<p><b>Barry Morris Goldwater</b> (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> – <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>) was a five-term <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senator</a> from <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> (1953–1965, 1969–87) and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party_0712.html" title="History of the United States Republican Party">Republican Party</a>'s nominee for president in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1964_7883.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1964">1964 election</a>. He is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> politician most often credited for sparking the resurgence of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_conservatism.html" title="American conservatism">American conservative</a> political movement in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Goldwater rejected the legacy of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> and fought inside the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Coalition_e4d7.html" title="Conservative Coalition">Conservative Coalition</a> to defeat the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_coalition_13c2.html" title="New Deal coalition">New Deal coalition</a>.

Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>. The Johnson campaign and other critics painted him in 1964 as a reactionary, while supporters praised his crusades against the federal government, corrupt labor unions, and the welfare state. His defeat allowed American liberals to pass their <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Society_cbeb.html" title="Great Society">Great Society</a> programs. However, the defeat of so many older Republicans in 1964 also cleared the way for a younger generation of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_conservatives.html" title="American conservatives">American conservatives</a> to mobilize. Goldwater was much less active as a national leader of conservatives after 1964. His followers mostly rallied behind <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, who became governor of California in 1966.</p>
<p>By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Right_7ce0.html" title="Christian Right">Christian Right</a> on the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factions_in_the_Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_06af.html" title="Factions in the Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> so conflicted with Goldwater's <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a> views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such as abortion and gay rights. Goldwater concentrated on his Senate duties, especially passage of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldwater-Nichols_Act_fda8.html" title="Goldwater-Nichols Act">Goldwater-Nichols Act</a> of 1986.</p>

<p>Goldwater was born Barry Morris Goldwater in Phoenix in 1909 in what was then the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Territory_7e22.html" title="Arizona Territory">Arizona Territory</a>. His grandfather, Michel Goldwasser, was a Jewish immigrant from <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konin%2C_Poland_2440.html" title="Konin, Poland">Konin, Poland</a> who founded a <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_store.html" title="Department store">department store</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix%2C_Arizona_97f7.html" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldwater%27s.html" title="Goldwater's">Goldwater's</a> Department Store. His paternal grandmother, Sarah Nathan, was from London, England and married Goldwasser in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Synagogue_of_London_e70c.html" title="Great Synagogue of London">Great Synagogue of London</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Goldwater's father, Baron Goldwater, converted to the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America_dc8c.html" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">Episcopal Church</a> from <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> when he married his fiancée, Hattie Josephine Williams, in Phoenix, Arizona. The family name had been changed from <i>Goldwasser</i> to <i>Goldwater</i> at least as early as the 1860 census in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>. The family department store made the Goldwaters comfortably rich. Goldwater graduated from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staunton_Military_Academy_3965.html" title="Staunton Military Academy">Staunton Military Academy</a> and attended the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Arizona_07d8.html" title="University of Arizona">University of Arizona</a> for one year, where he joined the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Chi_b022.html" title="Sigma Chi">Sigma Chi</a> fraternity.</p>
<p>Goldwater took over the family business after his father's death in 1930. In this capacity he was both a supporter of "progressive" business practices and anti-union. The strain of running the family business led to <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nervous_breakdown.html" title="Nervous breakdown">nervous breakdowns</a> in 1937 and 1939.</p>
<p>With the onset of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Goldwater received a reserve commission in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Forces_8bec.html" title="United States Army Air Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>. He became a pilot assigned to the Ferry Command, a newly formed unit that delivered aircraft and supplies to war zones worldwide; he spent most of the war flying between the USA and India, via the Azores and North Africa or South America, Nigeria, and Central Africa. He also flew "the hump" over the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalayas.html" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> to deliver supplies to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_China_4cac.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a>. Remaining in the reserves after the war, he retired with a rank of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_General_811b.html" title="Major General">Major General</a>. By that time, he had flown 165 different types of aircraft. Following World War II, Goldwater was a major proponent of building the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_ee12.html" title="United States Air Force Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a>, and later served on the Academy's Board of Visitors. The Visitor Center at the Academy is named in his honor.</p>
<p>Goldwater was married to his first wife, Margaret "Peggy" Johnson, from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> until her death on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">December 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. The couple had four children: Joanne (born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, 1936), <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Goldwater%2C_Jr._a5f2.html" title="Barry Goldwater, Jr.">Barry</a> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, 1938), Michael (born <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, 1940), and Peggy (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_27.html" title="July 27">July 27</a>, 1944). On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">February 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, at age 83, Goldwater married nurse Susan Shaffer Wechsler, 32 years his junior; they were married until his death.</p>
<p>Goldwater's son, Barry Goldwater, Jr., served as a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">U.S. House</a> member from <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> from 1969 to 1983.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Goldwater_8b15.html" title="Edit section: Political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political career</span></h2>
<p>Goldwater entered Phoenix politics in 1949. He first won a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">US Senate</a> seat in <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_election%2C_1952_f138.html" title="U.S. Senate election, 1952">1952</a>, when he upset veteran Democrat and Senate majority leader <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_McFarland_072f.html" title="Ernest McFarland">Ernest McFarland</a>. He defeated McFarland again in 1958, but would step down from the Senate in 1964 for his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Goldwater soon became most associated with labor-union reform and fighting Communism; he was an active supporter of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_coalition.html" title="Conservative coalition">Conservative coalition</a> in Congress. However, he rejected the wilder fringes of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-communism.html" title="Anti-communism">anti-communist movement</a>; in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> he sponsored the passage through the Senate of the final version of the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Mental_Health_Enabling_Act_b9f5.html" title="Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act">Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act</a>, despite vociferous opposition from opponents who claimed that the Act was a communist plot to establish concentration camps in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. His work on labor issues led to Congress passing major anti-corruption reforms in 1957, and an all-out campaign by the <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL-CIO_f5ff.html" title="AFL-CIO">AFL-CIO</a> to defeat his 1958 reelection bid. He voted against the censure of Senator <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_McCarthy_1e1b.html" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> in 1954, but himself was much more prudent than McCarthy and never actually charged any individual with being a Communist/Soviet agent. Goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of Communism in his 1960 book <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscience_of_a_Conservative_4278.html" title="Conscience of a Conservative">The Conscience of a Conservative</a></i>. The book became an important reference text in conservative political circles.</p>
<p>Goldwater supported the Arizona <a href="../../../n/a/a/NAACP_cd86.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a> and was involved in desegregating the Arizona <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html" title="United States National Guard">National Guard</a>. Nationally, he supported the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Rights_Act_aa4d.html" title="Civil Rights Act">Civil Rights Acts</a> of 1957 and 1960. However, he opposed the much more comprehensive <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964_483d.html" title="Civil Rights Act of 1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>; he argued that it unconstitutionally extended the federal government's commerce power to private citizens in its drive to "legislate morality" and restrict the rights of employers. Since conservative Southern Democrats were the main opponents to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and previous civil rights legislation, Goldwater's opposition to the 1964 Act, in which he was joined by only four other non-Southern Republican senators, strongly boosted Goldwater's standing among white Southerners.</p>
<p>In 1964, he fought and won a bitterly contested, multi-candidate race for the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a>'s presidential nomination. His main challenger was New York Governor <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_A._Rockefeller_8a62.html" title="Nelson A. Rockefeller">Nelson A. Rockefeller</a>, whom he defeated in the California primary. His nomination was challenged by liberal Republicans who thought Goldwater's hardline foreign policy stances would bring about a deadly confrontation with the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. He would eventually <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1964_dffd.html" title="United States presidential election, 1964">lose to President Lyndon Johnson</a> by one of the largest margins in the history of U.S. Presidential elections. Consequently, the Republican Party suffered a significant setback nationally, losing many seats in both houses of Congress. Goldwater carried only his home state and five (formerly Democratic) Southern states. Many Republicans at the time angrily turned against Goldwater, claiming that his defeat had significantly set back the party's chances of future national success. (There was a minor controversy over Goldwater's having been born in Arizona when it was not yet a state.)</p>
<p>He remained popular in Arizona, though, and in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_election%2C_1968_bec4.html" title="U.S. Senate election, 1968">1968 Senate election</a> he was elected again (this time to the seat of Carl Hayden, who was retiring). He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. Goldwater retired in 1987, serving as chair of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees in his final term. Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Yet Goldwater remained staunchly anti-Communist and "hawkish" on military issues.

<p>Goldwater was an unwavering supporter of Wisconsin's Republican Senator <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_McCarthy_1e1b.html" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> to the end (one of only 22 Senators who voted against McCarthy's censure). He was also friends with Senator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> of Massachusetts; in fact, Goldwater anticipated that a contest for the presidency between John F. Kennedy and Goldwater himself would have been an enjoyable experience, with lively debates between them, one of which was to be held on board a plane in flight. Goldwater disliked Senate Majority Leader <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_B._Johnson_d5db.html" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> of Texas (who he said "used every dirty trick in the bag"), and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_M._Nixon_16b3.html" title="Richard M. Nixon">Richard M.

<p>Goldwater was grief-stricken by the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_755d.html" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">assassination of Kennedy</a> and was greatly disappointed that his opponent in the race would be Johnson.</p>

<p>In 2006, his political ideals were revived in the "Jackson Stephens Campaign" in which Republican groups in law schools (namely, the University of Florida) sought to widely republish Goldwater's basic conservative political tenets in graduate school environments.</p>

<p>At the time of Goldwater's presidential candidacy, the Republican Party was split between its conservatives (with their base in the West and Midwest) and liberals (strongest in the Northeast). He alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html#Fiscal_conservatism" title="Conservatism">fiscal conservatism</a> and militant <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Communism_1ebb.html" title="Anti-Communism">anti-Communism</a>. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_wing.html" title="Right wing">right wing</a> of the Republican spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, more liberal Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including New York Governor <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Cabot_Lodge%2C_Jr._877c.html" title="Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.</a> and Pennsylvania Governor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Scranton_c08b.html" title="William Scranton">William Scranton</a>, to challenge Goldwater. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination. Goldwater boldly (and famously) declared in his acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican Convention: "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." This paraphrase of <a href="../../../c/i/c/Cicero.html" title="Cicero">Cicero</a> was included at the suggestion of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_V._Jaffa_5343.html" title="Harry V. Jaffa">Harry V. Jaffa</a>, though the speech was primarily written by <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Hess_a47d.html" title="Karl Hess">Karl Hess</a>. Due to President Johnson's popularity, however, Goldwater held back from attacking the president directly; he did not even mention Johnson by name in his convention speech.</p>
<p>Past comments came back to haunt Goldwater throughout his campaign. Once he called the <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_D._Eisenhower_449c.html" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> administration "a dime-store <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a>," and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a TV commercial with Goldwater.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party. In December 1961, Goldwater told a news conference that "sometimes I think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea." That comment boomeranged on him during the campaign in the form of a Johnson television commercial, as did remarks about making <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Security_%28United_States%29_305c.html" title="Social Security (United States)">Social Security</a> voluntary, and statements in Tennessee about selling the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Valley_Authority_87b5.html" title="Tennessee Valley Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (a large local employer, and symbol of the New Deal's perceived success).</p>
<p>The Goldwater campaign spotlighted <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, who gave a stirring, nationally televised speech, "A Time for Choosing," in support of Goldwater.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Conservative activist <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllis_Schlafly_99d0.html" title="Phyllis Schlafly">Phyllis Schlafly</a>, later well-known for her fight against the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Rights_Amendment_5e53.html" title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>, first became known for writing a pro-Goldwater book, <i>A Choice, Not an Echo,</i> attacking the liberal Republican establishment. Senator <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescott_S._Bush_1fbe.html" title="Prescott S. Bush">Prescott S. Bush</a> (1895-1972), a liberal Republican from Connecticut, was a friend of Goldwater's and supported him in the general election campaign. Bush's son, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H.W._Bush_6cdf.html" title="George H.W. Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> (then running for the Senate from Texas against Democrat <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Yarborough_b0af.html" title="Ralph Yarborough">Ralph Yarborough</a>), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns. Goldwater was painted as a dangerous figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan "In your heart, you know he's right" with the lines "In your guts, you know he's nuts," and "In your heart, you know he might" (that is, might drop the atomic bomb). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_Democratic_National_Convention_08e7.html" title="1964 Democratic National Convention">1964 Democratic National Convention</a>.</p>
<p>Goldwater's provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of Communism in Asia led to effective counterattacks from <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Johnson_a119.html" title="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> and his supporters, who feared that Goldwater's militancy would have dire consequences, possibly even nuclear war. Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of "goal, course, or purpose," leaving "only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Goldwater's own rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, "Let's lob one into the men's room at the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow_Kremlin_d298.html" title="Moscow Kremlin">Kremlin</a>."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Goldwater did his best to counter the Johnson attacks, criticizing the Johnson administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that "…we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people…I say it is time to put conscience back in government. And by good example, put it back in all walks of American life." Goldwater campaign commercials included statements of support by actor <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Massey_68f1.html" title="Raymond Massey">Raymond Massey</a> and moderate Republican senator <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Chase_Smith_e42e.html" title="Margaret Chase Smith">Margaret Chase Smith</a>.</p>
<p>Before the 1964 election, the muckraking magazine <i>Fact</i>, published by <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Ginzburg_160c.html" title="Ralph Ginzburg">Ralph Ginzburg</a>, ran a special issue entitled ‘The Unconscious of a Conservative: A special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater.’ The two main articles contended that Goldwater was mentally unfit to be president. The magazine attempted to support this claim with the results of an unscientific poll of psychiatrists it had conducted. <i>Fact</i> had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, and published a ‘sampling’ of the comments made by the 2,417 psychiatrists who responded, of which 1,189 said Goldwater was unfit to be president.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> After the election, Goldwater sued the publisher, the editor and the magazine for libel. "Although the jury awarded Goldwater only $1.00 in compensatory damages against all three defendants, it went on to [396 U.S. 1049, 1050] award him punitive damages of $25,000 against Ginzburg and $50,000 against <i>Fact</i> magazine, Inc."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> According to Warren Boroson, then-managing editor of <i>Fact</i> and now a financial columnist, the main biography of Goldwater in the magazine was written by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bar-Illan_e1b3.html" title="David Bar-Illan">David Bar-Illan</a>, the Israeli pianist. He went on to say "Goldwater sued me for $2 million. (He collected 33 cents.)"<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<li>The Republican National Convention had a vibrant mix of candidates, reporters, delegates, relatives, and others, crowding together in a somewhat aggressive atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A campaign advertisement known as <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daisy_%28television_commercial%29.html" title="Daisy (television commercial)">Daisy</a> showed a young girl counting daisy petals, from one to ten. Immediately following this scene, a voiceover counted down: ten, nine, eight,…three, two, one. The child's face was shown as a still photograph followed by images of nuclear explosions and mushroom clouds. The campaign advertisement ended with a plea to vote for Johnson, implying that Goldwater would provoke a nuclear war if elected. The advertisement, which featured only a few spoken words of narrative and relied on imagery for its emotional impact, was one of the most provocative moments in American political campaign history, and many analysts credit it as being the birth of the modern style of "negative political ads" on television. The ad only aired once, and was immediately pulled, but then was shown numerous times by television stations.</li>

<p>In the end, Goldwater received 38.4% of the popular vote, and carried six states: <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>, and his home state of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, which itself gave Goldwater 242,536 votes (50.4%) to Johnson's 237,765 (49.5%). In all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked: "We would have lost even if Abraham Lincoln had come back and campaigned with us."</p>
<p>Goldwater's poor showing, plus the tendency at the time for most people to vote a "straight ticket" (that is, loyally voting for every candidate from the same party as their Presidential choice), was associated with the defeat of many other long-time Republican officeholders from Congress through local races.</p>
<p>Goldwater maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief (referring to the assassination of <a href="../../../j/f/k/JFK_e817.html" title="JFK">JFK</a>), and that it was simply not ready for a third President in just fourteen months. It has frequently been argued that Goldwater's strong performance in Southern states previously regarded as Democratic strongholds foreshadowed a larger shift in electoral trends in the coming decades that would make the South a Republican bastion (an end to the "<a href="../../../s/o/l/Solid_South_d12f.html" title="Solid South">Solid South</a>") — first in presidential politics and eventually at the congressional and state levels, as well.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Barry Goldwater was also a prominent spokesman for amateur radio and its enthusiasts.

<p>In a 1988 interview on <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_King_cd18.html" title="Larry King">Larry King</a>'s radio show, Goldwater was asked if he thought the U.S. Government was withholding UFO evidence; he replied "Yes, I do." He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I certainly believe in aliens in space.
