<li>Homer didn't know his middle initial J. stood for Jay until one episode, long after Bart was born. Yet presumably the J. in Bartholemew J. Simpson stands for the same as the J. in Homer J.

<p>I'm a little unclear on this one. "Disinterested" actually means impartial (ie: has no <i>special</i> interest, unbiased). In flashback episodes, Bart is shown being discouraged by his kindergarten teacher ("Extra clap in BINGO, not college material"), but I'd hardly refer to this as "disinterested" in the strictest sense of the word. Is the word the writer looking for "uninterested"? --<a href="../../../t/o/q/User%7EToquinha_9c53.html" title="User:Toquinha">Toquinha</a> 1 July 2005 16:19 (UTC)</p>

<p>Originally, this is a mexican expression written "Â¡Ay Caramba!", meaning "oh, god!" or "Wow!" or whatever expression of surprise there is in english (exactly as Bart uses it in the show) and it is pronouncied as written in the article. Still, I wonder if it is alright to leave it or if it should be corrected to its original spanish spelling in the Article.</p>
<p>Three words: Respect other languages...</p>
<hr />
<p>I doubt the mexican origin, as the word "Caramba" has a very old and common use in Portugal and Spain, and the origin could be a Portuguese/Spanish one. As for the definition you're completly correct. It's a slang word (though not swearing) to express great surprise or astonishment about something, very common in informal spoken Portuguese. Ai or ay is another Portuguese(ai)/Spanish(ay) interjection that normally is used with someone experiencing sudden physical pain (a smack in the head, a bump on something, etc...). It's also very used to start an informal spoken sentence, like the "Â¡Ay Caramba!".</p>
<p>Correct pronunciation is "ahee".</p>
<p>"Carumba" or the even worst "karumba" are english misspelled adaptations of the word. FYI, traditional alphabeths of the latin languages family, which Portuguese and Spanish belong, *never* had the "K" letter in it, so "karumba" are two mistakes in a single word. --Netshark 09:14, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I checked the referenced episode, and no such thing happens. Besides, in the indicated episode, they get detoured and Bart never ends up at the doctor's office - he is shown as up and about when they get home, so it's unlikely he underwent surgery.

<p>Yes actually he was, though it never shows wether or not he underwent it, he was on a table with his pants off while rabbi was holding the knife, while bart was trying to convince him to reunite with his son, and Rabbi counters his argument and says "besides, this is neither the time nor the place", I'm sure you'll see it if you look at the episode again.</p>

<p>I recently removed a blurb about his ethinticity for various reasons. For one, its never been confirmed what their ethinticity is. Although its most likely Angelo-Saxon, as Simpson is a name of Scottish background, there was an episode where it was shown that the name was won by a gamble by one of Abe's ancestor's. Besides...since the subject of the Simpson ancestry cover's the whole family it should probably be stated in the page for the entire family.</p>

<dd>A discussion on the Talk page for <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mondegreen.html" title="Mondegreen">mondegreen</a> raises the issue of the prank-call names, and whether there's a term for what he's doing with the names. A mondegreen is a mishearing, usually accidental, that produces a different meaning. What Bart's doing in some (not all) of the calls is almost a reverse mondegreen, where he is <i>creating</i> the mishearing by saying something apparently innocent, but which will take on a double-meaning once it's repeated by his dupe. Anyone know if this phenomenon has its own name?

<p>An exclamation and catchphrase of Bart that doesn't specifically have literal meaning, though as a joke, it is sometimes interpreted literally by another character. The phrase is basically used as a tell-off, like "screw you", which also ignores the literal meaning of the phrase. It was brought into pop culture mainly by merchandise, as is evidenced by the fact that it only uttered by Bart on the show a handful of times before becoming used mainly as self-parody, and only once in the first season ("<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_the_Genius_25e8.html" title="Bart the Genius">Bart the Genius</a>").</p>
<p>In the third season's "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_the_Murderer_cdd4.html" title="Bart the Murderer">Bart the Murderer</a>", "<a href="#Eat_my_shorts.21" title="">Eat My Shorts</a>" and "<a href="#Don.27t_have_a_cow.2C_man.21" title="">Don't Have a Cow</a>" are horses in a race. In the sixth season's <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemon_of_Troy_8296.html" title="Lemon of Troy">Lemon of Troy</a>, Homer and Bart shout it as they flee Shelbyville. Flanders adds in, "yes, eat all of our shirts." By the eighth season it had become a definite in-joke. In "<a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala%28Annoyed_Grunt%29cious_4216.html" title="Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious">Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious</a>", Bart adds it to a song for no particular reason, and in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_Spin-Off_Showcase_387d.html" title="The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase">The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase</a>", Bart sings it along with "don't have a cow!" as part of his musical introduction in the variety show spin-off. In the ninth season's "<a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa%27s_Sax_af27.html" title="Lisa's Sax">Lisa's Sax</a>", flashbacks show Bart's first days of school, and what is implied to be his first rebellious act, saying "eat my shorts!" to principal Skinner.</p>
<p>Other characters occasionally use the line as well. In a halloween episode in which the school staff is eating students, principal Skinner considers that he might start by eating Bart's shorts as Bart has often suggested.</p>
<p>"Eat my Shorts" predates The Simpsons; DJ <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Dees_ff97.html" title="Rick Dees">Rick Dees</a> had a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> song with the same title. ("Eat my shorts; choke on poly-cotton. Eat my shorts; everything we had was rotten. So long, baby, I'll see you in court...eat my shorts.") The phrase was also famously used by <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judd_Nelson_f657.html" title="Judd Nelson">Judd Nelson</a>'s character in the 1985 film <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Breakfast_Club_6d55.html" title="The Breakfast Club">The Breakfast Club</a>.</p>

I've changed the inaccurate "From Christianity to Catholicism" to "from various Protestant faiths to Catholicism" because Catholicism _is_ a Christian faith.

<dl>
<dd>Presumably the earliest Christian sect was whatever-Jesus-and-his-homies practiced, which most definitely bears no resemblance to any modern religion that has a name least of all Catholicism. Catholics consider Peter the first pope, but he was undeniably Jewish. In America at least, -many- people who consider themselves 'christian' say so in deliberate opposition to catholicism. It's kind of like the China vs Taiwan thing.</dd>

<dd>I'm in the deep south, (lots of protestant faiths) and if you ask around catholisism is generally considered a christian faith in the fact that it beilieves jesus christ was the son of god and that he rose after death.

<dd>Good call. Every section of this is a serious mess, not just biography. I may be able to work on it much later tonight, but by then you may have made all the changes I would have.

<dd>Appearances on other shows are sort of a toss-up for me. Maybe we could mention it (one sentence) in the "impact on pop culture" section. I think we should get rid of the Bart-centric episodes list (if you haven't already), since that's half the damn episodes of the show. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 00:20, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have completely removed the biography info - since Bart is a child, there isn't much of a biography for him that happens before the run of the show (i.e. birth to age 9). I also trimmed repetetive info from the personality section. Someone else will have to do the rewrite - writing about fiction is not one of my strengths. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 00:55, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do we really need this?

<p>I disagree and have readded the section. If you look at the pages of the Simpsons characters, there are many with 'Trivia' or 'Miscellaneous' sections. Among the five Simpsons who live at Evergreen Terrace, both Marge and Lisa have "interesting facts" sections. More minor characters have sections like this, too. Barney, Mr Smithers, Santa's Little Helper, Krusty the Clown, and the one-episode Frank Grimes all have a miscellanea section. Surely if Trivia sections stand for these characters, Bart, who is one of the show's two main character deserves a section like this, too. It's only fair to apply the same standard to each character. (And this says nothing of the Trivia sections for all kinds of famous people - from Jefferson Davis to Ulysses S. Grant.) <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakethemud_34c7.html" title="User:Takethemud">takethemud</a> 16:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also disagree that it would be too detailed. Looking at the Mr. Burns article will reveal that there is a laundry list of things he has said that evidences his mental disconnect from the present day and a list of things pertaining to his ill-health &amp; old age. If this list stands up and is not removed as being "too detailed", surely a list of miscellaneous facts about Bart will not become too detailed for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakethemud_34c7.html" title="User:Takethemud">takethemud</a> 16:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also disagree that these facts can be worked into the article. Take, for instance, Abe Simpsons' page: There are little factoids that aren't worked in- his appearance in a newspaper, his height. Same for Seymour Skinner- note how his allergy is just plopped into the middle of an article. Sure, some editing would make <i>some</i> of them fit, but there would still be some factoids that would best fit in a 'trivia' or 'miscellanea' section in a bulleted list. By making a section for these things, it gives a place for us to put little facts that are interesting to know but have no place in the other sections of the article. <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakethemud_34c7.html" title="User:Takethemud">takethemud</a> 16:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps you should check up the WikiProject Simpsons article improvement drive. Those articles are not good examples because they haven't been cleaned up yet. <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_Simpson_8936.html" title="Homer Simpson">Homer Simpson</a> would be a better comparison, since it is already a good article. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 16:22, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. I still think that until this article is cleaned up, a trivia section should still exist. It will give contributors a place to list random facts about Bart, which can later be incorporated into the article more smoothly. And, if there are facts which are worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia but that do not work in the article, a section like this would provide a home for them. <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakethemud_34c7.html" title="User:Takethemud">takethemud</a> 16:35, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I removed the section, we're trying to clean up the article, and adding sections with unessential information makes no sense. So, he's allergic to Shrimp. We decided not to have a biography, so it can't go there. It doesn't belong in Personality, Origins, or Cultural influence, thus making it un needed. Besides, he's also allergicto butterscotch, imitation butterscotch and halloween make up. And those pages you cited haven't been worked on yet, their trivia sections will be rid of eventually. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 17:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps people could propose additions of trivia-type info on the talk page, and then we could incorporate them into the article if they seem significant. It's important to remember, since the Simpsons has been going for 18 seasons so far, that every character (even the minor ones) have a lot of trivia. We shouldn't add info to the article unless it's a regularly occuring situation (like Bart's poor grades) or is a significant explanation of the character (like Bart's ADD diagnosis). Otherwise we are bordering on Simpsons-wiki territory. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 18:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the name of the episode where Bart's full name is revealed (Bartholomew Jo-Jo Simpson)? I seem to recall Pincipal Skinner discovering his full name in a filing cabinet, while Bart is performing on stage ... or something along along those lines. I always thought that it was the episode where Bart is forced to take up ballet lessons ("Homer vs. Patty &amp; Selma"), but having seen that episode a few times I discovered that the scene I was thinking of was absent. I've seen pretty much every "Simpsons" episode and I still can't figure out where Bart's full name is first mentioned. If anyone knows the episode I am refering to, or can shed some light on the subject I would be very grateful, as it has always bugged me. I also think it would be worth including the origins of Bart's name in the article for further referencing.</p>

"...even before the revealing of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_the_Simpson_6f7a.html" title="Lisa the Simpson">Simpson gene</a>, as Bart exhibited many of the traits of a child afflicted with ADD. His extreme mental quickness coupled with his inability to be able to keep his attention set on mediocre work at school such as in the episode "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Gets_an_F_4202.html" title="Bart Gets an F">Bart Gets an F</a>" are big hints"</p>
<p>This section, at least, violates NPOV, and it will be deleted. The remaining reference to ADHD needs to be debated or it should also be deleted.</p>
