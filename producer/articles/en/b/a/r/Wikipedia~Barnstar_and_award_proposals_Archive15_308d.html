<li>I don't know who Joe Paterno is, so I can't answer that. My issue was with the narrow scope of the Wikiproject itself - but Badbilltucker informs me that it is active and two years old, so I'm cool with that.

<li><b>Support as project award only</b> - as project is so small that to create a full barnstar for this comparatively small project would only devalue the existing more general barnstars. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:42, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Is it just me, or does anyone else think that the two lenses aren't exactly centered on the middle of the barnstar? It is a minor point, but I would appreciate knowing if this is in some way intentional (if it is, fine) or whether it is accidental. If the latter, maybe straightening the glasses out would be in order. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 22:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I note that there is not yet a barnstar for the state of Pennsylvania itself, although it is a broader field, and actually encompasses several projects. I'm personally not completely convinced that one state is itself broad enough scope, but I am sure it would receive a lot more support if it was proposed, particularly from all the other projects associated with the state. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:09, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Currently there are several wikiproject relating to Pennsylvania. WP Pennsylvania, WP PA Highways, WP Pittsburg &amp; WP Philadelphia. There is a WP Award for Philly, and a PUA for Pittsbur. I don't think WP Pennsylvania has thought of developing an award, though if it did, it would probably involve a Keystone. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../e/v/r/User_talk%7EEvrik_9dfe.html" title="User talk:Evrik">talk</a>)</sup> 19:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - "edit countitis" has never been proven to exist, much less proven to be a bad thing. While focusing on <i>anything</i> in the extreme can be a bad thing - there is no good reason why we can't have a few awards based purely on undisputable measures of contribution - such as number of edits. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:47, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Oppose</b> - obsession with edit counts is in no way a good thing, and the fact that this design so dramatically emphasizes it indicates to me that it might become a factor here. I wouldn't mind seeing a similar award for edit counts, and believe that we already have one such service award, but I personally have very strong reservations about the styling of this one possibly emphasizing the number too much. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 21:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, but a few awards based on edit count would hardly seem to be an obsession - certainly not compared to the dozens and dozens of awards that can be given out for no concretely defined reason.</dd>
<dd>Do you think you might consider supporting if the design were changed? The text could be smaller and turned into something more of a statement. For example, "Here's to your first 5,000 contributions to the community" or "Thanks for making 5,000+ contributions"... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 22:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think by the time you make it to 5000 edits, you don't give a damn about getting an award. I'm only 900 away, and I sure don't care if I get an award when I hit 5000.

<li><b>Strong oppose</b>. We don't want users to think that they would get an award at 5000 edits, which could lead to massive balant edits by users to increase their edit count and damage this encyclopedia. Johntex, we award users a barnstar for making <i>quality</i> edits, and not for specific <i>edit count</i>. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 21:37, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Am I the only one who finds a bit odd the argument "No one would care to have this award, and editors will deliberately warp their editing to get this award"? Some other comments: (1) If you don't like the award, don't display it. (2) It's just a barnstar, doubtful that anyone would deliberately make lots of minor edits just to get this award, but if they do, so what? Minor edits are useful too. (3) People <i>are</i> motivated to achieve goals. That's just human. If you're not, then bully for you, but you're unusual. (4) Having 5000 edits is an achievement of some sort. Whether it is important or not is up to the individual user. Any editor is welcome to view this award on another editor's page and choose to disregard the information it displays. All that being said, I myself prefer the <a href="../../../s/e/r/WP%7ESERVICE_5427.html" title="WP:SERVICE">WP:SERVICE</a> awards (naturally, since I wrote them) because they also require a certain amount of time in harness. However, the <a href="../../../s/e/r/WP%7ESERVICE_5427.html" title="WP:SERVICE">WP:SERVICE</a> awards were deemed by the No Fun Brigade too controversial to be included in the roster of awards and hence their existance is not known to most. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 02:58, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe I should explain myself better. Although a large edit count as a goal for a barnstar might seem useful for this encyclopedia, it is completely against the purpose of barnstars. Barnstars are awarded for quality edits, which are truly an achievement, rather than for a certain count. I know some Wikipedians with a lower edit count which contributed and helped much more than some other users with a very high edit count. This is not "if you don't like it, don't display it", the award selecting process should be very limited, and if people oppose it then there is no reason for it to be on PUA, and especially not on the barnstars page. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 17:02, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Right. I mean, God forbid we should encourage editors from editing even more.

<li>This isn't a good arguement, nobody will manage to vandalize his way up to 5000 edits. The problem is that although these edits might not be vandalism, they might be very low-quality or duplicates. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 16:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've just added a fourth possibility. Because it's hard to change a barnstar later on, I think it's good to get the Hinduism WikiProject Barnstar to be the best we can from the start. Looking at the other Barnstar discussions above, I think it's a good approach to get more feedback - and also see if others have ideas they'd like to upload for discussion. I'm definitely not stuck on my own versions - I just want to see this done more consciously. I'm happy to work on any of these, when I get back to a computer in a few days. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyanath_0bf1.html" title="User:Priyanath">ॐ Priyanath</a> 22:10, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's why it's so helpful getting people's feedback. Once there's a strong consensus on one of these (1, 2, 3 , 4, 4a), I have a couple more color and shading variations to try for that particular one. I'm not sure about ten, though! I hear two votes for 4a since I added it - any other comments? <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyanath_0bf1.html" title="User:Priyanath">ॐ Priyanath</a> 21:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Support the concept. Somehow the Aum just doesn't blend with the barnstar at all in any of these. Looks like it's been forcibly superimposed. Is it because of the different coloring schemes? Sorry if I'm not very clear, but it looks like the Aum and the Star are two separate things kept on top of each other, and not one entity.

<p>That image is the one here.

<li><b>Support</b>: It seems absolutely fine to have a barnstar for South Indian cinema. Bollywood is so different from all other industries. This would promote editors from contributing to this template/category more because it brings satisfaction to editors who help correct the notion that Indian film industry isn't Bollywood, but is a conglomeration of films made in almost 15 languages. South Indian films are the maximum in number and the sum is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Indianfilms_bylanguage.PNG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Indianfilms_bylanguage.PNG" rel="nofollow">more than the combined total of all other regional language film industries</a> put together. Having the tag Indian Cinema sort of dilutes it and having a tag for 'Cinema' seems to be too broad of a definition! I strongly agree having a separate barnstar.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Indian regionalism strikes again. Since many directors, actors, and music directors work in several industries, wouldn't it be right to stress the UNITY of the film industries, not their differences? As for combining music and cinema -- strange choice. I know that many musicians make a living as music directors (it's the only way, if any CDs they issue are copied and on sale in the bazaars even BEFORE the official release), but there are classical musicians who won't have any truck with cinema. Have a separate star for Indian music? All-India Music Barnstar? I'm dealing with regionalism on the non-Roman scripts issue, and now we have to have a whole panoply of barnstars for the different film industries? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:07, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Though everybody works together, ultimately outside of India people think that there is just one Bollywood or atleast that is how IFFI and other Indian film festivals project it. It would great to stress on the identity of South Indian films as the artistes are almost shared between the industries. North and South share very few people, whereas Tamil/Telugu/Malayalam and also Kannada industries share the common pool of artistes. <a href="../../../s/u/d/User%7ESudharsansn_a9df.html" title="User:Sudharsansn">Sudharsansn</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/d/User_talk%7ESudharsansn_916a.html" title="User talk:Sudharsansn">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sudharsansn_4d8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sudharsansn">contribs</a>) 09:15, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This barnstar was conceived as an incentive for the development of the numerous South Indian cinema-related articles/stubs that I came across here on Wikipedia, and to acknowledge the work of a fair number of contributors who toil silently in the background to improve these articles. It is useful to understand that this barnstar was envisioned as a complement to the Bollywood barnstar. Now, having a single barnstar that can represent the two would doubtlessly be more efficient, especially taking note of the scale of this Wikiproject. The suggestion that these barnstars be merged under a common banner (e.g., the <i>Indian Cinema Star</i>) appears apt, and I would endorse it. The design and creation of such a barnstar I would leave in the capable hands of other experienced Wikipedians or volunteers (I am not much of a graphic arts person as you can tell). Separately, I must say that I was blissfully ignorant of the passionate simmer that I notice about 'regionalism'. This unawareness may not be surprising considering the fact that I am neither Indian nor hail from India. But I felt it harmless in acknowledging, or even celebrating, differences and diversity stemming from the various cultures and mores in different regions of India, which is something that I've always admired about the country. My apologies for any awkwardness caused. Best wishes, <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppleJuggler_4dc6.html" title="User:AppleJuggler">AppleJuggler</a> 08:44, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was just thinking that there are awards out there for tireless contribution in article mainspaces. Also, at certain times, editors comment that other editors have not done much discussion. Therefore, how about an award for being a comunicative (and possibly thought-provoking) editor? I was thinking for general use. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 20:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Support</b> - I do see this as being a useful Barnstar/award. All too often, editors make major changes to articles without discussing them, or even checking the talk page to see if that change has already been discussed. This would be a nice means of positive encouragement to do that. Unsigned comment posted by 14:27, 2006 November 25 <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a></p>
<p><b>Strongly Support</b> but suspect it will rarely be awarded. I've been watching some edit wars where there is no debate--even a Wikipedia administrator involved in these edit wars simply reverts and leaves the talk page completely blank. I would love to see this one awarded to someone, and yes, it's a postive means of encouragement. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 21:39, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Mild Oppose</b> - Discussion isn't what we want on talk page per se, but what we seek is discussion of the article. If this award were to reward comments which are similar to those found elsewhere in chat rooms, I would oppose it, as those comments are not the ones we're really looking for here.

<dd>The others are very broad and some only seem to cover article mainsapce, as before, and the latter is specialised to humourous comments. I was proposing an award to cover suggestions and ideas and to show the editor is contributing to discussions in a helpful way, perhaps. This will also be based, but not only, on the number edits they make to discussions of articles and maybe users. I hope this does not encourage vandalism but is a form of encouragement to new and existing editors. However i am not trying to replace other awards. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 16:44, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Mild Support</b> After review, I am reasonably confident that the above award proposal is not in fact specifically redundant to any other awards. I am still dubious that the proposal will ever receive wide use if approved, or will be even be widely known, but do think it addresses current weaknesses wikipedia has and that any way to address those pronounced weakness might be useful. Also, I would like to see some of the other proposed designs introduced on this page. My favorite is the one with the word balloon inset. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:01, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I think it does address a weakness in Wikipedia, namely that even administrators ignore discussing issues in preference to reverting and edit warring. Edit counts can't have anything to do with it, though. Again, an instance of administrator abuse shows a problem with this, an administrator who added reqests to expand tags on articles outside of his area of knowledge, including many articles that were already categorized as stubs, in order to simply increase his edit count. This is, imo, a quality, not quantity award, an award for someone who has enhanced the community of Wikipedia <i>and</i> improved an article by leading a useful discussion of content. As it is on Wikipedia now, if you ask a question on a talk page to an article, people assume you're attacking them personally. Discussion is taboo, it seems, an award that recognizes the original intent of talk pages and honors those who do this, is much need, imo. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 19:07, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>six people</b> are in favour of the award</li>
<li><b>one person</b> opposes</li>

<p><b>IMAGES</b><br />
The original image was opposed by one person and after discussion with other users it seems that the the design of a Barnstar with a speech bubble\balloon was preferred. Only one user has requested the Barnstar with bubble (Design 2, <b>NOT</b> 2, 4 or 5) i.e design 2 be used, although design 1 has beem given as a rough idea.</p>

<li>I think the title is fine. It, along with the accompanying text makes the Barnstar very clear in its purpose.

<li>I was about to archive this award proposal. There is not enough support to justify making this a barnstar. Six people is awfully thin. This would be fine as a PUA. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../e/v/r/User_talk%7EEvrik_9dfe.html" title="User talk:Evrik">talk</a>)</sup> 05:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, evrik, there are 6 supports and only 1 oppose (you). That seems consensus to me.

<li>I would not mind seeing this as a barnstar but I believe that this may be justified as <i>PUA</i> at this point. I also do not mind leaving the title the same either. As far as the image, I guess the barnstar with blue bubble is fine, however it would not hurt to post a few more alternatives.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 16:36, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Six votes means nothing ... and this isn't supposed to be about voting. I don't see the point of this award, or how it is remarkably different from other awards. Compare this award with the Fauna award that just passed and you see a marked difference in support. I say we archive this proposal. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../e/v/r/User_talk%7EEvrik_9dfe.html" title="User talk:Evrik">talk</a>)</sup> 19:30, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm stongly against the designs of the barnstar, which all seem to be some low-quality copypasting through paint. Compare this to the other barnstars we have, look at the fauna barnstar for example. This isn't a vote, and two opposers in a <i>barnstar</i> proposal are enough not to accept it. This might be fine as a personal user award though. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 17:11, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The image at the left is the current version, the one to the right my proposed change. This is an existing award, albeit only a personal user award at this time. This is called the "Purple Barnstar" and is located at <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_user_awards_2b20.html#WikiProject_Kindness_Campaign_and_Dispute_Resolution" title="Wikipedia:Personal user awards">Wikipedia:Personal user awards#WikiProject Kindness Campaign and Dispute Resolution</a>, where it is described as <b>"The Purple Star given to Wikipedians who have been hurt by others, for example by having their user pages vandalised, being mistakenly blocked (for too long, or affected by range blocks), being personally attacked, etc."</b>.</p>
<p>I have given this award three times myself, once to a good editor who was blocked, and twice to good editors who just felt poorly used, related to the quick changeover to the new, more stringent, fair use policy for images.</p>
<p>I don't know why it is called the "Purple Barnstar", but I assume it is related to the American military decorated commonly called the "Purple Heart', which is awarded to all servicemen who are wounded. (It may be related to the color of a bruise, but I don't think so). But this is not clear enough, hence I have placed the decoration at the center of the star and also suggest a name change</p>
<p>True, this is somewhat USA-centric, but I don't see this as insuperable. Just as most educated people in the English-speaking world know what a Victoria Cross is etc., I'll bet that lots of non-Americans know what a Purple Heart is. And anyway, it's already USA-centric, and even less clear, in its present state.</p>
<p>So I would ask for input on these three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>) Should the current graphic be replaced with the one with the decoration at the center.</li>
<li>) Should it be renamed from "Purple Barnstar" (of which the meaning is rather obscure) to "Purple Heart Barnstar", "Wounded in Action Barnstar", or some other name (suggestions welcome).</li>
<li>) Should it be promoted from being just a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_user_awards_2b20.html" title="Wikipedia:Personal user awards">personal user award</a> to being a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstars_e3a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstars">barnstar</a>.

<dl>
<dd>1) I prefer the one with the decoration, as it is slightly more obvious in its meaning.</dd>
<dd>2) I like the Purple Heart Barnstar as a name, even if it is US-centric, because of the clarity of the name. WiA is I think less appealing. Maybe other name could include the Personal Sacrifice Barnstar or something similar.</dd>
<dd>3) I'd like a really well-defined set of criteria before going with a regular barnstar, as it might be too easy for someone to say "I'm a victim" and be awarded this otherwise. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would still opt for some more specific parameters. Just about everybody has had their userpage vandalized, for instance, and I don't think we would want all people who have had vandalized pages get the award. Several other individuals qualify as having been "personally attacked" at least once who might not specifically deserve specific recognition for having been attacked. Maybe if it were something to be given out by the mediation or arbitration groups to encourage those who have been victims of attacks, or to somehow honor editors who have endured after repeated attacks of one sort or another? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:51, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is my first proposal, so bear with me. Members of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_League_of_Copyeditors_64c1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject League of Copyeditors">League of Copyeditors</a> agreed there should be an award specifically for copyediting, and we have worked together to come up with this design. If consensus is that copyediting is not specific enough for its own barnstar, and already covered under general editing (ie, if this proposal fails), we'll instead propose this as a WikiProject award. However, enough people seemed to think that this might be worthy of a barnstar, so we're starting at the top&#160;:-) <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 00:08, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe that linguists need a separate honour for their work on Wikipedia, because their field of work is of interest, as they add pronunciations to obscure terms or names, like myself, amongst other things. Their interest and pursuits must be rewarded appropriately so this is why I introduce the <i>Linguist's Barnstar</i> proposal. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReece_Llwyd_207a.html" title="User:Reece Llwyd">RJL</a> 23:38, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Sounds like a good proposal. I think this award could also apply to people who have responded well and consistently to calls to help editors with articles that include terms from other languages. This comes up a lot on some of the articles I've worked on, often when not only pronunciation is needed but, for example, when the term is needed in both Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and the proper plurals in both languages need to be checked. <s>But is there something wrong with me that I keep picturing a big tongue with a star on it? (or a big star with a tongue on it?)&#160;;-)</s> <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 02:53, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I had a Barnstar with several symbols from obscure languages, like <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> and suchlike, in mind. Any other comments?</p>
<ul>
<li>The only objection to Kathryn's proposal I see is that it sounds from her phrasing almost like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> logo, which I don't think would necessarily be appropriate here. I do like the lower proposal, as long as the characters aren't so obscure that they aren't recognizable as written characters. Maybe including some of the characters from some of the better known languages not used in English might work as well. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b> - Eeek! I wasn't serious about the tongue thing. All apologies. I was in a weird mood and probably being too informal for this page. I think the actual proposal&#160;;-) of symbols from a variety of languages, is very good. Perhaps it could be a star on a field of diverse symbols and characters? Maybe with something in IPA in the center? Maybe symbols for the same sound in many languages, with the IPA version of it central? Or maybe we could write "Wikipedia" in a variety of languages and put it in IPA in the center? Or, as there's no word for "Wikipedia" in many languages, perhaps the word "linguist"? <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 21:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Would this be intended for spoken languages, writing systems, work on translations, or... all of the above? I'd prefer an inclusive version as there is alot of overlap in these areas. The different symbols works for writing systems, having them all represent the same thing works for translation, and thus what they refer to might be chosen to cover spoken languages/linguistics in general. Using 'linguist' makes sense except that it is fairly long (even moreso in some languages) and thus would be difficult to show in multiple scripts/languages. Something like 'word' or 'speak' might be more compact in most systems... or we could just use a single sound (though that leaves out ideograms). Alternatively, the tower of Babel is a common motif in linguistics... something like a tower being built with bricks labeled in different symbols might be viable. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Though... suddenly it occurs to me that my 'incomplete tower of babel bricks' idea would look an awful lot like the Wikipedia logo. Just in tower rather than sphere form. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Response</i> - Support for it? I don't know. Need, definitely. This WikiProject is growing. Since December, we grew from only one recently active member to several. People are getting involved by taking on specific projects, participating in decision-making discussions, and working on article improvement. As our membership numbers increase, the quality of articles within our Project's scope is greatly improving. It would be nice to award both Project participants and the other editors who regularly contribute in them this for their efforts and recognize their contributions. A generic award could be used instead, but since it would be given for work specific to the WikiProject and its scope, it make senses to have an award just for that purpose. I originally created this within our WikiProject space (not in template space), but when I discovered other Projects have similar awards, this seemed the better way to go.

<li>Seven members who became active so far in only <i>one month</i>, and still growing.&#160;:-) I'm sorry, but am I missing something here? Is there a policy or guideline about creating new awards that I missed? I happened upon the WikiProject Awards Page, thought "Oh cool! I should list our new award here." Then I saw the note to announce and discuss it here before adding it to the page. I'm not sure what the fuss is all about. This is really just intended as a thank you award to members or from members for work done to improve Wikipedia and/or the WikiProject. To me, it makes sense that it should be listed on the WikiProject Awards Page based on that definition. I know that Wikipedia prefers wait for large-scale consensus to build-up before taking any actions, but unless there are some policies about not showing Wiki-love to others who deserve it within your WikiProject, I'm confused about the "wait a while" attitude. There are people who deserve recognition now, including non-Project editors who do great work on related articles. This award should also help encourage others to become more active. That would help the Project grow and improve, and that only helps Wikipedia. If it's a huge deal, I can withdraw the request to place it on the WikiProject Awards page, move the template out of main template space and back into our WikiProject space if there is a concern about it not being up to snuff for the mainspace. I'd rather have it listed with the rest of the WikiProject Awards, but it's not a requirement. I just think it would be a nice extra touch. Thanks. --a confused <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt"><font color="#C71585" face="Tahoma"><b>Willscrlt</b></font></a>&#160;<small>(<font color="#4169E1" face="Tahoma"><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillscrlt_ad5a.html" title="User talk:Willscrlt"><b>T</b>alk</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willscrlt_ad85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willscrlt"><b>C</b>ntrb</a></font>)</small> 13:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The WikiGnome award may be a general personal user award.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. We already have the minor barnstar. The designing also doesn't resemble anything close to a barnstar or an award, and was originally created as a fair-use image replacement. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 19:33, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Of the four types of awards (Barnstars, WikiProject awards, Other Related Awards, and Personal User Awards), I am seeking approval have this award be used as a Personal User Award, not a Barnstar award. I believe the design resembles a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_user_awards_2b20.html" title="Wikipedia:Personal user awards">Personal User Award</a> but would be happy to entertain any changes to the award. The image is from Wikimedia Commons and this use does not violate any of the existing guidelines governing the use of images in Wikipedia. The Minor Barnstar is awarded for making minor edits of the utmost quality. This award would be for making minor edits that are useful without clamoring for attention. As a personal user award, it would have less status than The Minor Barnstar. Approving this award as a personal user award would create more opportunity to encourage <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">WikiLove</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">WikiCivility</a>. In view of this, would you support this award as a Personal User Award?

<p>I need some advice from users here who understand the image policy better than I do. The image at right is adapted by <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmomo_8a01.html" title="User:Smomo">Smomo</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmomo_7f01.html" title="User talk:Smomo">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smomo_0473.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smomo">contribs</a>) from an image at <a href="http://www.interocitor-media.com/tardis/" class="external free" title="http://www.interocitor-media.com/tardis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.interocitor-media.com/tardis/</a>. The creator of that image says <a href="http://www.interocitor-media.com/tardis/about.html" class="external text" title="http://www.interocitor-media.com/tardis/about.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> that any use of the image (including adaptations) are permitted, as long as it includes his name and a link to his homepage. The assumption seems to be usage on websites, but that's not explicit. Since the proposal is for use as a barnstar, something which presumably would <i>not</i> be copied in any downstream usage of Wikipedia content, is this free enough for our purposes? I'm just confused by our arcane image use policy, and not certain how it's applied in cases like these.</p>
<p>If <b>Geni's more free alternative</b> <i>is</i> free enough, I'd like to propose it for use as a WikiProject Award for the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Doctor_Who_56b3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Doctor Who">Doctor Who WikiProject</a>.

<dd>The thing is that what's needed isn't a copyright expert, but a Wikipedia policy expert. And this is an area in which the Wikipedia policy is rather unclear (at least, to me). As far as copyright and the law are concerned, we're absolutely within our rights to use the image, because the creator has given blanket permission. What I'm unsure of is whether that's "free enough" for use outside the main namespace. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 04:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>IMPORTANT UPDATE TO THIS PROPOSAL</b> After an e-mail from myself, Rob has agreed to de-copyright this image and release it under a free license. He also provided me with two other TARDIS renders, also free of license. This solves our copyright problems here, and with using his TARDIS images in the future!

this? I only changed the background with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Paint_cda2.html" title="Microsoft Paint">Microsoft Paint</a>, so the border looks a bit messy, though.

<p>Subsequent comments should be made in a new section. I was interested in setting up a contest for the best pictures personally taken by wikipedia members that had been released into the public domain and added to important pages (such as core topics or featured articles) within a period of time (such as 2007). The winner would be selected by a panel of wikipedia individuals (perhaps administrators) that had some expertise in photography. The winner would be awarded a barnstar and given some amount of money (like $100 which I would put up). I was wondering if anybody had done anything like this and what the community thought about it. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemember_d145.html" title="User:Remember">Remember</a> 12:47, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know if this has been done yet but if not i support the concept. HOWEVER, the image definately needs work. Its great that you put effort into wikipedia and we love to see people contributing; however, barnstar images should be much more polished and refined than a mspaint program could do. I support the concept like i said, but <b>OPPOSE</b> this barnstar image. I believe that if you deny someone an addition to wikipedia you should do it yourself, if this barnstar concept is approved and you are unable to make a more professional image, i will attempt to do so myself. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuglas_a91e.html" title="User:Thuglas">thuglas</a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuglas_be5d.html" title="User talk:Thuglas">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_thuglas_5d0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/thuglas">edits</a></sup> 20:12, 31 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../b/a/r/Image%7EBarnstar_Random_Edits_2.png_d7e5.html" class="image" title="Barnstar Random Edits 2.png"><img src="../../../upload/3/3b/Barnstar_Random_Edits_2.png" alt="Barnstar Random Edits 2.png" width="111" height="106" longdesc="../../../b/a/r/Image%7EBarnstar_Random_Edits_2.png_d7e5.html" /></a> How about this one then, <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuglas_a91e.html" title="User:Thuglas">thuglas</a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuglas_be5d.html" title="User talk:Thuglas">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_thuglas_5d0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/thuglas">edits</a></sup></p>

<p>I changed it to the original barn star, made it the proper size, made the dendrites and axons much more clear by adding some stroke stroke.

<p>I like the red star color of #4, the dendrites and axons formatting and shapes of #3, with the blue color from #2. There, is that picky enough for you?&#160;:-) I just think the cyan color (the lighter blue of #4) gets a little lost. #2's color stands out the most boldly (though that <i>might</i> be because the star is darker color and that might get lost a bit against the brighter red in #4). I'm happy to offer my support once the criteria of the award is clarified a bit more. Who is giving this out and to whom? What are the requirements? Is this a topical Barnstar or a WikiProject one?

<p>I dont really know what it should be i just made the star.

<p>Subsequent comments should be made in a new section. <a href="../../../p/u/a/WP%7EPUA_9bb4.html#Special_circumstantial_awards" title="WP:PUA">The barnstar for this award</a> implies (given that it prominently features the hammer and sickle) that ironfistedness and abusiveness is characteristic of Communism. From <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammer_and_sickle.html" title="Hammer and sickle">here</a>, one can gather that the hammer and sickle are "symbols of the peasantry and the industrial proletariat; placing them together symbolises the unity between agricultural and industrial workers." I do not see how this relates to the <a href="../../../p/u/a/WP%7EPUA_9bb4.html#Special_circumstantial_awards" title="WP:PUA">"keen ability at offending or otherwise dominating vandals and trolls with an iron fist."</a>. It is misleading and reflects poorly of the Wikipedia ethos of accuracy and informed learning.

<dd>Surely the key point is that the use of the hammer and sickle for this "award" is anachronistic, backhandedly offensive (what self-respecting admin would want to be awarded such a thing?) and weirdly specific in context (what does Soviet communism have to do with this?).

<dd>To expand a bit. There are cases where considerably more effort goes in an investigation by an editor, beyond the normal scope of what traditionaly is seen. Complex Vandalism, can span over months or years may and require days or even weeks to uncover entirely the scope of the dammage done to Wikipedia by an vandal. I think its worth considering, because most of this type of investigative work goes mostly unoticed or recognized, as the bulk of the effort goes into reading through hundreds of articles, doing research, screening ect.--<a href="../../../h/u/1/User%7EHu12_d0ca.html" title="User:Hu12">Hu12</a> 20:34, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<b>The Barnstar Star</b> is awarded to users who are bold in creating awards for the community. Introduced by cyde, designed by Sango123 and WillMak050389.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I have a proposal to add the "Barnstar" Personal User Award. This is an award for users who have given out so many barnstars and other awards to users. I came up with the idea after I awarded <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal">Persian Poet Gal</a> a barnstar. I like awarding barnstars to users (of course, I don't hand barnstars out as though they were candy), and think that users who have given out several awards should be given <i>this</i> award.</p>
<p>However, I am concerned about uploading the image I have created. The award is made up of <i>six barnstars integrated into one,</i> and I am worried about any violations if I upload this image. If people want to see the image anyway, I will upload it: I'm just concerned that's all. Despite the fact that the award is made up of six barnstars, it <i>does</i> look like a completely new image. I worked hard on the image, and I don't really want to see it wasted.</p>
<p>I think this award is a good idea. It promotes WikiCivility, and users who have given out many barnstars but received very little or none would get an award. However, this award <i>should not</i> be used as an excuse for a user to give awards out to anyone.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 19:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is it like this award from the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_user_awards_2b20.html" title="Wikipedia:Personal user awards">PUA</a> page?</p>

<li><b>Support</b> - if Wikipedia wants to have a deletionist barnstar then they should have it - but this barnstar (as titled) is the editor's barnstar - and it wrongly suggest that editors should just delete things, when in fact there is another aspect to editting that is just as important to Wikipedia - adding information (you add information to improve/clarify the article therefore it is editting - someone raised that point with me in an earlier discussion and I just want to make sure there's no question here).
