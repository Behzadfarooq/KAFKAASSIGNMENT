	    <p>wtf does barbelo have to do with shiva or tantras??</p>
<p>I agree, which is why I asked for a citation. My intention though, was to ask, for a citation quote about what is the relevance, i.e., show a scholar of Gnosticism who says so, a significant scholar. If that isn't in there in a day or so I'll remove it again. I'm not trying to be a jerk I just want a Gnostic scholar of importance saying it, and I'm not aware of one. That would be original research if you can't find it, right?. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquirleyWurley_b002.html" title="User:SquirleyWurley">SquirleyWurley</a> 05:29, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please do not be so demanding. Rome wasn't built in a day. And take the time to look into a scholars credentials yourself, Google is easily available. I happen to have an use a first Indian edition of Singh. His book on the Shiva Sutras has since been republished by SUNY Press, along with other of his books. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/103-9640162-2314217?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dblended&amp;keywords=jaideva+singh&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/103-9640162-2314217?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dblended&amp;keywords=jaideva+singh&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>I'm not trying to be demanding. My concern is simply this: Jaideva Singh is an expert in what, exactly? Gnosticism? No, he's not an expert in Gnosticism, not an expert in Barbelo. So ok, he's an expert in something, great. But not in what is required for him to be an appropriate source for this article, that's all. I have a copy of Shiva Sutras myself. It's a different tradition; we can make comparisons, but it would either be original research, or it would be very debatable among scholars, or it would be really off topic for this kind of encyclopedia article. So again, I ask for a Gnostic scholar if you want to put that in. Not an Eastern Hindu Scholar who claims that there is a link between Tantra and Gnosticism, not a PhD in English, eihter&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquirleyWurley_b002.html" title="User:SquirleyWurley">SquirleyWurley</a> 03:01, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you are being demanding. Scholars of Gnosticism are not the only scholars whose work involves Gnosticism. Scholars of history, comparative religion, mythology, and psychology also have an interest in and are qualified to say something about Gnosticism. The discussion of the similarities between certain aspects of Gnosticism and certain aspects of the Tantras goes back to at least 1929, when Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Woodroffe_4b7f.html" title="John Woodroffe">John Woodroffe</a> mentioned the similarity. It has been also mentioned by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alain_Dani%C3%A9lou_ce65.html" title="Alain Daniélou">Alain Daniélou</a>, who is certainly a qualified historian. And it is certain to be covered in more depth and detail in John Lash's forthcoming book, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/193149892X" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/193149892X" rel="nofollow">Not in His Image: Gnostic Vision, Sacred Ecology, and the Future of Belief</a></i> . I hope that you won't think that someone who has been called the heir to both <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Campbell_2650.html" title="Joseph Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mircea_Eliade_f0a3.html" title="Mircea Eliade">Mircea Eliade</a> is not a suitable source for the article. In other words, it is not original research, I didn't just pull it out of my ***, which is what you seem to be implying. I hope you won't try to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the article. Adding information is one thing, and certainly I would encourage it, but removing information is quite another and is discouraged. Restricting the sources in the articles to people you feel are qualified "scholars of Gnosticism" would violate the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV policy</a>. —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 12:51, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I don't want to go against the norms of Wikipedia. It seems to me that one way to handle neutrality, according to Wikipedia's guides, is to keep viewpoint presentation proportionate to the scholars in the subject matter, Lash doesn't have the same weight as Meyer or Robinson or Layton. Speculating about comparisons between Tantra and Gnosticism is fine if the information is informative and descriptive and a little more substantive, I would think, especially if you have a quote and it is a scholar of Gnosticism or of ancient history. The looser sort of comparative religion does have a place, but where is it, in a separate section? Part of the problem is what does it mean that tantra speaks of Siva and Shakti. I mean, Wicca speaks of a God and a Goddess. So what is the real comparison, is that it? Fleshing that out would help, I think. The comparative religious writers pre-Nag Hammadi, and the popular writers who are not Gnostic Scholars, are often speaking very speculatively about their original research, and for whatever they say there are very many who would say otherwise, and Gnostic scholars themselves would be much more careful in explaining such parallels. Blavatsky had lots of views on Gnostics, too, but they would belong in a separate section or perhaps in a separate article, wouldn't they? I also think such a comparison belongs on another page, not the Barbelo page. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquirleyWurley_b002.html" title="User:SquirleyWurley">SquirleyWurley</a> 04:37, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope, it's against policy to split other views off from the article. Or to attempt to buffalo other editors into doing so. And that, I think, is going to be my final word on the matter, unless you care to discuss the details of how best to integrate these legitimate viewpoints on the subject into the article. —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 05:01, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not about just mentioning all minor views AS IF they were equivalent to views that are held by more prominent minority positions, proportionality is a worthwhile consideration. Also, putting in other views will be important, to avoid lack of neutrality issues. Also, I'd want to put an actual quote from Lash, because the sumary itself is so sparce it doesn't say much, the reader is likely to say, well how impotant is it that two systems have a male first principle and a second principle that is depicted as female? So it isn't too informative as it now is. I think these things would help present the information and develop the article. Comparing Tantra to Gnosticism is worthwhile, but it isn't quite so simple as saying, well there's the Hidden Father and Barbelo here, and Shiva and Shakti there. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquirleyWurley_b002.html" title="User:SquirleyWurley">SquirleyWurley</a> 05:29, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SquirleyWurley, I notice that you just started editing WP this month. I also notice that <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> has been here for two years longer than that. I also note that you are no more qualified than H.D. to be an expert on Gnosticism as it appears that you both have undergraduate degrees in unrelated fields. Therefore I'd suggest not speaking in such a condescending tone to another editor. Please see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Thanks. -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 14:34, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of all that, I think I said some things that might help make it a better article, which has been my only intention, so I'll point out that one wiki principle seems to be to try to assume good faith of other editors, so maybe we can all work on that. It might be a better article with a reference to tantra. But if so, I think it would be good to have a quote by some recent mainstream expert in Gnosticism, something that says something about Shakti and Barbelo beyond just a comparison of male-female pairs. But if that is all you mean, well you could specify that this is the only comparison you are making, too, I suppose. In any case, the Apocryphon of John and other Nag Hammadi texts are very different from the Tantras, so I don't think it is sensible to make it sound like there is this clear undisputed comparison. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquirleyWurley_b002.html" title="User:SquirleyWurley">SquirleyWurley</a> 07:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
