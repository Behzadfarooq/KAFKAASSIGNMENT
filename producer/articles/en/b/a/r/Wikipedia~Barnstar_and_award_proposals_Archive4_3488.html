<p><i>The following is the archive of an ended discussion. Please don't edit the contents. The result of the discussion was <b>create the Graphic Designer's Barnstar</b></i>.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid red;width:100%;background-color:#dddddd">
<p>Here's an idea that would add to the project, I believe. I was just revising the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstars_on_Wikipedia_c8fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia">Barnstars on Wikipedia</a> page and I saw that something was missing: we don't have a Barnstar to recognize Wikipedians who dedicate time and efforts to creating images for the project. I mean, right here, on this forum, there's some people I'd like to see recognized for their work in creating the images of the awards guys like me keep thinking up, but can't design themselves. This does not appear to be covered by the Photographer's Barnstar, which is for those who upload photographs to the website. I feel this award could comprise both those who create images (either new images, such as the barnstars, or graphic files of existing images, such as those who create images of flags, medals and other symbols that we use to illustrate articles) and those who combine two or more previously existing images — as in a montage — to create something objective that we can use (Photoshop, etc.). If the idea takes, we could call it <i>The Graphic Designer's Barnstar</i>, or <i>The Wiki Graphic Designer's Barnstar</i>. What about it?

<dd>In keeping with the concept of "creation of proposed images", I'll suggest an image which has half being a sketch on the back of an envelope and half being a Barnstar (either image or a precisely-drawn Barnstar).

<p>So far, only a few users have given their [valuable] input to this proposal, and they have all been positive. I'd love to get more of a brainstorm going for this, but if no one else will add anything to the discussion, I feel we could create the award with the name I proposed and Sango's first proposed image, which has received the support of all the users so far (Bratsche and myself, really).

<p>Owing to recent events it's been particularly difficult to keep the Muslim and islamic related articles POV Free. there have been attacks from so called islamophobes and bigots on one side, and zealots (like me, apparently) on the other, that being said there are some users out there doing an amazing job. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">User:Mustafaa</a> (Granted hes away now), <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> and the likes.

<dd>I must say, a religion-oriented Barnstar (whichever religion that may be) can be somewhat problematic, we might end up obliged to create Barnstars for all the other major religions (and maybe some of the minors too). Furthermore, I'm not quite clear on what it is the scope you propose. If it's for outstanding work in Islam-related articles, that's one thing, but if it's for keeping POV and vandalism out of Islam-related articles, we already have Barnstars that cover those fields.

<dd>This area of study already falls under the critiera of the <b>Barnstar of High Culture</b>. Religion also seems to attract POV like flies to honey, so I think a barnstar of this nature might be problematic. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBratsche_d97d.html" title="User:Bratsche"><font color="#006666">Bratsche</font></a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBratsche_6f8a.html" title="User talk:Bratsche"><font color="#FF6600">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">Esperanza</font></a></sup> 13:45, September 1, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My thoughts exactly. Even a more general "religion Barnstar" could cause trouble. As Bratsche said, good content contributions can be rewarded with the Barnstar of High Culture; and as I had said, work done to keep POV and vandalism in check can be rewarded with other existing Barnstars, such as <b>The Tireless Contributor</b>, the <b>Defender of the Wiki</b> or <b>The Barnstar of Diligence</b>.

<p>After updating DYK for a couple times last week, I felt that there were certain editors who created many exceptional <b>Did you know?</b> facts (and articles), and that there were several admins who diligently updated the DYK template routinely. I feel that the contributions of these people could be awarded with a <b>DYK barnstar</b>. Admittedly, I'm no artist, but I do have an idea for the barnstar: impose <a href="../../../u/p/d/Image%7EUpdated_DYK_query.png_1592.html" title="Image:Updated DYK query.png">Image:Updated DYK query.png</a> over a barnstar.

<dd>Not that the idea isn't good, but the problem I see is that it seems to be too narrow a field for it to have its own Barnstar — I mean, it would be a Barnstar for work on a single, albeit important, template. A wiki Barnstar works better if it can be awarded to a larger spectrum of users, in a broader contribution base. I feel that the good work that is done there can be justly rewarded with some of the already-existing Barnstars, such as the Barnstar of Diligence, or the Tireless Contributor Barnstar.

<dd>Perhaps expand it so that the barnstar covers new articles?

<dd>While I cannot think of a name, I thought up of a corny design. Ok, there is a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stork.html" title="Stork">stork</a> flying in the sky. In the stork's mouth, there is a blanket and in the blanket, there is a minor Barnstar. In the US, when people think of storks, we see them delivering babies (and that is how I saw babies delivered in TV until I was given a reality check in 5th or 6th grade). As for name...gee...all I can think up is the Creationist Barnstar. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 23:14, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>An award for users who create new articles...now that could work! Let's see, we already have a wiki award (not a Barnstar) for users who create or get articles up to featured status – it's a medal with a very interesting image. So perhaps we could take it from there in creating the appearance of this award? I feel it could be rather fitting. As for the name, regardless of whether it turns out to be a medal or a Barnstar, how about something like <b>The Trailblazer Barnstar/Award/Medal</b>. I thought of "trailblazer" because by creating a new article, a user introduces a new theme to Wikipedia, and many a time it does pick up, with many people interested — it was just a matter of getting it started, and once someone does, the topic can attract interest and thrive, so in a sense, the creator of the article may be "opening new paths" in the project. About the appearance, if we decide to go with a Barnstar, I like Zscout's idea. Alternatively (if the stork thing turns out to be too hard to come by), we could also use the ancient image of a hatching egg (with a Barnstar coming out of it). That's also an universal allusion to the beginning of life. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:30, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

Personally, why looking at it, the Working Man's Barnstar can be given out for working so hard for creating new articles. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 06:13, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, yes, but I believe that this field (outstanding activity in creating new articles) merits its own Barnstar. I mean, theoretically we wouldn't need any Barnstar other than the Original Barnstar, which can be awarded for, really, anything. Plus, other, older Barnstars also have an almost unlimited spectrum — such as The Barnstar of Diligence, The Working Man Barnstar, etc... But many topics have been found worthy of a specific Barnstar. When an idea is turned down, it's never simply because it could be covered by one of those "broader" Barnstars, but rather because their suggested theme is not worthy of a Barnstar on its own. There's the example right here: the original idea on this discussion, a Barnstar for work in the DYK template, was turned down — although <b>also</b> because it could be covered by said Barnstars — <b>mainly</b> because the proposed scope was not fitted for a specific Barnstar (as I said, it would have been a Barnstar for a single, albeit important, template). Notice that this is regarding those Barnstars that can be given out to almost any kind of work, but we also shut down many proposals whose scopes, although theoretically appropriate, are redundant with some already-existing specific Barnstars — this cannot apply to those "broad" Barnstars, because they have a very wide field of application (and virtually anything would be redundant when put against them).

<dd>True, but what I'm saying is that this one seems like a worthy prospect for a Barnstar (and I don't throw that around all too often). Do you disagree? Deryck too?

<dd>IMHO, I feel that this is a great barnstar (then again, I may be slightly biased...). But what covers this field?

<p>When I thought about it some more, I came to think that maybe the only image posted as the possible image for this award would work nicely, because it's green. Green is a color commonly associated with "go ahead", "proceed", and creating a new award could be associated with "giving a green light" to a new idea, by introducing a new article on it. Since this discussion is starting to look stale, I'd like to suggest the following draft:</p>

<p><i>The Trailblazer Barnstar</i> may be awarded to those who create quality new articles on Wikipedia, helping it expand its general coverage.</p>
<p>This award was introduced by <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and was designed by <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a>.<br clear="left" /></p>

<dd>Ok, I don't like the Barnstar at all. I know that Sango123 is on academic leave, but really, this Barnstar doesn't seem to fit. Right now, it's just a green barstar with a purpose of rewarding contributions of new articles. No offense to anyone, but I don't think it works right now.

<dd>Well, the star is really not very allusive to the topic. But it's all we've got. I resorted to an exercise in imagination to come up with the whole "green for go" explanation. In fact, since you mentioned it, I've actually been considering putting together a "call to action" myself. For one reason or another, this forum has (again) been deserted. Right now, only Zach, Deryck and myself have been posting regularly, and that's not nearly enough people involved. The part that's particularly hurt is the options for images. I can't come up with a decent drawing to save my life, and so we've found ourselves obliged to reach out to older drawings, such as this green star, in order to just have any option at all for a Barnstar image. Naturally, this is not going very well. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:41, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose we use this as the Ed Poor barnstar for boldness, to award to those really bold editors. One problem though: the mouth isn't supposed to be tweaked to the left, what's a more predictable way to make the mouth? It's currently a sideways greater-than (&gt;) symbol, in "Arial black". It looks fine on Inkscape, but it's tweaked to the left here. It looks like it rendered in a different font to me. --<span style="color:red"><a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <b><sup>(<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">talk</a>)</sup></b></span> 22:52, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have nothing but the highest respect for Ed and his contributions, but I don't think it's a good idea to create a barnstar with his name on it espousing boldness when some of his bold activities have been disputed and argued against (including having an arbitration case filed against him).

<dd>Define "bold". There's no specification on the scope of this proposed Barnstar. Being bold is one of the "corollaries" of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRI_cf98.html" title="WP:TRI">Trifecta</a>, which means that being bold is a desirable quality of what we would define as a good contributor — with no specific center: anyone can be good for a number of reasons: creating new articles, improving existing ones, participating in forums, etc. and one can be "bold" (and hence, "good") while doing pretty much any of it. This kind of general "goodness" is already covered by the Original Barnstar. I see no point in instating another Barnstar that is also that general; it would only make sense if the scope was somehow more specific, focused, than that of the more general Barnstars that we already have.<br />
It seems that originally, it was meant for those who are bold "Ed Poor-style", but that won't do, for the reasons stated by Deathphoenix and with which everybody seems to agree. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 20:57, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Does boldness mean splashing your personal opinions all over wikipedia? If so, the <i>caution</i> is more to be admired. And in any case, this image does not have that 3d effect - it does not look like it might be nailed to a barn. <a href="../../../p/m/u/User%7EPmurray_bigpond.com_8f29.html" title="User:Pmurray bigpond.com">Pmurray bigpond.com</a> 00:30, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The drawing is not of my concern right now, but I still believe with what happened to Ed after he did what he did (he deleted then <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a> some time ago) and trying to award Barnstars for it is not a very good idea. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 00:35, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, i'll accept it as rejected then. It wasn't meant for ed poor style boldness, it was meant for boldness, and Ed Poor being mentioned because he's the boldest.

<dd>Looking forward to it, and best of luck.&#160;:-) My first barnstar proposal (made, and rejected, when I was a newbie) was for a purple barnstar to be awarded to those who had their user pages vandalised. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 05:35, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
