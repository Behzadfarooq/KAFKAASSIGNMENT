<p>What about the wounded and those subsequently killed during rioting?</p>
<hr />
<p>What does Hanadi Jaradat have to do with this?</p>
<hr />
<p>"*Yitzchak Matoof, local resident, testified that "Arab storekeepers told me not to come to the Machpelah on Purim as it will not be good for Jews there.""</p>
<p>This obviously sounds pro-Goldstein because it in the section of their claims supporting him!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Questions</b></p>
<p>1) Does anybody know why the remaining Arabs (approximatley 770) didn't carry out their planned massacre of Jews after Goldstein's shooting?</p>
<p>2)Why did Goldstein try to stop the planned massacre of Jews by himself?</p>
<p>3)Why did the Arabs subdue Goldstein with a fire-extinguisher instead of the weapons that they'd smuggled in to the mosque? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 13:54, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) Many Arabs were killed and hundreds injured. With all of the people mourning, healing etc., they were in no condition to carry out an attack.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Does this mean the Arabs were so traumatised that they were only able to riot afterwards? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 13:33, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) The Arabs did not try to stop Goldstein from entering because he was a medic and they never thought he would carry out an attack. Had there been others with Goldstein, they may have had a harder time getting in. Also, the army refused to help.</p>

<dd>I was under the impression that Goldstein entered the mosque wearing a concentration camp uniform? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 13:33, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>3) The entire event happened very fast. They didn't have time to go find all of their smuggled weapons (as they were well hidden). Goldstein had trouble reloading his gun and the Arabs used whatever they could to subdue him</p>

1 - Yes. Also, if they had carried out the pogrom, then Goldstein would surely be viewed much differently.</p>
<p>2 - I have never heard that he wore a concentration camp uniform and a quick search on google couldn't find anything about that either.</p>
<p>3 - Well some of the Arabs were searched so they had to hide the weapons well.</p>
<p>All of the knowledge I have of this story has come from friends of his, websites, books, etc. I had never met him and I have no direct link to his family. I have heard the event told over many times and these are my findings.</p>

<p>NB - Just for the record Goldstein was wearing an Israeli army reservist uniform <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/25/newsid_4167000/4167929.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/25/newsid_4167000/4167929.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 08:52, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Itbach al Yahud"</span></h2>
<p>Jayjg - The war cry "Slaughter the Jews" was also shouted before the pogrom in Hebron in 1929. It was entered previously but you had edited it out. I think it is a very good point and should be included. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcoboy7_2019.html" title="User:Falcoboy7">Falcoboy7</a> 06:10, Apr 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"(uncited claim, and irrelevant in any case)"</p>
<p>It is relevant, because the Jews of Hebron knew about this and therefore were scared even more of another pogrom, which explains Goldstein's actions. Uncited claim? Isn't that why it's in the "claims" section? I guess I could go citing everything but the purpose of this is not to transform the entire article into a law case. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcoboy7_2019.html" title="User:Falcoboy7">Falcoboy7</a> 22:33, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) How do you know it was shouted in Hebron in 1929? If you can't provide evidence, then you need to cite things as claims, not statements of fact. 2) More citations are better. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:56, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, I can go digging for citations, but the entire thing about "Itbach al Yahud" is in the claims section. You said "if you can't provide evidence, then you need to cite things as claims," - which it currently is. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcoboy7_2019.html" title="User:Falcoboy7">Falcoboy7</a> 02:09, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The source for the Arabs shouting "Itbach al Yahud" (Slaughter the Jews) before they massacred 67 Jews in Hebron in 1929: Memorandum to the High Commissioner of Palestine from the Jewish Community of Hebron. It was reprinted in the newspaper "Davar" on 8 September 1929 on page 2.Simonschaim 15:09, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">One-sided</span></h2>
<p>While the facts stand that Goldstein murdered 29 Muslims in Hebron, and his act was vilified by most Israelis while being glorified by right-wingers, this article does not bother to suggest reasons for his behavior or motives. True, what he did was wrong, but as any good prosecutor would ask, <i>Why</i> did he do it? Since the answers aren't coming from Goldstein, I think we need to add more about his background and activities, as well as the general political climate in Hebron in the years leading up to the attack, in order to paint a fairer, NPOV picture. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYoninah_ec9f.html" title="User:Yoninah">Yoninah</a> 07:44, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Give me a break. We now have a picture of him as a doctor, and a large section attempting to justify his murders and the (scary) inscription on his tomb stone. Though it's useful in seeing that Jews are exactly the same when it comes to this whole "martyrdom" business as the arabs. Ask anyone about this guy and they'll say they've never heard of him. But he's the reason that suicide bombings started in the occupying state of Israel. That's the Jewish media for you!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Baruch Goldstein has very little to do with why suicide bombings occur in Israel. Perhaps you should read this article (at the least) before posting such non-sense. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcoboy7_2019.html" title="User:Falcoboy7">Falcoboy7</a> 19:08, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The first ever Hamas suicide bombing took place two months after the masacre. Perhaps in response to it?</p>
<p>the first ""hamas"" ""suicide"" bombings but they werent the first suicide bombings nor the first hamas bombings (long live the little diffrence)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terrorist or Militant</span></h2>
<p>Looks like there is some controversy over whether Goldstein is considered a militant or a terrorist. My feeling was that since just about all Palestinians who have killed Jews in the Middle East conflict are considered "militants," it only makes sense that a Jew killing Palestinians also be called a "militant." Thoughts? <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcoboy7_2019.html" title="User:Falcoboy7">Falcoboy7</a> 02:37, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Palestinian murderers are terrorists. Lies about them do not alter the terroristic nature of Goldsteins' actions. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremy_Nimmo_b295.html" title="User:Jeremy Nimmo">Jeremy Nimmo</a> 08:48, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While terrorists are definitely militants, I believe the more specific word should be used across the board. I disagree with the idea that the definition of terrorist is POV. Goldstein was a terrorist, as is <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_Bin_Laden_e170.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a>, as is <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanadi_Jaradat_3727.html" title="Hanadi Jaradat">Hanadi Jaradat</a> who was mentioned on this page. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 10:31, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Only a Court of Law can determine whether a person is a "murderer" a "terrorist", a "thief", a "rapist" and so on. Until such a Court has made such a determination, no-one has the right to categorise somebody with one of these terms. It is a basic principle of justice that a person is innocent until found guilty. No Court has ever ruled that Dr. Baruch Goldstein is a terrorist. Therefore the term "terrorist" is totally out of place for him. Simonschaim 13:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I see what you mean. I do think that in this instance the word "terrorist" could be considered POV but does not necessarily have to be. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcoboy7_2019.html" title="User:Falcoboy7">Falcoboy7</a> 05:24, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the problem is that currently it is considered POV. As a result, while the few Israeli terrorists are labeled correctly as terrorists, the many Arab terrorist individuals and organizations are usually described through terms that greatly reduce their actions in terms of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimes_against_humanity.html" title="Crimes against humanity">crimes against humanity</a> that they commit. This creates an unbalanced picture throughout the articles on the Middle East and is also unfair towards the victims of crimes by all sides. Contrary to common wisdom, this does not necessarily have to do anything with Israel.

<dd>Glad we agree. Everyone is on the long-run well-served by calling things by their names, e.g. Palestinian terrorists and Israeli terrorists, even if some temporary discomfort is involved. It is our policy, but unfortunately our practice is different. Wikipedia should not have double standards, nor should it flatten out the severity of all violence, that is opt for the easy single-standard solution. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 01:35, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is the unfortunate reality of en.wikipedia. I am happy that it does not allow moderate language when the crimes are by Israelis, but that is not enough. There are moral moral implications to the collaboration in a network that whitewashes crimes against humanity in large quantities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"unauthoritative" claims</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the word "unauthoritative" that was inserted before the word claims. It's unclear what exactly it means, and it appears to be merely an attempt to POV the article. The word "claims" alone indicates that they have not been substantiated. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I used the word 'unauthorative' because Goldstein gave no reasons for his actions, they have merely been infered. I have also removed the following claims for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The metal detector at the East Gate where most of the Arabs entered that Friday Purim morning was damaged the night before.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Could Goldstein have known this? If not then it could have had no bearing on his actions.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>An unusually large number of Arabs came to the Cave of the Patriarchs that Friday; around 500 men and 300 women. Because of this massive influx of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinians.html" title="Palestinians">Palestinians</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli.html" title="Israeli">Israeli</a> soldiers were only able to search a handful of men for weapons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Are Kach qualified to say that the number was unusually large? Did Goldstein know that only a handful had been searched? If not then once again it could have had no bearing on the supposed reasons for his actions.</dd>

<p>Also both these claims lack a cited source. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConch_Shell_7c1c.html" title="User:Conch Shell">Conch Shell</a> 16:26, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>1. The metal detector at the East Gate was already broken at least two weeks, if not several months, before Purim. (The Arabs just damaged it FURTHER on the night before Purim.) The Arabs knew well before Purim that it was broken since they came to pray in the Cave of Machpelah every day. What is significant is that ALMOST ALL the large number of Arabs entered specifically by this East Gate that morning. Although there was nothing to stop them entering by the Main Gate, very few chose to do so. [Sources: Shamgar Commission: Minutes pp.203 bet-gimmel, 519; Exhibit 14] 2. The number of Arabs who came that morning to the Cave of Machpelah is quoted in the Shamgar Report. That it was an unprecedented large number is not an assessment by Kach, but is evidence given to the Shamgar Commission by Arab guards and Arab worshippers who were present that morning in the Cave of Machpelah. The Army Duty Officer at the Cave of Machpelah gave evidence to the Commission that it was only possible to search a small number of the 500 Arab MEN - from the Report we can see that it was about twelve per cent. NONE of the 300 Arab women entering the Cave of Machpelah were searched. Even if there had there been women soldiers present, they would not have been allowed to make such a search, since the regulations forbade it. [Sources: Shamgar Commission: Report pp.15,18; Minutes pp. 203 gimmel, 509, 2119, 2191, 2235-36; Exhibits 286, 313, 322]Simonschaim 16:03, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look, for better or worse, these are the claims that are made (see the links provided), and they're quite widespread in certain right-wing circles. The article already states that Goldstein did not make any statement regarding his reasons beforehand; "unauthoritative" implies that there is some body somewhere that "authorizes" claims made by various groups. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:31, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV Word Usage</span></h2>
<p>In regard to my recent edits: I have replaced the word "massacre" with "shooting" in the sentence "<i>Rioting immediately followed the massacre, leading to the deaths of another 26 Palestinians and 9 Israelis.</i>" Secondly, I replaced "<i>Members of the outlawed Kach organization defend his <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_murder.html" title="Mass murder">mass murder</a></i>" with "Members of the outlawed Kach organization defend his actions." I feel that while most people (including myself) consider Goldstein a mass murderer, there are some who claim he is not, and that using such words supports one POV. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden">Aiden</a> 02:28, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terrorists category</span></h2>
<p>I realize that Wikipedia discourage the use of the word 'terrorist' but as long as they have a Terrorists category Goldstein should be in it because:</p>
<ol>
<li>He fits the Wikipedian category criteria.</li>
<li>The Israeli government demolished a shrine at Goldstein's tomb under a law forbidding the erection of monuments to terrorists, his own government therefore consider him to be one.</li>

The presence of a terrorist category is irrelevant, as it could have been created by anybody and its presence does not dictate new policy. Regardless of who is violating Wikipedia policy elsewhere, we as editors of <i>this</i> article should <i>not</i> follow in suit. Two wrongs don't make a right.

The overall impression is that there is disagreement on the issue. Personally I think we should avoid using this label and that is how I have been arguing for a long time. However, this category exists and Goldstein obviously matches it.

<p>The essence of "massacre" as opposed to "killing" is that it refers to killing a lot of defenceless people all at once. The fact that a lot of people were killed at once is disputed by nobody. The fact that they were defenceless was established by the Israeli commission (the best the victims could manage for a weapon was a fire-extinguisher) and not even the apologist Simmons claims that the Arabs were armed. So it was a massacre. Even if, against all evidence and simple logic, Goldstein <i>thought</i> he was saving a lot of people by his actions, it was still a massacre.

Otherwise he would have not made such a statement about the Arabs who were then in the Cave of Machpelah having no weapons. In my book, I gave details together with sources that showed that weapons were found by the Israeli soldiers after Dr. Baruch Goldstein's act, in the Hall of the Cave of Machpelah where the Arabs had been. These weapons were shown NOT to be those of Baruch Goldstein, the soldiers then on duty in the Cave of Machpelah or the Jewish worshippers who were present. (The Arabs certainly illegally possessed weapons at that period, since they had used them to kill no fewer than three Jews and injure many others in the Hebron area.) In addition there had been intelligence reports that the Arabs would try and smuggle weapons into the Cave of Machpelah in the days preceding Purim.

<dd>If the fact that a lot of people were killed is undisputed, how is calling the killings "killings" a fringe view?

<dd>"Massacre" is not a pov word, it is a neutral word that describes the event objectively. Calling it "killings" is losing key information, like calling something an animal when you know it's a horse. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 23:39, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So I suppose it's ok to use "Massacre" in this context: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riots_in_Palestine_of_1929" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riots_in_Palestine_of_1929" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riots_in_Palestine_of_1929</a></p>
<p>When describing the Arab killing of jews (67 to be exact) and refering to Arabs as murderers and using words like "atrocities"? But, the Cave of Patriarchs "shooting" was labled a ...um oh yeah it was removed.</p>
<p>There is a pattern of word mincing on Wikipedia in regards to the Arab/Israeli conflict. Here's a few examples:</p>
<p>Khanaey Chai is mentioned as "far-right" political party <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahane_Chai" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahane_Chai" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahane_Chai</a> later in the article it DOES state that the Israeli government itself declared them a terrorist group (The U.S. DOJ does as well by the way) but not in the first opening line. That information is burried further down the page. Not to mention their history and great pride in the Irgun group which carried out the King David Hotel "Bombing" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing</a> among other "attacks" on British and Arab targets.</p>
<p>Hamas, however, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas</a> are described as "best known around the world for carrying out suicide bombings". "Best Known"? The author is detaching himself from the responsibility of this being called a POV by putting that responsibility on someone else "the world". Is that based on a survey?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Did or Did Not Dr. Baruch Goldstein MASSACRE 29 Arabs? An opinion piece</span></h2>
<p>During the last few days I have on several occasions put the following contribution on this Talk page. Each time it has immediately been deleted by Gidonb. After each deletion Aiden has been very critical of this deleting by Gidonb. I am therefore now putting before the users of Wikipedia my contribution together with messages between myself, Gidonb and Aiden. I ask the users to decide whether my contribution should or should not be on this Talk page. Thank you.</p>
<p>MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE TALK PAGE</p>
<p>Did or Did Not Dr. Baruch Goldstein MASSACRE 29 Arabs?</p>
<p>As a person who has over the course of a number of years made a very detailed study of Dr. Baruch Goldstein's act in the Cave of Machpelah on Purim (25 February) 1994 and has subsequently written a fully documented book on the subject entitled <a href="http://www.geocities.com/chaimsimons/baruchgoldstein.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/chaimsimons/baruchgoldstein.html" rel="nofollow">"Did or Did Not Dr. Baruch Goldstein MASSACRE 29 Arabs?"</a> I feel that I can speak on this subject with some authority.</p>
<p>It is a most fundamental tenet of justice that a person is innocent until proved guilty and such guilt can only be established in an Court of Law. Not only has Dr. Goldstein never been found guilty of perpetrating any massacre, no opportunity has ever been given for anybody to put forward a defence for his act that Purim. Yet despite all this, he is continually being labelled a "terrorist", a "mass murderer" and so on. The only "trial" he has had, has been by the media and the politicians who have their own agenda.</p>
<p>It is true that a Commission of Inquiry (the Shamgar Commission) was set up by the Israeli Government immediately after that Purim. However the way it conducted its activities has much to be desired. Although the Israeli law on "Commissions of Inquiry" clearly states that should a situation arise where the name and honour of a deceased person could be harmed by the results of such an Inquiry, then the relatives of such a person have to be informed and given the opportunity to put forward a defence, including the right to cross examine witnesses. Despite this law, the members of Dr. Goldstein's family were NEVER given such an opportunity.</p>
<p>It also goes without say that judges or members of a Commission of Inquiry may not decide on the guilt of a person until they have heard all the evidence. Yet, in this Commission of Inquiry, the majority of its members were already calling Dr. Baruch Goldstein a "murderer" before they had heard all the evidence. One of its members, Judge Abed el-Rahman Zouabi, who is a professional judge of the State of Israel, used this term from the FIRST DAY of the hearings and in the course of the hearings used it no fewer than 17 times in just the open sessions.</p>
<p>I dedicated my book to "Truth and Justice. In the interests of truth and justice, a Commission of Inquiry should be established - the composition of which to be acceptable both to the Israeli authorities and to the Goldstein family - whose sole function would be to determine whether the killings by Dr. Baruch Goldstein should be classed as a massacre of Arabs or a pre-emptive strike to prevent a massacre of Jews."</p>
<p>I should mention that this is not an empty statement, since there is much evidence that Dr. Baruch Goldstein did a pre-emptive strike to prevent a planned massacre of Jews that Purim morning in the Cave of Machpelah.</p>
<p>Many of the questions raised in the above "Talk" have been answered and fully documented in my book. I therefore suggest that you read this book which appears in its entirety on the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/chaimsimons/baruchgoldstein.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/chaimsimons/baruchgoldstein.html" rel="nofollow">Internet</a>.</p>
<p>I will be very happy to hear comments from readers after they have studied the book.</p>
<p>MESSAGES BETWEEN MYSELF AND GIDONB</p>
<p>Dear Gidonb Please let me know why you deleted my contribution to the "Talk: Baruch Goldstein"? Is it any less relevant than the other contributions which appear on this talk page? Simonschaim 11:34, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Simonschaim, the reason I trimmed the text was in the edit summary. Sorry, I cannot promise there was not one single contribution that was less relevant to the edit process than your contribution (which I may have overlooked). That said, your contribution was definitely between the less relevant ones to the content of the page. Please follow the Wikipedia policies while you are here. If you would like to promote your personal opinions then you will be better off at a web-forum. Enjoy Wikipedia, I will insert a welcoming message if it hasn't been done yet. The links in such a message are helpful for the editing process. Regards, gidonb 16:25, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Gidonb: I was rather dismayed to read your "reasons" for deleting my contribution to the talkpage on Baruch Goldstein. These you stated to be that they were my "personal opinion" and that they were irrelevant to the article on Baruch Goldstein. However reading through one of your contributions to this very same talkpage you wrote "Goldstein was a terrorist". Since no Court of Law has found him guilty of being a terrorist, this is YOUR PERSONAL OPINION! In addition, if it is RELEVANT for you to make such a comment on the talkpage, it is NO LESS relevant for me to bring the counter view. You also mention "Wikipedia policies". If you would study the "Key Policies of Wikipedia" you would see that one of them is "Respect other Contributors". However despite this you totally removed my contribution and when "Aiden" accused you of "censoring talk pages" you classed this as an "unpleasant accusation". I consider my contribution to this talkpage no less relevant than your contributions and I am therefore restoring it. Simonschaim 08:30, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My contribution specifically discussed the categorization of the article, while there was disagreement about it on the main page. Your contribution did not relate to the edit process. Therefor it was removed. This has nothing to do with respect. I respect all contributors. However, if we are not tough sometimes on the information dumped at talk pages, they become one big mess. gidonb 10:25, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

MESSAGES BETWEEN GIDONB AND AIDEN</p>
<p>Did you not delete another user's comments? If that isn't censoring I don't know what is. â€”Aiden 17:05, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Saying that I censor talk pages is a very unpleasant accusation that does not improve the pleasure of contributing to this community project. I did explain in the edit summary why I removed the text. Also, you referred to Wikipedia policies, can you show me just one policy that states that anything that is dumped by anons at talk pages, even if unrelated to the edit proces, should remain there? gidonb 16:45, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>gidonb, article Talk pages exists so that users can offer their views on the article and the article's subject. Policies like WP:NPOV and WP:NOT apply to articles not Talk pages. It is not up to another editor to decide what should be censored and what should remain on a Talk page. It is very impolite to remove another user's comments from a Talk page, save for vandalism. Please refrain from doing so. â€”Aiden 14:17, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Many editors do this all the time. The talk pages are meant for discussing the editorial process and not meant for dumping/promoting personal opinions and websites. Per WP:NOT no part of Wikipedia is, although on personal talk pages this is usually allowed. Without bold editors all article's talk pages would eventually clog. Please refrain from making unfriendly allegations. Remember, I challenged you to provide one policy that underwrites that any text unrelated to the editorial process on talk pages should be kept there. So far you have not delivered. You only made new accusations. gidonb 16:43, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I, personally, have no problem keeping the post above. Just like its important to have the 911 conspiracy folks, neo-nazis, and every other group <b>express their opinion</b> on what should or should not be included in an article and what sources are relevant. I have been in debate with another user who says ALL of Wikipedia should be NPOV, while I say that talk pages are the EXACT place where ALL aspects of the article should be discussed and by that very nature, POV/opinion is going to come out. SO WHAT?? I don't support personal attacks, spam, <b>AGENDAS</b> or hmmmm, what else?? Anyways, you think Goldstein wasn't a massacrer/terrorist since he was stopping a planned attack or he did a pre-emptive strike or whatever, very good. Make your points, provide reliable sources, don't do original research, keep it civil, gain consensus and carry on.

<dd>Were you referring to my comments as positive?? After reflecting some more, this project is TRYING to be an encyclopedia of sorts. Way too many "hot" topics, ie Bush, 911, Arab vs Jew, ect, ect have turned into POV/soapbox central. I am VERY against censorship. But SOME type of moderation/mediation is important. IMveryHO, ANY defense of Goldstein's actions are VERY radical in view and DO NOT warrant the amount of talk page discussion that has gone on in here lately. The best example is the WTC Towers and how that talk page is trashed. I won't even go there. Again, what I was saying above in my first comment was that hearing from "radicals"(sorry but thats my opinion) helps show us the dangers that lurk out there. --<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 15:04, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simonschaim, this is totally getting out of hand. The text was allowed on the talk page, you received a reaction to your pov and now you insert a duplicate of the text? Isn't enough ever enough? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought, a soapbox, a free host, a blog, or an indiscriminate collection of information</a> <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 14:42, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dear Tom: The right to present a defense by (or on behalf of) ANY person being accused of perpetrating a crime is fundamental. I am sure that you will not find a single Judge in a democratic country describing this as radical (let alone VERY radical).Simonschaim</p>
<p>Dear Gidonb: Had you not from the outset kept on deleting my original item, the question of duplication would never have arisen. The best solution would have been for me to have yesterday deleted this particular talk item (i.e. "Should or should not ....") and replaced it with my original item. However this would have involved deleting comments of other users and this I am strongly opposed to. Simonschaim</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your opinion piece really does not belong here. All the comments except for one are copied from various talk pages into this page. All this is against our policies and simply <i>not done</i>. Your abuse of Wikipedia led to more abuse by you and may very well lead to abuse by others, since it is a precedent. Your misinterpretation of Tom's polite answer and Aiden's procedural disagreement for ideological support and your duplicate insertion of the text, prove to me that we should have been bolder in applying our relevant policies, not weaker. Please take your political debates elsewehere. We are not a forum, we do not want to become a forum and come to think of it, we are pretty bad at it too.

<p>I am going to remove some material, in the next days, from this article because I feel that it CLEARLY violates the above 3 Wiki policies. A link to a geocites web site is very questionable.

<dd>I'm not sure that the geocities site poses a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> problem. The website is by nature unreliable, but in this case it's merely an online version of a copyrighted book that Rabbi Simons wrote. The article appropriately presents this information as "a book by Kiryat Arba resident Rabbi Dr. Chaim Simons," not as objective fact. It is an effective representation of the pro-Goldstein view. On a side note, "Chaim Simons" is a fairly notable person, according to Google. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 17:47, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am sure that there are books denying the Holocaust, that doesn't mean we quote them or give them much credit in here. I am not sure if even one sentence is deserving for <b>speculation</b> about defending Goldstein's actions. The article says he never gave a reason for his actions.

See for yourself in the article on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>. The point is that as much as you disagree with something and consider it ridiculous, our job is to present both sides, no matter what. In this case, what is being presented is a claim made by supporters of Goldstein's actions. As speculative as it may seem, it is the view of a significant contingency of people that is being discussed in this article.--<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 22:27, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

When can do ALOT better, can't we? We DON'T present "both sides", we compile verifiable, sourced NON ORGINAL RESEARCHED FACTS. One fringe book doesn't cut it.

<p>I don't think it's <i>that</i> POV to say that he was an anti-Arab.

<p><i>Amir Oren, who subsequently became the military correspondent of Haaretz, provided the most complete story of Goldstein's relations with the Israeli army and the entire Israeli political establishment in his March 4 Davar article. According to Oren, after the 1984 elections and the subsequent formation of the national unity government, then Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and then Chief of Staff General Moshe Levy learned about Goldstein's refusal to treat non-Jews in Lebanon. Oren wrote:</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>When Goldstein's refusal to treat non-Jewish patients became evident to his commanders, both the artillery corps and medical corps commanders quite naturally wanted to court-martial him and thus get rid of him. They took it for granted that this could be easily done, because Goldstein had graduated only from the army's course for medical officers. [Goldstein did not have combat officer training, which is normally a prerequisite for admission to the course for medical officers.] <b>The two corps [commanders] also knew that Goldstein, while attending the army's course for medical officers, had become notorious as an anti-Arab extremist.</b></i></dd>

<p>"After being subdued with a fire extinguisher, Goldstein was beaten to death by Muslim worshippers, notably after his rifle had been taken from him. [3] Because of this, his official death certificate issued by the Israeli Ministry of the Interior lists the cause of his death as murder. [4]</p>

<p>Although the Israeli authorities know (via an Arab collaborator who was present that morning) the names of the Arabs who killed Goldstein, they were never brought to trial. [6]"</p>

It is clear from the text that he was <b>murdered</b> by definition (The <b>unlawful</b> killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice.) - this is a <b>fact</b>.

<dd>Of course he can't. As far as we know he was beaten when eh posed to change the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine_%28firearm%29.html" title="Magazine (firearm)">magazine</a>. Even if in retrospective it was possible to act otherwise, I don't think they could know this at the time. And anyway, it wasn't premeditated killing. It wasn't even as if he entered the place, and out of the blue they jumped on him and killed him. IT was after he shot to death more than 20 people.</dd>

<dd>Based on my own understanding of the terms, it would be reasonably justifiable to call Goldstein a "mass murderer" and much more difficult to justify calling him a "murder victim." But the description of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Category%7EIsraeli_mass_murderers_6c9b.html" title="Category:Israeli mass murderers">Category:Israeli mass murderers</a> describes the category as those "convicted of mass murder as Israeli citizens or permanent residents, by an independent court of justice. If they died while committing the act or shortly thereafter, a conclusion that they committed murder by the official inquiry (commission) of the relevant sovereign country will suffice for inclusion in this category." If the Shamgar Commission came to such a judgment, then that category would be completely justified; if not, it wouldn't. On the other hand, there seems to be no definition of what is included in the "murder victim" category, regardless of the circumstances. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:30, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I agree that he was a mass murderer, by any reasonable definition of the term. Despite your Columbine example, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_mass_murderers_e430.html" title="Category:American mass murderers">Category:American mass murderers</a> doen't specify inclusion criteria. The <a href="../../../i/s/r/Category%7EIsraeli_mass_murderers_6c9b.html" title="Category:Israeli mass murderers">Category:Israeli mass murderers</a> specifies that a determination must be based on an "official inquiry". Again, if the Shamgar Commission came to such a judgment, then by the definition of that category he would be a mass murderer. As to the suggestion that the immediate survivors of the mass murder were guilty of "murder" themselves based on their actions in trying to stop Goldstein from reloading his rifle and committing further murders seems entirely unreasonable. If anything, a claim of "murder" in this case seems even less justifiable than a case where passengers killed a fellow passenger who had tried to storm the cockpit of a Southwest Airlines flight in 2000, a year before September 11th, with no charges files against the passengers who had done the subduing (see <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_2000_Sept_18/ai_65282165" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_2000_Sept_18/ai_65282165" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> for details on this incident). <b>My Conclusion</b> - <i>Mass Murderer</i>, yes, if source is provided; <i>Murder Victim</i>, absolutely not. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:21, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New York connection</span></h2>
<p>Just read this article... And the Response section almost reads like a justification column! My specific point I wanted to bring up was the New York section under Response.. Reading through it and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Bridge_Shooting_e9bf.html" title="Brooklyn Bridge Shooting">Brooklyn Bridge Shooting</a> leads me to believe this section is a POV insert into this article to show how ugly the palestinians also are (na-na-na-nana). Perhaps I am missing something large, but I do not see any FACT related to a connection. The imam saying that Palestinians are suffering should come as no news to anyone and does not prove or show that the Brooklyn Bridge Shooting is a response to Baruch Goldstein or his actions. The source provided, <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/77" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/77" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, is pure speculation on this whole point. At best, I would like to see this whole section removed, at the least I would want to have added something like "It is theorized by <b>The Middle East Forum - Promoting American Interests</b> that (Brooklyn Bridge - Baruch Goldstein connection story)". Of course I am bringing it up here for fun and lively debate&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/c/e/User%7EMceder_5657.html" title="User:Mceder">Mceder</a> 12:36, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terrorist</span></h2>
<p>Noticing this edit war - Threeafterthree is indeed quite right that Goldstein can not be labelled a terrorist on Wikipedia until a reputable source is provided that calls him a terrorist, regardless how much Wikipedia editors wish to call him that. Please do not respond to this post with a long discussion. I do not care about your opinion on the subject, it is completely irrelevant to the article. A response should involve citing a <b>reliable source</b> says Goldstein was a terrorist. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 19:40, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even if a source is provided, it will only support the point-of-view of the source. According to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, we are not to advocate one point of view over another. Labelling someone as a terrorist via a Wikipedia category is in effect creating a list of people Wikipedia considers terrorists. This is a clear violation of that policy. â€”<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 20:09, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia cannot "consider" anyone "anything", because Wikipedia isn't a reliable source, nor are we a first-hand source. We can't just say "Oh, these are the people we have decided are terrorists, transexuals, Catholics, etc." because we don't have the power to make that call. What is needed, I guess, are <b>reliable</b> sources that indicate that Goldstein is widely considered a terrorist, which you may well be able to find. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 20:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>This guy is *not* being remembered for exceptional achievements as a physician. Virtually every other mass murderer (31 or so out of 34 in the <i>American mm</i> cat) has this type of lead.

<dd>I strongly disagree that virtually every other mass murderer has this lead. In fact, the converse is probably true. Timothy mcVeigh does not have such a lead. Kozo Okamoto does not have such a lead. Lee Boyd Malvo does not have such a lead. Terry Nichols does not have such a lead. Dalal Mughrabi does not have such a lead (this mass murderer has a lead that says "was lionized by Palestinian nationalists."!!).

<p>Isarig, you want to keep "a POV label" out of the lead, but instead introduce the most laden word in existence to describe the subject: Baruch Kappel Goldstein was an American-Israeli settler [...]. This is not a good edit. Here are some statistics about mass-murderers on Wikipedia and their lead sentence. The people you are reffering to are either convicted and/or living (McVeigh, Nichols, Malvo) or were connected to a militia (Okamoto), so the comparison to Goldstein does not make sense at all. The Mughrabi lionizing lead is ridiculous, btw. <b><a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosmopolis_4924.html" title="User:Kosmopolis">Kosmopolis</a></b> (<a href="../../../k/o/s/User_talk%7EKosmopolis_e454.html" title="User talk:Kosmopolis">talk</a>) 11:50, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
