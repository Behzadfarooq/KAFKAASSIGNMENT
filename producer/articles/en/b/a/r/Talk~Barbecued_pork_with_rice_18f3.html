<dd>(replying to Instantnood) Yes, the char siew in Malaysia and Singapore is indeed basically the same Cantonese fare that you can find elsewhere in the world. Char siew gets used differently in dishes many places in the world (char siew pizza, anyone?), but I suspect the actual char siew meat varies little from place to place.--<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 14:43, September 9, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks Yuje. I looked for pictures on Google by searching with "char siew rice", and they look quite different from those in Hong Kong.. say in Hong Kong the pork is served with honey sauce (mixed with soya sauce I guess), and in those pictures the rice looks like oily rice that served with Hainanese chicken rice.. I guess they are basically variants of the same thing, don't know if they would taste differently..&#160;:-P — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 19:49, September 9, 2005 (UTC)

You insist this is so, since every article in there is also appearing in somebody else's category. Now, you seem to be trying to dream up of enough reasons to create distinct articles for all food variants found in Hong Kong ever since the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milk_tea.html" title="Milk tea">Milk tea</a> episode.

<p>Is the 叉烧饭 in Singapore and Malaysia so different from the 叉燒飯/叉烧饭 in Hong Kong, Macau, Guangdong and the rest of southern China to merit separate articles? <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">User:Huaiwei</a> has so far been the only person having this view.

<dd>As I said many many times before, responsiblity is not the onus of the original content provider. Other users who attempt to restore edited material are sending a signal that they concur with the original content. Why else will they be reverting or editing here? My contention was with instantnood's two counts of reversions, and his attempts to counter my efforts to reduce bias in the article, and not merely on what was in the article prior to my first edit. If it was one reversion, I would perhaps pass it off as a case of a typical knee-jerk, mindless reaction on the part of instantnood as part of this daily "huaiwei edit reviewing exercise", but we are talking about <b>two</b> reversions here. Does he have any explaination for this behavior? Attempting to devert people's attention to <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakkwa.html" title="Bakkwa">bakkwa</a> does not absolve you from your misbehaviors in <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish_ball.html" title="Fish ball">Fish ball</a>, does not indicate the lack of "HK-centricness" in various articles I highlighted, and does not show any lack of the "You scratch my back I scratch yours" ethos on your part (and that of your cronies?).

<p>So I don't have to ban Instantnood and Huaiwei from another article I have decided to protect this page instead since a number of parties seem to be involved and this isn't a one on one with those two. First, let me say I cannot believe that such fighting occurs over a food dish!! This is absolutely ridiculous and some of you guys need to calm down, take a breath, and then discuss what you need to do on the talk page. Then, here's the fun part, step 2 is to <b>wait a day or two</b> to see what other people say about your proposal before you just institute it. It's called consensus building and if you folks can't build consensus on a food dish then we have some serious problems.</p>
<p>Please, for the sake of all concerned, calm down a minute, try to work together to make this a better article, that's the goal. When I think you've sufficiently calmed down or when you think you have then request unprotecting. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 10:30, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing. Just because someone writes an article from their experience and thereby POV doesn't make it wrong. If I write an article on Pizza it's going to have an inherent Chicago bias because that's where I'm from. When someone comes along and adds info about New York style pizza or traditional Italian pizza I don't get upset that someone is trying to ruin my article. Nor do they accuse me of writing a "Chicago-centric article" that is in drastic need of correcting. I wrote an <b>incomplete article</b> that needed some additional contributions to make it a better one.

<dd>Thanks so much Guy. I'd say what somebody had done was like a Chicagoan spliting the material of Chicago-style pizza to a separate article, after the pizza article she/he started was expanded by people from Italy, New York, London, etc. Thanks God both Italian and English use roman alphabets with no <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diacritics.html" title="Diacritics">diacritics</a>, and the word <i>pizza</i> is spelt in the same way across the ocean, and in both languages. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 20:16, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per the above, Huaiwei indicates he has no intention of stopping warring, in fact, he appears much more interesting in bringing up other arguments and other articles without any reference to this one. To me, this is the definition of "edit warring" when it's more about what happened on other articles than this article. So I am banning Huaiwei and unprotecting the article. I hope the remainder will work to produce a consensus on this article. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 01:48, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly protests this action on the part of Wgfinley. This is a discussion page, not the article page, and using my comments here as basis for a page ban is sending a message to everyone that perhaps all of us should stop using discussion pages least they be used as basis for administrative actions which are not fought over in the article itself? And I find it absolutely ridiculous for Wgfinley to say that I appear "much more interesting in bringing up other arguments and other articles without any reference to this one.", when the conversation he refers to was ignited by comments made by instantnood <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbecued_pork_with_rice&amp;diff=34805475&amp;oldid=33021528" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbecued_pork_with_rice&amp;diff=34805475&amp;oldid=33021528" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, which included the words "<b>A similar debate is around the Singapore-centric set up of the <i><a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakkwa.html" title="Bakkwa">bakkwa</a></i> article (see <a href="../../../b/a/k/Talk%7EBakkwa_69c5.html#Singapore-centric" title="Talk:Bakkwa">talk:bakkwa</a>)</b>" That he considers this evidence of "edit warring" on my part alone is completely baseless. Impartiality on the part of Wgfinley is sorely missed here, and I am inclined to think he is also reacting based on discussions taking place in <a href="../../../h/u/a/User_talk%7EHuaiwei_1532.html" title="User talk:Huaiwei">User talk:Huaiwei</a>.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 01:54, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As opposed to just banning on this page I protected it to give the parties involved a chance to work out differences. Instead of trying to work out differences you ranted about two prior articles (not just one), one of which (<a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish_ball.html" title="Fish ball">Fish ball</a>) the fight is well over 6 months old. This indicates to me that based on your warring on this article, and based on your comments here on the talk page and your own talk page that you are uninterested in stopping the edit warring. So, I have banned you from editing this article accordingly. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 02:13, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How then, would you consider Instantnood's efforts here as having "worked out differences"? How is it you have no comment on his initiation in bringing in the disputes over <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakkwa.html" title="Bakkwa">Bakkwa</a> into this page and ranted on Singapore-centricism? A simple look at the edit histories shows that prior to your protection, instantnood was very active in revert warring. How is it that you could make this assumption that I will revert war, while assuming good faith in your advocacy? I am sorry, but if you are serious about showing your impartiality, is this the way you do it?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 03:24, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In all due respects, I think we should ban Instantnood as well. I mean Huaiwei can't exactly edit war by himself; Instantnood clearly edit warred with him on 8/9 January. I think it is better if he doesn't edit this page without discussion here first. As an admin, I can impose such a ban, but I will defer to the opinion of Wgfinley. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 23:06, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I tried to cut them a break on this one, protect the page and see how it would go -- Instantnood stated on this page that he would try to comport his behavior, Huaiwei did not. I'm not looking to drag other articles. It's simple -- I gave them a break, one of them said he would try to comply (and I am <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> and assuming he intends to) and Huaiwei said he would not do likewise and brought other articles into it.

<dd>He <b>said</b> he will comply, while I failed to comment on it (I did not say I will). Based on this, you are presuming he will not revert war, while I will, and to actually ban me based on a prediction that I will revert war? Are you thus saying everyone must say in the respective talk pages that they will "not revert war", failing which a ban will be imposed? With all due respect, but since when is wikipedia administrative action based on such presumptions, verbal vows that mean nothing and curry-flavouring comments in your talkpages or anywhere else?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 06:20, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
