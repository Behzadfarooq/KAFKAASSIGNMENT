<p>So all this discussion has been fun and everything, but I came here to create an encyclopedia. At this point, the discussion has gotten incredibly repetitive (and mindblowingly, there are still requests for editors to repeat themselves), it's mostly about who said what instead of the article, and I don't think anything is really getting accomplished. So I'd like to make a concrete proposal. At some point this article will be unprotected, and it wil be edited. We all need to collectively decide what those edits will be. Here's what I propose, in roughly this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the reference/link to bonussugar.blogspot.com. There's a clear consensus that it's not a reliable source.</li>
<li>Add sources (reliable ones other than bonussugar) to each graffiti item for which they are available. I'd recommend putting the {{fact}} tag on all that do not have a reliable source.</li>
<li>Once sufficient time has been given to add sourcing info, delete all graffiti items which are unsourced (I assume adding sources shouldn't take more than a day or two, the page being locked doesn't stop people from looking for sources).</li>
<li>Once all graffiti items have been sourced or deleted, we can see which and how many there are. At that point it can be debated whether they are notable/trivial/whatever and how many should be included, whether all sourced ones should go in or just a selection, whether it should be a list or mentioned in the text, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd like to get a reaction to this proposal, counterproposals etc. I think the key here is to focus discussion on what should be in the article. I also think it might be more clear to handle the various elements separately instead of arguing everything at once. I recommend we reach consensus agreement on a course of action, and at that point request the page be unprotected. I realize that some may disagree with the consensus we reach and may even revert war over it, if that happens we deal with the disruptive editors. Let's try and bring this to some sort of conclusion. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 23:45, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I interpreted the discussions as finding the merits of the blog to be wanting, using RS as a guideline to come to that decision (as well as soiciting opinion at other venues). I know you disagree with the consensus but it is wrong to say there was no discussion. Also, I think if you read the proposal above it does not abandon discussion, in fact, it seems to be a starting point for discussion. In this case discussion would focus on each graffiti tag and the sources that are available for each. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 07:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have just submitted a request for unprotection, per this proposal. Assuming it is unprotected, I'd like to encourage all editors to use clear edit summaries (referencing policy and this talk page where appropriate), to give the other side the opportunity (time) to make edits and respond to changes, and if a revert war breaks out revert once to the consensus version and if further reverts are needed, give others a chance to make those reverts. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:11, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, lets talk about this. "the source matches the claim" Where does this come from? Well, it's a corollary to "Exceptional Claims require exceptional evidence." However, in this situation that argument is inapplicable. It would require us to accept the premise that the source had a minimal level of reliability in the first place. You keep bringing it up over and over, but it's totally irrelevant. "Oh, yeah, the info is so unimportant we don't need a source!"

<p>(:edit conflict) No, and as recently pointed out again on RS, sources are considered on a case by case basis, on a number of criteria. In this case, the source matches the claim because a language expert is verifying graffiti. (If we wanted to verify a climatological claim, we'd want a climatologist. If it was a new scientific theory that changed everything accepted about climate, we'd want more than one climatologist, peer reviewed journal.

<li>If the source is not reliable then the claim is hollow (consensus is that the source is unreliable, see above).</li>
<li>Another approach is, even if the source is reliable, but the ONLY source available, treat it with suspicion, especially if it is on blogspot (that is why WP:RS mentions third party sources).</li>
<li>Alternatively, if there is only one source then it is hard to see how it could be notable. Especially since the notable graffiti, according to slingshot, was the dialog not the graffiti tags.</li>
<li>And my relevant red herring, as you like to call it; reliable sources are not blogs that conveniently appear during the talk page discussion.</li>

<dd>Cindery, are these strawman arguments intentional? We know they are examples of graffiti, but why are they notable, slingshot does not imply that the graffiti tags are notable. Forget the general graffiti and discusss the specific graffiti. Where are the mutliple sources for the JD graffiti? If you can produce them there is no argument here. The fact that you refuse to cite these mutliple sources is revealing. Which pages in the Green Book? You implied above that they are in there. If not there, where? At present we have one source (too convenient to be trusted) and no claim for notablility. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 06:52, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you're misreading that JD/JC is not the only person to note specific graffiti--there are now three sources. (The "graffiti in general" has been established, but provides context for JD as reliable source--JD is not noting something in specific which does not have an established context.) "Strawman" is not civil, nor does it make any sense. I told you your "too convenient" was irrelevant, and I notice you were told that on ANI as well. "Notability" is a red herring which has been addressed multiple times now--the graffiti are examples, not personages which must meet a notability standard.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 06:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are two other sources for the JD graffiti tags? Which ones? Or do you mean there are two other sources that mention graffiti but not the specific examples cited by JD?</dd>
<dd>Well if there is no context for the JD tags I still wonder why they are important for the article. By the way, why can't the SF Chronicle graffiti tags be used instead to the JD tags? Then you could have some examples, if you feel that is really necessary, and at least we have a standard source for those.</dd>
<dd>When I outlined the scenario on WP:AN (not ANI) I did not mention names, I was soliciting opinions, do you think I misrepresented the situation? I tried to be decribe it objectively. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 07:05, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflict) Oh no, I think titling it "Gaming the system" was completely impartial and accurate.&#160;:-) The point I made though, is that you were told your "too convenient" accusation was "irrelevant," and yet you still bring it up. Re JD--I think you're misunderstanding: there is context for JD (graffiti in general was significant; that was established) and there are three sources for graffiti in specific (including JD). As noted above, the SFC <i>is</i> one of the sources.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 07:11, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The title was to attract attention, but you're right it does imply a lack of good faith, I do admit that. The reason the "too convenient" is irrelevant is becuase blogspot sources were dismissed without discussion.

<dd>Blogs come in many forms and JD's happens to be at blogspot. I would say I have a IDONTTRUST bias. I think this is a justified bias when it is the only source, only one entry AND on blogspot. Why not do a straw poll with random wikipedians, I'm betting it will be in the 90 percentile with respect to people that don't trust that specific trifecta for a source. Hopefully that will help you understand the context of my comment above.</dd>

<p>(undent) It's not the only source for graffiti in general <i>or</i> graffiti in specific--it's one of many sources. It's an offshoot which functions as a kind of subpage of Sugarhigh! which is hosted by abstractdynamics, under the registered domain www.janedark.com. Polls are not consensus, and would not further the discussion of: the source matches the claim. You clearly stated that you "draw the line" at blogs. Wikipedia does not. Your bias against blogs is your problem--no one has to justify blogs in general to you. I'm glad we identified the problem.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 08:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This dialogue has become increasingly ridiculous, but "You have to engage in discussion to gain consensus" takes the cake. I can't imagine how a sane person would look at the hundreds of posts on this page and insist that discussion hasn't been engaged in. "Source matches the claim" does not need to be refuted because it's not policy, it appears nowhere in RS or anywhere else. I don't believe it deserves to be dignified with a response. In fact, I don't think there's any point in discussing "bonussugar" <i>at all</i> any more since we've decided it's not a RS and doesn't belong in the article, not to mention that everything being said about it has been said many times already. The repetitive nature of the debate indicates that discussion has exhausted itself and it's time to take action. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 13:21, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And as I have said repeatedly now, bonussugar doesn't de facto fail RS--it has to be disussed per multiple criteria. Citing RS is not an argument. Repeatedly stating that it de facto fails RS and you have "consensus" on that is not discussion of a specific source in context. If you feel there's no point in discussion and that all you have to contribute is incivility like "I don't beleive it deserves to be dignified with a response" feel free to take action to exercise your right to leave instead of engaging in discussion.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 15:28, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The "counterproposal" is Wiki policy for content disputes: discussion. Discussion isn't determined by "voting," and in any case it's 3 v. 3 for leaving the graffiti list.

<dd>It's not "3 v. 3 for leaving the graffiti list." It's unanamity-less-one for <i>removing</i> them not if sourced within a few days—sourced to a reliable source which specifically does not include bonussugar. They are to be "left" for a few days only, during which they are to be marked as needing citations. It seems to me that you have a pattern of confidently stating things you say are "agreed to" that appear to be highly optimistic personal inferences or reinterpretations of what has actually been said. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:56, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The source matches the claim. Is that not sufficient? We have been emphatic about the fact that the grafitti is a very important aspect to any article about Barrington Hall.

I am personally of a mind that there are some types of information that naturally fall outside of the requirement for a source. If I were to call Mardi Gras "colorful," would you insist that I source it? Well - you are insisting here, and Cindery and I have responded. This is beginning to feel like goalpost moving. I worry that in addition to being "anti-blog" and especially "anti blogspot.com blogs" some of you are working from a position of "anti grafitti" and possibly "anti Barrington." --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 16:37, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(conflict)It is irrelevant whether or not you see the proposal as flawed. It is a proposal that 6 editors support vs your opposition. Regardless of your opinion of the proposal, it has overwhelming support from the majority of those involved in this debate. The proposal doesn't say that the bonussugar link is a defacto failure of RS, it says there is clear consensus that it doesn't pass RS (as supported by the 6 editors). As I have said before, please provide new arguments as your old ones are not well supported and the majority of people here do not support them. Re-using them again and again is getting no-where.</dd>
<dd>In response to astanhope - it is irrelevant whether or not the source matches the claim - the majority of the people here do not feel that bonussugar is a good enough source. Your comment about whether or not a source is needed is true - some things don't need sources (like saying that water is wet, tree's grow in the ground etc...) but something like a description like 'colourful' for the mardi gras depends on the context and all of this is completely irrelevant.</dd>
<dd>I know that for myself, I do not like the use of blogs that fail our reliable source guidelines (and therefore fail the verifiability policy) in articles.

<p>In reply to Cindrey, There has been discussion, MUCH discussion about the merits of the source, in multilpe locations: talk:RS, WP:AN and here. We don't need to have a unanimous decision to move on. As far as i can tell the majority think the JD blog source is not reliable when considering four different factors. It is the only source, the blog only has one (new) entry, is on blogspot and there is no claim to notability for these specific graffiti tags. This is reasoning, it has been discussed but you choose to ignore it. Ignoring the arguments and inferring that the decision is solely "<i>based on flawed propositon that the source de facto fails RS</i>" is illogical. You may disagree with the arguments but you cannot claim that arguments were not discussed. Worse is you argument from authority that seems to be your last resort having failed to win consensus on whether the JD blogspot is a RS. You are now trying to imply that only editors that have made significant contributions to the article should be given due weight. This is a clear misinterpretation of the "it is not a vote philosophy" to try force your hand. Most would consider an outside view to be more objective in a case such as deciding if a source is reliable or not. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 16:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict) Localzuk, thanks for the revert, but I don't think it's necessary to remove the San Francisco Chronicle reference. I also think as a show of good faith it would be good to leave any additions or swaps to the graffiti list (although any new ones should have a FACT tag if they don't have a reference), at least for the short term. I'd recommend providing the opportunity to put citations on items in the list so we can all see which and how many actually have reliable sources, and at that point move on to a discussion of which (if any) should remain in the list.</dd>
<dd>Cindery, I'm glad to see you adding references to the article.

<dd>(edit conflict) There are two objections 1) the format for inline cites of quotes will be links, not footnotes, per me. 2) not everything needs an inline cite, esp. as the Green Book would have to be cited so many times, is not paginated in its online form,and many of the sources are newspaper sources which aren't online, so inline cites for them wouldn't be to links.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 17:37, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is true. But as the article stands, there is no citation within the article text itself. So it can be debated that no "system" was chosen at all.

<p>Personally, I would be in favour of moving as many of the references to the text in the form of in-line references as possible. Is the Green Book really used as source 30 times (got his number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cindery&amp;diff=102969475&amp;oldid=102968174" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cindery&amp;diff=102969475&amp;oldid=102968174" rel="nofollow">from Cindrey's talk page</a>)? Here we have two possible strategies. Cite each page of the pdf file that are available on the web (similar to <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosalind_Franklin_d587.html" title="Rosalind Franklin">Rosalind Franklin</a>) page. Cite Green Book as a general ref below the inline refs unless it is used for very specific citations such as for the graffiti tags. The Rosalind Franklin approach is a little too much like overkill for me. I would be happy to cite the green book as a general reference after notes. Any other sources that would be better suited as a general reference rather than an in-line reference? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 20:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, if the greenbook is the sole citation for an entire section then we only need to cite it once.

<p>I think we should incorporate the sourced graffiti tags together in their own section or, possibly a better place, a subsection of the mural section. Guy deleted the graffiti tag section and this was not really a good faith edit given our proposal above. Hopefully when Cindery returns she will have more sources too.

<dd>1) I don't think she will have more sources when she returns. She had ample opportunity to provide them in the last two or three weeks. She could have looked for sources then, but preferred to spend that time arguing that the existing sources were adequate. If I turn out to be wrong about this, I'll apologize.</dd>
<dd>2) I don't see why two graffiti need their own section.</dd>
<dd>3) Even the current source does no more than support the statements that "Every surface in Barrington was covered with psychedelic murals and layer upon layer of graffiti." It doesn't demonstrate that there was anything that would distinguish them from any of innumerable other vaguely-counterculture student environments that featured them. If the video didn't mention Barrington Hall, you would probably have no way to know that it wasn't filmed at, say, Butterfield B at Wesleyan<a href="http://www.wesleyanargus.com/article.php?article_id=3972" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wesleyanargus.com/article.php?article_id=3972" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<dd>4) I think a lot of this article skates on the border of vanity. Every college graduate has a tendency to think their own dorm had cosmic significance. I won't quarrel with anything that's actually sourced to a decent published source. But Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not an oral-history project for an alumni reunion. This article needs tightening, not expansion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:57, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've gotta agree with Dpb here... I tried realy hard to get Cindery to provide citations and it was like pulling teeth.</dd>
<dd>My preference is to have a few examples given <b>in prose</b> with some reliable sources to back them up. It's not significant enough to justify two whole sections.</dd>
<dd>As far as I've been able to discover, the only major real media attention Barrionton Hall got was a number of newspaper articles in the early 90s when police had to be called in to quell a riot and forceably evict a bunch of people. Oddly enough none of those three articles mention anything about graffiti... ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 22:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There were also some mentions from the late 80s when Barrington had a reputation as a "drug house", which took quite a lot considering how many drugs were floating around colleges in those days. I've been busy, but I know I can find *some* sources for those days. (Unfortunately, I tossed all my records from my days as USCA vice-president.) The graffiti wasn't terribly notable, except that it did really cover a huge amount of the graffitiable space in the building, and there was a house policy to keep a lot of it. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 23:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cindery has been blocked again and it's possible that this one may be long term if not permanent. I'd go ahead and edit the article based on what facts are available and not wait for her return. That probably means sourcing it as well as possible and deleting anything unsourced. By the way, you guys have done a great job with the article since it was unprotected, nice work. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, but I'm basically out of sources...

</ul>
<p>This is a sad case. Dave Ross recently dies of cancer. Some friends remember one of several movies he made while at Barrington Hall. He appears to be a fixture at bears games and his obit was even mentioned on the Radio for a game, so he must have had an impact in Berkeley. Nevertheless, I am unsure why this movie or Dave Ross are more notable than the hundreds of other alumni that passed through Barrington hall. Why should Dave Ross and his movie be mentioned in this article? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 17:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From what I understand it was a traditional movie played once a year at the Hall. I don't have any sources for that, so it might end up in the pile of "things that are neat historical facts we can't verify so we can't include". A link to the movie might be worth keeping... just because links are cheep and don't need to satisfy WP:V. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 18:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If that's the case, it might be appropriate if we can include a reliable source saying it was played every year there. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 18:18, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
