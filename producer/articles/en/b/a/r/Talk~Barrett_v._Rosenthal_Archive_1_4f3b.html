The 1964 NY "public figure" case has absolutely nothing to do with this case. It was not cited in Barrett v Rosenthal ... and the reason Barrett lost was NOT because he was a public figure. There were 5 other reasons that were clearly stated, and had these not been satisfied, then and only then would his public figure defense been the reason he lost. This is not my POV ... I have clearly enumerated the reasons he lost from the Court Opinion.</p>
<p>Even if Mr. Rubin believes he knows more than the seven justices of the Supreme Court of California, that certainly does not make it true.</p>

<dd>As usual, your conspiracy fantasies show through loud and clear above. Bowditch's list of Ragtag Posse members is a spoof. Many of those people are simply listed because they share common interests, and none of them are members of any actual "group" or "team" since it doesn't exist in reality. IIRC, the list has been longer. (Peter Bowditch added all the people who were included in the malicious prosecution filed (<a href="http://www.casewatch.org/civil/negrete/appeal.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.casewatch.org/civil/negrete/appeal.shtml" rel="nofollow">and dropped</a>) by Hulda Clark and her employed team.) Bowditch made the whole page as a spoof to tease people like you. Conspiracy theorists need content in their lives, so Peter was just being kind.....;-) Barrett has nothing to do with it, and it certainly isn't "his team", nor is he using anyone! Those are your conspiratorial fantasies. I can understand why Peter added you to the page, and I think it's terrible what your actions are doing to damage the case for women who have been injured by defective implants. They regret the day you ever heard of their plight.</dd>

<dd>I don't know where you ever got the idea that I might be or have claimed to be an "unbiased" person. Only people who are ignorant lack biases (and not always then!). You certainly aren't unbiased, so don't point fingers. What counts here is the actual edits. We try our best to keep our biases from showing, and when they do we should help each other in a congenial manner. That's what's great about Wikipedia. By requiring editors from opposing POV to work in a collaborative effort, we cover all the important aspects of a subject, and leave out the <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a>.</dd>

<dd>I really feel that Ilena is doing what you ask here, Fyslee. She is providing information on this talk page (which is relevant and entirely enilightening). What does it say about a person who creates a "satirical" website/organization whose only purpose is an entirely childish one. If I were you, I would petition to get your name taken off that list. It really damages your credibility to be associated with a site/org who actually takes the time to write <a href="http://www.ratbags.com/posse/songbook.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ratbags.com/posse/songbook.htm" rel="nofollow">peevish songs</a> about people they don't like. I've heard libel mentioned a lot in connection with Barrett, but up until now, I've never actually seen libel in practice (and oddly it isn't against Barrett but it is from the other side). Honestly, if I were you Fyslee, I would try to distance myself from that site as much as possible. It looks really bad for you.</dd>

<dd>Levine, you have made some very mature, sensible, and commendable suggestions. As far as Bowditch's site, the Rag Tag page was just a spoof unrelated to any lawsuit, although names were later added from one case - the Clark malicious prosecution case. He's a bit rough in his criticisms and uses a lot of sarcasm, but then he doesn't pretend to meet any other standard. Not my style or Barrett's. It's a mixed bag of extremely serious stuff, and a spoof once in awhile. His biggest peeve is the anti-vax movement, where he monitors the sufferings (and even deaths) of their own children, and that's enough to get any parent really riled up. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 21:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excuse me if this in not where this belongs.</p>
<p>I am posting here Polevoy's refusal to our "mutual walk-away" and our offer to him. What is notable, is that Polevoy has maintained on his website that I had "no intention of settling" while anyone can clearly see this is false. Please note that one of their publicists, Nidiffer, posted false information as to the outcome on this case publicly.</p>

<p><br />
Dear Ms. Rosenthal:</p>
<p>Again, thank your for your message about settling. I am sorry you had trouble reaching me, but the virus problem has forced many people to change their e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>I am sincerely interested in settling, but any settlement would have to have two elements:</p>
<p>1. It would have to include a release of Dr. Barrett and Mr. Grell. 2. It would have to include a public acknowledgement that there is no police report that I stalked any women (as stated in the message you posted that triggered this whole nasty business).</p>
<p>Without both of these, we will proceed to trial.</p>
<p>cc: Mark Goldowitz, Chris Grell, Dr. Stephen Barrett</p>
<p>Terry Polevoy, MD</p>
<p>P.S. I was informed that if you did not hear back from me that you would post your letter on Usenet. It is really unfortunate that you would even consider doing this, because this would be the wrong thing to do.</p>

February 14, 2004

Dear Dr. Polevoy:

Today I received a personal email from Dr.  Barrett
with his view of the case.

Your attorney, Mr. Grell,  has also contacted me
personally by email expressing his opinions.

In turn, I am extending the same courtesy to you so
that I can be absolutely certain that you understand how we perceive the situation. Mr. Goldowitz has 
conveyed our letter of a mutual walkaway to Mr. Grell, but I have no way of  knowing what Mr. Grell relayed to you.

Further, although the Appeals Court vacated their
opinion as to you (only)  several months ago, and a new opinion and addendum were filed in our case with substantially different facts, I note that your website has not been updated to reflect the actual status of our case.

In fact, Ted Nidiffer using the alias of “Nana Weedkiller” recently posted  that I had lost this case and owed money, which we all know is absolutely not true.

For your benefit, I  am enclosing a copy of Mr. Goldowitz’s letter of 
January 26, 2004 which explains why we believe it is in your interest to  settle the case with me now.

Because both of your co-plaintiffs have lost their cases, may face malicious  prosecution charges, and have large money judgements against them with no  bargaining chips, their attempts to tie your
settlement to their losses now  has no benefit to you.

My attorneys are currently  preparing our petition to the California Supreme Court as discussed below, and even your lawyer has
indicated that they will likely grant our petition.

Although the deadline has already expired, for the
sake of full mutual  understanding and a mutually beneficial resolution to the dispute between  us, I have extended the deadline.

It is now 12:00 PM, Pacific Time, Monday, February 16, 2004 for you or your  counsel to notify us that you agree to the mutual release of all claims that  you and I have against each other.

Sincerely,
Ilena Rosenthal

Mark Goldowitz, Director

As Arthur Rubin calls himself a "Wikipedian against quackery" ... his bias is apparent and his attempts to change the facts of this case to make the losing plaintiffs look better is glaring.</p>
<p>The lower court ruled in this case, that what is and what is not quackery is an opinion, not the dominion of Stephen Barrett and his many quacky front groups and supporters.</p>
<p>As I previously noted, Polevoy has lied continually about the settlement offer and I posted verbatim the correspondence. You call this into question apparently and dispute this because it shows your bias and attempts to bury the facts of this case.</p>

<p>Calling a suspended California Corporation with no evidence of legal status in any other state, (despite repeated unanswered questions of the officers, "questionable" is totally valid.</p>
<p>Who are you Ronz? It is possible you are Stephen J. Barrett himself.</p>
<p>I've had .... followed my ISP's around and the 3 of you attempting to get me thrown off of Wikipedia, so it would enlightening to know who you are. Barrett published his affinity for "assumed names" when he published this piece in the AMA News:</p>
<p>Quoth Stephen J. Barrett, writing in AMA News on August 25, 1975, describing the Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud:</p>
<p>"By working "undercover" using assumed names and box numbers, we've gotten all sorts of information and publications other groups, like the medical societies, haven't been able to lay their hands on.</p>
<p>...Really, we're a bunch of guerrillas - we're not a large group, there are about 40 members, but we're the only such group in the country."</p>
<p>I am creating a page on my experiences here in Wikipedia in the event that Barrett's teammates manage to censor me here. Ronz yesterday posted on this page an spamlink to Barrett's questionable NCAHF, yet I am not allowed to post my link to explain who I am. 18:57, 11 December 2006 (UTC)18:57, 11 December 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> (<a href="../../../i/l/e/User_talk%7EIlena_10cb.html" title="User talk:Ilena">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ilena_da18.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ilena">contribs</a>).</small></p>
