Frank Lloyd Wright</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright is America's best known architect. Born in 1867, he lived to be 91, and enjoyed a career that lasted nearly as long as his lifetime. Some prime examples of his work include the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prairie_School_1408.html" title="Prairie School">prairie houses</a>, the <a href="../../../s/2E/_/S._C._Johnson_%26_Son_d88a.html" title="S.

Wright was often absent duing the actual construction of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyhock_House_b597.html" title="Hollyhock House">Hollyhock House</a>, due to the demands of another major commission, the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Hotel_fd5f.html" title="Imperial Hotel">Imperial Hotel</a> in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo%2C_Japan_fec7.html" title="Tokyo, Japan">Tokyo, Japan</a>. Therefore, he entrusted supervision of the Barnsdall project to two young men who would later rank among Los Angeles's most prominent architects: his apprentice, <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_Schindler_2c1a.html" title="Rudolph Schindler">Rudolph Schindler</a> and his son, <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_Wright_9a9a.html" title="Lloyd Wright">Lloyd Wright</a>.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the area's mild climate, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyhock_House_b597.html" title="Hollyhock House">Hollyhock House</a> is a combination of house and garden. It is a remarkable example of the architect's love of nature and how he incorporated it into his designs. The House takes its name from the favorite flower of Wright's client, oil heiress Aline Barnsdall. At her request, Wright's abstract hollyhock pattern was incorporated into the decoration of the House.</p>

The Hollyhock House at Barnsdall Park</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Aline Barnsdall was an unconventional independent woman with a passion for the arts. In 1915 she commis¬sioned Wright to help her develop an innovative theatrical community on the nation's cultural frontier. Selecting a thirty-six acre site known as Olive Hill, client and architect worked together to develop a plan that included a home for Barnsdall and her young daughter, two secondary residences, a theater, a director's house, a dormitory for actors, studios for artists, shops and a motion picture theater. Because of financial and artistic differences, only the two secondary residences and the Barnsdall home, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyhock_House_b597.html" title="Hollyhock House">Hollyhock House</a>, were finally built.</p>
<p>In 1927 Aline Barnsdall gave Hollyhock House and eleven surrounding acres to the City of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> for use as a public park in memory of her father, Theodore Barnsdall. Today, surrounded by a modern theater, galleries, and studios, Hollyhock House comes closer than ever before to realizing its original purpose as the centerpiece of a functioning arts complex. The House attracts thousands of visitors annually, who come from around the world to acknowledge its place in the cultural and <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architectural_history.html" title="Architectural history">architectural history</a> of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery is a 10,000 <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_foot.html" title="Square foot">square foot</a> venue that offers dramatic exhibition space for large, thematic group exhibitions that are representative of the current endeavors of area artists, and major retrospective exhibitions of work by individuals who have made an extraordinary contribution and impact on art in Los Angeles. The Junior Arts Center Gallery is a 2,000 square foot venue that offers a more intimate space for oneperson exhibitions by mid-career artists who have produced a significant body of high quality work, as well as smaller thematic group shows. At times the two spaces are linked by a single, large scale exhibition occupying both galleries.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery of Barnsdall Park are dedicated to the presentation, interpretation, documentation, promotion, and enrichment of the arts and artists of the culturally diverse Southern California. As the city's primary exhibition venue, the gallery is devoted to the exhibiting emerging, mid-career, and senior artists from the area, in group and individual presentation formats. The curatorial focus includes painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, video, installation, design, and related disciplines that reflect the architectural fabric of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.</p>
<p>The ongoing mission is to provide college level studio arts which are taught by artist/instructors who are professional artists.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnsdall_Art_Park_4d8f.html" title="Edit section: Exhibitions program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Exhibitions program</span></h4>
<p>The exhibitions program at Barnsdall Park produces approximately nine exhibitions of contemporary art each year at the Municipal Art Gallery. The mission of the program is to promote, interpret and present to the general public, the contemporary art of artists from culturally diverse Southern California. The curatorial focus includes painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, design, video, electronic, performance and installation works. Exhibits at Barnsdall Park serve over 45,000 visitors annually.</p>
<p>Exhibitions at the gallery are developed and produced by the curatorial staff, who often work with guest curators to insure a diversified curatorial perspective. The curators work with advisory input from the gallery's Artist Advisory Committee and the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery Associates Program Committee. These committees each meet six times a year with the curatorial staff to discuss issues, evaluate current exhibitions, and preview the development of future exhibitions. While the Gallery Associates raises funds to support the Exhibition and Education Programs at the gallery, the Associates Program Committee also seeks to develop and produce ancillary programs such as films, lectures and symposia.
