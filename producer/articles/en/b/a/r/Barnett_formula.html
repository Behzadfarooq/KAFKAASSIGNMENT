<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnett_formula.html" title="Edit section: How the formula works">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How the formula works</span></h2>
<p>Barnett consequentials are calculated to ensure that a particular change in public expenditure in one geographical area leads to a change in public expenditure in others which are proportionate to population in the different areas. It is not applied to all public expenditure, but it remains a default option unless other decisions are made. A decision to change expenditure in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> will lead to Barnett consequentials in Northern Ireland; a change in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_and_Wales_a031.html" title="England and Wales">England and Wales</a> to Barnett consequentials in Northern Ireland and Scotland; and a change in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> to Barnett consequentials in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>Simply put, any increase (or decrease) each year in public expenditure is to be distributed evenly across the home nations, in proportion to their population at that time. Expenditure is allocated en bloc, not per-service (health, transport, etc.) and this gives the devolved executives the opportunity to reallocate funds between services to suit their needs. The formula does not reallocate existing expenditure, merely any changes made that year.</p>
<p><a name="Proportional_to_population" id="Proportional_to_population"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnett_formula.html" title="Edit section: Proportional to population">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proportional to population</span></h3>
<p>At the introduction of the formula in 1978, Scotland benefited from higher expenditure per head, as a result of the legacy of the 1888 Goschen formula (introduced by chancellor <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Goschen_082d.html" title="George Goschen">George Goschen</a> as part of the proposals for Irish Home Rule), which originally allocated 80% of funding to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_%26_Wales_99c5.html" title="England &amp; Wales">England &amp; Wales</a>, 11% to Scotland, and 9% to Ireland. This was later adjusted to calculate the funding in terms of the English amount instead of the overall total, thereby fixing the Scottish share at 11/80th of the total (13.75% of the English amount).</p>
<p>By 1970, Treasury preparations for devolution meant that changes in the relative populations were examined. By then the relative populations were 85% England and 10% Scotland, meaning that the new Barnett formula was brought in fixing changes to Scottish expenditure at 10/85th of the change in England (or 11.76%), 2% lower than the amount that was being received.</p>
<p>The population percentages have been recalculated annually since 1999, and in 2002 the Scottish share was then set at 10.23% of the English amount, reflecting the lower population growth north of the border.</p>
<p>It was political unwillingness to manage the difficult task of making the big changes necessary to rebalance existing expenditure meant that the Barnett formula was applied, as has been stated, only to changes. This means that the Scottish 'advantage' is over time eroded. The initial baseline and non-formula adjustments are accountable for the current differences in per-capita spending. As new expenditure is added in proportion to population the differences in the baseline become less and less important. Thus the formula acts to bring each home-nation's share in line with the relevant share of the population (the so-called 'Barnett squeeze'). The greater the spending increases, the quicker the adjustment. In Scotland, falling population numbers counteract the 'squeeze'.</p>
<p>Details of the funding arrangement can be found in <a href="../../../h/m/_/HM_Treasury_81f1.html" title="HM Treasury">HM Treasury</a>'s <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/documents/public_spending_and_services/devolve/pss_devolve_devolveUK.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/documents/public_spending_and_services/devolve/pss_devolve_devolveUK.cfm" rel="nofollow">Statement of Funding Policy</a>.</p>
<p>However, the continuing distribution of a per-capita amount to each devolved areas higher than that allocated to England still continues to attract calls for the formula to be re-negotiated. Using figures from the financial year 2003/2004 (source: <a href="../../../h/m/_/HM_Treasury_81f1.html" title="HM Treasury">HM Treasury</a>, <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/economic_data_and_tools/finance_spending_statistics/pes_publications/pespub_index.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/economic_data_and_tools/finance_spending_statistics/pes_publications/pespub_index.cfm" rel="nofollow">Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (PESA)</a>), if a UK-wide per-capita average was a notional 100% then identifiable per-capita expenditure on services was 96% and the Scottish amount 119%. Wales was 112%, Northern Ireland 129%. This comprises all expenditure that can be identified as being to the benefit of a particular country and includes more spending categories than the devolved spending (like spending on pensions and job seekers allowance).</p>
<p>In actual monetary figures, that works out as (per person):<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>England £5,940</li>
<li>Scotland £7,346</li>
<li>Wales £6,901</li>
<li>Northern Ireland £7,945</li>
</ul>
<p>As these regional variations were not ever a consciously decided policy of the Treasury or Parliament this has been cited as a reason for reform. However, as noted earlier these differences are eroded by time, and at current rates of growth in public expenditure they should disappear in thirty years.</p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnett_formula.html" title="Edit section: Based on 'need'?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Based on 'need'?</span></h5>
<p>Naturally, as further noted below, there is no account made of the amounts raised by taxation in each of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_nations.html" title="Home nations">home nations</a>, nor the relevant 'fiscal need' (based on factors such as sparsity of population, cost of travel, unemployment rates, and health factors) in each area. The Barnett formula however never claimed to address these issues, and was a basic calculation on the basis of proportions of the population.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Government's official measures of fiscal need (including the age distribution of the population, road lengths, recorded crimes and numbers of sub-standard dwellings) clearly show a per capita need in Wales far higher than that of Scotland, yet the Barnett formula allocates the higher amount to Scotland.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lord Barnett himself viewed the formula that he devised as unfair. In <i>The Scotsman</i> in January 2004 he wrote "It was never meant to last this long, but it has gone on and on and it has become increasingly unfair to the regions of England. I didn't create this formula to give Scotland an advantage over the rest of the country when it comes to public funding."</p>
<p>According to <i>Scotland on Sunday</i><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>, moving to a 'needs based' allocation of government finances would cost Scotland around £2.5 billion a year. On the other hand, the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audit_Commission_afc2.html" title="Audit Commission">Audit Commission</a> (for England and Wales) concluded in a 1993 report that 'needs assessment can never be perfect or fair.'</p>

<p>In addition the Barnett formula would not be practical in a system of English regional assemblies, meaning that if such a proposal were to be resurrected a new system of financial allocation would have to be devised.</p>
<p><a name="Controversy" id="Controversy"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnett_formula.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>The Barnett formula is widely recognised as being controversial, though there is no consensus on how to change it.</p>
<ol>
<li>It takes no account of different needs or different costs in different areas.</li>
<li>It does not affect existing levels of public expenditure, even if relative population shares change.</li>
<li>Since existing levels of public expenditure are not allocated in proportion to population, a particular expenditure decision will lead to different percentage changes in different areas.</li>
<li>It does not apply to divisions of expenditure between the different <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_England_a07f.html" title="Regions of England">regions of England</a>.</li>
<li>It takes no account of different amounts of tax paid in respect of different areas or of changes in these amounts.</li>
<li>Neither Barnett nor needs-based spending is incentive-compatible. Neither, that is, gives the territories an incentive to become economically efficient.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p><a name="The_English_complaint" id="The_English_complaint"></a></p>
<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnett_formula.html" title="Edit section: The English complaint">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The English complaint</span></h5>
<p>The perceived 'unfairness' of the Barnett Formula is often raised in association with the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Lothian_question_08ab.html" title="West Lothian question">West Lothian Question</a>. In the period since the establishment of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Parliament_4b1f.html" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish devolution</a>, the two issues are often grouped together as the 'English Question'.</p>
<p>Taxation and charges only applied in a single nation also affect the Barnett formula, and this has been controversial. In one example, the variable ('top-up') tuition fees introduced in England are counted as additional English public expenditure (as the extra income is spent by the universities) and therefore an equivalent amount from the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consolidated_Fund_a466.html" title="Consolidated Fund">Consolidated Fund</a>, paid for by UK-wide taxation, was transferred to the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Executive_a01e.html" title="Scottish Executive">Scottish Executive</a>. <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page5186.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page5186.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> It was argued that this meant that only the English paid tuition fees, and yet this money would be shared with the Scottish universities, despite Scottish students studying at those universities not having to contribute any extra.</p>
<p>In contrast to this, if the Scottish Executive were to use their tax-adjusting powers (often referred to as the 'tartan tax'), then the additional (or reduced) revenue would not be considered in any calculations by the Barnett formula of the block grant for Scotland.</p>
<p><a name="A_nationalist_viewpoint" id="A_nationalist_viewpoint"></a></p>
<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnett_formula.html" title="Edit section: A nationalist viewpoint">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A nationalist viewpoint</span></h5>
<p>The lack of legislative basis for the formula also troubles Scottish and Welsh Nationalists. The devolution legislation states that the Scottish (or Welsh) Secretary will make a grant of such monies as Parliament makes available. This is seen as relying too heavily on the goodwill of the Westminster Parliament, and impinging on the independence of the devolved Executives.</p>
<p>Scottish Nationalists have also pointed to what has been termed the <i>Barnett squeeze</i><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>. They say that rather than protecting the favourable spending position of Scotland, that instead the Barnett formula is a method to steadily erode that advantage. They point out that if a 4% increase is needed in expenditure to cover inflation, Scotland will only get an increase of 3% of its total budget, whereas England will get the full 4% (proportional to population share; however, both amounts will be equivalent). After inflation, this would mean a 1% budget reduction for the Scottish Executive.</p>
<p>Opponents of that view claim that these are not cutbacks, merely lower growth, and that spending convergence between the Home nations is not a policy objective of the current UK Government or Scottish Executive.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Options_for_change" id="Options_for_change"></a></p>
<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnett_formula.html" title="Edit section: Options for change">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Options for change</span></h5>
<p>The Barnett formula is a simple mechanism that is only loosely related to the actual need of the countries of the UK, based on the assumption that fiscal 'need' is related directly to population.</p>
<p>The formula does not provide for proper fiscal independence of the devolved governments. They still have to work within a total budget that is not of their choosing or under their control<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> (although the Scottish Executive do have limited tax-raising powers - the so-called 'tartan tax').</p>
<p>The Scottish <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_8c75.html" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> commissioned <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Steel_bdc6.html" title="David Steel">Lord Steel</a> to investigate what options existed for changing the present arrangement. The <a href="http://www.scotlibdems.org.uk/conference/steelcommissionsummary.html" class="external text" title="http://www.scotlibdems.org.uk/conference/steelcommissionsummary.html" rel="nofollow">report of the Steel commission</a> was published on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_6.html" title="March 6">6 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> and calls for greater fiscal powers for the Scottish Executive, similar to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Purse_agreement_0e79.html" title="Common Purse agreement">Common Purse agreement</a> that exists for the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Manx Government</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_National_Party_206a.html" title="Scottish National Party">Scottish National Party</a> has also called for 'full fiscal autonomy' or 'fiscal independence' for Scotland. The SNP do not accept arguments that Scotland has a fiscal deficit of expenditure over taxation.</p>
<p>Given worse public health and greater rurality, and in the case of Northern Ireland greater security concerns, it would appear that the devolved governments will continue to rely on above average levels of per-capita expenditure.</p>
<p>However, it could be reasonable to give devolved parliaments and assemblies greater budget powers, and allow them the fiscal accountability to make the trade-offs between taxation and spending in whichever direction the voters of their nations demand.</p>
