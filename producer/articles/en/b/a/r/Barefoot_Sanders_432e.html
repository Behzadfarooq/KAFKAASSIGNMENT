Then I got a call from the president's plane, with the command</i> 'Find Sarah Hughes.' Coincidentally, Judge Hughes, Jan [Judge Sanders's wife], and I were supposed to go to Austin that night for a dinner for President Kennedy. I reached her at home and said, 'They need you to swear in the vice president at Love Field. Please get out there.' She said, 'Is there an oath?' I said, 'Yes, but we haven't found it yet.' She said, 'Don't worry about it; I'll make one up.' She was very resourceful, you know. By the time she got to the airplane, someone had already called it into the plane.

<p>Though Sanders handled thousands of civil and criminal cases during his tenure as a Federal Judge, he is best known in Texas for his role as judge in the <i>Tasby</i> litigation brought against <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Independent_School_District_0b7d.html" title="Dallas Independent School District">Dallas Independent School District</a> in the 1970s, in which plaintiff Sam Tasby charged that the DISD was still a segregated school district.</p>
<p>The litigation began before Sanders became a federal judge, but he took over the case until its conclusion in 2003, and had oversight of many Dallas ISD activities related to racial balance until that time.</p>
<p>Though the Tasby litigation was not the first desegregation lawsuit against DISD, it is the most famous.</p>
<p>Until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, Dallas was the largest city in the South with a segregated school system <a href="http://library.law.smu.edu/disd/background.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://library.law.smu.edu/disd/background.shtm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. That same year, the DISD school board implemented a desegration plan—the so-called "Stairstep Plan"—under order of the <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals_6c47.html" title="Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals">Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>. In september of that year, 18 black students started first grade classes in what had been whites-only institutions.</p>
<p>In spite of tremendous dissatisfaction with DISD and continual complaints by the Dallas <a href="../../../n/a/a/NAACP_cd86.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a>, DISD declared itself desegregated in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>.</p>
<p>Litigation that continued for three more decades proved that declaration inappropriate.</p>
<p>Sam Tasby filed a lawsuit against DISD charging discrimination prohibited under <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_v._Board_of_Education_9aee.html" title="Brown v. Board of Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_6.html" title="October 6">October 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. Federal Judge William M. Taylor presided over a trial of the case from <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_12.html" title="July 12">July 12</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, and ordered the school district to come up with a new desegregation plan, which the district published on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">July 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>.</p>
<p>Four years later, in July, 1975, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit_803a.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> rejected several parts of the plan and ordered a new desegregation plan implemented by January 1976. Other parties, including the NAACP, were added to the suit.</p>
<p>On February 2, 1976, Judge Taylor presided over a second desegregation trial, and by April, a new desegregation plan was issued. The Fifth Circuit rejected most of this plan as well. The most controversial part of this plan centered around <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busing.html" title="Busing">busing</a>, and Judge Taylor held an additional hearing on the case. Taylor removed himself from the case on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_21.html" title="March 21">March 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> to "avoid any further possibility that a desegregation plan might be overturned <a href="http://library.law.smu.edu/disd/background.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://library.law.smu.edu/disd/background.shtm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>," and the case was assigned to Judge Sanders.</p>
<p>After additional hearings, Sanders ruled that DISD continued to show signs of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a>, but concluded that <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busing.html" title="Busing">busing</a> would not solve the problem. He ordered parties to submit new <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desegregation.html" title="Desegregation">desegregation</a> plans, and then issued his own, ordering <a href="http://library.law.smu.edu/disd/background.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://library.law.smu.edu/disd/background.shtm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>:</p>
<p><i>"This Judgment constitutes the Desegregation Plan for the Dallas Independent School District ("DISD" or "the District") and is rendered pursuant to, and is to be construed in the light of and consistent with, (1) the Court’s Memorandum Opinion dated August 3, 1981; (2) the Stipulation dated December 1, 1981, and approved by the Court on December 2, 1981; and (3) the Court’s Memorandum Opinions and Orders dated December 7, 1981; December 21, 1981; January 4, 1982; and February 1, 1982. This Judgment supersedes the final judgment rendered by this Court in 1976. All programs provided for in this Judgment must be initiated by the beginning of the DISD 1982-83 school year, or sooner if feasible, unless otherwise herein provided."</i></p>
<p>The school district fought Sanders decision until August, 1983, when the Fifth Circuit upheld Sanders' plan; at that time, the DISD board of trustees unanimously accepted the court's decision.</p>
<p>DISD remained under Sanders' oversight until he declared it desegregated.</p>
<p>Decades of oversight finally came to an end in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, when Sanders ruled that DISD was no longer subject to his oversight and was desegregated<a href="http://library.law.smu.edu/disd/background.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://library.law.smu.edu/disd/background.shtm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>:</p>
