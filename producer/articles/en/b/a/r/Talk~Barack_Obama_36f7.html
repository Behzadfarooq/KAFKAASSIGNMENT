<p>Would the fascists who control this article allow some mention of his smoking habit? This been discussed quite a bit in the media and could become a campaign issue. Of course, if we want the article to remain an Obama advertisement, we might want to sweep his nicotine addiction under the rug. Ogeez 19:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's not very civil. A better way to describe it would be this: "Obama's cigarette smoking is getting increased press coverage lately and I think it merits mention in this article. I believe there was a poll out recently (the standard "Would you vote for a qualified _____ for president?" poll) which showed that a large percentage of people would not. I think this merits mention in the article." I would agree that it should go on his <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barack_Obama_presidential_campaign%2C_2008_5b57.html" title="Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008">campaign page</a>, but not here. The fact that Senator Obama smokes is not notable. The fact that it may affect his campaign, and that his campaign has responded with a "Quit Smoking With Barack" program, is. But not here. Lots of people smoke. <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykll42_ca06.html" title="User:Mykll42">Mykll42</a> 20:07, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So basically the answer is, "No, but we can stick it in an article that no one will ever read." Out of curiosity, does the Obama campaign have a full time staff of volunteers devoted to running this article? There's nothing to prevent that from happening. Given the way any mildly negative information gets suppressed, it wouldn't surprise me. The ironic thing is I think Obama would be better served by un unbiased account of his potential strengths and flaws. But I guess you would rather make this into a second Obama campaign web site. Maybe we should put up a link where people can make donations. Ogeez 22:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I personally don't think his being a smoker is negative information and I think his attempt to quit will strike a positive chord with the electorate. My problems with it are not the NPOV issues but the notability issue. About 25% of Americans smoke. I do agree that the election page could be more prominent. Oh, and I don't work for the Obama campaign. Please be civil. <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykll42_ca06.html" title="User:Mykll42">Mykll42</a> 22:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> Ogeez and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> of other editors. Referring to editors as "fascists" or accusing editors of working for Obama is not a good way to go about improving this article or any articles on Wikipedia. This article is NPOV and well referenced. It was even a featured article at one point. The Obama smoking issue is not relevant to his <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">BLP</a>. I understand he has recently quit (or is still currently trying to quit), and this fact may be relevant given that it's generated the note that it has (do a google search for Obama quit smoking if you must), but since he's decided to quit and there's not been any proof of him smoking since, calling him a smoker in this article would qualify as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which is not allowed. I know it may appear this article is biased in favor of him, but it has been strictly upheld and maintained per wikipedia policies. Obama just happens to not have generated a lot of negative note, (real) criticism, or (real) controversy.</dd>
<dd>It might help not to look at articles like "We need to have a balanced amount of positive and negative information in this article". Rather, look at it like "We need to use NPOV language/wording, and include relevant, notable information about this person/thing/place/idea in order to represent accurately the person/thing/place/idea we are writing an article about." --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 23:28, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just look back at the rest of this talk page. Every time something negative comes up, it is deemed "not notable." Yet the article includes shameless puffery such as: "The Washington Post noted his ability to work effectively with both Democrats and Republicans, and to build bipartisan coalitions." Is there any other politician who gets this type of treatment? I make no apologies for referring to the editors of this article as fascists, nor for accusing them of working for Obama. Just because they use polite language and come up with excuses like "undue weight" for rejecting negative information does not justify the ridiculous pro-Obama bias of this article. It's not like you're fooling anyone. People will come here looking for answers to questions like "Does he smoke?" or "Is he Muslim?" and instead see this puff-piece that refuses even to acknowledge these issues. Ogeez 00:13, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe because he isn't Muslim. It is clearly indicated in its own section that he joined the United Church of Christ in his 20s. The only issue I have is that more should be explained about how his mom disliked organized religion and his step-father was somewhat secular also. That would finally clear up the whole Muslim thing. But this is completely offtopic. As for on topic stuff, <a href="../../../s/m/o/WP%7ESMOKERS_5a99.html" title="WP:SMOKERS">WP:SMOKERS</a> clearly says quitting or smoking does not matter unless it plays an integral part of his life. Sure there are "multiple available citations" but that "does not mean it is notable for inclusion in a Wikipedia article." <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 00:23, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My mistake but I still don't think quitting smoking is important until he makes it important. He only seriously addressed it once and has not seemed to address it again. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 00:04, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok. You win. According to official Wikipedia policy, we are not allowed to mention the smoking habits of a guy who wants to be president of the United States and a role model for children. You guys certainly know Wikipedia policy better than I do. I'll give you that much. Maybe we could start a new policy on WP:How_his_parents_met that would say statements like this are not notable: "His parents met while both were attending the East-West Center of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was enrolled as a foreign student." Or is that more important that his smoking? Ogeez 00:39, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I'm going to ask you again to not call me a fascist. The object here is to create an encyclopedia article. Between 15-25% of Americans smoke. Barack Obama the Senator smoking is not notable. As an aspect of his political campaign, it is. I note you haven't added anything to the (unprotected, btw) campaign page, or its discussion page for that matter. If we were truly trying to remove negative information, don't you think his past cocaine use would be the first to go? <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykll42_ca06.html" title="User:Mykll42">Mykll42</a> 00:56, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>His smoking might not be notable, but his very public effort to <i>quit smoking</i> is. The Obamas have been very open about it, with countless reliable sources available. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaliavivi_ad2e.html" title="User:Italiavivi">Italiavivi</a> 02:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Winston Churchill smoked and drank regularly. Hitler did neither. The point being, smoking has nothing to do with leadership capacity and quality. 205.202.240.101 16:33, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with the above point.</p>
<p>Ogeez, the article is not "ridiculously pro-Obama biased". You're not doing anything to contribute to this article or wikipedia. You came to the wrong place if you were looking to smear a presidential candidate you don't like. The purpose of an encyclopedia is to include relevant, representative information about something. That's what this article does, and it's a fine example of a good article. The problem with including a lot of the "negative" information you want to be included is, none of it is notable. Read the policy. If he were to say something blatantly racist and there was a public reaction/outcry, such that it generated plenty of note, it would be included in this article, regardless of the political affiliations of the editors. But somehow I don't see him doing something like that, so people who see him as a threat will continue coming here to find out why his article is so "biased". --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 02:57, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it would be rad to include a fully contextualized discussion of Obama's smoking including the fact that individuals with lower incomes (working-class) are more likely to smoke than those with higher incomes. Also, why doesn't GWB's page list his cocaine use? Probably it's controlled by "fascists" as well. -- <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutumninjersey_b651.html" title="User:Autumninjersey">Autumninjersey</a> 18:00, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Smokin' Obama&#160;! Consider the moment when we first learned that Obama smoked. Did it skewer, however briefly, previous thoughts we held of him, whether yea or nay? Probably. Ok, certainly. Now, after becoming aware of such, did our opinions of him become sufficiently altered that our perception of the man took a new form? Probably, not. If we liked him, we continued to like him. If we didn't, then we continued to not. Net effect of all of this is that the smoking issue is, well, just that, an issue for each of us personally. But, is it an issue of encyclopedic proportion. History says no. Current events say yes. If we decide yes, given the current free-flowing content of Wikipedia, then logic guides to mention, for all public figures, their smoking habits [John Brown, smoker; Jane Brown, non-smoker]. Because if the smoking habit of one is sufficient for encyclopedic entry, then the non-smoking habit of another becomes equally necessary. Since no one is prepared to do that, I vote we leave it out [though it bothers me, personally, that he smokes]. --Free4It 23:01, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that including it would be an example of <a href="../../../r/e/c/WP%7ERECENT_2836.html" title="WP:RECENT">recentism</a>. I don't agree that if it's included in one article, it should be included for all articles — notability of a specific event or characteristic should be determined on an article-by-article basis. I'm certainly sympathetic to the argument that it should be included since the media made a (relatively) big deal out of it a few weeks ago — this has entirely died down, though. If it comes up again in a big way in the campaign, then it should probably be included, at the very least in his 2008 campaign article as a campaign-related issue. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 23:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Without question, Sen. Barack Obama's actions have come under intense scrutiny since announcing his bid for the White House. Allegations of controversy have arisen concerning many elements of Sen. Obama's life and person, including on this article's Talk page. Some dispute whether or not many of these elements even qualify as <i>controversial</i>, and many dispute these elements based upon <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. It's the goal of this survey to gather a snapshot of consensus concerning the notability of these many elements.</p>
<p>If you are a subscriber to the opinion essay "polls are evil," you're in no way required to participate. No one's forcing you, I simply ask that you not go out of your way to disrupt those who don't mind using a snapshot format.</p>
<p>I gathered most of these items from Talk page archives, and tried to present them as accurately and neutrally as possible. In some cases, I could not find extensive sources, but used the sources listed by past Talk participants. If I have missed any items/elements, feel free to add them in a sub-section with format similar to those below.</p>

<p>Let's get the facts straight about Mr. Obama. He is a Freshman Senator, not a Junior Senator as you have clearly written, with hyper-text, in the first sentence of your facts paragraph. Do not make this man out for more than he is, he has next to zero national political experience yet all you people want is to make him President. Two years and two months, please he hasn't even been in office a full term, nor has he even run a state, let alone the United States. Why is it too, that the media does not talk about his Islamic up-bringing or is that to sensitive. I'm sure the Obamaites will whip-up some sort of spin to keep selling a poor bill of goods, but I wouldn't expect anything less.Chrispb-72 18:45, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's me from the last comment on another computer Here is the source I promised: The following is a link to a Los Angeles Times story dated March 15, 2007. The LA Times is a known pro-Obama newspaper. Here's the article: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obama15mar15,0,5315525,full.story" class="external free" title="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obama15mar15,0,5315525,full.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obama15mar15,0,5315525,full.story</a></p>
<p>Here is a quote from the article: "His former Roman Catholic and Muslim teachers, along with two people who were identified by Obama's grade-school teacher as childhood friends, say Obama was registered by his family as a Muslim at both of the schools he attended."</p>
<p>Barack was called Barry in Indonesia. And here's what someone who knew him told the LA Times</p>
<p>"His mother often went to the church, but Barry was Muslim. He went to the mosque," Adi said. "I remember him wearing a sarong." This is a valid source and this story should be mentioned in the article. It is very noteworthy as to the canditade's childhood background as this likely shapes his world-view as an adult. <i>The previous unsigned commment was added by User: 69.125.108.189 at 01:56, 2 April 2007</i></p>

<dd>Your representation of that article is disingenuous at best. Every source I'm reading in that article affirms what's already known, and <i>no one</i> in the article alleges that Obama was "a practicing Muslim." Quite contrary: <i>The childhood friends say Obama sometimes went to Friday prayers at the local mosque. "We prayed but not really seriously, just following actions done by older people in the mosque. But as kids, we loved to meet our friends and went to the mosque together and played," said Zulfin Adi, who describes himself as among Obama's closest childhood friends.</i> I'm reverting your POV-pushing characterization, and would note that anything else mentioned in the LA Times article you link has already been covered in the article. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaliavivi_ad2e.html" title="User:Italiavivi">Italiavivi</a> 22:16, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>HELLO! Hebrew and Arabic are closely related (both Semitic languages). "<i>Baruch</i>" and "<i>Barakah</i>" are obviously closely related terms, as both mean roughly "blessing" (and similar terms: grace, charisma, divine favor/presence, etc). Seeing as his father came from a Muslim background (and thus likely had at least <i>some</i> familiarity with Arabic), there's no doubt the root of Obama's name is from the Arabic word <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barakah.html" title="Barakah">Barakah</a></i> [NOTE: sometiems spelled differently], and NOT from the Hebrew word "<i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Baruch.html" title="Baruch">Baruch</a></i>" because his father was likely to have MUCH more familiarity with Arabic rather than Hebrew. Also, didn't Obama briefly study at a Muslim school in Indonesia? There we would no doubt have been learning ARABIC, and not Hebrew. --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWassermannNYC_d58e.html" title="User:WassermannNYC">WassermannNYC</a> 10:32, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>WassermannNYC: (1) I'm curious how wherever Barack Obama <b>Junior</b> went to school has any relevance to the name he was given when he was born, or did you have another reason to insert that in this conversation? (2) Since he is <b>Junior</b>, then I guess we're talking about his grandparents' choice of name for his father, aren't we, so whatever familiarity his father had with Arabic is rather irrelevant, seeing as the name was given to <i>him</i> at <i>his</i> birth - am I wrong? and (3) Obviously the name derives from Arabic - as we say, it's an East African name and there's not much chance that Hebrew was known in the village of Nyanza province where B.O. Senior was born. The article says: <i>Speaking to an elderly Jewish audience during his 2004 campaign for U.S. Senate, Obama linked the linguistic roots of his East African first name Barack to the Hebrew word baruch, meaning "blessed."</i> The Senator made a point, <i>linking the linguistic roots</i> to the Hebrew word <i>baruch</i> (<i>barukh</i>) which apparently you agree with as it is patently true and Linguistics 101. It appears to me that he was trying to create some common ground of understanding with his audience, not erroneously claim that his name was actually from Hebrew. So am I missing a point about the article that you're trying to make? <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:14, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm concerned about the direction this article is taking. My inclusion of the Arabic spelling of Obama's name has come under a lot of fire that I find hard to understand. It occurs to me that the reason, perhaps, is that the powers that be in this article's editing are worried about the political consequences of including the name. I'm sure it's obvious why that worries me. I want to make it clear that this is not a political statement. I'm not especially political myself, and haven't looked too much into the 2008 election. At the same time, it's important to provide information to those seeking it. We have a responsibility to the readership to provide such information. If my content were false or irrelevant, it would make sense to remove it -- but it isn't. He is and American of African lineage, yes, but his name is, without question, of Arabic origin. I can attest to a potential reader's interest in the Arabic spelling because I myself was interested in it when I saw the article. When I ran across the article, I noticed that the Arabic spelling was missing, found it, and added it. I realize that there's not much I can do to keep the Arabic script in the article if people with much more time than I are constantly watching over it. I have neither the ability nor the interest in engaging in such an edit war. I'm asking that those who object to its inclusion consider their own reasons in light of the mission of Wikipedia. If they would only do this, I have no doubt that they would see why my contribution deserves mention in the article as it was. It's not political, and it's not irrelevant. I understand the wish to protect the article on the part of Obama's supporters, but it's downright irresponsible to withhold relevant information, regardless of what you assume the political consequences might be.

<dd>Unless that's a Wikipedia rule, it seems to me that we ought to err on the side of more information rather than less. Sure, it doesn't make sense to include names in other writing systems randomly, but my feeling is that linguistic origin is as good of a reason as the person's usage of another system.

<dd>Then you would be adding the Greek spelling for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Dukakis_8fbd.html" title="Michael Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiro_Agnew_94aa.html" title="Spiro Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> as well? They were the sons of Greeks, like Obama is the son of a Kenyan, of the <a href="../../../l/u/o/Luo.html" title="Luo">Luo</a> ethnicity (note: not an Arab). It would be no more appropriate on those articles than it is on this one. And please don't make assumptions about the motivations of people who edit this article regularly, some of whom also edit <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_9905.html" title="Hillary Rodham Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Edwards_8861.html" title="John Edwards">John Edwards</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

Your supposition that not including the Arabic spelling here is politically motivated is wrong, and unsupported.

<dd>Thanks for the belittling and inappropriate response, in blatant violation of Wikipedia guidelines -- though I admit I was afraid for a few lines there that your contribution was going to become constructive. As far as the "Michael Dukakis" defense -- I see no reason not to include those types of things. Our task is to provide information. Names are culturally relevant. Sure, there might not always be a dire need for alternate writing systems' spelling, but there's no harm done in including them, and there will often be enough interest in these spellings to say that including them will really improve the articles.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mikehoffman (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikehoffman_f1a3.html" title="User talk:Mikehoffman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikehoffman_0a03.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikehoffman">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Mike, my intention was not to belittle, and I apologize if it came across that way to you. However, I stand by the substance of my comment, and do not see how it was in any way inappropriate. (1) You said <i>It occurs to me that the reason, perhaps, is that the powers that be in this article's editing are worried about the political consequences of including the name.</i> and you said <i>I understand the wish to protect the article on the part of Obama's supporters, but it's downright irresponsible to withhold relevant information, regardless of what you assume the political consequences might be.</i>. Those comments impugn the motivation of the regular editors here. The regular editors here - and I am not talking about disruptive editors, I am talking about the numerous sincere, hard-working editors who have worked on this article - do not agree on everything, not by a long shot. Read this talk page and the archives and you'll see what I mean. But for the most part we reach consensus on the direction of the article - some do by surveying the group, others do it by attempting to persuade, but we don't edit with an agenda as you suggested. I pointed out to you the variety of articles that are edited by some of the regulars here, to indicate that any of us could just as easily be accused of being an Edwards or a Clinton supporter as an Obama supporter. (And the Rockefller, Bush, and Washington examples were not sarcastic - I for one have worked on all three.) (2) I think it would be odd to include the Greek spelling of Dukakis, and to me there is no difference between Dukakis and Obama on this. It wasn't a "defense", it was an observation. Our task is indeed to include information, but we make decisions all the time about which information to include. (3) The fact is that Barack Obama the man is not, to the best of our knowledge, of Arabic descent. So the fact that his name derives from Arabic is really irrelevant. (4) If my "editing war" comment was to you somehow out of line, I'm sorry, but again say that I'm glad that you don't want to edit war, because it would not be helpful. But reverting to your text three times in a day does come close. Finally, (5) As for whether any harm is done in including irrelevant information such as this, I'm sure you know that this article is a target for all kinds of vandalism, much of which has centered on Obama's supposed, but incorrect, Arab and/or Muslim background, ranging from the "Osamas" to the "madrassahs" and more. Adding his name in Arabic, since he is not of Arabic descent, might be giving <i>mis</i>-information, no matter how well-intentioned you are in suggesting it. So, since we try to proceed on this article by consensus, it appears you don't at present have it, since a few editors have removed your addition. This is not a shy bunch - if others disagree, I am sure we'll hear from them. Meanwhile, I think it best to leave the article as it is and discuss. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 19:50, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If your initial response wasn't intentionally belittling, then it was poorly-proofread. But point taken. As you can see, I haven't been adding the text back to the article, and it was never my intention to keep it there by force. That would be both irresponsible and uneffective, given the apparent convictions of those who moderate the article's content. I have every intention of addressing this omission through legitimate channels (i.e. this talk page), and as such, I expect that other editors will give my position the attention it deserves. I'd like to reiterate that I am NOT suggesting that the Arabic spelling belongs on the page because of his heritage. I'm well aware that there's little reason to believe that there is even a drop of Arab blood in Obama's veins. The name, however, is Arabic. It does not follow from Obama's non-Arab heritage that there is no reason to include the spelling of his name in the language from which it originates. We include the IPA pronunciation because the pronunciation might not be obvious to some readers. We don't include that information for every name. It seems to me that the same reasoning ought to apply to the spelling of names in their original languages. Neither necessarily has anything to do with the actual heritage of the individual, but each deserves mention. I'm more than willing to listen to the objections raised by those who oppose the Arabic text's inclusion. I would ask, though, that you would engage me (and, really, the topic) in a constructive way. Pharos, for instance, made his point in an appropriate fashion, and in doing so, he positively contributed to the conversation. Don't assume that new editors are any less intelligent or useful in the Wikipedia process than you are. Mikehoffman 21:04, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is an inherent contradiction in asserting the reason the name was removed was for political reasons, then asserting its insertion would not be of political relevance. There is no reason to include the Arabic spelling of the name. He is not Arab, he is not Muslim, he does not write his name in Arabic, he's not even from an Arabic country. There is as much reason to add the Arabic spelling of his name as there is to add the Greek, Japanese, Chinese, or Swahili. Just because the name originates from Arabic (which, you've not prevented any evidence to suggest that was indeed its origin, as I'd hesitate to wonder if it actually derived from names from another culture), does not mean it should be written in such. Any more than you should write my own name, Keith, in old English. Nor would you write my mother's name in Hebrew, or any number of Americans' names in the corresponding language of that name's origin. If you wish to, however, create an article for the -name- Barack and Obama, and not the -person-, in some or another context, feel free. Barack Obama is an American, writes his name in English, <s>the official</s> standard language of America. I don't have anything against Arabic. I do have something against people inserting a politically charged and illogically, unreasonably placed line in a political leader's article. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAltonBrownFTW_41b8.html" title="User:AltonBrownFTW">AltonBrownFTW</a> 06:30, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This will be my last contribution to this discussion, as my participation is clearly not yielding anything. I have a lot of respect for the Wikipedia project, but this experience has been disheartening. It's shown me, above all else, that Wikipedia is dominated by coders, not intellectuals, and in that spirit, has little regard for intellectual freedom. That is disappointing, and like I said, this will be my last post. I felt that I should at least defend myself against the last post, though even a marginally careful reading of any of my prior posts would discredit the personal attacks launched in the previous poster's comment. The Arabic text was, in no way, politically charged, and I saw no reason why it should have been seen as such. My remark regarding the objection to it on political lines had to do with the sentiments that clearly dominate the editing of this article. My inclusion was not political, but the ideologues that censor this article no doubt felt that the mention of the origin of Obama's first and middle names could be harmful to the campaign. That strikes me as more than a bit racist, but that's not my business. The rest of the attacks offered in the post are almost verbatim repetitions of those offered by others who chose to read my posts only superficially, so if you're interested in my response to them, check the other posts. I'm confident that this post, too will be met with the same half-attention and will result in perhaps even more angry responses through the walls of the posters' mothers' basements. Of course, you should feel free to give these responses, but it's only fair that you know that I won't see them. Ideology has triumphed over intellectual freedom, so those of you who had hoped to shield Wikipedia readers from this information should be proud -- you've won. Again, feel free to gloat, complain, and dismiss to your heart's desire. I won't be reading this discussion page any more, but I'm sure your online girlfriend will be very impressed by your bravado!

<p>Why is it that I added something to this article about Barack Obama's opposition to a bill protecting infant victims of botched abortions and it was deleted by another user MINUTES later? Can somebody explain why CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM of Barack Obama is deleted with no explanation? Also, there is NOTHING negative about him in the whole article. Compare that to any article about a REPUBLICAN Presidential candidate and you will see what I mean. But for now, I will re-add the article from world net daily and hope that none of the censors (obama supporters/staffers) don't delete for fear it will take away from the positiveness of this fluff piece.</p>

<dd>Propaganda placed into an article, any article, for the explicit purpose of hurting the candidate, especially when that material is not just controversial but unfounded, and further, during an election year is... Not proper. If there are articles you feel are being similarly treated, then you should patrol them similarly.

<dd>Please can we put these type of distorting type selective facts somewhere else? Most congressional bills are complex. Many times bills are voted up or down many times. I can always pull apart some bill and say, see, republicans didn't vote for xxx (ignoring that they voted against it for another valid reason). This type of tactic is NOT encyclopedic, and should be rejected on pages of candidates for all parties. <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustz_1d79.html" title="User:Augustz">Augustz</a> 00:59, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. While I am inclined to support Obama (we're both left-handed smokers), my BS detector lights up a little after reading this. In the Political Image section it describes him as being neither lefty nor righty. He's been against the Iraq war since day one (a position typically reserved for the extremes on both sides - like Ron Paul or Denis Kucinich), is pro-choice and advocates universal healthcare. In 2007 America this combination puts you on the left. Not neccessarily far from the center, but absolutely NOT on the right half of the scale. If there are some lesser known positions that move him to the right, you really ought to mention them. I'd have to unfortunately agree with the swiftboaters above who speculate that this page has been 'caputured' by members of his campaign. 24.98.251.37 23:03, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, throughout the article, it is clear where his political allegiances lie. The section you're referring to is specifically referring to his "image", and cites numerous reliable sources that allude to the bipartisanship he has displayed throughout his career, and does not say that his beliefs are anywhere other than on the liberal side of the American political spectrum. I agree that we can probably make that more clear in the text. (Also, it isn't very <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">nice</a> to make the claim that you did at the end, as it's entirely untrue.) —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 23:21, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article clearly states on numerous occasions that he's a Democrat. The line you're referring to is more of a comment on his insistence to treat each political issue individually, instead of adhering to party lines for the sake of party/political reasons. Did you not read the rest of the section? It has multiple criticisms, etc. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 23:26, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to know just why he is so popular in the democratic party. How does someone so young and with so little experience get seen as such a visionary? Everything I have read about his politics leads me believe he is moderate democrat ideologically close to both Clintons. I do not get any notion that he is suggesting anything particularly new. Yet there is all the buz around him versus any other Democratic Senator? If anyone has some ideas about this I would very much like to see them discussed here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Custodiet ipsos custodes (<a href="../../../c/u/s/User_talk%7ECustodiet_ipsos_custodes_1530.html" title="User talk:Custodiet ipsos custodes">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Custodiet_ipsos_custodes_e231.html" title="Special:Contributions/Custodiet ipsos custodes">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Then whose place is it to speculate???? Hello? The point of the discussion page is go places and talk about things that wont make it on the main page. (Again I am not advocating putting original research on the main page.) One could though explain with sources his popularity. If it can be done this way it is essential to an article about him. In the future when people look back at him in history they will be wondering why he was so popular. This is a very important point. History is not just dry facts but an explanation of them to provide coherence to those facts. If this is not the place where is the place??? Custodiet ipsos custodes 19:54, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

So, if you want to discuss why he's popular, perhaps you should head over to one of the discussion boards dedicated to talking politics. However, if you'd like to add why he is popular to this article, I'd suggest you find a reliable source that explains that. One thing I've noticed is that requesting others to look up information for you tends to be ignored. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 20:47, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been trying to word this tidbit in a fair manner, but the more I look at its source (a blog post from <a href="../../../r/e/a/RealClearPolitics_0ec3.html" title="RealClearPolitics">RealClearPolitics</a> <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/federation/feature/?id=110009664" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.opinionjournal.com/federation/feature/?id=110009664" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>), the more I have a problem with its reliability. The author, Nathan Gonzales, <b>paraphrases</b> all of Sen. Obama's responses to his questions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>When I asked the Obama campaign about those votes, they explained that in some cases, the Senator was uncomfortable with only certain parts of the bill, while in other cases, the bills were attempts by Republicans simply to score points.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I had mistakenly placed the phrases "uncomfortable with only certain parts of the bill" and "attempts by Republicans to score points" within quotation marks, assuming them to have been Sen. Obama's responses, but now realize that Mr. Gonzales has provided no <b>directly quoted</b> responses from Sen. Obama in his blog post. Due to its origin (a conservative blog), and the fact that it provides none of Sen. Obama's actual responses, I question its reliability as a source for this article. In previous Talk discussion, there was a fairly solid consensus (including from anti-Obama-POV editors) that Obama's past "present" votes were neither extraordinary nor notable. Should this become an issue covered by <i>reliable sources</i>, we can re-visit it later. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaliavivi_ad2e.html" title="User:Italiavivi">Italiavivi</a> 22:58, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed.

<dd>I'm not sure focusing on the abortion bills represents undue weight as both sides were represented in the paragraph. Undue weight doesn't necessarily mean focusing on one topic, but rather focusing unnecessarily on one viewpoint or in excess of what the topic is worth. This is particularly true when the only "present" votes that are really drawing attention is his votes on the pro-life bills. That being said, I'm not strictly opposed to the "present" issue being removed as the only source that's calling the present votes an issue is Gonzales's op-ed piece. However, his votes against the partial birth and the "Born alive" bills (either as a "no" or a "present") being an issue has been mentioned in a number of reliable sources.<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/17/politics/main2369157.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/17/politics/main2369157.shtml" rel="nofollow">[24]</a><a href="http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/abortion-foes-target-obama-because-of-his-vote-record-on-illinois-legislation-2007-02-15.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/abortion-foes-target-obama-because-of-his-vote-record-on-illinois-legislation-2007-02-15.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> So I don't see a reason why those votes can't be included in a sparsely covered state legislature section. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 01:54, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is a quote from the article: "His former Roman Catholic and Muslim teachers, along with two people who were identified by Obama's grade-school teacher as childhood friends, say Obama was registered by his family as a Muslim at both of the schools he attended."</p>
<p>Barack was called Barry in Indonesia. And here's what someone who knew him told the LA Times</p>
<p>"His mother often went to the church, but Barry was Muslim. He went to the mosque," Adi said. "I remember him wearing a sarong." This is a valid source and this story should be mentioned in the article. It is very noteworthy as to the canditade's childhood background as this likely shapes his world-view as an adult. <i>The previous unsigned commment was added by User: 69.125.108.189 at 01:56, 2 April 2007</i></p>
<p>Obama's statements in this article and in several public forums contradict what these sources say and that should be noted in the article. If the Obama supporters don't think there is anything wrong with having been registered as a Muslim, they should have no problem with this fact being in the article and its NPOV becaue having been is Muslim is not a bad thing, but the facts are the facts.</p>
<p>I hope we can dicuss this civilly and hopefully find a sentence that represents accurately this issue and that everyone can agree on. But consistently undoing my attempts is not the way to accomplish this and violates wikipedia's 3 undo edit rule. Rebyid 00:09, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please actually read the article. <i>'The childhood friends say Obama sometimes went to Friday prayers at the local mosque. "We prayed but not really seriously, just following actions done by older people in the mosque. But as kids, we loved to meet our friends and went to the mosque together and played," said Zulfin Adi, who describes himself as among Obama's closest childhood friends.'</i> If you are going to quote items 40 years old subject to a lot of mixed evidence including in the article itself, why not quote the following <i>"Instead of using his fists, Obama gained respect — and friends — by using his imposing stature to protect weaker children against the strong, Dharmawan said."</i> Obviously I think neither of these types of things positive or negative belong in the article. <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustz_1d79.html" title="User:Augustz">Augustz</a> 01:13, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is over 100k long, which seems to indicate that the creation of a number of child articles are in order here. The Senate career section is almost 30k in length on it's own and could be easily copied and pasted into a Senate career of Barack Obama article and then expanded/reformatted into a quality article. I could even see the senate campaign moved off to the career article with a short6 summary of the sections left here hitting the high points of the election and his senate career. The cultural and political image section is also ripe for being made into a summary for a child article. The political advocacy section and the presidential election section seem to be excessively long for summaries of another article. I know there isn't a chance in heck of getting this article down to 32k without leaving a pile of <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drek.html" title="Drek">drek</a> behind, but it should be doable to reduce the length down to a more acceptable and quality 60k with a proper application of <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>.
