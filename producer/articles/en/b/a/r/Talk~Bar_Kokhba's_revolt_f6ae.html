<p>This is standard operating procedure in the Roman religion: you tear down opposing holy sites and build your own temple on top of their ruins. No evidence this was motivated by anti-Semitism, that I can see. Indeed, the whole section seems only partially related to anti-Semitism, falling into the more general category of "history of nasty stuff done to Jews". I'm less sure about this, but wasn't <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_punishment.html" title="Collective punishment">collective punishment</a> such as <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimation.html" title="Decimation">decimation</a> a standard Roman technique too? Our article on <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadrian.html" title="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> doesn't suggest that he was anti-Semitic. Perhaps it should, if we're going to be making that accusation here. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 23:05, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The only thing that suggests Hadrian was anti-Semitic is his ban on circumcision, enacted (I think) before the revolt, and its truth is debatable -- the <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_History_9305.html" title="Augustan History">only source</a> that reports the ban is rather dubious. His actions after the revolt were unquestionably hostile towards Jews, but he had reasons other than a hatred of Jews <i>qua</i> Jews. (For reading on this, and ancient anti-Semitism in general, I recommend the essay <i>"Anti-Semitism" in Antiquity: The Problem of Definition</i>, by Shaye J. D. Cohen, in <i>History and Hate: The Dimensions of Anti-Semitism</i> (ed. David Berger).)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Err, and attacking Judaism as a religion could be seen as anti-Semitic, I suppose, but again the issue is cloudy; the Romans made conquered barbarians worship Roman gods as a standard practice of Romanization, and the vast majority of said barbarians, being polytheists, didn't object too loudly. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">--MIRV</a> 23:58, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AFAIK, circumcision (<i>brit-milah</i>) has utmost religious importance in Judaism. Hadrian loathed it, and forbade this mutilation (as he called it) on pain of death. I'm not sure how far his projects of pagan temple advanced _before_ the uprising, but that's secondary. For what he did before and for his inadequate response to the uprising, he well deserves a place in the roaster. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> 08:09, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit_milah.html" title="Brit milah">brit milah</a> is indeed an important Jewish ritual. However, one cannot presume that every person who dislikes circumcision is anti-Semitic. It may be that Hadrian loathed circumcision because it was a Jewish ritual because he loathed the Jews. However, he may have loathed circumcision for other reasons. Further, note that we're not even sure that Hadrian <i>did</i> ban circumcision, as MIRV states. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 19:27, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hadrian's dislike of circumcision (assuming that the <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_History_9305.html" title="Augustan History">Augustan History</a> can be trusted -- Antoninus Pius did rescind a ban on the practice, but it's not clear that said ban was originally Hadrian's) <i>may</i> have been based on anti-Semitism, or it could have been part of a general Greco-Roman dislike for mutilation of the body (especially the male body) -- the ancient Greeks detested such mutilations, and Hadrian was strongly influenced by Greek thought and culture. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">--MIRV</a> 19:44, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>About all we can do is attribute - sometimes people do research papers working up a more plausible guess, based on population, grain shipments, or whatever, but then you'd still want Dio's number alongside. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 05:30, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>The research papers are based on facts and reasoning (such as comparison with more recent pre-industrial settlements with censused population). AFAIK, we don't know what the ancients' (C.Dio) numbers are based on - they seem to be guesstimates.

<p>What is the basis for this assertion? According to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philistines.html" title="Philistines">Philistines</a> article the place seems to have been continuously inhabited up to Roman times. "Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon eventually conquered all of Syria and the land of Canaan, and the Philistine cities became part of the Neo-Babylonian empire.

<p>A DNA study performed by a Japanese university. Surely you do not think that they have any reason to lie about this. This study used a comparison of the differences between populations now existing to determine how various groups are related. It found the palestinians have more haplotypes in common with jews than with most other "Arab" people. It found that jews have more DNA in common with Palestinians than with most other groups studied.</p>

<p>Please do not assume that I am some how anti one side and Pro the other. Yours is a conflict between brothers in which I have no stake.</p>
<p>This is relivant because it establishes that the Phillistines are in fact not extinct they just converted to a differnt religion than the worship of pagan idols that they had been doing. This fact alone does not mean that they as a people do not exist. ie. my self and my Native Relatives are still Native Americans although none of us practice the old traditions as they existed pre coloumbus. This does not make us white or black, just Natives who practice a different religion. I can also understand the politics of ancestry determineing who gets to live "on the 'reservation' " and who does not. I have firsthand knowledge of those type of matters.</p>

<dd>Are you saying they converted to Judaism? Or were they a non-Jewish peasent underclass ruled by hereditary Jewish overlords?

<p>All of this is relevant to this discussion because it falseifies the statement that "the Phillistines were long extinct". It just is not a true statement.</p>
<p>Where do I personally stand on the matter? If anything the current Palestinians being mostly the same people puts the current conflict in perspective.

<dd>Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I try not to assume anything. That was a general observation not directed at you. BTW, I think I understand your perspective: I have several Native American friends. Sorry, some of your assumptions are simply wrong. Arabs and Jews did not fight each other for thousands of years. As a matter of fact, they got along better than Christians and Jews. By 1940s, about a million of Jews lived in Arab/Muslim lands, see <a href="http://jimena-justice.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://jimena-justice.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
<dd>Back to our subject: "The Phillistines are in fact not extinct they just converted to a differnt religion" -- the point is, they stopped identifying themselves or being identified by their neighbors as a distinct people.

<p>According to DIO CASSIUS, Second century Roman historian, in Cyprus and Cyrene, Jews massacred gentiles in great numbers. "The Jews were destroying both Greeks and Romans. They ate the flesh of their victims, made belts for themselves out of their entrails, and daubed themselves with their blood... In all, 220,000 men perished in Cyrene and 240,000 in Cyprus, and for this reason no Jew may set foot in Cyprus today."</p>
<p>I have not seen anything by this same historian to include the number of dead Jews. I would like to see a link to a non-Jewish source for any such claim.</p>
<p>The fact is that this was Roman territory and the Jews living in that land were given a huge amount of freedom to practice their religion. That's why the Romans were taken aback when the rebellion came. Jews slaughtered thousands of Gentiles, mostly innocent women and children who's only crime was not being Jewish. --<a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 02:55, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You need to check yourself because as a pro-Israeli, pro-Jewish supporter you make it hard for me to deal with anti-Semites when you exclude historical information related to the subject at hand. When people twist history to meet their political agenda, then your opponents can make up lies and then you have to deal with those lies as well as history. Naturally, "revisionists" use history and lies together to make converts. I have never lost an argument to an anti-Semite because I use history to confirm what happened and argue that history is not an indication of present life or the future. For the most part, I use any historical source that can be confirmed. In this case, because you and I will go back-and-forth with this page, I will use Jewish sources (although I retain the right to use any verfiable historical source). That's why my sources in this article are strictly from the Jewish Encyclopedia. If you had been fair, as I have been, you would have added this information without me having to visit this page. Sadly, in this case, you only told half the story. I ask you to tell me why you left out the information from the Jewish Encyclopedia that rightfully should have been included.</dd>

<p>"Modern historians have come to view the Bar-Kokhba Revolt as being of decisive historic importance. The massive destruction and loss of life occasioned by the revolt has led some scholars to date the beginning of the Jewish diaspora from this date. They note that, unlike the aftermath of the First Jewish-Roman War chronicled by Josephus, the majority of the Jewish population of Judea was either killed, exiled, or sold into slavery after the Bar-Kokhba Revolt,"</p>
<p>Which "Modern historians" still cling to this "expulsion" myth? (OK, I can probably guess which ones). There is an extensive literature on Jewish life in Palestine (they were the majority of the population) for hundreds of years after 132. I will delete the part quoted above unless a source is supplied, representing the consensus of recognized modern academic historians (not some advocacy site claiming to be an encyclopedia, please). <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourtildas_846b.html" title="User:Fourtildas">Fourtildas</a> 05:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It should also be noted that there is a popular but utterly incorrect idea that the supposed expulsion of Jews from Palestine is what started the Jewish diaspora, as implied in by the article as quoted above. The diaspora happened a long time before that, and it didn't result from "expulsion" at all. There were huge Jewish communities in Alexandria and Babylon, for example, and lotsa Jewish communities all over the Roman Empire. In fact, if you read Philo and Josephus carefully, you get the impression that there were already more Jews living outside Palestine than in it, well before the Judaean War of 70-74.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's really no reason to doubt that the modern Palestinian Arabs are descended from the people who lived there anciently, many of whom were Jewish. Any more than there's any reason to doubt that most modern Levantine Muslims are descended from Christians who lived there in Byzantine times, and who are in turn descended from pagans who lived there before that. And when I say modern Palestinian Arabs, I include the Jewish Palestinian Arabs along with the Christians and Muslims and Druzes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's certainly true that the "Roman expulsion of Jews" is a myth. Rome didn't persecute Jews qua Jews until it became Christian, whereupon it acquired a theological reason for hating Jews. Tom129.93.17.174 04:43, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Gosh, where to begin when confronted with such historical theories. Palestinian Arabs are in all likelihood descended from all those people you mention, as well as many others. Being Arab is, after all, not a genetic definition but a linguistic or ethnic one. And the area we know variously as the Levant, etc., has always been an area with lots of migrations of people. It's a bit tedious to quibble about genetic descent in this context, as it's always going to be a contest of assertions. In the meantime, genetic tests, for what they're worth, show that Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews are related to each other, and also to Arabs and Assyrians. Which shouldn't surprise anyone and makes the divisiveness so much more tragic.</dd>

<dd>As for the expulsion, the Romans did indeed persecute Jews long before Christianity set in among them. It wasn't that they were particularly harsh toward Jews - they were harsh toward anyone who was insubordinate to Roman ways, and Jews could not tolerate idolatry in general and desecration of the temple in particular. Yes, there has been uninterrupted Jewish habitation of the area throughout all historical time, but the Romans implemented and enforced severe difficulties for Jews, to force them to either assimilate to Roman ways or leave. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 05:07, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
