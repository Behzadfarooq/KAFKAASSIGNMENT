<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_High_School_Early_College_51b9.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Founded in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> as a partnership of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_Department_of_Education_7ff0.html" title="New York City Department of Education">New York City Department of Education</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_College_4a64.html" title="Bard College">Bard College</a> and originally funded in part by the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation_4d96.html" title="Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, the school accepts students into the ninth grade and allows them to earn both a high school diploma and an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associate_of_Arts_8dc6.html" title="Associate of Arts">Associate of Arts</a> (A.A.) degree in four years. BHSEC was the first school in the Gates Foundation's Early College High School Initiative, which aims to improve education in the United States by introducing smaller public high schools which help remove the barriers to a college education by offering students a college education in a high school setting. Many of the teaching philosophies that BHSEC has implemented were originally developed at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon%27s_Rock_College_ee70.html" title="Simon's Rock College">Simon's Rock College of Bard</a>, the nation's only liberal arts college designed to accommodate students who are capable of doing college-level work at a younger age.</p>
<p>Many graduates of BHSEC transfer their 60+ college credits to another college or university and finish their <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Arts_b70d.html" title="Bachelor of Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> (B.A.) degree in two more years; others opt to study for three or four years in their subsequent institutions. The tuition-free school is open to all New York City residents and attracts a highly diverse student body. Admission is highly competitive and is based on a comprehensive set of factors, including grades, an essay and math exam, and an interview. In admitting the class of 2011, 900 applicants made it to the interview stage of the application. Approximately 3000- 4000 applicants vie for approximately 148 seats each fall.</p>
<p>As of June 2006, four classes have graduated since the school's opening in 2001, and the first class to have gone through all four years of the program graduated in June 2005.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_High_School_Early_College_51b9.html" title="Edit section: High school">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">High school</span></h2>
<p>In the BHSEC program, students spend what is traditionally ninth and tenth grade finishing the bulk of their high school work. Students take the five <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regents_exam.html" title="Regents exam">Regents exams</a> required for the High School Regents diploma, which they receive in addition to the Associates of Arts degree from Bard College. Unlike most New York City high schools, however, BHSEC does not offer courses tailored to prepare students for the Regents, nor are there any <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_5c2b.html" title="Advanced Placement">Advanced Placement</a> (AP) courses offered (as the last two years are spent in an accredited college program). In order to complete the high school curriculum in two years, courses are taught at an accelerated pace.</p>
<p>During the freshmen Fall semester, students are enrolled in <i>Introduction to Foreign Languages</i>, where they get to experience each of four foreign languages: <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>,<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>,and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>. At the end of the semester, students choose the language they wish to study further.</p>
<p>As of the semester of Fall 2005, the high school science curriculum has been revamped, and over the two years of high school, students study an "integrated science" course taught by college professors, combining <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>. Previously, students studied biochemistry as freshmen and chemistry as sophomores.</p>
<p><a name="Early_College_Program" id="Early_College_Program"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_High_School_Early_College_51b9.html" title="Edit section: Early College Program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early College Program</span></h2>
<p>The two years spent in the college program are denoted <i>First Year</i> and <i>Second Year</i>. As a college program, students may select their courses based primarily on their academic interests and preferences for certain professors; however, they must also meet the college program's core requirements. These requirements include four semesters of seminar, in which students read and discuss seminal works of western thought, from <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> and the classics through <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> and ending in <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodernism.html" title="Postmodernism">postmodernism</a>. Students are also required to complete two semesters of math, two semesters of laboratory science, one semester of history, one semester of literature, and two additional semesters of either social science or literature, and three arts credits. Students may also create their own courses with the independent study program, provided that a faculty member is knowledgeable in the subject. Every semester, a student must take 14-18 credits. With permission from the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean.html" title="Dean">dean</a>, students may take more than 18 credits in a semester. Students can also transfer credits from other universities to meet their requirements for the college program.</p>
<p>BHSEC's college program offers classes that are much more specialized than in the high school program, such as Multi-variable <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">Calculus</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graph_Theory_c9c8.html" title="Graph Theory">Graph Theory</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_Algebra_e27d.html" title="Linear Algebra">Linear Algebra</a>, to name a few math courses popular with students in the 2005-6 academic year. Some popular liberal arts courses offered that year are Creative Writing, Novels of <a href="../../../d/o/s/Dostoyevsky.html" title="Dostoyevsky">Dostoyevsky</a> and Justice.</p>
<p>There are some major courses available at the school in: the arts, digital arts, environmental studies, further studies in language, literature, mathematics, musicianship, philosophy, psychology, the sciences, social sciences and theater production.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_High_School_Early_College_51b9.html" title="Edit section: Faculty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Faculty</span></h2>
<p>The majority of BHSEC faculty members at the school hold <a href="../../../p/h/d/PhD_8f5b.html" title="PhD">PhDs</a> and all faculty have a masters degree or higher (2003-2004 Annual School Report). Faculty often choose to teach courses in the area of their scholarly research. A full list of faculty is available on the school's website. <a href="http://www.bard.edu/bhsec/academics/faculty_list.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bard.edu/bhsec/academics/faculty_list.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_High_School_Early_College_51b9.html" title="Edit section: Library">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Library</span></h3>
<p>The library was constructed, completed and opened to the student body in November 2004. It utilizes a fully automated catalog which can be accessed online <a href="http://library.nycenet.edu/common/welcome.jsp?site=1323" class="external autonumber" title="http://library.nycenet.edu/common/welcome.jsp?site=1323" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The library covers a diverse selection of subjects, and has recently added a small collection of classic movies in circulation. There are also twenty-five wireless laptops available to students for work and research, complete with printer access. Beginning in the Spring 2007 term, a Student Center was created and the Learning Center merged into the library. This effectively shifted socializing to the Student Center and renewed the academic purpose of the library space.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_High_School_Early_College_51b9.html" title="Edit section: Learning Center">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Learning Center</span></h3>
<p>In Fall 2004, BHSEC opened the Learning Center including a Writing Center, where students can come at any time for assistance in writing papers from faculty and student volunteers, and a Math Center for math help. In addition, students can receive chemistry tutoring. Students will often find that many of their older peers are willing to help explain a key point or revise papers, and the majority of students believe the Writing Center is a valuable resource. Some professors are willing to take into consideration the time spent in the Writing Center working on their papers into grading.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Spring 2007 term, the Learning Center was relocated to a portion of the library and its former location became the new Student Center to re-separate the library from socializing.</p>

<p>While studies occupy much of BHSEC students' time, they are also avid participants in community events.</p>
<p>BHSEC has the <i>Community Council</i>, a student government consisting of three representatives from each grade and faculty representatives. The council is responsible for the organization of events and activities for the school and acts as the school community liaison between the administration and the students. Some of the programs organized in the 2005-6 academic year by the Community Council were the <i>Spring Community Day</i> (a celebration of the school's diversity and culture) and the <i>Pink Dance</i> (a dance for the students with the majority of the proceeds funding breast cancer research). In the 2006-7 academic year, the Community Council has revised the school's Course Evaluation form, held an "S-Dance" and is currently planning the year's Community Day, getting recycling for the school, and improving the new Student Center.</p>

<p>BHSEC has a wide variety of extracurricular activities including student organizations and volunteer opportunities. In keeping with BHSEC students' initiative, a student can found a club for anything as long as there is sufficient student interest. Displaying the wide variety of passions in the student body, clubs range from the philosophy club, to the food lover's club, to the award-winning step team. A full list is below:</p>
