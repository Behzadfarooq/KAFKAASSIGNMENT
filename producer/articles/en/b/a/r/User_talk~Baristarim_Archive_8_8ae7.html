<h2><span class="mw-headline">Circumflex</span></h2>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumflex.html" title="Circumflex">circumflex</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>. Until recently, the modern (<a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">Latin</a>-based) <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_alphabet.html" title="Turkish alphabet">Turkish alphabet</a> introduced in the time of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk_b631.html" title="Mustafa Kemal Atatürk">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</a> used the circumflex accent to indicate when a vowel was to be pronounced in a way more native (usually by stretching it out somewhat) to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>. Words featuring such an accent, such as <i>kâtib</i> "scribe", <i>ilâhî</i> "divine", or Kâmile (a woman's name) are generally <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loanword.html" title="Loanword">loanwords</a> distinguishable from true Turkish words, and were represented easily in the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_script.html" title="Arabic script">Arabic script</a> used in the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Turkish_language_f605.html" title="Ottoman Turkish language">Ottoman Turkish language</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_alphabet.html" title="Turkish alphabet">Turkish alphabet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optional <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumflex.html" title="Circumflex">circumflex</a> accents can be used with "â", "î" and "û" to disambiguate words with different meanings but otherwise the same spelling (for example, while "<i>kar</i>" means "snow", "<i>kâr</i>" means "profit"), or to indicate <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatalization.html" title="Palatalization">palatalization</a> of a preceding consonant, or long vowels in <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loanword.html" title="Loanword">loanwords</a>, particularly from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>. These are seen as variants of "a", "i", and "u" and are becoming quite rare in modern usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being said, do you think it was correct to move <a href="../../../i/s/t/%C4%B0stiklal_Avenue_b4f6.html" title="İstiklal Avenue">İstiklal Avenue</a> to <a href="../../../i/s/t/%C4%B0stikl%C3%A2l_Avenue_4e5b.html" title="İstiklâl Avenue">İstiklâl Avenue</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakkari.html" title="Hakkari">Hakkari</a> to <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakk%C3%A2ri.html" title="Hakkâri">Hakkâri</a>? You'll notice that the articles from the Turkish Wikipedia don't use this type of accent mark, unless it's for historical figures such as <a href="../../../../tr/h/a/s/Hasan_%C3%82li_Y%C3%BCcel_eaa1.html" class="extiw" title="tr:Hasan_Âli_Yücel">Hasan Âli Yücel</a>. What do you think?

<p>It was a great job; I believe you reach to the end of your efforts. Is there anything left besides the stability? I recognize that no one adds to the content. It may be help full 4u to argue that content have reached to its maturity. Emphasize that vandalism is part of the reality.

<p>Thanks for the encouragement! One section I would like to add to complete the package would be Politics. Except for my meetings with the mayor and once with the state appointed governor, I know little about local politics. Do you know of any sites that have election data or maps for the region? Preferably in English? Otherwise my only concern with the article is citation, since many observations are not verifiable. --Patrickneil 17:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Baris.

<dd>This is why i am advising you not to remove such comments; because u could be accused of "hiding comments for unknown reasons"... I would propose to let alone the users who make such comments... After all, they should be the ones to defend themselves or to deal with the polemic nature of comments that their own have caused. That article has indeed become a battleground, but IMO, every user involved there should be responsible for his comments, if not, he/she should not press "Save page":p.

Remember project collects Ottoman Empire, Seljuk , etc. If in the future, this project becomes a place to attract attention, we should expect people from different nations. For Ottoman Empire, isn't it possible to <b>create an Ottoman Empire work group!</b> Isn't it a better idea to have a symbol that does not put the nationalism on the front page. I have no idea what that symbol would be.

<dd>I didn't want to start a political discussion on the Hrant Dink talk page, but I just had to say in response to your comment above - some of the initial reactions by the public were certainly unexpected by me and I hope are a sign of things to come. The state however is the very instrument that tried him multiple times for a crime he never committed (insulting Turkishness) and convicted him of, and upheld the conviction on appeal. The state continues to subvert the truth, free speech, and gave massive negative publicity to a man who otherwise would never have been heard of, and never shot. It is the state that caused this, whether they find the hand that carried out their agenda of silence or not. I am still shocked by the news. Still shocked by the image of him face down in a pool of blood. He sat right behind me in September and I was too shy to talk to him... instead we exchanged a few emails in October. I can't believe I will never get a chance to talk to him. That a kid assassinated him.

<dd>Well the "initial intent" of the government as you put it, was to silence him. The end result was in fact just that. Permanent silence. Let's see if the small Armenian community can even find another person with the leadership qualities he had, and let us see if that leader is willing to stick his neck out like Hrant did. Both seem quite unlikely to me - I suspect he is irreplaceable. I must say most Turks I have interacted with just don't want to remember "what happened". Many might be willing to reach out, but usually (not always!) only if that subject is not mentioned, not brought up, not discussed, or not fully acknowledged. Most Turks are not quite like you. He comes to Yerevan for conferences where I see him - including in September when he was sitting right behind me in a very empty area of seating in the back two rows. My friend Garegin Chukazyan knew him in person and offered to introduce us, and I did not want to bother him and declined. His views were so interesting to me - I would have loved to discuss them at length... as you know, he held somewhat different views on how to proceed than the vast majority of Diasporans. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 01:39, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if he <i>did</i> consider himself Turkish Armenian, then that is fair enough. The confusion is caused by peoples misconception as to what nationality really means. In English it is neither clear (two distinct meanings), nor grasped by the stupid departments who make the enquiry as to "what is your nationality". But from your part of the world, and my adjacent region (historically linked with Turkey anyhow), we don't suffer from that confusion. Personally I would have opted to give him two seperate sections such as: Nationality: Turkish; Ethnicity: Armenian. Or another more defining example is: Citizenship or legal status: to Turkey; Nationality/Ethnicity/Affiliation etc: Armenian. But like you said on the side note, if Armenians of Turkey choose to distinguish themselves both from Armenian Armenians and all ethnic Turks, then "Armenian Turk" is acceptable. I was only suggesting something here and I'll leave it to you! I shalln't edit the article on that section again&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/v/l/User%7EEvlekis_1e94.html" title="User:Evlekis">Evlekis</a> 08:33, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Got your message. I'm a little confused. You have a picture of this brave journalist on your page, yet you're suggesting that we hold back until it is unprotected.</p>
<p>I doubt it will ever be Unprotected again. This subject has been a hot topic for nearly 100 years, and that isn't likely to change.</p>
<p>Already, though, we see that the events since 1960 or so have not been chronicled. It will be all the more difficult to remember them if we do not chronicle them in some fashion. At least my Talk comment puts it there. We must never forget the genocide attempt, because we're destined to repeat those mistakes which we do not remain mindful of. (Even then, there are fools like GW Bush to push us to the brink of disaster by willful use of unnecessary force.) So I feel it is important to show that this continues, and that people continue to be killed and lied to even today.</p>

<li><a href="../../../k/u/%C5%9F/Ku%C5%9Ftul_Monastery_babc.html" title="Kuştul Monastery">Kuştul Monastery</a>: I think it's better to just use the word "expelled", rather than using the whole phrase, "population exchange between Greece and Turkey." First off, it's pretty long, and secondly, I don't think the Greeks really <i>wanted</i> to leave, and the word "exchange" makes it seem like it was some fair thing that went on. "Expel" just means to eject, and I think it's a pretty neutral term in this sense.</li>
<li>When I think of the word "Turkish" used for a person of Kurdish ethnicity, I usually don't think "they're a Turkish citizen", but "they are probably an assimilated Kurd". Although there is not the slightest hint of Kurdish nationalism in <i>Organize işler</i>, it turns out that he has been touched to some degree by the Kurdish nationalist movement:
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1980, two young men from Hakkari, taking a stroll in Aksaray, met a fellow countryman, Firat Baskale.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Baskale was a revolutionary musician whose voice was similar to that of Sivan Perwer (the most popular of Kurdish musicians). At F. Baskale’s invitation they went to the hotel where he was working</i></dd>
<dd><i>These young men had such a strong longing for Kurdish music that Firat, looked around suspiciously to see if there was anyone around “If anyone hears us, we’ll be denounced and our lives won’t be worth a light” he warned them.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Then he led them to a dark and tiny room in the hotel cellars and picking up his guitar sang in Kurdish.</i></dd>
<dd><i>A few minutes later these two young men, certainly as frightened as if they had been taking part in an illegal demonstration, felt as happy as if they were back in their native mountains.</i></dd>
<dd><i>One of these youths was none other than Yilmaz Erdogan. As for the other, he was Muhsin Kizilkaya, who, some years later mentioned this incident in his biography of Erdogan</i></dd>

<p>My problem with the template is that it is a) large and confusing and more importantly b) these regions are not official classifications, there is no government of the 'Aegean region' for example. Turkey is administered ate national, provincial and district levels. I would be happy if the entry for each province contained a) a list of the districts in the province b) a list of the 81 provinces and then c) your list of regions, which can link to an entry listing the provinces within the region and a geographical description.</p>

<dd>There was a need to cover the casualties of the Ottoman Empire, sure. It is a valid concept. Question is how to do it without turning it into edit wars? In a perfect world, each issue would have developed their concepts in separate spaces, such as Armenians did. However, it is obvious (and realized) that there is too much at risk on the Muslim side. If you read the private conversations, you will see that it bothers everyone. I believe you can not reach a holistic picture here. It is also difficult in scientific world, too. After 82 years, there is no single book that covers WWI Ottoman Casualties, only distributed papers. They treat it like an insignificant concept! So 5,0000,000 people died, who cares, they concentrate only what is significant to them. The article in its form (holistic), will be under delete and deform attacks. No one is willing to develop a holistic concept, and they do not have knowledge. I do not give much chance, to a holistic approach. Look what happened when it was in pieces. Most people prefer it keep in minimal. Hope I would be wrong.<a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">OttomanReference</a> 15:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
