<h2><span class="mw-headline">What's the point of this ridiculous, gratuitous article?</span></h2>
<p>The subject seems to be clearly obsessed, probably unhealthily. It seems this article exists merely to highlight those characteristics solely to place the subject in an unflattering light. It's cruel, gratutious, and a sad attack on the part of whoever favors keeping it in the cause of some stupid pissing contest. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 22:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"What is the point?" The encyclopedia article, like all articles here, is meant to provide information to those people that seek it. Ms. Schwarz has achieved a level of notoriety that has met the requirements of Wikipedia, as this has been challenged on that ground on three times and lost each time. Non-notable subjects do not motivate hundreds of pages of discussion and attract numerous admins and editors. I would also encourage you to follow the rules of Wikipedia. Do not engage in personal attacks against other editors. You should also assume good faith on the part of other editors. Questioning the motives or intentions of other editors and administrators is not appropriate behavior. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 09:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> Ms. Schwarz is first notable for her FOIA requests and lawsuits against the government accusing various agencies covering up proof that would prove her beliefs. It is not her delusions which make her notable here, rather her attempts to prove them by suing the U.S. government. The court documents are not original research, they simply show her attempts to get information the government doesn't have. She does/did this by filing suits against several agencies, field offices, and hundreds of individual employees of those agencies. It is a tragic, but true fact, that her legal quest to prove her delusion has cost hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of fees, time, and legal action.</dd>
<dd>She is also notable for the attempted deprogramming on her on the subject of cult intervention experts.</dd>
<dd>It is very important though that the article reflect the focus on the FOIA and deprogramming issues, and treat her delusions in the context of it's relationship to the notable issues. It should not be a page to ridicule her. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 23:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That just seems like a back door attempt to try and find more notability than ther is. Analogy: (I love analogies, an analogy is to Wikipedia like ...oh yeah here is it)--If there were two little press articles about how I burnt down my apartment building because the obsessive pile of notes I obsessively stacked in the apartment caught fire, would this sad but minor story be shown to be more notable by explaining what the content of all these notes was? Ms. Schwarz is mildly notable for filing a bunch of requests and lawsuits, to the extent that there's a couple of minor news articles about it. Thats it. The Scientology thing is peripheral. Something can't be reliably connected to something else via a <i>delusion</i>. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 03:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand your analogy <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> but it doesn't actually apply to Ms. Schwarz's situation because it's too simple. Your burned down apartment did not involve the CIA, FBI, FDA, USDA, NSA, HHS and various others spending tax dollars trying to find information that doesn't exist and then having to defend themselves in court when they can't find what she wants. The Scientology thing is not peripheral because she sued for information proving that L. Ron Hubbard was her father and she seems to believe that a once prominent Scientologist is being held by someone somewhere for killing her which goes back to why she has filed so many suits. A more relevant analogy should address the many points in the actual situation. Here would be a better analogy than an accidental fire or arson in an apt building.
<ul>
<li>Analogy: Jill is certain that there is a book about her at the library, so when she finds out there isn't one she sues the library. Everybody but her knows that libraries don't keep biographies about just anyone, but because Jill has the right to do so she sues. She represents herself, and spends almost no money while the library has to spend money on a lawyer. Jill's case is rejected so she appeals, and because she found out the library two towns over doesn't have her book that they should be sued. In the end lots of time and some of your money (if you pay taxes) gets used to pay and deal with lawyers rather than buying new books. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 04:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But...but..but...where are all the secondary sources that would provide some reasonable indication that this is <i>notable</i>? In Jill's case, it's <i>you</i> opining about resources being wasted that would be better spent and all, and thats valid, and no one would disagree, <i>but it aint news</i>. Back to Ms Schwarz, all I'm seeing is a one-off article in the The Salt Lake Tribune. Should we have a Wiki bio for everyone whose had an article written about them in a local newspaper? Everyone who's filed a bizarre lawsuit or bunch of lawsuits? It's back to notability, and like Gertie sez, there ain't no there there. When it comes to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, what wrong with erring on the side of Wiki Hippocrates and first do no harm, rather than satisfy voyeuristic desires (and worse) on the part of some here who seem to obsess about Ms Schwarz for some ungodly reason even more than she obsesses about whatever she obsesses about. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 05:28, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having many secondary sources are actually not always necessary, but it does help. By "...it ain't news" I take to mean that by your interpretation of Wikipolicy nothing belongs on here that has not been debated in the news? That is wholly inconsistent with the idea of an encylopedia which draws on several types of sources to provide information. When discussing a subject for which there is no tangible answer, secondary sources in the media are essential. When discussing issues of fact, primary sources count because the media can offer different answers for already established facts. In this case there are actually so many that adding them all would make the article mostly a page of links.

Because in the hypothetical situation I mentioned you seem to imply that there would be rational people supporting using tax money to pay attorneys to address a woman's delusions. In my analogy the libraries represent several states as well as the federal government, the books represent stuff they are supposed to use tax money for. Instead of spending it on rebuilding New Orleans, paying teachers and the other things tax money is for. I mean no insult to you but your analogy of a pile of notes spontaneously igniting and burning down an apartment building doesn't seem to apply here.

<dd>Would it satisfy you if we changed the wording to something along the lines of "Ms. Schwarz claims she was President...". She has claimed she was so if the scan doesn't work for you we can fix the issue with a simple rewording. It was my impression you wanted to defend her, not remove her achievements. Why is the scan unverifiable though, because it's in German? I was actually working on translating the parts that have to do with her using Google's language tools. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 07:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

I, and a few others, feel that the scan abides by appropriate wikipolicy. (Let's face it, the scan has been on here for quite a while and then you remove it. You must realize that you weren't the only editor to have looked at this article.) When you accuse an editor or their information of violating policy, please also state why.<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>,<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and other policy articles are not meant to be invoked without clarifying which part of that policy is being violated. For example earlier on this talk page you expressed the opinion that usenet and blogs are never acceptable and gave a link to the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> page. As another editor pointed out Ms. Schwarz posts on usenet do meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> exceptional requirements. So please, explain to myself and the others involved here how specifically the article was violating any of these policies before you began editing here? The policy about assuming good faith means you must assume we know the rules and have placed the information here in accordance with them, just as I assume you are arguing your point to make the page fit in accordance with your interpretation of the rules to make it conform with wiki standards. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:49, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

A court document meets the requirements of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. There is no serious dispute that the cited court document says something other than what this article says. Just because you can't find the text online doesn't mean it doesn't meet the requirements of WP:RS. In any case, besides Ms. Schwarz being acknowledged by the courts as the former President of Germany, there are numerous statements directly from her where she also makes the same claim as the German courts. This is just another non-issue. We've had numerous editors and admins here that have actually INSISTED that we allow Ms. Schwarz's own words defending herself to be included. An author's own words can be used in an article about themselves, especially when there is no claim made by anyone that these words are not in fact her own. And in any case, Ms. Schwarz admitted to the Salt Lake Tribune that she wrote the 92 part autobiographical stories on USENET. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 09:03, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is an easy way to verify the authenticity.

<p>I think she is notable, but that is just my personal opinion. That said, I don't think the article should go into detail regarding her personal life. That is an invasion of privacy. She needs to be able to live her life without folks looking over her shoulder. She has published a sort of autobiography online. A link to that is useful, but using most of the material in it in a Wikipedia article is probably not appropriate. There may be more interest from Scientology related users than is appropriate. She has not been actually involved in Scientology for many years. My personal stamp of approval is not really worth much. Deleting the original article and its talk pages was worth something, as we (Jimbo and the community) had determined that <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">biographies of living persons</a> needed to meet minimal standards. The article needs to recount her internet prominence and a basic outline of the basis and nature of her freedom of information requests. These things should be briefly and simply stated.

<p>Please don't misunderstand me, I do not mean to imply any hostility. I am trying to figure out though whether you do actually understand what you are accusing editors of doing. Having read your talk page, I think we can agree that you tend to find yourself in discussions very similar to this one. You seem intelligent, so I have a sneaking suspicion you are ignoring the policies you are accusing others of violating. If I assume my suspicion is correct without giving you an opportunity to prove otherwise; Would not be assuming good faith which we all must do. I have simply asked you to back up your assertion that <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> is not abiding by <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. If you really think I am attacking you, perhaps we should involve a third party to ensure neutrality?

<li>Campaigning = <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> isn't running an organization or campaign designed to turn people against her. If <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> wanted to do that, he/she could've included a lot more irrelevant but damaging information about Ms. Schwarz from her usenet posts.</li>

Using Wikipedia as an extension of a petty, nasty, sexist pissing contest is morally reprehensible.

<dd>OK, enough of this. Tilman is right in saying that these issues have been discussed at great length before - there have been three unsuccessful AfDs for this article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clean up needed</span></h2>
<p>The below was my response to BabyDweezil's requests that I take a look over here. I think that we, just as human beings, should go through this article and clean it up and make sure that it complies with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> with only published information from high-quality sources. Who wants to go first?

<blockquote>
<p>Anywho, this is just another dirty little corner of Wikipedia that I have not much taken an interest in (of course, I have seen most of her story over the years). I feel bad for her as she is obviously unbalanced and that is sad. Her major "notability" lies in that she is the laughing stock for an insular group of individuals that would publicly mock an unbalanced person. Yeah! The article should be cut down to what notable parts it may have and then perhaps AfD. But first clean it up so we can see what we have. Re Tilman's editing it. Hmmmm, tough call. My quick read of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> would seem to indicate that he might want to stay away from it but, to be honest, so long as he stays very neutral on it (not taking sides in talk debates), I don't see a problem.

Which means we could initiate a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> on either the article or <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a>'s behavior.

You appear to agree that her FOIA use makes her noteable. The editors who wrote the article appear to have only used info relevant to her FOIA/Rick Ross experiences. I'm hoping you understand we are not out to make her look bad/crazy/ridiculous. Regrettably the facts of what makes her notable are tied to her beliefs. We are not making light of her illness, and it would be assuming bad faith if you think we are. I think I can speak for all you are accusing, <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a>, by saying we have better things to do than make Barbara Schwartz look bad just for amusement. She has made herself a prominent figure in FOIA history. If she hadn't been so litigious she would not be notable, because there are millions of people out there with unconventional views. Sadly Ms. Schwarz's views make her the first and only person so far to use FOIA this way. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 03:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I will need to sleep on it. She is notable, I guess, for being the "informal queen of FOIA requests" but I think that the level of detail here goes well beyond her notability. I really think that if she were not the "whipping boy" for a clique of very active editors here then the fact that she filed a lot of FOIA requests and got a mention in the news would never even show up as a blip on the radar here and she would have no article at all. What does that mean and what do I think her article should look like? I will think about it. I do think this <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies
<blockquote>
<p>"If someone <b>appears</b> (emphasis added) to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources and a clear demonstration of relevance to the person's notability."</p>

I think I see material in the article that seems to be pushing an agenda by utilizing non-RS sources (usenet) or primary sources.

<p>I'm glad we agree that her FOIA history should be discussed, I also agree with you that the article could use some rewording or clarifications. Regarding her FOIA history, <i>some</i> of her ideas do need to be mentioned otherwise a reader is left to guess what she wanted to know so badly. For exmple, compare these three statements,</p>
<ul>
<li>Barbara Schwarz has filed more FOIA requests than anyone in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Barbara Schwarz has filed more FOIA requests than anyone in the United States. She has done this in an effort to confirm her memory of being born and living in a private submarine base in the Great Salt Lake. She also requested information to prove that she is the daughter of L Ron Hubbard and granddaughter of General Dwight Eisenhower, as well as information regarding someone named Marty Rathburn is being incarcerated after being convicted of her murder. (Someone other than the Scientologist, because obviously he wasn't convicted of killing Barbara Schwarz).</li>

Ms. Schwarz has also been arrested for trespassing at the White House, disorderly conduct in a Washington D.C. restaurant, and shoplifting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first statement does not provide enough information, but is accurate. The second statement includes only the information Ms. Schwarz sued for. It is also accurate and complete in explaining why she made so many FOIA requests. The third statement is also accurate, but includes information that is irrelevant to explain her FOIA situation. I don't see anything like statement number three in the article regarding her FOIA notability. Which part of the article is using manufactured notability? The <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyril_Vosper_e29f.html" title="Cyril Vosper">Cyril Vosper</a> incident seems notable too for several reasons revolving around the controversy that approach has generated. The section about her usenet activity explains why she wrote her biography there.</p>
<p>I did want to ask <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> if we could change the title section about her conspiracy theories to something more like Barbara Schwarz's Beliefs.

<dd>There are two points here. The first is whether the word "added" applies. It does. Words have more than one dictionary meaning. For instance "something joined onto or used with something else."<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/addition" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/addition" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and "to include"<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/add" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/add" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.

<dd>Again you are contradicting the dictionary (it is widely accepted that words have different meanings <i>depending on usage</i>), but that's your prerogative. As to the second point, I was attempting to be civil and humorous and foreshorten a pointless debate by supplying the dictionary definitions, but apparently that was to no avail. However, I continue to stand by the dictionary definitions, so you might want to address further disagreements to the publishers of any of the dictionaries quoted. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 19:56, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Did you look at my links? I am quoting dictionary definitions. They support my assertion that the word "added" was a proper description. To your second point, I think your brand of humor is not helpful. I suggest you stick to the issues and avoid further attempts at levity. I believe phrases like "...for those apparently unable to access a dictionary..." are insulting, not humorous. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 20:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Obviously my brand of humor is not useful, and I guess its not going to foreshorten a discussion, so I will explain. If I "added" the subhead, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>, what did I add it <i>to</i>? If you say I added it to that subhead, that's not true, because I clearly <b>replaced</b> that subhead. If you say I added it to the article, thats clearly inaccurate, because it implies I accepted what was there and made an addition to it without significantly altering what was there. False again, and improper usage. Why does this matter? Because by saying I "added" it, <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> is obfuscating the history of those edits, which is that I first challenged that entire non <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> section, and when that was reverted, I changed what I noted <i>twice</i> in my edit summaries was a strong disagreement with the subhead that I <b>replaced</b>, rather than added to. So in fact, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>, <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a>'s implication that I am some butterheaded editor who "adds" things and then complains about them later is what's insulting. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 20:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I cannot agree. Barbara Schwarz's abuse of the internet and of the Usenet <b>is</b> a notable fact, particularly in light of her legal threats against Wikipedia, and her repeated attempts to continue to edit Wikipedia via a battery of sockpuppets after being banned. Barbara Schwarz has initiated smear campaigns against Wikipedia, Jim Wales, Fred Bader, and other Wikipedia editors by abusing the internet. Also, she has violated the privacy of other Wikipedia editors, and made unwelcome research into their private lives. Schwarz's ban from the Salt Lake Library's internet access is the result of her abuse of the Usenet, and the original citation is the article was discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Newsgroup_activity" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Newsgroup_activity" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> prior to being added. It is not a POV push to state the fact that Schwarz was banned from the use of the Salt Lake Library's internet access after she abused it. <b>For the purpose of this discussion only,</b> it is worth noting Schwarz is the recipient of several kook "awards" as voted upon by posters to the Usenet in alt.usenet.kooks, who recognize abusers of the internet - not those who are merely heavy posters to the Usenet - in this manner. However for the purpose of the article, I do believe that Schwarz's Alt Usenet Kook Awards for Kook Of The Month and Golden Killfile Awards in May 2003 should not be mentioned in it. Including those awards would be reduce the article to tabloid journalism; making a NPOV statement about her banishment from internet access at the Library does not. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 03:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. While I am not disputing that she may have been the president (I have no idea) surely you can see that offering that as "proof" that the Schwarz referenced here as the subject of this article is one and the same the person mentioned on that form; offering that as "proof" is just ridiculous and BD's objection is well-founded. I get 7201 Schwarz just from switchboard.com and 29 Barbara Schwarz from intelius and that is just a partial sampling of the US. There are likely a couple hundred "Barbara Schwarz" in Germany and Europe. It just needs a better source.

<dd>Actually I'd call it a corroboration. Schwarz has said repeatedly in her Usenet posts (again, nobody disputes their authenticity) that she held this post from 1982 to 1984. The Salt Lake Tribune article refers to her membership of Scientology in Germany and her claim to have been "kicked out in the mid-1980s" - note that the timeframe fits. So we have two sources, Schwarz herself and the register, saying that she was the President of the CoS in Germany at this time. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 18:55, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How is it possibly a "corroboration?" (<b>corroboration</b>: noun: confirmation that some fact or statement is true). The SLC Tribune article says <i>She describes herself as a "nonorganized" scientologist who was "kicked out" of the church in Germany in the mid-1980s.</i> So she apparently never told the paper she was "president." As to her usenet postings, you can't possibly be saying that, given this whole discussion about the veracity of her claims, that this is to be taken as "corroboration."? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 19:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Respectfully though, how do you reconcile removing <b>all</b> information about her "conspiracy theories"? I agree with your belief that this is not the forum to list <i>all</i> of her thoughts and ideas about everything she wrote about in her posts, doing so would hold her up to ridicule for no reason. I truly regret that her reasons for pursuing FOIA requests so aggressively are driven by ideas that many people find ridiculous. The fact remains that those ideas directly related to her FOIA requests need careful mentioning. I've been trying to point out that if we wanted to make a POV argument about her sanity there is A LOT more we could have added to the article. For example Ms. Schwarz talks about waitresses and police conspiring with secret Nazi agents to get her thrown in jail for not ordering enough food. This idea is just as ridiculous as the idea that she is related to Hubbard or Eisenhower, but to my knowledge she hasn't filled FOIA requests about it. Therefore mentioning it in the article itself would be pushing a POV. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> I was under the impression you were looking to defend Ms. Schwarz from ridicule, but now I'm noticing your points seem to focus on her links with Scientology. Are you concerned about "anti-cultists" using her to somehow disparage Scientology? Speaking for myself, I have no interest in making a link between Barbara Schwarz and Scientology in order to make Scientology look bad. Again, if we were looking for a "poster child" against Scientology there are much better candidates out there. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/JeremyPerkins/" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/JeremyPerkins/" rel="nofollow">Jeremy Perkins</a> comes to mind, also <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_McPherson_0813.html" title="Lisa McPherson">Lisa McPherson</a>.

I really do not care about her Scn connection except where it is the lead-in to the article when it is far from what makes her "notable". That placement is agenda.

<dd>What more is possibly needed than to say she has filed requests about the man she says is her husband; Dwight Eisenhower; L.

<dd>Here's what Jimmy wales sez--""Real people are involved, and they can be hurt by your words. We are not tabloid journalism, we are an encyclopedia."

<p><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> seems pretty clear about the inadequacies in the current sourcing of this claim <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLP#Public_figures" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLP#Public_figures" rel="nofollow">here.</a>:<br />
<i>Where a fact has first been presented by a verifiable secondary source, it is acceptable to turn to open records as primary sources to augment the secondary source.

So the purported court document would seem allowable only if the claim that she was "President of Scientology" had been reported in a secondary source.

<dd>Let's review the evidence, shall we? Barbara Schwarz is German and was a Scientologist - both established facts. She says that she was president of the German CoS in the early-mid 1980s. Her testimony is a primary source. Verifying that testimony, we have documentary evidence from another primary source (the court document) which says that Barbara Schwarz was president of the German CoS at this time. <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a> suggests that the documented Schwarz and "our" Schwarz are in fact the same person. We would otherwise have to postulate a theory that "our" Schwarz has for some unknown reason taken on the identity of the documented Schwarz, complete with detailed accounts of what she did during this period. That's a textbook example of original research ("a novel narrative or historical interpretation" - <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), to say nothing of ignoring <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> says explicitly that "information supplied by the subject may be added to the article if [i]t meets verifiability, NPOV, and no original research policies." In this case, we have information from Schwarz that she was president of the German CoS, and we can verify this with German public records from the period in question. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 02:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Like, I say, I really don't care one way or the other. If she was then she was. I just find it interesting that we take her word, of all people, that she once headed up the German church. And the only supporting evidence is a possibly totally unrelated document. Maybe it is "common knowledge" amoung ARS devotees but I just wonder what exists that passes any possible test that this project might have for inclusion (other that the ubiquitous <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, of course). --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 02:14, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The problem is that besides Hubbard, the CoS doesn't seem to post records about former leaders in the U.S. (I assume CoS in Germany operates in a similar way.) In fact if you just went by what the church says on their site, there wasn't even a guy named Rathbun either going by Mark or Marty in a top position within the CoS. (A search I performed on their site for "Rathbun" met with 0 results.) In the interest of compromise, perhaps the article could say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ms. Schwarz <b>claims to have been elected</b> President of the Munich Scientology org in the 80's.

My position is that even though <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> may have a point about the information we have being sketchy it still bears including for a couple of reasons beyond the valid points <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a> have already mentioned.

<dd>The text is sourced per her 92-part series. She has described her arrests, her being put into different mental institutions, and her deprogramming.

<dd>And, with all due respect Tilman, your problem is that you know too much about the subject You are like a neighbor fighting another neighbor and trying to score points by listing their foibles on wikipedia. That is why you should recluse yourself. You cannot seem to distinquish between what is RS (high quality sources) for making derogatory statements about her here and what is not. That is why "less-knowledgable" editors should probably take the lead here. Her Usenet "bio" is not a source for you to justify posting derogs about her!

<p>So, let me get this straight, guys. According to what you're saying, if Tilman ever dislikes anything anyone adds to <i>his</i> article, all he has to do to get them removed as an editor is to pick a fight with them. Then, <i>because</i> he chose to embroil himself <i>and</i> the other editor in that dispute, that editor is now burdened with a "conflict of interest" and expected to recuse him or herself -- not because he or she did anything wrong, but merely because Tilman started a fight and thereby <i>created</i> a new "interest" which could should not be allowed to edit any articles regarding psychiatry? Miscavige identified one of the two goals of the Church of Scientology as "to eliminate psychiatry in all its forms", that sure sounds like a humdinger of a conflict of interest to me. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see. That is indeed a clarification.

Her banning from the Salt Lake City Public Library isn't relevant, because it has no bearing on her dealings with the FOIA.

<dl>
<dd>Chris, I do not agree with your reasons for its removal. The subject of the article is Barbara Schwarz, not an article about FOIA abuses. Therefore Barbara Schwarz's banning from the Library for internet abuse is entirely relevant to the subject of the article. As Schwarz was banned from the use of the Library's internet access for abuse of the internet, I do not see how the inclusion of these facts transgresses boundaries of privacy or unfairly intrudes into her personal life. It is a matter of public record that Schwarz was removed from library access due to the abuse of those facilities. If citing of Schwarz's abuse of the internet is a violation of privacy, it could be argued that the spammer <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Ralsky_0a8b.html" title="Alan Ralsky">Alan Ralsky</a>'s article must also intrude unfairly on his personal life - which would also be improper. Barbara Schwarz's abuse of the internet is mentioned on the Abusive Host Blocklist pages and is thus part of her notability, and is therefore noteworthy. Please also note that internet abuse and spamming activites are mentioned in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_versus_the_Internet_b7e1.html" title="Scientology versus the Internet">Scientology versus the Internet</a> and Schwarz's ban from the Salt Lake library's internet is a reflection of the results of following this scientology policy. Fred has also stated above that <i>The article needs to recount <b>her internet prominence</b> and a basic outline of the basis and nature of her freedom of information requests.</i> (emphasis added). For these reasons, I think this section on newsgroup activity should be restored, and ask that you restore it. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 01:14, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I've already said much the same thing in the biographical section and pointed to the relevant Google Groups link, the idea being that if you want more info about Schwarz, here it is. As for the ban from the SLC Library, why is it notable? People abuse library facilities all the time, and some get banned for it - but why is this inherently notable? Regarding Orsini's comments that her behaviour is "following this scientology policy", I find this hard to believe considering that she's not even a member of the CoS and (as far as I know) doesn't claim to be acting on its behalf.

<dd>While the question whether she is acting on behalf of scientology is indeed OR, so I am not asking it to be put back, but - FYI: she has posted about changes on RFW before others even noticed them, and had a WWW account with a scientologist provider for a long time. And after being kicked off the library, she suddenly had an internet account, a computer and a phone. --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 10:30, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chris, in response to you and adding to Tilman's comments with which I concur:</dd>
<dd>1. The article states <i>[Schwarz] describes herself as a "nonorganized" Scientologist</i>. While she may not be officially a member of scientology, by reason of describing herself as still retaining this philosphy, it is not unreasonable to expect that she would also still seek to further the objectives of scientology - which means following its policy. For example, one does not need to shave one's head or join the KKK to follow Nazi Party policy and to further its objectives.</dd>
<dd>2. I agree with you that by stating Schwarz is acting on behalf of the scientology organization itself is indeed speculation and OR, however her practice of following the doctrines or policies of scientology is not. I was not suggesting or implying any such statement should be included in the article; I was explaining the rationale for my assertation as to why the original deleted section should be restored intact. As Tilman has stated above re RFW, a new phone line and computer etc: it is widely speculated she is in the employ of scientology, but speculations have no place in the article.</dd>
<dd>3. To clarify Tilman's point re Barbara Schwarz's ban from the Salt Lake Library: her access to the internet there was banned specifically due to her abuse of the internet, not to a genaralized abuse of library facilities. Chris, while I agree with you that it is not uncommon for persons to be banned from library facilities for abuse of privileges, it is most uncommon and therefore notable that a State institution's internet IP addresses was blocklisted due to their non-response in dealing with the abusive activities of one client - and a non-employee at that. As Tilman states, this makes a very notable and very rare example of library policy enforcement.</dd>
<dd>4. You have stated the section covering her autobiography published on the Usenet is included in the article. However I think the current inaccurate section dealing with her biography should be moved into the restored <i>Newsgroup Activity</i> subheading with its original text, thus removing this redundancy. The aticle currently states: <i>During 2004, she posted a 92-part account of her life on the Usenet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology...</i> This statement is inaccurate, as those articles were written over a period of several years, from 2002 onwards. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 20:40, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, I noticed that the article seems to feel a need to repeat her <s>delusions</s> novel ideas in every single section which seems to me a bit much. For example, her otherwise unsupported "ideas" can hardly be called "Biographical material" without further support. Why not just mention them in the lead and, somewhere else, spell them out to the extent required to provide support for the rest of the article. Otherwise it seems to be an effort to hold her up to scorn unnecessarily. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 17:38, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We're not supposed to evaluate the accuracy of her claims, just their relevance to the rest of the article. I left in the bare minimum of her autobiographical claims, as they provide necessary context for her FOIA campaign. She believes that the US government is holding information on her because they apparently own the secret submarine base where she was born; she also believes that she's entitled to relief because she's a US citizen (or at least thinks she is); and her belief that she's married to Mark Rathbun is obviously central to the whole campaign. I don't think it's necessary to include the rest of her many claims but these three points provide an essential element of background to explain her reasons. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:31, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citizenship and birth?</span></h2>
<p>It might be worth mentioning that she was born/raised in Germany for several reasons. From a FOIA angle the CIA declined/ignored her requests because she is not a U.S. citizen. I think she appealed saying that she was trying to prove she was born in the U.S. and it's not fair to refuse her FOIA requests when they will prove she was born in the U.S. (If they existed of course.) It also seems relevant because the more I think about it, the more it occurs to me that the FOIA doesn't really apply to foreign nationals.</p>
<p>Moreover, during the last couple of years in the states there has been a lot of debate about illegal immigration and how they may be draining government resources. Many people equate "illegal immigrant" with latino immigrants. As Ms. Schwarz proves, one need not be from Mexico to be an illegal immigrant. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 21:10, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anynobody, please note this issue has been discussed before. In summary:</dd>
<dd>1. Barbara Schwarz is a German citizen, as she has often stated she holds a German birth certificate (citations are in this Talk page's archives).</dd>
<dd>2. The case summary for <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/1999/05/99-4016.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/1999/05/99-4016.htm" rel="nofollow">Schwarz v CIA, No. 99-4016 (D. Utah) (D.Ct. No. 97-CV-85-B)</a> clearly states the court was unpersuaded by her contention that she knows she is a United States citizen because she remembers being born in the United States. Her memories do not meet the standards of Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b)(2). Please also note she was attempting to obtain files from governmental departments who deal with issues of national security at the time.</dd>
<dd>3. Her actual immigration status in the United States is uncertain. Thus, it cannot be stated in the article that she resides in the United States illegally until there is evidence of this.</dd>
<dd>4. It is possible that similar arrangements were made for her as was done in the case of Antje Victore [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cults_and_governments#_note-5" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cults_and_governments#_note-5" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>] but this is only speculation, and speculations don't belong in a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 21:14, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> I have indeed read the past discussions, however my point does not appear to be addressed in way that answers all my questions. To your point, speculation and OR must be avoided of course. However, we do know her status as she has admitted it herself and has been pointed out by the government. To understand why I feel confident in making that assurance, let me explain, a little about how the CIA operates. As we both pointed out, she was denied info from them. This is indeed for strict security reasons but only because the CIA like all intel agencies, doesn't share ANY information with non U.S. citizens. If I were to write them regarding the same issue, as a US citizen I would probably get a reply indicating that the CIA doesn't deal with matters like familial relationships of US citizens. It simply isn't their job, and they are actually limited by law regarding operations on U.S. soil. The CIA's mandate is foreign intelligence collection, keeping track of intelligence matters her in the US are the people of the FBI's counter-intelligence division. If they (the CIA) felt helpful, they would probably refer me to the FBI for the kind of info she is asking for.</dd>
<dd>Respectfully, <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> if the federal courts of the U.S. say a person is not a U.S. citizen shouldn't we AGF on their part?

<dd>There is other information indicating her status, in one of the articles about her, most likley the SLC Tribune, she mentioned how the government could throw her out of the country if they wanted to. I also read the very good summary you made of her USENET posts, she admits arriving in 1989 on a visitation visa. If I remember correctly, when she was arrested one time, she expected the judge to "give her papers" to get citizenship and instead she ended up being sent to a state mental hospital. Unless a person is going to school, or working here there is no way a vistor visa would be extended until 2007. The difference between Antje Victore and Barbara Schwarz is that Ms. Schwarz didn't/hasn't requested asylum as Antje Victore did. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 22:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anynobody, the US Federal Court stated she was a German citizen at the time of the case in 1990, and it is <i>possible</i> her immigration status has changed since then. But there's no proof it did, or it did not. I agree with you that a visitor's visa would not be extended until 2007. For example, the US Temporary Visitor's Visa (issued under the Visa Waiver Program) permits a maximum stay of 90 days in the US, and applications cannot be made by visitors entering the country under this privelege to extend that time while the visitor is still present in the United States. Under the progam, there are strict conditions imposed - applicants cannot undertake employment, attend an educational institution (this requires a different visa and application), apply to extend the visit, and they waive any rights to appeal being denied entry. I do not know the asylum application process; I know only that a process exists and there is a legal framework for it, and so I do not know if asylum applications are published. However I would presume such delicate matters like this would be done confidentially. The Antje Victore immigration case got attention after certain facts became known after her application was successfully made. It's uncertain if Schwarz has applied for refugee status, and I do not believe there is a legitimate way to confirm or refute speculation that she <i>may</i> have applied for asylum. The quote from the Salt Lake Tribune is noted where it was stated she knew she could be deported; could this action be done equally to a refugee granted asylum, or to an illegal alien, either of whom may have filed many frivolous and taxpayer funded court cases seeking nonexistant evidence of submarine bases, murdered cult husbands, Nazi brain implants, and presidental paternity? A refugee is still a guest of the host country, and not generally considered a citizen until he or she applies for citizenship. It's also possible that Schwarz was granted a status of LPA under an amnesty The article cannot state she is an illegal alien if her status is unknown. With regards to your questions: could you please clarify them? <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 00:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I appreciate the concerns you have expressed, honestly I don't want to accuse anyone of anything that can not be proven. However, <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> I must respectfully point out that some of the information you cite is incorrect or unrelated, for example the case I was referring to was actually from 1999 not 1990 and it has been appealed since then as well. The unrelated info is about the nature of work/school visas, unless you were explaining the difference for any readers who might not know. To that end, a person on a visitors visa can get employment or go to school as long as they apply for and get the new appropriate visa. Back to Ms. Schwarz, the court documents are not the only source because she did after all admit as much in her biography. To be clear, I'm not saying she should be labelled an illegal alien. I'm advocating a sentence like: "Ms. Schwarz entered the US on a visitor visa in 1989 which has presumably expired, her current status is unknown." and then maybe a link to <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States_be7f.html" title="Illegal immigration to the United States">U.S. Immigration information</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 01:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your clarifaction. Thank you also for pointing out my typo with regards the date of the court case. The point I made still stands; it's possible a change in status may have happened since the court case. However, the visa information is relevant to this discussion, because you've stated it is possible to extend a visitor's visa, and according to information at the State Department and ICE websites, it is not done in the way you suggest. I think it's important to point out that, as her immigration status is unknown, it may be inappropriate to label her an illegal alien etc, and I am glad you concur. While I think the statement you suggest adding to the article is a good addition, please note that cult symapathisers wish to see the article deleted as an attack article, and the addition of a link to the place you suggested my be viewed as pushing a negative POV with regards to the subject. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 00:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that she meets the barest minimum of notability requirements. Of course, the only real reason she is here is because some editors here have an agenda to discredit Scientology so the fact that this poor woman was once associated with Scientology and that Scientology plays a prominent part in her delusions and her internet abuse guarantees her a nice long article here going into considerable depth to the non-notable parts of her story. I, as a Scientologist, could care less about her having an article (and I wonder what part the "deprogramming" played in her current condition, but that is beside the point).

<dd>Do not try to change the subject from your acts of deliberate disruption to your inaccurate and blind allegations of what I supposedly feel about Barbara. I do not think she is an evil person, I think she is a mentally ill person. I do not think she deserves to be attacked and I do not think she is <i>being</i> attacked. I think that by her record number of FOIA requests and the nearly unprecedented response she has provoked she has made herself notable, and the fact that this is something that she may not want to be notable for, or that <i>you</i> might wish she wasn't notable for, is <i>irrelevant</i>, just as these accusations are absolutely <i>irrelevant</i> to your acts of deliberate disruption. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:30, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do not think she is being "attacked". She is "just" being held up to scorn and ridicule. She is being turned this way and that so that all can get a good look at the "crazy Scientologist". All in the most "encyclopaedic fashion", of course. If we really only thought she was notable for FOIA requests then there would not be much more than that here and a mention of her delusions that underlie her requests. Actually, if we really only thought she was notable for FOIA requests then there would just be a mention under "Trivia" in the FOIA article. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 17:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's obviously untrue, Steve. The article lists how her internet activity brought her to light in anti-spam circles. They're STILL interested in her, as her spamming continues to this day.

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a>, you can certainly put her on both pages. Please bear in mind though that she has a sort of inverse importance relative to both figures. That is, Hubbard and Ike mean a lot more to Ms. Schwarz than she did to either. I doubt Hubbard even knew her, and I'm confident Ike didn't. I can't guarantee that the editors working those pages will feel the same way about her as you do though, so I'd recommend mentioning the idea on their respective talk pages before editing or the other editors may indeed cite <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</dd>
<dd>Please remember, the Hubbard-Ike-Schwarz connection is part of her motivation to pursue her FOIA requests which is why they are mentioned here.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Biographical information" edit warring</span></h2>
<p>A few editors are reverting my removal of the below from the "Biographical information" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schwarz says that she was born around 1956 in a submarine village beneath the Great Salt Lake in Utah, where she lived until she was kidnapped and taken into Germany at age 4 by Nazi agents. She says that she later married a prominent Scientologist, Mark Rathbun, whom she says was imprisoned on the false charge of having killed her.</p>

<p>I find this inclusion disingenuous and an abuse of wikipedia. I daresay that the editors that insert this material know full well that it is NOT "Biographical information" but is delusory information. There is no RS that this is anything more than Schwarz' stated beliefs and not a one of these editors would consider her an RS on the subject. The "Biographical information" section should contain only material that is actual "Biographical information", not delusions not supported by any RS whatsoever. Please stop putting KNOWN non-RS material in a section that should be trustworthy. THAT is abuse of the project.

<dd>Let me repost something I said above, as you've not responded to it:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We're not supposed to evaluate the accuracy of her claims. I left in the bare minimum of her autobiographical claims, as they provide necessary context for her FOIA campaign. She believes that the US government is holding information on her because they supposedly own the secret submarine base where she says she was born; she also believes that she's entitled to relief because she's supposedly a US citizen; and her belief that she's married to Mark Rathbun is obviously central to the whole campaign. I don't think it's necessary to include the rest of her many claims but these three points provide an essential element of background to explain her reasons. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 20:54, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>This is something that the subject of the article has stated that she believes but no other substantiation is presented. When it is presented in the article, it is also attributed to Schwarz and presented as "Schwarz believes", and not as undisputable fact.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't think we should be in the business of including only autobiographical information that we can corroborate. Many of our biographical articles include autobiographical information that can't realistically be corroborated with any external source (details of private life, beliefs etc). Furthermore, while it's certainly true that the claims aren't believable, they're central to Schwarz's reasons for mounting her FOIA campaign in the first place - omitting them will leave the article without any explanations for her activities. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> It is very unfortunate that the actions for which she is notable depend so heavily on her unique view of reality. This view is indeed one which is held up to ridicule by many, sadly there will always be people who find others misfortunes entertaining. The truth is that her delusions by themselves are not notable, as millions of people globally experience delusions everyday. Some of them became notable when she acted on them and affected hundreds if not thousands of employees of various state and federal agencies. Other misperceptions of reality which she believes are not appropriate for mention because she has not pursued them in the same way through FOIA. I believe the best way to address concerns about defamation or intent to ridicule, is to only mention "delusional" information she has sued for. This can be confirmed in a RS like <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" rel="nofollow">Memorandum Opinion Dismissing Case as Frivolous, Judge John D.

<li><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> It is my understanding that the whole Barbara Schwarz article is a biographical one. If I understand your specific request seems to treat sections within the article as being biographical. For example you agree that the info is notable, just not as "Biographical information". You also say it shouldn't be expunged from this article, but it seems like that is exactly what you want.

<li>This RfC has a very specific question that, I think, is clearly presented. Please let me know if that is not the case. Her delusional material is presented . . . and again . . . and again . . . and again. No opportunity is missed. One opportunity that, as a minimum, should be given a pass is in presenting what is <b>known</b> about her biography. We do a disservice to her and to the reader by presenting such material as "Biographical information". If you would care to comment on that issue, I would be interested in what you have to say.

<li>The whole article is a biography. Just because one section contains the word "biographical" does not make the other sections any less biographical. Moving the content would change nothing. The information is fine, and having it in that section is also fine. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I asked you to address this below but I see that you do here, so thanks. Presenting this material as the beliefs that underlie her FOIA requests does not make it "Biographical information" if by that we mean true data about the things that have happened in her life. The section headers have meaning and that section should be reserved for things that are known to be true (or at least likely). --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 01:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> If your issue is where on the page the info appears; we could move the delusional info to the "FOIA history" section. I just think you should understand that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies to <i>entire</i> articles, not sections of them. The entire article about Barbara Schwarz is of the biographical type (as opposed to an article about a work of fiction or a historical event). When you say it (info about her belief of her biography) should not be included under the biographical info section, you are saying it should not be in this article. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 01:23, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hey, cool, you get my point, so thanks. Do you also see that saying that cetain beliefs form the basis for her FOIA activity is quite different from saying that those same beliefs are "Biographical information"? Let's just put all the "unsupportable" (to be generous) material in the FOIA section then. That has been my point all along and why the article is protected again and why I started this to RfC work past the impasse. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 03:19, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Justanother, Steve Dufour has called attention recently to <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words to avoid</a>. That page cautions against the use of the word "claim" in a sentence such as the following: "Paranoid schizophrenics typically <b>claim</b> that some people are tracking their movements in an attempt to harm them." This is given as an example of dubious usage of the word "claim". Why is it dubious? Because it implies that these beliefs are not true -- even though in the context they are almost <i>by definition</i> delusions. It seems that policy is pretty clear on this point already, but it seems as though what you are saying is that <i>because of the context</i> (i.e., that <i>we</i> believe Schwarz's accounts of a submarine village under the Great Salt Lake, etc. to be delusions) we should exclude the POV of <i>the subject of the article</i> about what her biographical information is from the "Biographical Information" section. Well, there is in fact some policy that supports actions in the form of "policy as written says one thing but the context suggests something different." That policy is <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a>. Given how fervently you have decried WP:IAR in the past over matters far smaller than <i>completely excluding the POV of the subject of an article</i>, there would be an obvious problem if you tried to invoke it here. Even if you were to do so, WP:IAR should be invoked only very cautiously. "The rules say one thing, but there's no evidence that anyone ever foresaw how the rules would apply to this particular situation" is an argument that <i>might</i> hold some weight. That argument does not apply here, however, because clearly <i>it was</i> foreseen that we might need to write about a POV that everyone but the subject would agree was delusional. Now. If you would care to examine alternatives, the alternative that I would suggest is that we start the biographical section with a sentence along the lines of "Unchallenged biographical information about Schwarz is hard to obtain," follow that with the best biographical sketch we are able to compose from reliable sources, and then follow that with Schwarz's account of the same time frames. This way Schwarz's POV is in the section where it has to be but it is clearly marked as her account and clearly contrasted with a more reasonable account. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:01, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

That being, even under a different heading name like "FOIA history" doesn't change it being "Biographical Information", because it's in a biographical article. An article about a person is a biographical article, regardless of the sections it includes each and every section should directly deal with a part of the persons life. Please have a look at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/biographical" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/biographical" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary: biographical</a>. It's because I understand your point that, unfortunately, we must discuss this impasse further as it proposes a contradiction. That being, you advocate keeping information in a biographical article under a section not to include the term biographical in it's title. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a> summed it up perfectly: "Moving the content would change nothing."

<li>While there may be a point there I really think that "the devil is in the details". The simplicity of it is that her delusions have no place in a section entitled "Biographical information". Going yet again to the dictionary:
<blockquote>
<p>Biographical - Containing, consisting of, or relating to the facts or events in a person's life.</p>
</blockquote>
The biographical relevance of her beliefs are 1) they are her beliefs and 2) they are the basis of her FOIA actions. They are in no way <i>facts or events</i> in her life. They have no place in that "Biographical information" section. Does that clear it up? Do you see what I see? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 03:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> I see you do not want to include information regarding her delusional beliefs about her past in a biographical section of the Barbara Schwarz article. You do not see that every section under an article about a person named Barbara Schwarz is biographical, whether or not the word is in the title. To see what I believe you see, I would have to accept a contradiction;</p>
<ol>
<li>The delusions are relevant to her FOIA motivation and should be mentioned</li>
<li>Delusions do not belong in a biography</li>
</ol>
<p>Delusion can be relevant if it motivates one to do things which affect others, and even though they don't happen for everyone they are very real to the people who are having them. A similar, more dramitic, example is <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_J._Guiteau_2d27.html" title="Charles J. Guiteau">Charles J. Guiteau</a>. He got it in his head that is he campaigned for McKinley, then he (Guiteau) would be appointed ambassador to France. Since this promise was in his head, he became enraged when he was not sent to his ambassadorship in France and then assassinated McKinley. If Guiteau had gone to his grave feeling slighted and done nothing about it, his delusion of a Presidential appointment is irrelevant. In this case the delusion drove him to murder a man, and please do not think I am saying Barbara Schwarz is anywhere near a murderer. The only thing she shares in common with Guiteau is a false view of reality and desire to right a misperceived wrong and took action. Because they did take action, and because those actions affected others, the delusions that drove them to it are notable. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 04:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anynobody, I really see no contradiction at all. She has delusions. Those delusions led to her making all these FOIA requests. Those delusions are not facts about her life. She is not LRH's daughter or whatever. They are not facts. They have no place in a section section section entitled "Biographical information". This is not jumping through hoops. This seems to me a no-brainer. Mention the delusions. For kindness sake and lack of RS call them "beliefs" instead of "delusions" but we all know what they are. Mention them as her beliefs in the FOIA section. Not in the "Biographical information". That is my entire point. I know ChrisO gets my point 'cause I have seen his writing. I am sure other "anti-Scientologists" do too. This is not about Scientology. I want to say it is about common sense but I do not mean to be insulting, just exasperated.

For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)</a> describes guidelines for writing articles about works of fiction such as <font color="#5BE85B">Disney Characters, Star Wars, and Moby Dick.</font></li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28legal%29_824c.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (legal)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (legal)</a> describes how to write a proper article about legal matters such as <font color="#E7AF97">Strict Nature Reserves, murder, and local ordinances.</font></li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28biographies%29_010f.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)</a> describes the proper way to create an article about people like <font color="#0000FF">George W Bush, Rasputin, or Barbara Schwarz</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the page as you edited it works for me, it shouldn't work for you based on the arguments you've been putting forth. Your argument is that information about her delusional beliefs should not be included in a <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font> section since it is not part of her <font color="#0000FF">biography</font>. Your solution is to change the name of the section in question so it is not <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font>. Respectfully your view is missing the bigger picture of what a <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font> article is. Using your logic, you or I could add anything to any article about a person as long as it doesn't mention the word <font color="#0000FF">biography</font> in the section heading. To prevent this from happening every section of a <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font> article is by definition <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font> in nature. Simply changing the name of the section within the article about Barbara Schwarz does not change the fact that the article is a <font color="#0000FF">biography</font>. The sections are each parts of her <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font> article. It can't logically be argued that information inappropriate for a <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font> section of an article about a person is appropriate elsewhere in the article. In other words every section of a <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font> article is supposed to conform to the rules about <font color="#0000FF">biographical</font> information. This is the contradiction I was talking about yesterday, I hope it makes more sense today. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 05:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Anynonbody. Actually I still think that you are missing my point. A section specifically specifically specifically entitled "Bio Info" should clearly include only those facts and details about her life that are known or likely. If someone were to believe that she were a robot and, based on that belief, commited some crime then the "Bio info" section would not say:
<blockquote>
<p>Jones says she is a <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot.html" title="Robot">robot</a>. She says she has a robot husband, William Sr. and two robot children, William Jr., 6, and Jenny, 8. She says that she was manufactured in Kansas and moved to NYC where she worked as a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_designer.html" title="Graphic designer">graphic designer</a> from 1988 to 1996. She then went back to university where she studied <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a> . . . "</p>
</blockquote>
No, that would be silly. The robot bit would be discussed in relation to her crime.
<blockquote>
<p>Jones stole motor oil, claiming that she was a robot and had a robot family to feed.</p>
</blockquote>
I hope that clarifies my issue. And since my mod works for both of us, let's say we propose it as a solution to this dispute. Thanks --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 12:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> I promise you, I understand your point. You are saying that a biographical section <i>should clearly include only those facts and details about her life that are known or likely</i>. My point is that the ENTIRE ARTICLE should clearly include only those facts and details about her life that are known or likely because the ENTIRE ARTICLE should be composed of biographical information when it's about a person. Your point is her beliefs about her history are not known and not likely. If I agreed with your belief that it shouldn't be included in a section describing a persons biography, that belief would carry forward to the article as a whole. Please don't take this as sarcasm: How can you say the info is inappropriate for a biographical section, but is appropriate for a biographical article? An article is made up of sections, each section in a biography should list biographical information don't you think? Otherwise it isn't a biographic article. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 22:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Anynobody. What did you think of my robot analogy? Does that clarify my point for you? BTW, one of the lessons that wikipedia has taught me is that you do not always get the other to see things exactly as you would like (and certainly not to act as you would like but that is another topic). The important thing is that you work out a compromise that both are comfortable with. So if you are comfortable with my proposal, rather that try to get me to think the way you want me to (and vice versa), let's just call it the compromise. Sound good? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 22:39, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I assure you I am not trying to be obstinant. At this point I'm trying to get you to see that you have accidentally selectivly applied Wiki policy to come to this compromise (seriously I don't believe you are noticing your error or doing this on purpose). If I'm right then we are sure to encounter problems again in the future because one of us doesn't understand some basic facts about Wikipedia. I don't mean to give the impression that I can't possibly be wrong about this, and if I am I'll accept whatever feedback I get. Your view is that a section ceases to be biographic if the word "biographic" is removed from the title of said section (Correct me if I'm wrong). Your robot analogy seems to be arguing this point; some info doesn't belong in a section titled biographic (Again, correct me if I'm wrong). To understand my point we first assume you are right about the info not belonging in a biographical section because it violates the rules regarding what a biography is. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies to entire articles (every section of it). The core of my point is this; the BLP rule applies to every section in a biography article. You have successfully resolved a (possible) violation by changing the nature of the section under which the disputed info appears. This appears to fix the issue with the section, but because the section is in a biographic article the nature of the article hasn't changed. Again, how can you correct a violation of BLP by simply changing a section name when the info itself appears as part of a biographic article? Seriously, this is the second time I've asked you to explain why rules about a section of an article can take priority over the rules for an entire article which in this case are the same set of rules. Unless you are saying that the rules for an article are less strictly applied than the rules for a section of the article? On the subject of whether a person's delusional belief should count as part of a biography, I was watching <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Beautiful_Mind_%28film%29_f91e.html" title="A Beautiful Mind (film)">A Beautiful Mind (film)</a> and realized that a person's delusions do happen to them in their mind. They have to be convinced delusions didn't happen, and until that happens they operate as if the delusions are real. Their actions reflect the influence of the delusions as if they had actually happened, like Ms. Schwarz did when she embarked on her legal quest. Even though the delusions don't happen in real life, it is because they affect real life that they are worthy for mention here. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 04:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

While I am pretty sure that I get your point (it does not matter where we say "Barbara Schwarz believes X" as it all falls under the super-heading of bio) I cannot seem to make you see that that statement being placed as her reasoning for her FOIA requests is different than that statement being presented as "Biographical information".

<dd>Bingo, <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a>, you've hit it on the head and made an excellent case for why all of that information regarding her "delusions" etc should be summarily excised from the article per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. We are writing a biography here (on an extremely marginal, barely notable fellow human being) not a psychohistory, a screenplay, or any such thing. What makes you are I or anyone here knowledgeable or competent enough to conclude that her actions result from her "delusions?" You are making an entirely original research claim--and one that clearly violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>--to wit, putting up an artcile that says "here's her delusional beliefs, in her own words, here are some things she has done, like file lotsa FOIA requests, now, fellow armchair psychohistorians, lets put two and two together and conclude that A caused B, and not have to worry about bothersome niceties such as seconadary sources, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or any such thing because we are all just so durn clever and superior to this silly woman who is banned from defending herself here that we can make pseudo-smartypants psychobable conclusions about why she did what.

As an "outsider" to the whole dispute, I have to say, this group seems no less, and perhaps far more obsessive than poor Ms S by a long shot. Added to the obsession is a cruelty in the manner that this group bands together as a wolf-pack and almost rabidly and ferociously defends even the slightest questioning of their use of Wikipedia for acting out their obsession (witness the responses by members of this group on my current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#BabyDweezil_redux:_proposing_a_one-month_block" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#BabyDweezil_redux:_proposing_a_one-month_block" rel="nofollow">ANI</a>--you'll notice that they are the ones howling repeatedly most loudly for blood and vengeance.

<p><a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a>, I wasn't saying that your position solved the basic dispute about content.

My point was that if he feels that such info should not be included in a biographic section of an article, those rules would also have to apply to a biographic article as a whole which I see as your argument. It is important to understand that I disagree with you, and feel that some of the information does belong in the article. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> seems to genuinely care about following the rules in good faith, if it were obvious that he didn't care I would not have spent this much time trying to explain that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies to everything.

Both editors claim affinity with the scientology organization, which can reasonably presumed to be embarressed about the actions of its former German president. The scientology organization is clearly embarressed by her actions, with scientology spokesperson Linda Simmons Hight's statement of "we're cluessless about this person". <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&amp;p_theme=sltb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields(Schwarz)%20AND%20date(5/11/2003%20to%205/11/2003)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=5/11/2003%20to%205/11/2003)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22Schwarz%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no" class="external autonumber" title="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&amp;p_theme=sltb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields(Schwarz)%20AND%20date(5/11/2003%20to%205/11/2003)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=5/11/2003%20to%205/11/2003)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22Schwarz%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></dd>

Justanother, just say the word if you wish to escalte this matter; if I had made a personal attack on you, you'd know about it. Please stop making false accusations and disrupting Wikipedia. You have failed to address any point I made above with regards to your RfD - in particular point 1, regarding your claim that the Usenet was the primary source for these biographical delusions, and point 2 which addresses <b>what she states</b> consists of the facts / events in her life. As her FOIA <s>abuses</s> requests have not any uncovered evidence to support them, they must be identified as her claims and not a factual account, and I think mentioning them in the "Biographical information" section is appropriate in these circumstances.

<p>Oh, pu-leese, Orsini. You clearly implied that I was a troll and not to be "fed". Why would I escalate this, I already gave you the warning it deserves. If you don't want to own up to calling me a troll then so be it. Trust me, I am hardly unable to defend my positions. Your questions do not, in my opinion, address the subject of this RfC, which is that "Bio info" section should be limited to facts or likely facts, not "beliefs" that are highly suspect. There are other sections of the article where those fit better. And regarding your repeated and somewhat <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack of this RfC (that is what you mean by RfD, no?) as "frivolous and disruptive"; well, if I told you what I really think then you would have the valid charge of <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">WP:PA</a>.

<dd>Oh, man, Anynobody. And here I had a high opinion of you. Oh well. Let me give you my standard schpeel. I take the reference to "collusion" as a bald-face lie and a personal attack. Take a look please at the definition of collusion:
<blockquote>
<p>Collusion - A secret agreement between two or more parties for a fraudulent, illegal, or deceitful purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
Now 1) exactly just how <i>secret</i> is it? and 2) how is it <i>fraudulent, illegal, or deceitful</i> for me to state that the article should first be cleaned up to comply with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and then see if it is deserving of AfD or not?

<p>Honestly <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> I used that word very carefully, I do not mean to insult you but what I cited on your talk page is collusion regarding the Barbara Schwarz article, which I will explain. Let me first explain that I will be as thorough as I can in an effort to prove that I have given great thought to making this accusation. First the secrecy aspect; when you discuss a plan to have the article deleted with another editor from that page on a separate page you are having a secret conversation. If I hadn't become curious about your sudden change in tone and checked your talk page, I would not have seen the discussion. If it weren't secret then why not have the discussion here? The collusion I believe you are attempting to commit is being done by you and <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> . If I misunderstood your discussion please explain what you meant when you said "The article should be cut down to what notable parts it may have and then perhaps AfD." which by itself I could accept if you hadn't called the article a "dirty corner of Wikipedia". It sounds to me like you and <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> are working together to get the article removed by advocating the removal of information until there is not enough information left to justify it's existence on Wikipedia by feigning editing concerns. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 04:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I can AGF with you, Anynobody, as you have never given me cause not to. Yes, you misunderstood my words. First, thinking that a talk page is somehow a "secret conversation" is a bit of a stretch but let's forget that one.

<dd>"you (BD) seem to have an affinity for the organization" Why, because he is my wikifriend and I am the most obvious Scientologist here? That sounds more like an affinity for me (aw shucks). Because he fights against the abuse of wikipedia, i.e. the use of it as a propaganda medium, by a group of POV-pushers (or, as you'all call them, "anti-Scientologists")? That sounds more like an affinity for truth, justice, and the wikipedian way. If I had to guess, I would say that, before meeting me, he probably did not give much thought to Scientology at all and he may well think it is the most dangerous cult in existence but Justanother sounds like a nice guy, the poor sap.

Personally, my views of L. Ron Hubbard as I've encountered his legacy through U.S. Navy records and FBI correspondence keep me from looking into what Scientology believes. I'm not sure I want to know, but I do know that right now the U.S. government lists Scientology as a religion. I see your point about getting experience dealing with intolerant people, it's smart but on the flip side it must be a pain in your posterior all the same.

<li><b>The information should stay - the current section is fine</b> - I came to this article very recently, so I don't know the full history of edit warring and I don't care to know. I have commented a few times in the section above and I have reverted a few attempts to remove information from the article. I have no desire to either promote Scientology or to bash it. I have never had any conflict with Barbara Schwarz in this or any other forum. It is clear to me that the subject's views, however delusional they may be, are important to understanding her as a person and her drivers for filling so many Freedom of Information requests. It would be a dis-service to our readers to take out this information from the biography. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:07, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>You did not make the RfC very clear (in my opinion at least) that the only two possible outcomes were to leave the information in this particular section or to move it to a different section in the article. If those are the only two options, then you may want to clarify your wording.</li>
<li>I don't think BD wants to keep it all - so it is certainly very relevant for people to remark that they want the information to stay. And Steve has already said he wants the information to be removed. Your selective labeling of my comment as a "straw man" argument was not very nice, was not accurate, and shows that you are campaigning against all comments that don't agree with your view.</li>
<li>As I explain above, I am not a long-time editor to this article. I don't know Barba Schwarz, and I am not for or against Scientology. Therefore, I don't consider myself involved. You are free to disagree, but you are not free to move my comments again. To pose a question back to you: Why are you so worried about where I comment? I suggest that you take a less argumentative stance and just welcome comments. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I am free to disagree and I do. You have already argued that the article should be a certain way and therefore, you have a stated position, and you are not non-involved. I am not being argumentative, simple stating a fact. This is not the section for "neutral editors that have already been involved here" which is how I imagine that you would describe yourself. It is for previously non-involved editors. Re my statement of the RfC, well, it is a wiki, you can edit it. But I think it is clear enough especially when the first line of my comment is that the material should remain somewhere in the article. So rather than complain about me 'cause I complained about you first, would you like to address the issue of the RfC? Thanks. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 00:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One of the issues with this RfC is how it is presented. It is not OK to say, "It is a wiki, you can edit it." Not after others have already commented. It is also not OK for you to say that the reader will be able to figure it out by reading your comment. How are they to even know you wrote the RfC? Why should they have to read your viewpoint in order to properly parse the meaning of the RfC? You are eseentially saying they have to read and understand your view on the RfC before they can understand and comment on the RfC. That is very improper. The RfC should be posed in as neutral a manner as possible. Also, I reiterate that it is unfair to criticize my post for saying the material should remain while you choose not to criticize those who say it should be removed entirely. You are being very selective in your criticisms by only criticizing those who are not agreeing with your position. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for responding to the RfC, <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a>.

Under WP:V it says "Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, usenet postings and blogs are <b>largely</b> not acceptable as sources." Emphasis added on largely because there are exceptions, when you say USENET posts are banned it implies that they are never acceptable. Also, please look closely at WP:RS, it DOES mention USENET as a possible exception (emphasis added): 5 Self-published sources (online and paper) 5.1 Bulletin boards, wikis and posts to <b>Usenet</b> Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or comments on blogs, should not be used as sources. This is in part because we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them, and in part because there is no editorial oversight or third-party fact-checking.

<dd>It's worth pointing out that there are already well-established examples of Usenet being used - entirely uncontroversially - as a source, particularly in computer science articles: see for instance <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a>, which quotes Usenet postings by <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linus_Torvalds_1ecb.html" title="Linus Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> and others (simply because that's where they were communicating with others during the development of Linux). The key issue is that normally "we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them", but in this case we do - the Salt Lake City article explicitly attributes Schwarz's Usenet autobiography to Schwarz's authorship, and she's always publicly claimed authorship as well. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 01:53, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not saying that the deprogramming attempt was justified or good, but there are probably people out there who are debating the entire concept of deprogramming.

<p>Excuse me, I must have missed something. Justanother is now making large-scale changes and implying that these changes have consensus because they were produced at User:Anynobody/Sandbox.(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=112122178&amp;oldid=112119110" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=112122178&amp;oldid=112119110" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>) Try as I might, I can't seem to find any discussion that indicates a consensus agreement to adopt without further discussion any text produced at User:Anynobody/Sandbox. If there was such a consensus, it should be pointed out so that all can find it; if there was no such consensus, then this action is very improper. Sandbox pages are (as the name implies) for experimenting and trying different options <b>without</b> being constrained by anything you produce automatically winding up in the live production version, and yet it seems that editing experiments which were conducted in a private user sandbox are being presented, not <b>for</b> consensus, but <b>as</b> consensus. Of course, if someone can show me the discussion where the larger group of editors here actually endorsed sight unseen whatever came out of the editing experiments privately conducted by a much smaller group of editors, I will gladly withdraw the question. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:23, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

(55) This means that agencies such as the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Intelligence_Agency_295c.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Security_Agency_8130.html" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a>, and even some parts of the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_d581.html" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> and the new <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Homeland_Security_2981.html" title="Department of Homeland Security">Department of Homeland Security</a> may refuse to process such requests. (56)</i> As a non-American citizen theoretically she could be representing another government. I strongly doubt she is of course, and I'm guessing the CIA probably knows she isn't either but because she <i>could be</i> they gave her a brush off. The CIA isn't known for being "open", so any excuse they have to not say something is used. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 22:05, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this case it does have to do with Ms. Schwarz. She has not only sued the CIA but also the NSA as well. She appears to have not requested information from the counterintelligence dept of the FBI (which is the part of the FBI mentioned in the quote). These agencies (CIA and NSA) appear to have ignored her requests. Were she in fact a U.S. citizen they would have processed the request. (Please understand by "process" I mean either approve or decline, but as part of the process a response would be received). <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 22:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If you look at articles like <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evel_Knievel_06fd.html" title="Evel Knievel">Evel Knievel</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a> or <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_van_Gogh_769c.html" title="Vincent van Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a>, you see that nationality is one of the primary descriptive terms. I really could care less about where it appears but if are going to have an article here then data like her nationality and where she lives are the most basic data that would be included. And Tilman, Bullock is not a German-American, she is an American. My mom is a German-American (born in Germany); I am an American (born here).

The question of whether it's interesting is secondary and irrelevant when the information is tied to the subjects notability.

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> also says: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability. Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability. Once notability is established, primary sources may be used to add content.

I promise you I am only interested in her notability as it relates to her FOIA and the deprogramming attempt made on her. I have doubts about her abusive nature on USENET being mentioned, but since she posted her autobiography on it the fact that she has a well documented USENET may be minor notability there. Having browsed through the 92 part autobiography I can assure you I am not looking to put all of it in the article. Much of what is in the writing should be left in Ms. Schwarz's own words, but the parts relevant to her beliefs/motives for filing litigation must be mentioned in a way that does not imply derision, but must all the same be mentioned. Her lack of US citizenship/birth certificate was a factor which relieved some of the agencies she filed requests with of any responsibility to respond to said requests. Because of the intimate relation with the FOIA matter means it too must be mentioned. Information I see as out of bounds are things like her arrests at the White House, a supermarket, and a restaurant. I don't want to list each and everything I think should be left out, because that would kinda defeat the purpose of keeping it private. You would have us keep EVERYTHING out for the sake of your friend, and that is a form of censorship. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 07:31, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sorry but the more I look at this article, the less it seems to belong here. Her sole "claim" to notability is that she had an article or two written about her as filler for a local paper. Sorry, but lots of people are mentioned in the papers. They are not notable. For instance, I can google "most parking tickets" and learn a lot about "McMillan Electric Co." reasons for racking up 1,497 ticket worth $74,375 in San Francisco. Certainly that does not make the firm notable enough for an article here. I could then google them a bit more and maybe find out that they had some <a href="../../../o/s/h/OSHA_7b95.html" title="OSHA">OSHA</a> violations or filed a lawsuit or two. Still does not make them notable. But if a few editors here had a non-notable feud and dislike against "McMillan Electric Co." then they might be able to make an article that almost (but not quite) seems like it belongs here.

<dd>I'm sorry to have to disagree with you again <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, but in insisting on media coverage as a link to notability you are ignoring the many guidelines I've seen cited by many of the editors who do not support the article. In considering this, I'll put forward a hypothetical scenario. I apologize for it's morbidity and am not implying that Ms. Schwarz's actions are as bad as the example I'm about to give.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In a major metropolitan city a serial killer murders 10 people. The press do not cover the deaths. Local law enforcement publishes details such as victims appearances, dates of disappearance, possible suspect, etc. Is it notable? In my view it is for several reasons, two of which I'll detail in the interest of keeping this as short as possible.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) The public's safety is always notable.</dd>
<dd>2) The media's failure to cover an important crisis like an active serial murderer is notable for their astounding incompetence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In an article about the failure of the media to cover an important story, one can not rely on information from the media itself. Barbara Schwarz is not a serial killer, but her actions have impacted the professional lives of thousands. Sadly, like many serial killers, her behavior is affected by her own unique view of reality. Would you write an article about <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Berkowitz_7170.html" title="David Berkowitz">David Berkowitz</a> without mentioning his delusional beliefs? Since her actions are based on unusual beliefs they must be discussed to a point that balances the need for information with the privacy of the subject. To those who believe it is an attack article, I ask you to read her 92 part autobiography and then reread the article. I believe you'll find it quite conservative when it comes to using embarrassing and irrelevant information in the article. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:56, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

To seriously claim that Schwarz has impacted on "thousands" of people is a good example of the aforementioned "uniqueness." <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 23:08, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

BLP/N, RfC, even AN/I, are all better means of handling an attack article, I think.

<p>Would anyone be opposed to contacting the editors who voted in the last discussions and asking them to vote on this? I noticed strong indications of support for this article in many of the comments made my those voting in the previous 3 AfD debates. Some of them may have changed their mind, so I'm not saying we should apply their previous votes to this one. However based on the comments I think many would still want the article in a neutral form. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 01:31, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I don't enjoy bringing up the mistakes others have made, but in this case I have to in order to illustrate the fact that pointing out a possible area of violation regarding a guideline implies bad faith for several reasons after considering our history: 1. I did not tell <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> how to vote. 2. Since he has put a lot of effort into the article, I am making him aware that it is now an AfD. 3. Canvassing is gathering groups of outside editors (which <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> is not) to influence the vote. 4. I have stated my opinion of your motivations in editing the Brabara Schwarz article appear to be influenced by your spirtual beliefs which you won't discuss. Instead you have tried to imply wrongdoing on my part by notifying <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> about a pending AfD vote, proposed by you, of the article we have been talking about.. To address your concerns directly: If you catch me inviting a bunch of new editors with known bias to come and vote against AfD then by all means take some kind of action to redress me because at that point I will be canvassing. Sorry to take up so much space on your talk page <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a>.

<dd>Hi. Your "feel free to delete this from your talk page" caught my eye and it seemed an odd suggestion. Without getting into what might have motivated you to make such a suggestion, I simply mention that asking one or two editors whose opinions are known to you to take a look at something that they have already expressed interset in would hardly, in my opinion, violate the spirit of <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVASSING_427e.html" title="WP:CANVASSING">WP:CANVASSING</a>. Don't know why you got so defensive in your reaction to my pointing that out. You should have stuck with your first instinct rather than rehash how we might not see eye-to-eye on another, unrelated, issue that has not yet to come before a neutral panel (why not wait for that before getting all "high and mighty"; I usually do pretty well before neutral panels). --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 05:11, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> in case you weren't aware of it deleted talk page sections can still be accessed, so there was nothing being "covered up" so to speak. I also don't mind explaining myself to you, because it seems like you think I'm out to get Scientology. Since I'm not, it's no bother to explain what may appear as suspicious behavior to you. With that in mind, here's why I said that. Some editors don't like to clutter up their talk pages with reminders, especially once the reminder is not necessary. It also was because I hadn't planned to post anything else here. I honestly don't mean to sound defensive, I'm trying to address your concerns as completely as possible. When you mentioned <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVASSING_427e.html" title="WP:CANVASSING">WP:CANVASSING</a> you didn't say how you felt that particular guideline was in danger of being broken when you first mentioned it. This puts me in the rather difficult position of trying to figure out what you meant. Since I cannot be sure which part to address, I just went ahead and addressed the whole concept rather than interpret what I think you meant. Since you are now saying you aren't concerned by my activity in regard to canvassing, I find it odd and interesting you'd mention it in the first place since my actions have not changed since the topic was mentioned. Seriously though, we've said enough here that it now probably needs to be included in the AfD discussion. I want to make sure everyone understands what's happened here in case anybody else gets suspicious.

<dd>Patently ridiculous. I made no "attempt" at an AfD. I asked for input from interested editors. Based on that input I see reasonable support for setting up an AfD but have not yet decided if I will do so. <b>Reasonable use of the process here is not violation.</b> Anynobody has a disagreement with me over this "Biographical Information" point I raise. So what? If you disagree with someone you ask on BLPN or set up an RfC or ask your favorite neutral experienced editor or whatever. You don't take the <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> approach of accusing them of COI, accusing them of violating <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a>, and starting an RfC against the advices of the experienced admin that was helping you, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">User:Bishonen</a>.

<p>With all due respect to <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>, he/she seemed to be under the impression that I was the only editor supporting it.

I think you know that is a clear COI since "personal favor" isn't a criteria for deletion, but would have accepted it in this case as a means to get the article removed. The fact that you would overlook such an issue, is what proved to me that you just want the article gone no matter what. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 11:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is because I believe that everyone is entitled to their vote. Unlike you, I am not engaged in stopping people from rightful use of the process here. I accepted a vote from Tilman, whom I beleive has a very clear COI, and from all the anti-Scientologists too, that I believe have more COI than I do. But that is OK, this was just to see what everyone thought and it is clear that there is basis for a 4th AfD and I will likely post it soon. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 12:25, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

Because if it is not a joke then you are severly misrepresenting the truth for your own ends. Where I come from, we call that <i>lying</i>. As you well know Bishonen's help on the RfC was originally requested by Smee, not you (see <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html#RFC_minor_formatting" title="User talk:Bishonen">User talk:Bishonen#RFC minor formatting</a>) and most of the postings on her page about it are from Smee, not you. I think it is pretty clear that she knew that Smee "supported" the RfD. Not only that but she specifically told the two of you that Smee should not be the 2nd party to certify having "tried and failed to resolve the dispute":
<blockquote>
<p>"No, IMO your attempts were ok, I was talking about Smee's. "There must be real attempts, by *two people*, to resolve differences with JA". See the top of the RFC template: "at least *two people* need to show that they tried to resolve a dispute with this user and have failed". You're only one. Bishonen | talk 07:31, 8 March 2007 (UTC)."</p>
</blockquote>
But you ignored all that good advice, didn't you? And after this "very busy admin" spent an inordinate amount of time trying to help you two with the RfC, you come here and lie about it. This is not a personal attack. This is not uncivil. This is the truth for any other editor to check for themselves.

<p><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> I'm honestly amazed at the lengths to which you are going to avoid this matter. With all due respect to <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen's</a> advice, once he told me I was ok I assumed he meant <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smee's</a> efforts were what he was talking about. IMHO they were not what he made them out to be, so I submitted the RfC rather than arguing our POV over <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smee's</a> efforts. After all, the worst that could happen is that it got rejected and I'd know I was wrong about my perception of <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smee's</a> efforts. I can live with being wrong, so I submitted the page. It was approved, and drawing comments as you know from your time editing there. Ordinarily I would also take time to point out several errors you've made about the history of the request itself, but frankly your perception of the genesis of the request is irrelevant. If you want specifics, I can include them in our discussion about why the erupting volcano seems offensive to you after you return from your break. For the sake of others though I will move on to explain why your actions are probably going to make things worse than they were. The point of the RfC was to get the opinion of outside editors who didn't know either of us. I don't mean for this to be taken as spiteful, but your actions have possibly crossed into censorship and corruption. (To be clear:Censorship of community discussion and corruption by asking <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> to delete a process you disagree with, and him actually doing it after it had already been approved.) It's hard to imagine anyone who understands how things are supposed to function here, coming to defend actions like that. I just met <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>, and i really don't want to see him get in trouble for doing you a favor. I'll wait for a bit and give him a chance to restore it before I take action. (Seriously though, it didn't occur to you that going to the admin you complain to and asking him to delete an RfC about you didn't seem like a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>? Or that having an active RfC deleted by the same admin is probably a violation of <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a>, since a non-involved admin approved it being there and people were commenting?) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 07:32, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Please see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Litigation_list" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Litigation_list" rel="nofollow">litigation list</a> in Archive 8. Please note that many of her FOIA cases were not against scientology. Schwarz's notability was also discussed and argued at length <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Remove_page.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Remove_page.3F" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and why this article is part of the scientology series was discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Category_of_this_article" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Category_of_this_article" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 15:25, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, FOIA requests are never "against" another person or entity. However, her requests often had to do with inquiries regarding Scientology.

<dd>I see your point. However, the requests were more to do with the scientologists Hubbard and Rathbun, rather than the organization. I may have misunderstood your statement when you said above that most of the cases were scientology based, by thinking your reference was more to do with scientology the organization itself. Her non-scientology FOIA <s>abuses</s> requests were similar to <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/FOIA/Appeals/FOIA-Decisions/01-0140.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ncua.gov/FOIA/Appeals/FOIA-Decisions/01-0140.htm" rel="nofollow">this item against the NCUA.</a> <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 18:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I probably should have been more explicit in what I meant. Anyway, I think that inquiries into Hub/Rathburn are pertient to Scientology insofar as Hubbard <i>was</i> Scientology, and Rathburn held a high position in the organization. <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 20:10, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still don't see how Barbara's article forms part of a series on Scientology. Would you recommend it to a person trying to understand Scientology? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 15:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying anything against Tilman's article, but he isn't a Scientologist. Does that mean you would support removing the Scientology infobox from his page? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 06:59, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. Because his article is about him, not about Scientology. To me it does not seem to form a part of a series about Scientology. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 15:54, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
