<p><i>Baronets use the title "Sir" before their name, just as other knights do.</i> This is the first introduction of the idea that a baronetcy is a species of knighthood. Assuming this is actually so, shouldn't we mention this before that line? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnanel_b5e3.html" title="User:Marnanel">Marnanel</a> 22:07, Apr 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Robert Baden-Powell was granted a Baronet in 1922 and the Baron Baden-Powell is now a peerage title in the United Kingdom. I included Robert Baden-Powell on the small list of notables in the article because he did indeed have the Baronet, though the title is now a peerage title. It's all a bit confusing/conflicting, but I think he warrants inclusion unless there's a good reason not to. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 19:46, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Surely the two are separate: a baronetcy cannot "become" anything, it remains a baronetcy. That a baronetcy has become merged with peerage still means each hereditary title exists, although the lesser might not be mentioned. And presumably, although I know of no such case off the top of my head, it is possibly for the peerage title and the baronetcy to "demerge", as it were, although the only way I can think of this happening is if there were no sons and the peerage and baronetcy had different rules for inheritance in such an eventuality. I believe the current Rothschild barony (of Tring) is similarly merged with an earlier baronetcy.<br />

<p>I put species back in because a baronetcy isn't quite like a knighthood, and type would suggest that it's on the level of the Thistle or something. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 04:01, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Understood, though I'm not sure that anyone will pick up on that distinction without further explanation (as evidenced by the fact that I didn't think that "type" would be saying anything different. Ddye 13:12, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A baronetcy is entirely different from a knighthood - to write that it is a species is a confusing misnomer. It is a class of its own, solely within the British honours system. It is based on the idea of knighthood, hence the post-nominal 'Sir', but otherwise it is wholly separate, as well as having a place in the order of precedence higher than most knighthoods.</p>

<p>Is a baronet entitled to supporters on their achievement of arms, as peers and knights are? I realise this information is more about heraldry than titles per se, but I haven't been able to find confirmation of this anywhere. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:47, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No he is not <b>entitled</b> (peers are, knights are not) although some are given that additional honour. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 14:38, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I may have been misinformed, but the texts on heraldry that I've consulted say that Knights of the Garter (in English heraldry) are entitled to supporters on either side of the shield, just as peers are. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:33, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Correct. The right to supporters belongs to members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle and Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights Grand Commanders of the junior orders. But not other knights and baronets - although some enjoy them. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 11:45, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been racking my brains over this as I'm certain examples exist. The notion of 'hon' knighthoods is C19. Before that a knighthood was a knighthood and mutual recognition existed across Europe. Ordinary non-hon knighhoods are easy to find but as for the baronetcy the best I can find is bb comments agreeing that a swede + a dutchman did get one.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 14:42, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've done some digging around. It turns out that a total (I think) of five baronetcies (3 for Parsees, 1 for a Hindu and one for a Muslim) were created for ethnic Indians. I think four are still extant, the Parsee ones certainly are and I think the fourth Muslim baronet was embroiled with the Indian Goverment over his estates as late as 1967. Any further information on these baronetcies would certainly be welcome.<br />

<p>I'm dubious about having him in the "Baronets who do not use their baronetcy" catagory.

<p>In view of the current "Cash for Honours" scandal, it would be interesting to know what the rate of charge for a baronetage has been, over the years since James Stuart introduced the title, purely as a fundraising device. There seem to have been a lot of very wealthy men created baronets, in the 19th C.</p>
<p>Was it a standard practice to create a baronet after they had given a specific service? The <a href="../../../o/d/n/ODNB_ace9.html" title="ODNB">ODNB</a> on Sir Robert Nicholas Fowler says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" He received a baronetcy from Lord Salisbury in 1885, a common honour for a former lord mayor, and in the next election, in July 1886, he was returned unopposed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was there a list of jobs that gained this honour, or was a substantial payment? Is there a good history book that will tell me about this? The article lacks much by way of citations.</p>

<p>I've altered special clauses to remainders as they all seemd to relate to succession which is a remainder. There are a few baronets where precedence is assigned (rather than the normal by date system) I suppose that might be considered a special clause but only matters for a handful of examples. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 17:32, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Originally baronets also had other rights, including the right to have their eldest son knighted on his 21st birthday. However, beginning in the reign of George IV these rights have been gradually revoked (by Order in Privy Council which was not competent to make such an Order revoking a right granted by a Sovereign), on the grounds that sovereigns should not be bound by acts made by their predecessors."</p>
<p>Since the award of any knighthood is an exercise of preogative power the refusal to grant is, irrespective of the promise of knighthood in patents prior to ~1827, rather moot. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 16:17, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have always understood that the title of baronet can only be passed to an eldest son and that if a baronet fails to produce a male heir (or that heir is disinclined to pursue the matter) the title will become extinct. Since it seems unlikely that many new baronetcies will be granted in the future the number of baronetcies can only decline and eventually the title will disappear altogether. Is this correct? - 81.145.241.123</p>

<dd>You never know. We live in extremely interesting times for hereditary titles in general. We need to see what happens when the next few Prime Ministers (especially Conservative ones) retire.<br />

<p>Thanks. However I wasn't really speculating on whether there will be new baronetcies created (Indeed you never know) but whether a baronetcy (unlike a dukedom for example) becomes extinct in the absence of a son. Do you know the answer? - 81.145.241.123</p>

<p>Without looking it up my understanding was that any male descendants of the original creation can inherit. So even if all the males in the 20th century finally died out, and the baronetcy was created, say, in 1800, then there may be male descendants of the first baronet throughout the 19th century who have escaped notice in the 20th, being so far removed, but who will still have a claim if everyone else in between has failed and could be traced. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 11:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pah, As I'd added the LP you could have seen it in the article itself. However that really only tells us the modern form not the historic. Looking at the LG I can see the baronet usage at least as far back as the 1660s though I can't comment beyond that. [ed.] Reading this back David I was reading the LG a few days ago which reminded me of an older use ~ <i>the Right Honorable Sir George Jeffreys Knight and Baronet, Lord Chief Justice of His Majesties Court of Kings Bench</i>, <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 16:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps a confusion is arising between 'knight' baronet and <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight_banneret.html" title="Knight banneret">Knight banneret</a>? Certainly, the history on this page is confusing. The article begins by stating (correctly) that the rank of baronet was invented by James VI &amp; I. But under the 'history' section, it describes baronets created in the 14th and 15th centuries! They certainly sound like bannerets from the information given. The fact that some were paid for is not extraordinary: it could conceivably refer to the knight's fee. A baronetcy is a rank of nobility, not chivalry. But don't follow the information given at <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight_banneret.html" title="Knight banneret">Knight banneret</a> too conscientiously: the article needs serious work to make it accurate and comprehensive. I'll try and improve it when I get time. <a href="../../../g/w/i/User%7EGwinva_2cfd.html" title="User:Gwinva">Gwinva</a> 20:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
