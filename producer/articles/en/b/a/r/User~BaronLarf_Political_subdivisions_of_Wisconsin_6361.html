<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_Political_subdivisions_of_Wisconsin_6361.html" title="Edit section: County">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">County</span></h2>
<p>The <b><a href="../../../c/o/u/County.html" title="County">county</a></b> is the primary political subdivision of Wisconsin. Wisconsin has seventy-two counties, covering the entire state. Every county has a <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_seat.html" title="County seat">county seat</a>, often a populous or centrally located city or village, where the government office for the county are located. Within each county are cities, villages and towns.</p>
<p>A Board of Supervisors is the main legislative entity of the county. Supervisors are elected in nonpartisan elections for two-year terms (except in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee_County%2C_Wisconsin_f585.html" title="Milwaukee County, Wisconsin">Milwaukee County</a> where they served four years). The type of executive official in each county varies; ten counties have a County Executive elected in a nonpartisan election for a four-year term; ten counties have appointed County Administrators; and 48 have appointed Administrative Coordinators. Other officials include a sheriff, district attorney, clerk, treasurer, coroner, register of deeds and clerk of courts. By 2008, all of these offices state-wide will have four-year terms. In most counties, elected coroners have been replaced by appointed medical examiners.</p>
<p>Counties are generally responsible for social services, such as child welfare, job training and care of the eldery; and public land management, such as care for parks. Law enforcement and road maintenance are also administered by the county, in conjunction with local municipalities.</p>
<p><a name="City" id="City"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_Political_subdivisions_of_Wisconsin_6361.html" title="Edit section: City">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">City</span></h2>
<p>In Wisconsin, a <b><a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a></b> is highly <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_entity.html" title="Autonomous entity">autonomous</a> incorporated area within one or more counties. It provides almost all services to its <a href="../../../r/e/s/Residency.html" title="Residency">residents</a> and has the highest degree of home rule and taxing jurisdiction over them. The <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee%2C_Wisconsin_a6b4.html" title="Milwaukee, Wisconsin">City of Milwaukee</a>, the only "First class city" in the state, has its own special rules apart from all other cities. As of 2005, Wisconsin had 190 cities.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_rule.html" title="Home rule">home rule</a> authority granted to cities allows them to make their own decision about their affairs, administration and a good deal of their public policy, subject to state law.</p>
<p>Cities are governed by Common Councils consisting of the mayor and elected aldermen. City officers include a mayor, treasurer, clerk, attorney and health officials. Cities may also, by their discretion, have an engineer, comptroller, assesors, street commissioner, constable and a board of public works.</p>
<p>Cities can also elect to hire a city administrator instead of an elected mayor. In cities that have city administrators, often times the head of the common council is referred to as mayor.</p>
<p>Cities in Wisconsin are generally divided into four classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>First class: Cities with 150,000 or more people</li>
<li>Second class: Cities with 39,000 to 149,999 people</li>
<li>Third class: Cities with 10,000 to 38,999 people</li>
<li>Fourth class: Cities with 9,999 people or less</li>
</ul>
<p>There are exceptions to these classes, however; in order for a city to move from one class to the next, certain governmental changes need to take place and the mayor must publish a proclamation. For these reasons, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison%2C_Wisconsin_c802.html" title="Madison, Wisconsin">Madison</a> is still a second class city, <a href="../../../w/a/u/Waukesha%2C_Wisconsin_be3c.html" title="Waukesha, Wisconsin">Waukesha</a> is still a third class city and several cities with a population of over 10,000 are still fourth class Cities.<a href="http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/bb/05bb/744-779.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/bb/05bb/744-779.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In order to incorporate as a city, a community needs to have at least 1,000 citizens if it is in a rural area or 5,000 if it is in an urban area.</p>
<p><a name="Village" id="Village"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_Political_subdivisions_of_Wisconsin_6361.html" title="Edit section: Village">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Village</span></h2>
<p>In Wisconsin, a <b><a href="../../../v/i/l/Village.html" title="Village">village</a></b> is an autonomous incorporated area within one or more counties. It provides various service to its residents and has a degree of home rule and taxing jurisdiction over them. As of 2005, Wisconsin had 400 villages.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_rule.html" title="Home rule">home rule</a> authority granted to villages allows them to make their own decision about their affairs, administration and a good deal of their public policy, subject to state law.</p>
<p>Villages are governed by a Village President and a Board of Trustees. Village officers include a president, clerk, treasurer and assessor. Villages can also elect to hire a village manager instead of an elected village president.</p>
<p>In order to incorporate as a village, a communitiy must have at least 150 citizens if it is in a rural area or 2,500 if it is in an urban area.</p>
<p><a name="Town" id="Town"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_Political_subdivisions_of_Wisconsin_6361.html" title="Edit section: Town">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Town</span></h2>
<p>In Wisconsin, a <b>town</b> is a municipality within a county; in this usage, Wisconsin towns are similar to <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_township.html" title="Civil township">civil townships</a>. All areas in the state which have not been incorporated as a city or village are parts of towns. Towns provide a limited number of services to its residents. The US Census considers Wisconsin towns to be <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_civil_division.html" title="Minor civil division">minor civil divisions</a>. As of 2005, Wisconsin had 1,260 towns.</p>
<p>Towns are governed by Town Boards, with the board chairperson at its head. Towns also have a clerk, treasurer and assessor either elected or appointed by the board. In addition, every town must hold an annual <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_meeting.html" title="Town meeting">town meeting</a> in the beginning of April. At this town meeting, the electors may authorize the town board to take certain actions or change the make up or wages of town supervisors or officers.</p>
<p>Towns have less authority than villages and cities; they do not, for instance, have home rule granted to them by the state, but instead only have specific powers granted to them under state statute. At the very minimum, towns maintain their roads and provide garbage, fire and police service as well as zone land. Towns may choose to provide more services however, overlapping with those provided by the county. In most cases, however, towns provide limited services and thus town residents often pay lower taxes than their city or village counterparts.</p>
<p>Towns are often annexed by neighboring cities and villages in whole or in part. Piecemeal annexation has left some rather small towns, such as the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germantown_%28town%29%2C_Wisconsin_ad3c.html" title="Germantown (town), Wisconsin">Town of Germantown</a> which covers 1.7 square miles, or the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookfield_%28town%29%2C_Wisconsin_e53d.html" title="Brookfield (town), Wisconsin">Town of Brookfield</a> covering 5.5 square miles. This contrasts with the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_%28town%29%2C_Wisconsin_f3d7.html" title="Winter (town), Wisconsin">Town of Winter</a> which covers 279.5 square miles. Most towns are about the size of a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survey_township.html" title="Survey township">survey township</a>, or 36 square miles. The <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menominee%2C_Wisconsin_fbbf.html" title="Menominee, Wisconsin">Town of Menominee</a> is unique in that it is coextensive with the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menominee_County%2C_Wisconsin_8827.html" title="Menominee County, Wisconsin">County of Menominee</a>, and covers 365 square miles; this is due to its unique history and connection with the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menominee_Indian_Reservation_4662.html" title="Menominee Indian Reservation">Menominee Indian Reservation</a>.</p>

<p>There are numerous examples of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unincorporated.html#United_States" title="Unincorporated">unincorporated communities</a> throughout the state. These areas have no legal status and are administered by the town or municipality in which they exist.</p>

<p>In Wisconsin, special purpose units of government provide specialized services for those who live within the district, and are empowered to tax residents of the district for the services provided in common. Special districts often cross the lines of cities, villages and towns. In 2006, Wisconsin had over 1,100 special districts.<a href="http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/GW/gw_12.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/GW/gw_12.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>These special units of government are created to solve problems that are regional in nature, and sometimes to get around the limits on debt that each municipality can have. The state can also exert more control on special districts through the governor's appointments to district boards. Politicians also set up some special districts to insulate themselves from the sometimes unpopular taxes these boards levy, since the boards are often appointed and not elected.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/c/h/School_district.html" title="School district">School districts</a> are the most common kind of special district. They provide, arrange or contract for all public education services, including special education and school transportation, the latter also for non-public schools. In 2006, Wisconsin had more than 440 school districts.</p>
<p>School districts are often not precisely coextensive with municipalities that bear the same name, meaning that a person living in one hamlet or village might send their children to a school associated with a different hamlet or village. Residents pay school taxes to the same school district in which they live and their children attend school.</p>

In Wisconsin, a CDP is often a part of a town outside any villages. The CDP may cross town and county borders. A CDP cannot be any part of a city or a village, nor can it be the entirety of a town.
