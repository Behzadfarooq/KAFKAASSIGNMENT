<p>From his birth he was the heir after his father of Chabd. However due to his disassociation with Chabad of his uncle he was exculuded from herldom.

<dd>His son Barry (Shalom Dov Baer) became alienated from the Chabad movement, and later claimed that the official Chabad library was a family heirloom. As the previous Rebbe's sole grandson, he claimed ownership of it. The case was brought before a secular court. On the fifth day of the Hebrew month of <a href="../../../t/e/v/Tevet.html" title="Tevet">Tevet</a>, the court handed down its decision in favor of Rabbi Schneerson. The Chabad movement has since commemorated this day as "Didan Natzach" ("Victory is ours!"), a kind of "V-Day".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Gurary became a devoted follower; however, his son <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Gurary_6217.html" title="Barry Gurary">Barry Gurary</a> resented what he perceived as Rabbi Schneerson's "usurpation" of what he thought should have been his father's position, and various intra-family disputes arose. For example, when invaluable books and manuscripts from the Chabad library began to disappear, Rabbi Schneerson's wife, Chaya Mushka, suspected her nephew and ordered a surveillance camera installed, which then confirmed her suspicions. This led to a protracted battle in federal court over the library's ownership. Barry Gurary claimed that the library was a family heirloom, and as the previous Rebbe's sole grandson, he claimed ownership of it. Rabbi Schneerson countered that the library was the collective property of the Chabad movement. Barry's mother, Hanna, sided with him, while his father remained staunchly devoted to Rabbi Schneerson, forming a deep rift in the Gurary family. On the fifth day of the Hebrew month of <a href="../../../t/e/v/Tevet.html" title="Tevet">Tevet</a>, the court handed down its decision -- an overwhelming victory for Rabbi Schneerson. His followers commemorate this day each year as <i>Didan Notzach</i> ("We did triumph"), a kind of "V-Day".</dd>

<p>The letter has nothing to do with why Gurary is at all notable. The letter furthermore has nothing to do with "science" or physics but is essentially a point about engineering. If he a letter to the NYT about the controversy surrounding him that would matter. This does not. On a related note, can anyone find these physics papers? I have been unable to find any in a brief search. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:16, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Errr Joshua: Do not go into reverse, meaning that now that there is an article about Barry Gurary, then it's perfectly logical to move forth and include more information about him. Wikipedia articles are not "one horse towns". Science, physics, and engineering are all connected, so stop making out that they are "disjointed" subjects. So what if the letter is not about "the" controversy, because this is not an article <i>only</i> about "101 views about 'the' controversy." You ask about "finding" these papers after I have just searched for them and provided the online links to summaries of each and every one of them. You will notice from the links, they can be obtained if you want to pay for the full versions of the research papers, which should prove that they are still worth something. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 03:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Re <i>Searchers Find 'Black Box' in Alaska Airlines Jet Crash</i> (news article, Feb. 3):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After every airplane crash, we keep reading about the enormous resources expended to find the two <i>black boxes,</i> the cockpit voice recorder, which holds the latest 30 minutes of conversation among the crew, and the flight data recorder, which holds the latest hour's worth of readings from a number of flight instruments.</dd>

<dd>BARRY S. GOURARY</dd>

<dd>So then the logic is that every letter to the editor, written by anyone on whom Wiki has an article should be in the article? Uh no. And if a biography means "all aspects", where is Gourary's shoe size, favourite foods, turn-ons and turn-offs, favourite TV shows? Also, this is an encyclopedia article (although it is currently written like an essay (why the rhetorical questions? they don't belong) not a full blown biography. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 09:48, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jim62: Don't be silly! This is a serious discussion. My point is simply, that since this article has established that Barry Gurary is notable enough to deserve an article, and it has links to a number of his scientific papers, it is therefore both of interest and of note, and worthy of at least a link in the article, that since his (Barry Gurary's) mind was focused still on matters scientific of a serious nature as evidenced by this letter to the ditor of the NY Times, it's deserving of being in the article. (Who is saying that anyone who writes a letter to an editor is noteworthy? Altho I have no doubt that at some point someone may do just that on Wikipedia.) At any rate, by "all aspects" is meant NOTABLE aspects worthy of inclusion in the article, which should have been self-understood yet you have unfortunately chosen to mangle my words and my intent. At no time was anyone thinking of contemplating inserting his favorite foods or TV shows, for heaven sakes be serious man. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 03:17, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Writing a letter about an essentially random topic that isn't even remotely related to what he did his physics research nor related to anything else the man did simply doesn't belong. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:20, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The topic of this article <i>is</i> the man, and not just his research about this or that. So if he appears to have "surfaced" somewhere outside of the usual, even if it's a place <i>you</i> deem to be "unimportant", it is is still nevertheless connected to our main subject here, which happens to be Barry Gurary who was more gifted than his enemies in Lubavitch would like to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics.html" title="Comics">charicature</a> him as having been. You are chopping-up a human into irrational parts, when the truth is that "the whole is greater than the sum of the parts" and besides, his letter to the Times contains a very novel scientific idea that has still not been implemented when, as he points out, it could and should very easily be done to the benefit of many people who lose their loved ones in unfortunate plane crashes. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 04:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Conceptual background: Hasidic dynastic disputes</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Note: This section aims to provide a wider {{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EContext_4c09.html" title="Template:Context">context</a>}} to this subject</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In order to appreciate the wider context of the issues surrounding the person of Barry Gurary and what he symbolized, both verbalized and unspoken, one must know something about the way <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic</a> movements are born and how they function.</p>
<p>The Hasidic rabbis, known as <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebbe.html" title="Rebbe">Rebbes</a>, are not "hired" or "appointed" but owe their positions to their direct ancestral family relationships to earlier Rebbes who were disciples of the founder of the Hasidic movement <a href="../../../y/i/s/Yisroel_ben_Eliezer_%28The_Baal_Shem_Tov%29_1684.html" title="Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)">Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)</a>. Essentially, all the major Hasidic dynasties and groups claim to be the heirs of earlier Rebbes by being related by birth or through marriage into the families.</p>
<p>Hasidic dynasties function as miniature <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_monarchy.html" title="Absolute monarchy">absolute monarchies</a>, based on the Torah and Jewish law of course, but the "mandate" to rule their followers is derived by inheritance and not by dint of pure <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah_study.html" title="Torah study">Torah scholarship</a> alone. The Rebbe controls every aspect of his followers' lives, sets communal policies, and controls the key educational institutions and all its charities. He does not receive a salary.</p>
<p>When this system runs smoothly then it has great advantages of unity and <i><a href="../../../e/s/p/Esprit_de_corps.html" title="Esprit de corps">esprit de corps</a></i> but if there is a problem such as unclarity about the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession.html" title="Line of succession">lines of succesion</a> or not knowing who is the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_apparent.html" title="Heir apparent">heir apparent</a>, then a form of "<a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">civil war</a>" often breaks out as it would in a split monarchy or in a government with potential rival claimants, creating a literal <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_crisis.html" title="Constitutional crisis">constitutional crisis</a>. It is because the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe only had two surviving daughters and only the Gurarys had a son, Barry, so that from the time Barry Gurary was born he was already a factor or a "football" in any thoughts and equations about future succesions that any ruling family would obviously think about, if not discuss, <i>within</i> itself.</p>
<p>In-house dynastic battles within Hasidic families are not uncommon. In recent times two sons of the previous <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_e587.html" title="Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)">Satmar Rebbe</a> <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_e587.html#Satmar_succession_feud" title="Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)">split up their father's empire</a> of followers. When the last <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobov_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_3422.html" title="Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)">Bobover Rebbe</a> passed away, his half-brother and son-in-law <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobov_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_3422.html#Fifth_rebbe.28s.29_of_Bobov" title="Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)">split up the movement</a>. There have been similar disputes, splits and clashes over the centuries of Hasidism with various issues involved.</p>
<p>When the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe passed away, his two sons-in-law developed a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modus_operandi.html" title="Modus operandi">modus operandi</a> to share responsiblities in running the Lubavitch movement. While Rabbi Schneerson became the public leader, Rabbi Shemaryahu Gurary, Barry Gurary's father, held positions of power behind the scenes, such as running the schools, but without fanfare.</p>
<p>As the only grandson, Barry Gourary was a possible <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_apparent.html" title="Heir apparent">heir apparent</a> at a young age, but he drifted away from this. It is not clear if over time he chose to leave Lubavitch voluntarily was somehow or other "pushed out" cannot be ignored. Often in families there can be <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapegoat.html#Scapegoating_in_psychoanalytic_theory" title="Scapegoat">scapegoating</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoanalytic_theory.html" title="Psychoanalytic theory">Psychoanalytic theory</a> holds that unwanted thoughts and feelings can be unconsciously <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_projection.html" title="Psychological projection">projected</a> onto another who becomes a scapegoat for one's own problems. This concept can be extended to projection by groups. In this case the chosen individual, or group, becomes the scapegoat for the group's problems."</dd>
</dl>
<p>His leaving the movement of his own free will and volition would be a type of "<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdication.html" title="Abdication">abdication</a>," much like <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII of the United Kingdom</a> abdicated in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>. Barry Gurary may have been not "Hasidic" enough in his way of thinking, preferring the ways of the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Jews_cc4e.html" title="Lithuanian Jews">Lithuanian Jews</a> and the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> over the more intense type of anti-<a href="../../../m/i/s/Misnagdim.html" title="Misnagdim">Misnagdim</a> type of Hasidic <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a> that his uncle encouraged. When Barry Gurary sold books belonging to his own grandfather it unleashed a tide of pent-up fury against him, as if to validate Rabbi Schneerson's long-ago rift with his nephew.</p>
<p>The fact that after the last <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson_07ba.html#Succession" title="Menachem Mendel Schneerson">Rebbe died without having designated a successor</a>, the frustration over Barry Gurary's life's choices, as viewed by Lubavitchers, becomes a subject for even more repression and denial to the point that he is viewed as a literal "enemy" of his own family and the movement which, under different circumstances, he may even have led.</p>

<p>IZAK: it is good information, but as it stands, it is a little too essayistic and opinionated for Wikipedia. For example, saying what would happen "under different circumstances" is certainly conjectural, and "Barry Gurary may have been not 'Hasidic' enough in his way of thinking" is sheer editorializing. All of this would be a <i>lot</i> better if you could cite someone else saying it.</p>
<p>Barring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>lose the first paragraph: don't tell the user what the "must know" in order to understand.</li>
<li>If you want to say things like "When this system runs smoothly then it has great advantages of unity and <i><a href="../../../e/s/p/Esprit_de_corps.html" title="Esprit de corps">esprit de corps</a></i>…", you <i>must</i> cite someone else, not write it in Wikipedia's narrative voice without citation.</li>
<li>Still, you can, I think, make statements like "succession to the leadership of a Hasidic sect is essentially dynastic; as in some monarchic states, the choice of successor can be contentious." That seems to be a simple and accurate statement of fact. Citation still would be good.</li>
</ul>

<dd>The section should be included. Similar things are included about Bobov, Satmar, Belz etc also. In 'chareidi articles' you cannot avoid a certain level of OR. Enforcing the OR rule very strictly as PinchasC wants, will result in a huge loss of information, three-quarters of most 'chareidi articles' consist of OR... --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> | <small><i><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel575_08a4.html" title="User talk:Daniel575">(talk)</a></i></small> 06:09, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The general background on Hassidic dynasties seems reasonable, might want to add that due to the tradition that the Baal Shem Tov was descended from King David, Hassidic communities regard their dynastic rebbes as potential candidates for <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Messiah_dd7d.html" title="Jewish Messiah">Jewish Messiah</a>. The "may" and "would be" lines are pretty clear giveaways that speculation is involved -- something I'd steer clear from, especially when other people's motives are involved. The pyschoanalytic part seems most clearly essay -- people involved may be projecting, but it's pure conjecture, and would definitely need the opinion sourced if it should be offered at all. I'd stick with facts on this one. It's clear that Barry ended up with interests and an outlook quite different from the Lubavitcher hassidic community, this is a fact, but how this happened -- whether he left himself or was pushed out -- I'd leave unsaid absent good sourcing. Also, how he regarded his community I'd leave unsaid (absent good sourcing). Same with his motives for taking the books. Maybe he just really needed the money.

<dd>I have a few suggestions... First, as Shira says, stick with facts [as all articles should!]... my biggest problem with the deleted section is that it doesn't cite a single source. If I'd come across it, I'd more likely have slapped a {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} on it, rather than deleting it outright. Second, this "essay", as Shira describes it, is fine [with sources!], <i>in a more appropriate article</i>, which I would regard as a <i>good</i> reason for having removed it from the article. Anything relevant to the subject of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Gurary_6217.html" title="Barry Gurary">Barry Gurary</a> can be reinserted, but the rest of it, <i>with at least a <b>few</b> citations</i>, should be included in Hassidic dynasties#Development and succession or some such similar relevant place.

<li>Unfortunately, <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">User:PinchasC</a> keeps on deleting the section he does not like, as understandably <i>anyone</i> with a pro-Chabad party-line outlook would obviously do, but that is what is called <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> editing on Wikipedia and it's a no-no, and so I urge PinchasC to come out and debate the issues and questions out in the open, and confirm what is factual and refute what is not, but he cannot act as the "judge" and "executioner" in an attempt to destroy what he does not like to hear. So, lets talk rather than delete on sight.

<dd>I think the background info on dynastic succession is useful but should possibly function best as a separate article, something along the lines of Dynastic succession in Hasidism or something like that, which this article could then cite to. It would have to be sourced but that shouldn't be too much of a problem- there should be plenty of stuff in JE and other readily available sources on this phenomenon. There also must be some source discussing the reason for Gurary's separation from Chabad, and a certain amount of speculation is permissible if the sources present different views. Some of the other materials (scapegoating etc.) are a little too speculative for an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 14:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Brian thank you for your thoughtful comments with which I do basically agree. At this time, and because the subject is still relatively fresh, and also because the Lubavitch organization is a behemoth that literally stradles the globe, most of the real discussions and material on the subject are readily available on blogs, that have either sceptical or antagonistic attitudes to Lubavitch. But for anyone knowledgeable enough about the issues and trying to stick to a NPOV, it is possible to extract serious and valid information on this topic from those sources at this time given the constraints. After all, kindly remember that Haredi Jews and Haredi Judaism are focused on studying and publishing Torah, Talmudic, and Halakhic works. The serious Torah scholars are mostly not academics and they are not to be found at universities and think-tanks publishing "papers" or books about themselves which they would consider to be total nonsense in any case. The other type of English language literature that comes out from most Orthodox circles is more <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a>, how this and that Rebbe were all "saints" from the time they were born, and they would never publish the truth about a subject in a biography such as of Barry Gurary. So that is the basic <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dilemma" class="extiw" title="wikt:dilemma">dilemma</a> we face here because we are working with very limited, controlled, and essentialy censored material that might seem like no big deal to an objective scholar, but to hardcore Lubavitchers is highly toxic, for obvious reasons. But that should not stop this information from being studied and published. Lubavitch is big enough and way too strong to feel anything from this. In fact it's ultimately <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catharsis.html" title="Catharsis">cathartic</a> that this subject can be aired and see the light of day, hopefully even put it in perspective, and then we can move on to better and happier topics. The Tanakah (Hebrew Bible) never tried to hide the faults and failings of its characers. The Lubavitcher Rebbe is not "God" and Barry Guaray is not the "Devil" as Lubavitchers like to think. The Lubavitcher Rebbe and his nephew are human beings who BOTH had a case to make and being that this article is about Barry Gurary, it must convey how and why he never became the "Rebbe", regardless of if he ever stood a chance or not. The goal should be to edit it so that the truth and the facts are conveyed. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 09:27, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While the part of this section that gives the history of disputes over leadership in Chassidic sects is potentially usefull, the rest reads like a conspiracy theory. The psychoanalysis is also a bit much.

<dd>Sagtkd: When it comes to <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession.html" title="Succession">succession</a> struggles there is no shortage of conspiracy to be found, and that is not a "theory."

<p>I do not have anything new to shed on the subject, since much of what I knopw has already been said. That doesn't mean that I am trying to put a word in for an article that I have no knowledge on. I think that the consensus has been up to now that this section does not belong, and that you are ignoring that and keep fighting for something that not many of us think belongs. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESagtkd_f2b0.html" title="User:Sagtkd">Sagtkd</a> 04:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>After furthur look at the most current version of this section, I think it is very good, and I don't see why it can't stay in the article. It makes its point of the history of controversy in succesion, why it's relative to the article, and does not overdo it on the conspiracy theories of Barry's move away from Chabad. Nice job. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESagtkd_f2b0.html" title="User:Sagtkd">Sagtkd</a> 02:14, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No-one denies that Barry Gurary's father, Rabbi <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shemaryahu_Gurary_d4d9.html" title="Shemaryahu Gurary">Shemaryahu Gurary</a> was given many powers in the Lubavitch movement alongside Rabbi Schneerson, and which he retained until his death.

Presumably had Barry Gurary remained within the Lubavitch movement he would have naturally taken on and continued with his father's work within the movement.

<li>Is it true or false that Barry Gurary was the <i>only</i> grandson of the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe? Is it true or false to state that when Barry Gurary was born, and since Rabbi Menachem Schneerson did not have children, that therefore when Barry Gurary was a <i>child</i> he was viewed and regarded as a possible successor Lubavitcher Rebbe, no different to any <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Prince_5adf.html" title="Crown Prince">Crown Prince</a>?

<li>The application of the example of <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapegoat.html#Scapegoating_in_psychoanalytic_theory" title="Scapegoat">Scapegoating in psychoanalytic theory</a> is acceptable. To be consitent I challenge <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">User:PinchasC</a> to edit many <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> articles on Wikipedia that insert mountains of informations from truly unverified and irrelevant sources into articles (see examples at <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_and_Jonathan_bbc7.html#Erotic_interpretation" title="David and Jonathan">David and Jonathan erotic interpretation</a>; <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html#Ancestry_and_evolutionary_biology" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve ancestry and evolutionary biology</a>) that touch upon characters imortant To <b>Judaism</b> (remember that topic?) and revert them until <i>those</i> truly weird editors "get it right" according to his criteria.</li>
<li>How is Barry Gurary leaving Lubavitch different to an abdication especially in view of the fact that he was the only male relative eligible by birth to become Rebbe of Lubavitch? (Being born the son or grandson or nephew of a Rebbe is the only known direct line to becoming the successor Rebbe of a Hasidic dynasty. Or am I missing something here?)</li>
<li>Seen from Barry Gurary's perspective, there should be nothing wrong in assuming that he was entitled to at least some ownership of his grandfather's books, especially if the grandfather never said anything to the contrary as far as is known. Indeed his mother, who was a daughter of the sixth Rebbe, thought what Barry Gurary did was legal. For that she was assaulted and almost blinded by a Lubvitcher crazy-head thug, or is that not relevant? Hmm? See this gruesome picture of what happened to Barry Gurary's mom: <a href="http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/images/chana_gourary_2.jpg" class="external text" title="http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/images/chana_gourary_2.jpg" rel="nofollow">part of an article that reads: Tzemach Atlas links to a post on CrownHeights.info that contains links to audio files of a farbrengen (informal talk within a hasidic gathering) given by the titular head of worldwide Chabad, Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky. In this talk Rabbi Krinsky admits the Rebbe's sister-in-law, the eldest daughter of the sixth rebbe, was beaten and blinded by a Lubavitcher rabbinical student (second audio file about 1/3 of the way in), admits that Chabad did everything in its power to stop the Rebbe from being deposed by a New York court regarding his incitement of that incident, and frequently refers to the grandson of the sixth Lubavitcher rebbe, Barry Gourary, as the "sitra achra."</a></li>
<li>What can explain the ferocity of Lubavitch's antipathy to Barry Gurary? That he wanted his grandfather's books? See this comment that is worth noting from someone who has rejected the Lubavitch party line: <a href="http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/chabad_history/index.html" class="external text" title="http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/chabad_history/index.html" rel="nofollow">It also should be noted that the sixth rebbe's library, the source of the dispute that led to the beating, contains many interesting secular books collected personally by the sixth rebbe beginning when he was still a child. Included were editions of Sherlock Holmes in Yiddish and other works of fiction. Chabad, despite what Rabbi Krinsky says on the audio files, could not go to an independent beit din (religious court), because no independent beit din would have awarded the library to them. The secular court was untroubled by the normative Jewish law regarding inheritance, and by the presence of secular books – which by the estimates I've seen made up a large part of the collection. A beit din would have awarded those books – all of them – to the surviving male heir, the sixth rebbe's grandson, Barry Gourary. And so, Chabad did what haredim so often do – whatever was most convenient.</a> (From <a href="http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/chabad_history/index.html" class="external free" title="http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/chabad_history/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/chabad_history/index.html</a>)</li>
<li>Barry Gurary was loyal to his family, particularly his parents, and was a loyal Jew, despite any <i><a href="../../../l/a/s/Lashon_hara.html" title="Lashon hara">lashon hara</a></i> against him emanating from Lubavitch or any other source.

<dd>PinchasC: They are all trying to be nice (to you) I think, and they have not given any serious alternatives whereas I at least try to solve a central riddle here by stating the facts, nothing more. Here is my basic question to you: (without hiding behind Wikipedia's formalities which in this case is a huge cop-out) How would <i>you</i> suggest an explanation should be formulated for the fact that Barry Gurary never made it to become the Rebbe of Lubavitch, for whatever reasons? After all, being <i>both</i> the grandson of the sixth Rebbe and the nephew of the seventh <i>should</i> have given him at least the potential to become Rebbe <i>eventually</i>, or at least a fair and legitimate open opportunity by the rules of Chasidus. For example, in similar historical circumstances, after Rabbi <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Teitelbaum_9a0d.html" title="Joel Teitelbaum">Joel Teitelbaum</a> the last <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_e587.html" title="Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)">Satmar</a> Rov passed away, his <b>nephew</b>, Rabbi <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moshe_Teitelbaum_%28Satmar%29_efb6.html" title="Moshe Teitelbaum (Satmar)">Moshe Teitelbaum</a> indeed became the next Satmar Rebbe. Another example: When Rabbi <a href="../../../a/h/a/Aharon_Rokeach_ac5e.html" title="Aharon Rokeach">Aharon Rokeach</a> the previous and fourth <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belz_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_c527.html" title="Belz (Hasidic dynasty)">Belzer</a> Rebbe was <i>niftar</i> there was a serious division of opinion within Belz, but ultimately his <b>nephew</b> Rabbi <a href="../../../y/i/s/Yissachar_Dov_Rokeach_%28II%29_8fa0.html" title="Yissachar Dov Rokeach (II)">Yissachar Dov Rokeach</a> the present Rebbe took over. So please, you owe it to the public to <b>explain why and how the nephew of the last Lubavitcher Rebbe never made it in the race to be Rebbe in Lubavitch?</b> when in other Hasidic movements it did take place, (and please don't tell me that the Rebbe was Mashiach/and or/an incarnation of the <i>Eibishter</i> and that he is "still" the Rebbe - this is Wikipedia, remember?) Nothing that I have written here is outside the paramaters of good <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> and basic self-evident facts. The citations above stress the photos that tell it all, that Barry Guarary was held close to the bosom by his grandfather the sixth Rebbe of Lubavitch, no different to any <i>rebbishe einikel</i> ("[a] grandson [of] rebbes") who was being coddled and prepared to become a potential future Rebbe himself. It's just that something happened along the way that made it no so, and this article MUST address that isssue one way or another (and which you seem to be resisting tooth and nail), otherwise this article will remain like a house with its roof (<i><a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebbe.html" title="Rebbe">Roov</a></i>?) missing. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:45, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yitzi, just stop it. We all understand, and indeed <i>appreciate</i>, that you feel annoyed or even offended about Pinny's removal of your well-written content from the article. The point remains, as I and others have told you plainly, <i>most of the removed text doesn't belong <b>in this article</b></i> ... Referring to quibbles and squabbles in the succession among various Chasidic dynasties is fine, but the text you're arguing for, in large part, is relevant to <i>most</i> Chasidic dynasties, and is not of particular and special relevance to an article about Gurary specifically. Look at the text you're fighting for, and then look really closely at the name of the article. Yes, much of it <i>applies</i> to Gurary, but just because it applies to Gurary doesn't mean it belongs in an article <i>about</i> Gurary. It's just a little bit of a leap, and I hope that by saying so up front, you won't use the big leap I'm about to make as some strawman to attempt to delegitimize the very important point I'm trying to impress upon you by making this leap... Gurary is Jewish. Now, imagine someone coming along and trying to insert 4 paragraphs about <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> into the Gurary article. Gurary is Chasidic. Now, imagine someone coming along and trying to insert 4 paragraphs about <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chassidic_Judaism_edf9.html" title="Chassidic Judaism">Chassidic Judaism</a> into the article. To take it to the extreme, Gurary is [I hope] circumcised. Imagine your outrage if someone were to come along and try to insert 4 paragraphs about <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a>. The point is, the article is ABOUT <b>GURARY</b>, <i>not</i> about "Processes of succession in Chassidic dynasties". As I said before, there's nothing wrong with the text itself, it simply, however, <b>does not belong in <i>this</i> article</b>. Yeah, it sucks that the information presented is really hard to give citations for, but one or two would be <i>really</i> impressive, especially in light of how hard it is to come up with such citations [keep in mind, citations are not limited to WWW URLs!]. That would be <i>almost</i> as impressive as including the information in a <i>relevant</i> article would be. I don't doubt the veracity of the information, I simply see no valid argument being made for its inclusion in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Gurary_6217.html" title="Barry Gurary">Barry Gurary</a>. Nobody's saying "IZAK! You're you're fulla crap!!!"...so a line-by-line refutation and saying "see, this too is truth" is a red herring. Nobody's accusing you of providing <i>false</i> information, but I think there's a strong consensus that <i>as far as this article is concerned</i>, what you're insisting "needs to be included", <i>does not belong in this article</i>. It has its place, to be sure, but <b>this</b> article is <i>not</i> its place! Alright, I think I've got so much bold and capitalization and italicization and bold italicization and bold and capital and omg, what's my name? IZAK. Keep the information. Defend it. Source it. And then include it in an article where it's actually suitable.

<dd>Oh Tomer, I am not upset, I just think that not giving a decent explanation fails simple <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empirical.html" title="Empirical">empirical</a> scholarship which seeks answers to the questions of "why," "how" and "what" - in this case: <i>why</i> did Barry Gurary fail to become an eventual rebbe in Lubavitch unlike in other dynasties where nephews <i>did</i> succeed to the top, <i>what</i> happened and <i>how</i>&#160;? That's it. Why is that so hard to digest? I can understand where PinchasC is coming from, but what's your stake in this beyond trying to protect his feelings? What about Barry Gurary's honor. He has become like the proverbial "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_in_the_Iron_Mask_bad4.html" title="Man in the Iron Mask">Man in the Iron Mask</a>" of Lubavitch. I know you don't subscribe to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/ArtScroll_4e91.html" title="ArtScroll">ArtScroll</a> or Chabad style of studying and <i>portraying</i> history and biographies so why the verbose commotion? Your analogy to the <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> article makes no sense (in any case by now so many people have added so much fluff to that article so as to make "being a Jew according to Wikipedia" almost meaningless, but we won't get into that discussion.) Wikipedia is awash with crap, some of it coming from very nice well-meaning people (yeah, well, sometimes they are not well-meaning) but if an article, in this case a biography about a controversial person, is to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion without it's core guts missing then that article MUST be edited as I have done here, provided that the information is true, logical and as I say here, self-evident. I am prepared to take as long as it takes to work this through. Let me ask you, do you have any problems with the photos serving as citations? Take a look at the links to them above. PinchasC has in the past removed them as references in the article from the "external links" yet, on technical grounds, which is why I have reproduced them here as links on the talk page as part of the discussion being links for anyone to see. Let me know. And yes, have a wonderful <i>Chag Sameach</i> and enjoy your <i><a href="../../../s/u/k/Sukkah.html" title="Sukkah">Sukkah</a></i> -- whose pictures will be decorating yours? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 09:22, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is an old, wise, and funny Jewish tale, unfortunately I cannot render it in English it its full wit. But the story goes like this. Abram and Isaac went into a quarrel; <i>gewalt</i>, pieces of <i>payot</i> in the air... Chaim comes by: "Why so noise? Go ask rabbi to judge you". The three go to rabbi and all three start shouting there. Rebbe says: "Speak in turns. You Abram first" Abram says: "It was thus and thus, rebbe". Rabbi nodes wisely:"You are right, Abram." Issac, impatiently: "But rebbe, it fact all this is so and so!" Rabbi nodes wisely:"You are right too, Isaac." Now Chaim jumps in: "But rebbe, how can it be possible? Abram is right and Isaac is right?" -- "And you are right, too, Chaim!.."</p>
<p>The background is essential to establish notability of Barry beyond the petty theft issue. Otherwise we may well delete this article. At the same time some of IZAK's text goes beyond the description of the context. Things like drawing parallels or making guesses is <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. Unless really trivial and common knowledge, all work of logic must be referenced. It is not that we think that wikipedias are stupid, it is because <i>some</i> wikipeditors are stupid, and unfortunately in wikipedia the line between (potential) stupidity and wit is drawn right on the boundary of wikipedia. No one invented a non-controversial way to increase "expert-friendliness" of wikipedia yet. Attempts of <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a> for "expert-friendly" but otherwise similar wikiprojects are of limited success so far, to put it delicately.</p>
<p>Concluding, I am deleting some pieces, but the section in question is relevant and useful.</p>

<li>PinchasC is merely blanking a section he disagrees with while avoiding the responsibilities of editing. Wikipedia cannot reflect the Lubavitch "politically correct" view that Barry Gurary is "an enemy of the state" and hence a "non-person" and one cannot talk of Barry Gurary without his connection to the question of succession in Lubavitch and the how and why he was cut out of the equation over time.

<li>Note: The material from this article cannot go into "<a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_dynasty.html" title="Hasidic dynasty">Hasidic dynasty</a>" because there is no such article - <i>that</i> topic is in the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic Judaism</a> article. Note also that because "Hasidic dynasty" redirects to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hasidic_dynasties_7500.html" title="List of Hasidic dynasties">List of Hasidic dynasties</a> it therefore does nothing to enhance the list. One should not place essay-length material into lists that do not need them especially if the list in question is doing just fine without extra stuff in it, and in that case the list has a link to <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic Judaism</a>. Finally, the article <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_philosophy.html" title="Hasidic philosophy">Hasidic philosophy</a> is a mess, it's basically just ideas from Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic philosophy, so what would be the point of moving Barry Gurary away from himself (such as this article about him) and into articles not related to the prolonged and agonizing <i>succession struggle</i> which is NOT part of "Hasidic philolosphy"&#160;?

<p>This new version removed alot of the problems in the original. However there is still a problem that most of the sources are from blogs ehich is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The source from these blogs need to be quoted instead. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 16:28, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>PinchasC: Thanks. Note: A photo is a photo is a photo, and as long as they are not a forgeries they are acceptable. You are <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitpicking.html" title="Nitpicking">nitpicking</a> because the blogs are <i>not</i> quoted in the body of the article. Rather, footnotes are provided because the photos come from some blogs and so the footnotes are merely providing a rational and acceptable <i>context</i>, such as captions associated with those photos. Why does that upset you so much? Finally, the photos can also be found in books and often posted on the web. Could you please list here <i>any</i> facts that you dispute. Thanks again. Be well, <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 06:31, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>If the sources are taken from books than eventually they should be quoted from those books as they are more reliable than blogs. Please see my edit summaries for the parts that I did remove, as I listed my objections in those edit summaries, instead of mass reverting. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 15:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The blogs are backed up by books and <i>vice versa</i>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 13:52, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
