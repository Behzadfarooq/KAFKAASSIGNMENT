<p>I think the 2008 presidential run should be broken out into it's own seciton. The Obama page is already quite long, and the information about the 2008 presidential election is just going to continue to grow and grow. Plus, this would allow his basic "biography" to become pretty stable, while most of the new stuff would be going into the election run article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">book deal-Harvard Law Review connection?</span></h2>
<p>Obama became president of Harvard Law Review in 1990 and graduated HLS in 1991. As I said in edit summary, obviously being presisdent of HLR is a good <i>credential</i> for anyone wanting to get a book publishing contract - Law Review is a writing gig, and editing it and being elected president indicates writing skills, and his election brought hi some notice as was stated in the section about his HLR presidency. Dreams was published in 1995 - I just don't see a clear connection to HLR presidency, nor any relevance to it - so is there a citation that can illuminate why his HLR presidency should be juxtaposed with the book deal? It sounded to me like something was being implied by the juxtaposition and I don't know what that is, or if it should be there. So I removed it, but am interested to know why it was put in and then reinstated. The edit summary said "Harvard Law Review part is relevant, it's how he got his book deal to write Dreams from My Father" but that's not self-explanatory.

<dd>In the preface to Dreams he says that he got the deal as a direct result of his presidency. I'll quote the relevant section later tonight. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 23:19, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's actually the introduction, not the preface, and I'm not sure how much I can quote (if any at all) in talkspace, so I'll summarize that page <i>xiii</i> states that he received offers from "a few publishers" during his third year at Harvard Law, and agreed to not seek employment for a year after law school during which he would write a book. I haven't re-read the whole introduction, but to my recollection there is no explanation for the large disparity in time between graduation and publication. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 23:36, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it reads fine now but I don't have a problem at all saying that he was offered the book deal because of his presidency of HLR. Otherwise a reader could be left wondering why a Chicago lawyer got a book deal about his childhood and adolescence seemingly out of the blue. (That is to say, I think that needs to be explicitly stated with the book cited as the source rather than the other text, as it is equally as unclear.) —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 23:48, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/books/40725" class="external text" title="http://www.wnyc.org/books/40725" rel="nofollow">this link</a>, it says "the opportunity to write the book came while I was in law school, the result of my election as the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review . In the wake of some modest publicity, I received an advance from a publisher...". However, I can't explain the time discrepancies. Still, I think it is an important fact to put it in for the reason Bbatsell put forth. - <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPoliticalJunkie_1864.html" title="User:PoliticalJunkie">PoliticalJunkie</a> 20:42, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lol, don't get me started on "writing for a reader who doesn't know anything." But I was just asking because it refers to him in other parts of the article as running as a Democrat.

<p>You're absolutely right. I'm sorta new to the editing game. As you can probably tell all I want to do is add portions of Senator Obama's Oct. 2002 iraq speech to this page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let's move "Political Advocacy" section outside of "Senate Career" section</span></h2>

I am absolutely determined that by the end of the first term of the next president, we should have universal health care in this country.'"</i> I propose making "Political Advocacy" Section 7 instead of Sub-Section 5.3, where it currently is.

<dd>Hmm, I'm not sure about this one - I think we sort of do a dance between having very current up-to-the-minute information and having some longer perspective. Of course we need to be current, but we can't and shouldn't try to be a news-source - I don't think the article needs to list his day-to-day schedule of appearances as we are veering toward, and perhaps some of the older information gives a needed perspective on his candidacy or potential candidacy. So I personally wouldn't be so quick to remove last year's news if it gives insight into how he came to be in the position he now is in - maybe shorten it, but I wouldn't want to completely lose all of the nuance of the lead-up to his announcement. An encyclopedia should have that depth, I think. I know some are concerned about length issues, but let's not let that get in the way of keeping some historical perspective. I mean this as an over-all comment, actually - I'm not saying this particular graf is necessarily essential. Also, we do want some stability in the article - especially in light of the FAR discussions we just came out of. Let's see what others think. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 02:38, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read the paragraph again, in the context of the page, and reinstated it. Yes, some of it may technically be "last year's" opinions, but they're essentially just over a month ago - and the Alter article is needed if we are to keep the Time cover which I think we should. We're talking about only four sentences, and they illustrate exactly what has been going on in the run-up to Obama and Clinton's announcements, still relevant and giving some perspective. <a href="../../../d/u/s/WP%7EDUST_e3db.html" title="WP:DUST">WP:DUST</a> - an essay, not a policy - might be worth reading in this context. Also, the article just passed an informal Featured Article Review, and stability is considered a virtue in that realm. Obviously we need to update the article as events occur, but do we need to constantly rewrite the portions that actually have not changed?

<p><b>Presidential candidates ought to take sustained and preemptive measures to protect their security, but their Wikipedia articles should not.</b></p>

<dd>I agree with Hail in that openness is the hallmark of wikis everywhere. The catch 22 is that because Obama is now a presidential candidate there should be more openness in editing and there will be a larger desire for anonymous editing (whether purposefully anonymous or "drive by" anonymous). However, at the same time, there will most certainly be a significant rise in vandalism because of the interest generated by the move. The truth is that there may be very valid reasons for anonymous editing and even if there is no reason other than sheer laziness that does not make the contribution of an earnest, anonymous editor any less valid than an earnest, registered editor.</dd>

I say lift it and we (the editors with this article watchlisted) can deal with vandalism until it really and truly gets out of hand. In a certain sense I feel a bit shameful when and article I keep tabs on gets protected because it signifies a breakdown in the vigilance of the editorship (I know this is an unrealistic view... but still). I say we give it a go... the worst that can happen is a re-addition of protection (and hey..

That user ID need be in no way identifiable to any individual person - in fact, IP addresses are <i>more</i> identifiable than user IDs, because they can easily be traced with WHOIS by anyone. User IDs can be traced by admins, but it requires a special request to do so, and those are not granted frivolously. So in fact the user ID editor is more anonymous, not less. We have seen recently that the level of vandalism, and the nature of the vandalism, is such that it is damaging to the article to allow IP editing. This article is certainly watched by many people, but it is a small number who diligently montior it and revert vandals. When IP editing was going on, it was an unfair burden, in my view, as it made it difficult to keep track of, and assess, legitimate edits when one is drowning in a sea of vandalism. Further, the nature of the vandalism - as I have said in the past - has not been the annoying "HI MOM" type, but instead has been a targeted, often vicious, vandalism that does damage to the hard work that numerous editors have done here and makes a mockery of the serious attempts that are made to keep the article factual and neutral. I am all in favor of an open system, but requiring usernames that do not have to bear any resemblance to one's real name, and do not have to have an email address attached, are certainly protective of the editor who wishes to remain anonymous, but also protective of the integrity of the article. This article, in my view, is a classic case where sprot is legitimately used to avoid the worst of the vandals. It won't eliminate them all, but it certainly will make it manageable to maintain the quality of the article. The fact that we've had some relative - not absolute - calm due to the latest sprot has allowed the article to be edited and improved without placing an undue burden. I haven't heard any argument that is convincing as to why IP editors should be allowed to return and, I believe, start doing their damage again. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 05:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a>, I believe the semi-protection should be reinstated. This will continue to be one of the most high profile pages in the coming year, and with thus be most vulnerable to vandalism. I further agree that s-protect doesn't prevent people from editing (thus not violating the "anyone can edit") because it's extremely fast and easy to register for a userID. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjewiki_11bf.html" title="User:Bjewiki">Bjewiki</a> 12:36, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should be removed temporarily to see if vandalism persists, and if so, extend the length of protection each time. It will give an opportunity to be edited by anons; however, they decide if it stays unprotected and how long. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">shakam</a></p>

<dd>There are well-meaning anons and malicious vandals. The vicious ones will decide if it stays protected and for how long - not the well-meaning ones. That does not seem right to me. I think we've already seen it, and we should make the decision now. We had sprot for 8 days and needed it back pretty quickly. Now we've had it for 2 weeks and I don't hear anything suggesting why this time would be different - I doubt this is a case of vandals getting tired of waiting and moving on to another target - that's true when it's my example of Joe from Milwaukee. This has been targeted at Obama, a combination of POV-pushing on the one hand and malicious troublemaking on the other - and he's moving up in visibility, not down, by all indications. Why this bothers me is that I think it is difficult to monitor and edit the well-meaning entries that are added when there are so many malicious ones to sort through. Yesterday there were well-meaning additions about the exploratory committee, but they needed editing - if it had been intermingled with vandalism on top of real edits, I think it would have been difficult to sort through (I've seen this happen before), and with the changing base of facts that I expect will be needed in this article in the months to come, why not decide now for an extended term, rather than a longer term by only 5 or 6 days? Articles with sprot are not immune to vandalism but it becomes manageable. The benefits to me outweigh the cost. But if everyone feels that we should go through the motions again, I'll of course cooperate. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It will come as no surprise that I have not changed my opinion on this. I haven't looked closely at today's edits, but yesterday there were times when garbage stood on the page for 11 minutes, for 14 minutes, for 6 minutes, possibly some longer - in the middle of the day - and there were no doubt dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of people reading the page at those times. The prinicple of "open editing" is not the only principle we work under here. Jimbo Wales himself has stated that sometimes semi=-protect is needed. I'll get the reference again if anyone wants it. Everyone in this discussion knows that - we've been around and around and around the block on it. Yes, edits are fairly quickly reverted when a lot of editors are monitoring the page. But there are times when we're not so fast, and that's when Wikipedia looks amateuristic at best, racist at worst, juvenile in the middle - and I am disappointed that the desire for "open editing" has trumped all other concerns. Furthermore, I myself - I thnk a pretty diligent editor, who does at least her share of reverts - have had several instances in this latest round when I've missed real edits that I might want to question because of the sea of crap edits and reverts. The result? Some edits that are legitimate, but I or any editor here might want to discuss or tweak or remove, are overlooked. The end result? A weaker page. If that's what you want, that's what you'll get. I know it's not what many of the people who regularly edit here want - I and they want a great page. A page that when the thousands of people descend as we know they will, that we can be proud of. Our names are not associated with this - this is pure pride of anonymous accomplishment, but it's thwarted by the ideal of open editing. There were almost no IP edits in the last few days that were worthwhile. Again, I haven't llooked today, but I recall maybe one yesterday. All of the rest were vandals having fun, throwing crap on the page, and making us clean it up. I don't know about the rest of you, but I edit lots of pages here and I feel like my time is being grossly wasted by having to watch out for idiocy that could be reduced, if not eliminated, by sprot. All for some principle that has been blown out of proportion into a more important notion than accuracy and professionalism. I am tired of being made to jump through the hoop, when it could be reduced. Hey, guys - I'm just one editor. I've been described elsewhere as the one editor who wants permanent protection - that's not exactly true: I don't want full protection, but I do think we should have longer-term sprot. Just like <i>many</i> other pages have, including some involved in this Presidential campaign. That is, if we want this page to be a good reflection of what Wikipedia can be - a collaborative effort by dedicated people who work together and create up-to-date, compfrehensive articles about everything. Or, we can be seen as a bunch of kids who play here, producing unreliable material that professors shouldn't allow their students to quote from, and mostly only good to joke about regarding Anna Nicole Smith's page having 300 edits in an hour. Other than being amused at being thought of as a kid, which I am quite certainly not - I'd like more than that. No one has yet given me an argument that even began to convince me that this page should not be semi-protected. Forgive my typos - I am late and have to leave. Cheers, folks - this will likely be a big weekend for this article. I hope we're not embarrassed. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 22:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, that's a lot of words! Let me just add, "I agree." This page is too high profile and too juicy a target not to have semi-protection on it.

<li>Well, from my point of view, I think semi-protection does in fact need to remain on this article. Only after a decent period of time should it ever be removed to see if it will subside. However, the fact that the vandalism was worse today than yesterday (you think it'd be worse yesterday due to the announcement), I think semi-protection should pretty much stay up unchallenged. Almost every IP that's posting on this article is posting vandalism from the looks of it, and I'd much rather finish up a paper then constantly re-sp this.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 17:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Look, SP does not stop <i>any</i>one from editing, and it exists for articles that are natural targets. I say SP 'em all until the conventions, then continue SPing the nominees. <a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnschool_e4b4.html" title="User:Unschool">Unschool</a> 17:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I recently read the Faith chapter of <i>The Audacity of Hope</i> and if I remember correctly his mother wasn't very religious; she was just pretty wise. His father left when he was two he couldn't have possible had any effect on his religion. And even though he went to a majority Muslim school, when he lived in Indonesia, he said it didn't really effect him. He came to beliefs he have now on his own, through the "black" church.

<dd>Most of the confusion here is which man you consider his father. Obama's real father was from a Kenyan tribe, and I couldn't find a reference to his religion in the book <i>Dreams from My Father</i> (published 1995, long before Obama was a prominent figure). However, Obama was raised by "Lolo" from the age of two onward. Lolo was a native Hawai'ian, and he was NOT a Muslim. In response to the "<i>Madrassa</i>" claim, everybody who has gone to a school, ever, in their life, has attended a <i>Madrassa</i>. It's the Arabic word for "school", whether secular or religious.

<p>In Islam one does not need to practice it and would still be considered Muslim. So Barack's father was a Muslim. Zidane is not religious and may even be atheist. Yet he is considered a Muslim. Obama also went to a madrassa school for sometime. If he was not Mulsim I fail to see what he was doing there. So Obama is a convert from Islam to Christianity.</p>

<p>It's incorrect that Obama attended a "Muslim" school from ages 6-8. Obama's note in <i>Dreams of My Father</i> (in addition to Insight Magazine et al's exposition of that tidbit) was simply wrong, as demonstrated by this <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/22/obama.madrassa/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/22/obama.madrassa/index.html" rel="nofollow">CNN report</a>. The school is nominally secular, public, and non-religious.

<p>Hmmmm. Wikipedia has certainly failed on the Obama article. Obama himself had admitted that he was a Muslim "in his childhood years." This story has been picked up by the AP (e.g, here: <a href="http://asia.news.yahoo.com/070211/ap/d8n7n7bg0.html" class="external free" title="http://asia.news.yahoo.com/070211/ap/d8n7n7bg0.html" rel="nofollow">http://asia.news.yahoo.com/070211/ap/d8n7n7bg0.html</a>).

<p>"So how can you support murdering babies?" I told him I understood his position but had to disagree with it. I explained my belief that few women made the decision to terminate a pregnancy casually; that any pregnant woman felt the full force of the moral issues involved and wrestled with her conscience when making that decision; that I feared a ban on abortion would force women to seek unsafe abortions, as they had once done in this country. I suggested that perhaps we could agree on ways to reduce the number of women who felt the need to have abortions in the first place. The man listened politely and then pointed to statistics on the pamphlet listing the number of unborn children that, according to him, were sacrificed every year. After a few minutes, I said I had to go inside to greet my supporters and asked again if the group wanted to come in. Again the man declined. As I turned to go, his wife called out to me. "I will pray for you," she said. "I pray that you have a change of heart." Neither my mind nor my heart changed that day, nor did they in the days to come. But I did have that family in mind as I wrote back to the doctor and thanked him for his email. The next day, I had the language on my website changed to state in clear but simple terms my pro-choice position. And that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own--that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>I could have sworn this page used to have a section for criticism. Most politician's pages have a spot for it, as well they should. I think one should be included here, with the bit about him purchasing a house and a developer purchasing the property next to his, and with the story of his "fundamentalist madrassa" education, followed by the debunking of the madrassa story. The madrassa story should <b>definitely</b> be mentioned here, as the story made it to national news outlets, and people who have heard the story <i>but not it's debunking</i> will visit this article and assume this page is maintained by Obama fans who don't want the "dirt" on Obama revealed. The information should be there. 71.198.52.89 23:37, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to Insight Magazine's false "madrassa" smear, Obama's Wikipedia article is still bound by Wikipedia's policy on biographies of living persons, and the section would have to be <b>very</b> carefully written. As for the non-story concerning his house, it was determined to be non-notable, and placing it under a "controversy" section (when no wrongdoing was alleged) could be seen as a POV maneuver. I can see a good argument for the "madrassa" bit included as a controversy (not a criticism), but agree with past editors that the non-story on his house is not notable for inclusion on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaliavivi_ad2e.html" title="User:Italiavivi">Italiavivi</a> 23:41, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Perhaps "controversy" would be a better title, but I still think both stories should be mentioned. <a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2006/11/obamas_house_de.html" class="external text" title="http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2006/11/obamas_house_de.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the first Google hit I got for "Obama house." That story quotes the original Chicago Tribune article saying "...the hows and whys of a real estate deal, and a train of subsequent transactions, are raising questions about the relationship between the two men, as Obama struggles to distance himself from Rezko, and Rezko strives to stay out of prison." The story doesn't have to outright allege illegal doings to be critical or controversial. Same with the madrassa story. I guess this seems important to me because these are the two criticisms I have heard people make about Obama in real life. If somebody wants information about Obama, they may come here, and I think they should be given, or at least directed to, the correct information. The madrassa story, especially, should be included, because it wasn't just Insight that published it. The story was all over FOX news, and how many people do you suppose saw the story there, but never saw the follow up on CNN or in the New York Times? The <i>whole</i> story should be covered. 71.198.52.89 07:04, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to the house non-story, you knew specifically what you were Googling for, and I stand by my assertion that it is not notable enough for inclusion. If the words "drugs" and "cocaine" are not present at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>'s article (with the link to "substance abuse controversy" being in a single paragraph), this house non-story doesn't belong on Obama's in <i>two</i> paragraphs. I also wonder if there's a degree of recentism here -- of what notable consequence will this house non-story be a year from now? In five years? Ten?</dd>

<p>Criticism sections, in my opinion, tend to give undue weight to criticisms because they tend to be turn into dumping grounds for everything that is unleashed on the article's subject. They are equivalent to Trivia sections, IMHO. If the criticism is worthy of inclusion in the article, then they can be worked into the existing prose. As for the madrassa hoax and Howard's criticism, perhaps the presidential article is a better place for them. Howard's comments are too new to judge the impact, but the madrassa hoax has gotten several weeks of play in the media and will probably make re-appearances throughout the campaign. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 19:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rezko real estate deal</span></h2>
<p>Just a quick follow-up on some of the controversy points. I don't think the madrassa story has any real purpose appearing here. The real estate deal seems significant enough, however. The story about the Rezkos, whether or not Obama did anything improper, did consume significant media attention for a lengthy period of time, and Obama apologized for it. As one article has <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/cookstory.asp?id=279787&amp;cc=c&amp;tc=&amp;t=" class="external text" title="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/cookstory.asp?id=279787&amp;cc=c&amp;tc=&amp;t=" rel="nofollow">summarized</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first crisis of Obama’s Senate tenure unfolded right before last November’s election. A Chicago newspaper reported Obama closed on his $1.65 million Hyde Park home the same day in June 2005 that campaign fundraiser Antoin “Tony” Rezko closed on an adjoining vacant parcel from the same owner. Obama got a discount of about $300,000 from the list price, while Rezko, a developer, paid the full price of $625,000. Obama acknowledged he tipped off his acquaintance Rezko to the land’s availability. Rezko, who was under federal investigation at the time the two closed on their purchases, was indicted last October on charges he tried to use his influence with Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich to shake down companies who wanted state business for campaign contributions and kickbacks. In between the home closing and Rezko’s indictment, Obama bought a strip of land from Rezko to augment his side yard. When the deal became public, Obama apologized and called it a boneheaded move.</p>

<p>I don't see anything on the Talk page that fits what's been claimed earlier: "As for the non-story concerning his house, it was determined to be non-notable." By whom?

<dd>I think having the sentence removed completely as it is now (last I looked) is the best solution. I'm sorry I didn't do that last night, but there were so many edits and reversions that I couldn't quickly see when that line had even gotten into the graf (one of my prime reasons for supporting sprot as everyone here has read me say too often) - so I removed the ridiculous redundancy of "biracial" and "non-white", and intended to come back today and see how it got there. So again, I think taking the line out completely, leaving the text as we have had it, is the correct way to go right now. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:25, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Drug Use</span></h2>
<p>Should we include in this article that Obama is the first mainstream Presidential candidate who has admitted drug use, marijuana and cocaine? I think this is an important piece of information, considering the federal regulations refusing special security clearances, such as those needed by a President, to specific types of drug use. This may be a major issue during the race. This is the very reason that Clinton "did not inhale" and Bush "did not use cocaine".</p>

<dd>Well, the idea that a serving President of the United States (the man with his finger on the red button, let's remember) would be denied security clearances is bizarre and totally a non-issue.

<dd>The article already discusses Obama's admission of marijuana and cocaine use as a teen. I don't see a need to give that fact any more weight by labeling him the first presidential candidate to admit as much (and wasn't Clinton's statement essentially an admission? What about Bush's declining to discuss whether he used any illegal drugs <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_substance_abuse_controversy_7531.html#Illegal_drugs" title="George W.

Are reliable sources discussing Obama's alleged "first" in respect to it being a "first"? I haven't seen any.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Links to Obama's Parents, Etc.</span></h2>
<p>I've inserted article links to Obama's parents, his step father, and his father's village, even though these articles don't yet exist on Wikipedia. These subjects are all notable insofar as they influenced Obama, and are frequent subjects of discussion in the media. Those looking for information, for example, about whether Obama's step-father was a dedicated Wahabbist (as conservative talk radio has claimed) should be able to turn to wikipedia to find information about Lolo Soetero. Same goes for Obama's mother and father and his father's villiage (which I've seen on the television news here in the US). Quality articles on these subjects will be of great use in the discussions of Ombama's background which will inevitably be a feature of American political life for the next year or two.

<dd>Our Manual of Style encourages against overlinking, and I don't know that any of Obama's family is notable enough <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">with regard to Wikipedia's policies on notability</a>. Obviously his family is going to be mentioned peripherally sometimes when Obama is mentioned, but I'm not certain how likely it is that they will ever receive attention as primary subjects (rather than as Obama's family). Redlinking to articles that don't exist and possibly won't ever exist doesn't help the article, in my humble opinion. If those articles are created, and their notability established, then I have not one problem with linking to them, but at present, that is not the case. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 22:58, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I reverted before noticing that you had posted here, sorry. They aren't notable just because they "influenced Obama". In fact, if their notability is entirely tied to being related to Obama, they certainly shouldn't have articles here, in my opinion. I'm just not sure if there are multiple, non-trivial sources that discuss these people in detail. One caveat: I'm not saying that his economist father shouldn't have an article, though, but I know nothing about his work as an economist and whether it is encyclopedic. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 23:02, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that the amount of discussion of these subjects in the media, as well as the number of google hits on them would in most cases be sufficient to establish notability. Additionally, all are discussed in Obama's published works. Most importantly however, all of these subjects are difficult to find reliable information about and subject to media rumors. Wikipedia can perform a valuable role in collecting and making available accurate information about these subject of wide public interest. While I agree that the article is now somewhat overlinked, I also think that links to non-existent articles are useful pointers towards where more work need to be done, and that including them is therefore quite important. (Alego, for example seems to be quite a very obscure village; however perhaps after seeing a red link, someone with access to good information on Kenya will be able to supply its location and a description.) Obama's candidacy has placed particular importance on his family background, and interest in these figures is sure to be significant. Whether or not we feel that the public *should* take an interest in these figures, Wikipedia will imo</dd>

<dd>His family is probably all non-notable, but I think it would be great to have an article on Alego, his father's hometown.

<dd>I think we are overlinked already, and unless someone has enough information to warrant writing separate articles, any stubs that just say Ann Dunham was Obama's mother, for example , will be merged back to here anyway. If, however, as Jersyko suggests, there is something notable to write an article about, then I hope someone will write it and we would link to it. As it stands now, I think adding red links is implying that there is notability without any evidence. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 00:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, actually Gore's son was in the news a fair amount, so if the daughters have articles it kind of makes sense for the son too. I would guess that Bill Clinton's mother has an article, becsause she was a personality that was known to the country, like Miss Lillian (let's see how many old folks know who I mean)... Obama's mother, however, is unknown to the world, as far as I know, so I await with bated breath what her article would be. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 04:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I find it very likely that Obama's family will eventually become clearly noteworthy enough to merit articles, as more news sites focus in on them over the coming months. (I expect that Fox will have a field day running with the idea of a liberal presidential candidate having two atheist parents, for example.) In particular, if Obama ends up making it through the primaries (though possibly even if he doesn't), it will be a certainty that his parents will need their own articles, as the topic of a major current presidential candidate's parents is automatically noteworthy, and his (and their) history is too complex to all cover within the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barack_Obama_6463.html" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> article. However, it may be wise to wait and see whether that happens before rushing to make such articles in anticipation. If any of the editors here are antsy to start work on such pages (which I think could be quite fascinating, honestly; Obama's parents seems like remarkable people, and I find his mother especially interesting), then I recommend working on such articles in Userspace until they unambiguously meet our criteria for inclusion. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 11:54, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm really somewhat mystified that several people have asserted that Obama's partents and step-parents are non-notable, without proving any rationale for their claim. It would seem that according to the standards of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, these persons (like his father's village) quite clearly fall within the usual guidelines for notability. A notable person is one who, for example: "has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." Hundreds or thousands of discussions (already) of these persons in radio and on television seem quite clearly to establish notability based on this criterion. On a more abstract level, this information seems clearly to pass the "100 years test," given that those interested in the biographies of famous persons always find information such as this of use. Frankly, I find the refusal to admit notablity in these cases irresponsible, given the enormous amount of speculative public discussion now taking place about these people. Also, I find it ironic that those Obama himself acknowledges to have had a a crucially formative influence on him seem to have been judged less notable than the creators of obscure CD's, web comics, etc. who are routinely included in Wikipedia. Surely raising Barack Obama is as notable as putting together a college band, especially since Obama himself emphasizes the importance of his parents in the formation of his character and beliefs. Finally, I have a disturbing sense that some may be averse to including links to articles that don't yet exist for purely aesthetic reasons, or that they might make the article "look bad" as an encyclopedia article. I hope I'm wrong about that, as of course the omission of links in order to make a good impression on readers would be a very bad and irresponsible practice.

He and his wife are both open about his kicking the habit. I am now of the opinion that Sen. Obama's quitting is notable enough for mention, and would like to survey this page's editors concerning a mention of Sen. Obama's current no-smoking effort.</p>
<p>I propose a mention which highlights his <i>public effort to quit smoking</i>, not one which impugns him simply for being/having been a smoker.

<li><b>Support</b>. However a whole *section* on this issue would be *way* more than is called for. Smoking can be mentioned quite briefly, for example: "Obama writes about using marijuana and cocaine during his teenage years to "push questions of who I was out of my mind." Obama also took up smoking during his high school years, a habit he has recently resolved to quit." (The second sentence would be new to the article.) No whole section is needed for this, and there do not need to be updates every time there's a rumor that someone saw him smoking.

I deliberately changed the title of this section to emphasize that you are not the one controls how a discussion is handled. If you can feel free to move my comments than you shouldn't have a problem with the new title of this section. Or do you just like to put those who disagree with you on the defensive with your passive-aggressive attitude? And to word this survey and section in such a way that your POV has a more prominent position in the discussion (i.e., instead of you having to give your arguments for non-notability others have to give their arguments against notability and to do so in a special section that you create for those of us who disagree with you).

<li><b>Answer</b> I know that I personally do not understand your interpretation of policy and I am sure other editors feel the same way. What campaigns are being conducted on the Obama website of which I am a member has no bearing on whether this fact is notable. This isn't Obama's campaign website. We aren't here to promote Obama or to draw attention to his personal goals, or his personal decision to quit smoking even if he and his supporters choose to draw attention to it. So to your question about his supporters conducting a quit smoking campaign factoring into this I have to say that it does not as this isn't Obama's campaign website. Also, the amount of media coverage of a fact does not equate to it being a topic (i.e, Obama is a topic as opposed to his quitting smoking not being a topic). Being an active member of Obama's website I ask you where exactly is this so-called "campaign." I am not saying that it isn't on the website but that I who have been actively involved on his website have not yet come across it. As far as I can see it is not a part of his static content. If it is something that we are doing on the blogs and in the groups than it has no right to be included based on that. Obama doesn't even mention smoking on his <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/healthcare/" class="external text" title="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/healthcare/" rel="nofollow">health care</a> page. Doing a search of BarackObama.com gets no search return for the word smoking and when you use the word "smoke" returns three mentions of it on his website which have no bearing on his quitting smoking. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 05:15, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

That is not to assume you had that reason nor did I claim that you did.

I had every right to make that point and I now state clearly that you are wrong and that I did not assume bad faith. Let me state that as clearly as I can: YOU WRONGLY ASSUMED THAT I HAD ASSUMED BAD FAITH BUT WAS MERELY MAKING A POINT ABOUT WHY THE COMMENT SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE ARTICLE.

What is unwarranted is your saying that my all-caps is unwarranted and uncivil and it is highly rude of you to say so. Why don't you calm down and stop referring to my statements as uncivil, stop impugning my motives and stop telling me what is and is not warranted as its clear that your comments are unwelcome and rude and I consider them highly uncivil and I suggest you calm down. You have successfully put me on the defensive. Was that your intent when you accused me of assuming bad faith? You are rude, inconsiderate, uncivil and your comments are unwarranted and offensive. What started out as a simple point about me thinking that the comment shouldn't be included because I thought it had a political motivation has resulted in you maligning my character, and impugning my motives. Continue this and you will win and I will leave this talk page. I have never had anyone be so rude and uncivil as to accuse me of assuming bad faith. I find it offensive, rude, inconsiderate and uncivil and then to top it off you say that my using caps it unwarranted.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I do not admit that it is either newsworthy or interesting instead I stated that simply because it is considered newsworthy or interesting does not mean that it should be included as notability is not the same as newsworthiness. To start this article should not give undue weight to his decision to quit smoking. Simply, "undue weight applies to more than just viewpoints. Just as giving undue weight to a viewpoint is not neutral, so is giving undue weight to other verifiable and sourced statements." The idea that we should give serious consideration in this article to his decision to quit smoking is concerning as "an article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject."</dd>

<dd>This fact simply does not meet the significance of being prominently included in the article. Biographical articles are not repositories of every fact, trivia, or statement made by an individual during their life. Further, "undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements." <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnham_36c9.html" title="User:Ernham">Ernham</a> made the point "If his cat died tonight, it would get 500-1000 hits on google by the morning. I can't wait for the subsection in this wiki, personally. Meow." Here he makes a valid observation as to the notability of personal facts about a person's life. An example of giving undue weight to his quitting smoking is that no where in the article is it mentioned that his children want him to run for President so they can "get a dog." This statement was also made in his "60 Minutes" interview along with his decision to stop smoking. Should we include that he likes to cook pasta because that is his children's favorite food? Or that he might very well be the first "<b>Commander in Chef.</b>" The "I" was deliberately left out and the word Chef is correct. You have yet to give an argument as to why this should be included and on Wikipedia we place the burden on those including information to prove that it should be included. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 20:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You feel free to move anything you want as its clear that you intend to do so. Also, I wasn't unhappy with the survey's structure. What I am unhappy with is your uncivil conduct. That you can't see how rude your above comment is and how offensive it is than there is no reason to continue this discussion. Also, referring to this as a dispute seems arrogant as it assumes that there is something to dispute as if the decision is yours to make and mine to dispute. It further implies that I did not have the right to object to your moving MY COMMENTS without my consent. Moving sections is one thing but moving comments made by individual editors is another. I have never not been calm but if it makes you feel all fuzzy inside to think, "look at how good I am for being the better person and asking the unhappy "user Edward" to calm down." The passive aggressive way in which you treat others need to be condemned. New editors leave when people accuse them of assuming bad faith and behaving as you have. Being less secure about myself and my opinions I may have done the same but I now that other editors aren't as rude as you have been here. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 04:39, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How does he expect to win?</span></h2>
<p>Is it just me, or is he in a bad situation to become POTUS? His name is possibly the worst it can get in a time like this (Barack=Iraq; Hussein=Sadam Hussein; Obama=Osama, O-"Bomb"-a), although that's just a cursory glance. He smokes, he's done drugs, he's only been in the senate for less than a full term, the only media coverage he's gotten is when he announced he may run for Pres, he's African-American (which in itself, Americans would question the nation's readiness to elect a black president, but one who is born to interracial parents may spark another question among the black population).</p>
<p>I do not mean to bring any offense to those who think highly of Obama, but it seems that America is taking him into consideration too easily and quickly. It doesn't make sense to me that such a man could decide to run for president out of the blue and get all the support he's getting. His polls may be high, but when it comes election day, I question the feasibility of his becoming president.</p>
<p>Neither this article nor the campaign article takes any of this into account. It is very viable information (maybe minus the name thing) and should be included into the text of the article. While some people may think it's "touchy," it certainly doesn't look too good beating around the bush. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035"><font color="#0084C9">Jared</font></a></b></sup><sub>┘</sub><sup>┌</sup><sub><i><a href="../../../j/p/0/User_talk%7EJP06035_4c31.html" title="User talk:JP06035"><font color="#009E49">talk</font></a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup>  01:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, that was my own personal view, and I have no sources to back anything up and don't plan on looking for any. But, again, it appears that you have ignored my other comments. It just seems like if people are going to ignore the obvious truth, then they're just cheating themselves. (And I am not referring to the naming thing, which is a fabrication of my own but I'm sure shared by many others.) <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035"><font color="#0084C9">Jared</font></a></b></sup><sub>┘</sub><sup>┌</sup><sub><i><a href="../../../j/p/0/User_talk%7EJP06035_4c31.html" title="User talk:JP06035"><font color="#009E49">talk</font></a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup>  01:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is not the place for your personal views in any capacity. The "obvious truth" to you is indeed not obvious to everyone, no more than someone else's "obvious truth" would be straightforward to you. Such a discussion can serve no purpose.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 01:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps you should read his campaign website and find out why he thinks he can win.&#160;:) If the information you request is notable enough and covered in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, then it can be added to the campaign article. Obama seems to be rather popular despite his biracial ethnicity and the rather nonsensical gyrations some make with his name, but he could be a Howard Dean for all anyone knows at this point in the campaign. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 02:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Barack Obama Biography</span></h2>
<p>A new biography on Barack Obama is being put out by Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers. It's called <i>Hopes and Dreams The Story of Barack Obama</i> by journalist Steve Dougherty. I think this might be good information to add to the Pop Culture section of the main Obama page.</p>
