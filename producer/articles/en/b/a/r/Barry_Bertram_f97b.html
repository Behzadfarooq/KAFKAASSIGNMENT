<p>Bertram, meanwhile, will work as Cocanougher's parttime assistant. Cocanougher will keep his office in Springfield, and the Campbellsville unit in Taylor County, out of which Bertram worked, will become a sub-office. Bertram, meanwhile, has moved next door to Bertram &amp; Cox to work in private practice with his son, John D. Bertram (born <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>). In private practice, Bertram can handle Felonies, Real Estate Law, Personal Injury, Probates &amp; Estate Administration, Family Law, and Workers' Compensation Law</p>
<p>"I intend to be available to do some civil work . . . I'll also assist the county attorney if I'm needed. I will not be full-time. I'll work at my own speed. My health is good, and I still enjoy the practice of law," Bertram said in an interview with reporter James Roberts in Bertram's hometown newspaper, the <i>Central Kentucky News-Journal</i> of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campbellsville%2C_Kentucky_3767.html" title="Campbellsville, Kentucky">Campbellsville</a>.</p>
<p>John Bertram said that his father is returning to private practice because "he loves people, and I think people genuinely feel like he is a good listener when they share their issues. This has been true in the prosecution setting and will continue to be the case in private practice."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bertram_f97b.html" title="Edit section: A family of lawyers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A family of lawyers</span></h2>
<p>Bertram comes from a family of lawyers: his grandfather, his father, two uncles, a brother, and a nephew, 11th District Circuit Judge Allan Ray Bertram (born <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>). After he graduated from high school, Bertram married his high school sweetheart, Margaret R. Bertram (born <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>). The couple has four children - George Barry "Chip" Bertram, Jr., Teri Campbell, Kathy McCabe, and John Bertram.</p>
<p>The law lineage continued with three of his children. Teri Campbell owns "Nashville Court Reporters". "Chip" spent five years in his father's office as a legal assistant. John is (1) an assistant commonwealth's attorney, (2) the Campbellsville city attorney, and (3) a partner of Bertram &amp; Cox. Kathy McCabe, a teacher, is the only one to not go into a law-related field.</p>
<p>Bertram obtained his bachelor's degree <i>cum laude</i> and his law degree from <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanderbilt_University_3e3f.html" title="Vanderbilt University">Vanderbilt University</a> in <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville%2C_Tennessee_0fa5.html" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>. After he finished law school in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, he returned to Campbellsville and began working alongside his father, George O. Bertram (<a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>), at Faulkner &amp; Bertram. Though his father would have been an obvious mentor, Bertram said his father turned him over to law partner, Fred Faulkner, Jr. (born <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>). "Fred couldn't have been a better mentor," Bertram said.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Bertram first ran for commonwealth's attorney against Lester H. Spalding (<a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>), who was seeking a fourth term. Bertram was secure in the seat thereafter: he had opposition only once, in the Democratic primary held on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. Bertram defeated James L. "Jimbo" Mattingly, 6,003 (52.5 percent) to 5,434 (47.5 percent).</p>
<p>The commonwealth's attorney (1) prosecutes felony violations within the Circuit Court and (2) presents evidence to the grand jury concerning such violations.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bertram_f97b.html" title="Edit section: High-profile cases">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">High-profile cases</span></h2>
<p>In his three decades-plus of service, Bertram has witnessed his share of high-profile cases. The Campbellsville newspaper cited three such situations:</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, he tried Eugene Frank Tamme for a double murder in Washington County. Tamme twice received the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>. "He got the death penalty, appealed it, and got it again," Bertram said.</p>
<p>In the Tamme case, the remains of two boys were found in Washington County in 1983. "They were buried in a shallow grave," Bertram said. "A few months later, he dug them up." Police found the bodies in the Chaplain River and an accomplice came forward and accused Tamme. Tamme died while a prisoner. Kentucky has traditionally very few executions.</p>
<p>A case Bertram tried in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> resulted in changing the state kidnapping law. Beverly Johnson kidnapped a baby from Springview Hospital in <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon%2C_Kentucky_bd2e.html" title="Lebanon, Kentucky">Lebanon</a> with the intent of convincing her boyfriend the baby was hers. If that plan failed, Johnson planned to sell the baby, Bertram said.</p>
<p>Before this case, kidnapping in Kentucky had to involve murder, rape, or a ransom demand. What Johnson did was considered custodial interference, until the law was changed to make taking a child <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidnapping.html" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>.</p>
<p>In a third case, Bertram cited his personal frustration when a suspect was freed despite contrary evidence. There was a <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodomy.html" title="Sodomy">sodomy</a> case in Green County. A man had been accused of sodomizing his stepdaughter, and the suspect's seminal fluid was found on the child's shirt. Bertram was seeking twenty years to life, but the jury acquitted the man.</p>
<p>"Juries will follow the law if they agree with it," he said. "I feel that Green County [jurors] violated their oath. It's frustrating to have jury trials when many times the jury doesn't see things your way, but that's the system. I don't think you ever get over that. It hurts," Bertram said in the newspaper interview.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bertram_f97b.html" title="Edit section: Making the law work for people">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Making the law work for people</span></h2>
<p>Bertram noted how he once gave a college student a break. The student had stolen from his employer, the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_Green%2C_Kentucky_bb65.html" title="Bowling Green, Kentucky">Bowling Green</a>-based <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit_of_the_Loom_2509.html" title="Fruit of the Loom">Fruit of the Loom</a>, which formerly operated an underwear manufacturing plant for more than four decades in Campbellsville. Bertram recommended probation. Bertram said that the suspect went on to "become a very successful teacher. . . . If he had a felony on his record, he wouldn't [have been] able to [have done] that."</p>
<p>In his new role as an assistant commonwealth's attorney, Bertram said that he will have the luxury of not having to prosecute any suspect that he does not believe to be guilty.</p>
<p>John Bertram said that his father's reputation for simply listening to clients and offering guidance will benefit the law firm: "To this day, I still see many clients who recall having worked with my dad or grandfather, so they'll be pleased to know they can consult with Dad regarding various matters. So, I'm thrilled that he is returning."</p>
<p><a name="Bertram_the_runner" id="Bertram_the_runner"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bertram_f97b.html" title="Edit section: Bertram the runner">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bertram the runner</span></h2>
<p>Bertram ran track in high school and also at Vanderbilt but then lost interest in the sport. At the age of 40, he resumed running for health reasons and amusement. Bertram said that at the college level there are many good runners. However, the older the runners get, the fewer show up in running events. "At my age, there aren't more than three, four, or five people who even show up at races, and I often wonder why," he said. "So many of them were excellent runners."</p>
<p>After the age of 65, running divisions are no longer broken down into five-year ranges. "I'm in the 'up' division now," Bertram said. "Races have divisions for different age groups, like 55-59, 60-64 and 64 and up," he said. "I'm in the 'up' division where they stop breaking the age groups down and where there aren't a whole lot of people to compete with anyway."</p>
<p>Bertram said that he has not missed a race in some twenty years. He even competed one year after having had surgery. "I jog for fitness, but if there's a road race I'll go and do the best I can," he added. Since his first half marathon, he has also run full marathons, including the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Marathon_c3a3.html" title="New York Marathon">New York Marathon</a>. He also competed once in the Kentucky 50-miler, a race from <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisville%2C_Kentucky_392f.html" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville</a> to the capital of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfort%2C_Kentucky_220e.html" title="Frankfort, Kentucky">Frankfort</a>.</p>
<p>Bertram has the ability to laugh at himself: he is bald. He and two other commonwealth's attorneys, Ray Larson and Steve Wilson, once formed the "Kentucky Bald Guys Caucus" as a way of laughing at themselves.</p>
