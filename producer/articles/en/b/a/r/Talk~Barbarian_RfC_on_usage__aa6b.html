<p>This <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RfC</a> is on the usage of the term <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html" title="Barbarian">Barbarian</a> at wikipedia.</p>
<p>I argue that the usage of the term "barbarian" is inherently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>, is inherently imprecise because it is too vague and broad a term and unless being used in a direct quote, is inappropriate at wikipedia in most instances. This is concerning the broader contextual meaning of the term and not just for the Roman's usage of it.</p>
<p>User <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> takes the position that the term barbarian is a neutral and appropriate term to be used when identifying any <i>"non-Roman"</i>, as can be seen in protracted discussion at <a href="../../../d/e/c/Talk%7EDecline_of_the_Roman_Empire_d6ef.html" title="Talk:Decline of the Roman Empire">Talk:Decline of the Roman Empire</a> and his recent addition of the section <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html#Modern_academia" title="Barbarian">Modern Academia</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html" title="Barbarian">Barbarian</a> article.</p>
<p>Please read the relevant policies on this matter: <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Identity" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia Manual of Style</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28identity%29_da8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (identity)">Wikipedia Naming Conventions</a>.</p>
<p>Based on these policies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Barbarian is not the term these groups self-identified as.</li>
<li>Barbarian is an outdated and imprecise term - it is vague, overly broad and encourages sloppy scholarship.</li>
<li>Barbarian is not specific terminology. The most specific terminology available is the appropriate usage.</li>
<li>Barbarian cannot be assumed to be an all-inclusive and accurate term when describing all <i>"non-Romans"</i>.</li>
<li>Barbarian is inherently unneutral. It is considered pejorative and has negative associations - regardless of common usage.</li>
<li>Barbarian can be used in a direct quote, with the original text, even if the author does not adhere to these guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Up until fairly recent times, it was quite normal - even in academia and science - to refer to non-anglo cultures and racial groups as simply <i>"non-white"</i> rather than whatever their respective self-identifier was. Referring to any "outside" group based on the blanket biases and opinions of another group which is perceived as morally and culturally superior is inherently POV. This archaic usage can be seen in instances in referring to all non-jews (or non-christians) as <i>"gentiles"</i>, or more relevant in this instance, the archaic practice of referring to native-americans simply with the historical usage of <i>"savages"</i>.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with falling back on the fallacious <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_tradition.html" title="Appeal to tradition">Appeal to tradition</a>. A conclusion should be able to be drawn solely based on empirical common sense that referring to "outside" groups with a pejorative is inherently POV. - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 19:15, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The term Barbarian is appropriate in <i>some</i> articles on Wikipedia dealing with <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Antiquity_2491.html" title="Late Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a> because it is the commonly accepted terminology used by Medieval scholars.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the available modern mainstream sources about the Middle Ages use the term Barbarian <i>within proper historical context</i>. This includes:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.britannica.com/search?query=barbarian&amp;ct=&amp;searchSubmit.x=0&amp;searchSubmit.y=0" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/search?query=barbarian&amp;ct=&amp;searchSubmit.x=0&amp;searchSubmit.y=0" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Britannica on Barbarian</a>. plus all other general purpose Encyclopedias. I know of no Encyclopedia that <i>avoids</i> the term Barbarian or use it in quotes.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_the_Middle_Ages_c1c9.html" title="Dictionary of the Middle Ages">Dictionary of the Middle Ages</a></i>, the largest, most modern, and most respected encyclopedia about the Middle Ages in the English language, has an article entitled "Barbarians, the Invasions" and uses the term barbarian throughout its 13 volumes.</li>
<li>The most important and top scholars of Late Antiquity are: <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Heather_254a.html" title="Peter Heather">Peter Heather</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Brown_ce2b.html" title="Peter Brown">Peter Brown</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Pohl_58c0.html" title="Walter Pohl">Walter Pohl</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Goffart_5d69.html" title="Walter Goffart">Walter Goffart</a> -- all of whom use the term Barbarian not only in texts, but in the titles of books, including those published as recently as December 2006. These scholars work at some of the worlds top universities and are obviously peer reviewed per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</li>
<li>This is just a sample but shows mainstream use in reliable sources per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The above RfC has provided no source to support its position. It is a logical fallacy to take the term out its proper academic context.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes terms do go out of style, if that is the case, it should be no trouble providing a source saying so. For example, <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028782/Dark-Ages" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028782/Dark-Ages" rel="nofollow">this article</a> from Encyclopedia Britannica says the term Dark Ages "is now rarely used by historians". Is there any source anywhere that says Barbarian "is rarely used by historians"?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the "Appeal to tradition" argument, according to the rules of Wikipedia (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) we are supposed to use mainstream academic sources ie. tradition. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is not an "appeal to tradition", but how Wikipedia is designed. We report on what others say and do.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As for it being a pejorative, historians don't use it as a pejorative, it is used to avoid an anachronism, which is standard historical practice, many historically pejorative terms are used that way. For example "Renaissance" implies a "rebirth" from a "dark age" which implies a negative view of the kingdoms of the early middle ages (related to the complaint about the term barbarian). The term "Renaissance" was a pejorative created by Italian humanists in the 15th C who wanted to see Ancient Rome rise again, but historians use "Renaissance" today in a neutral manner without implying they wish to restore ancient Rome (!). In the same way historians use Barbarian in a neutral manner <i>within proper historical context</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding this: <i>Barbarian is not the term these groups self-identified as.</i> - Most of the terms for these tribes were assigned to them by the Romans. Germans, for example, did not call themselves German until after Late Antiquity was over - German is a Roman term.</li>

<p>The term is an ancient slur. We are not citizens of ancient Rome and, if we were, it still wouldn't be OK because Wikipedia is a <i>neutral</i> source of information. It doesn't matter how neutral anyone <i>means</i> it to be, the origins and definition of the term are plain to see and there are many other, more specific terms that could be used instead.</p>
<p>Not only this, the term is not necessary, is unspecific, has various negative historically incorrect connotations and is, as others have stated, rather lazy. If the tribes are Germanic, write <i>Germanic tribes</i>. If there were <i>Slavic tribes</i>, write it. If there were both, write it. Rome does not gain more importance on the historical scale than those surrounding it. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloodofox_6b7d.html" title="User:Bloodofox">:bloodofox:</a> 17:08, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nonsense. "Barbarian" is just like "Indian" - it refers to the native peoples using historical terminology. The term Indian is indeed controversial in modern politics, see <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_name_controversy_7f75.html" title="Native American name controversy">Native American name controversy</a> - but no such controversy exists for Barbarian. If it did, there would be no trouble pointing to sources that said so - actually you did, you said "Modern Germanic Neopagan Reconstructionist groups, for example, shun the word as it is anciently slanted towards Roman POV"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADecline_of_the_Roman_Empire&amp;diff=98409367&amp;oldid=98406128" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADecline_of_the_Roman_Empire&amp;diff=98409367&amp;oldid=98406128" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>Taking the term out of its academic context and using a cherry-picked dictionary definition to claim POV is clearly Original Research. We report on what people do and scholars (both specialists and generalists) use the term Barbarian in proper context all the time, universally, without controversy or exception. I'm sorry you personally find that offensive, but that is just how the world is and how Wikipedia operates. Perhaps the problem is not with the word, but a mis-understanding of how professional historians use words from the past. If your so upset with this particular "slur", I could name a dozen other slurs that are equally offensive: Renaissance. Middle Ages. Dark Ages. Ancient Regime.

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a>'s position -- in the context of Greek and Roman history, the term <i>Barbarian</i> serves a useful purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>If pejorative connotations exist, they reflect the attitude of many civilised societies, not merely those of Greece or Rome, to consider outsiders with a different cultur and language as inferior by default. E.g. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese authors routinely used comparable terms in describing foreigners.</p>
<p>Why hide the existance of such prejudices by bowdlerizing sources and debattes with politically correct euphemisms? The study of history should be enlightening - trying to be inoffensive does not help.</p>

<p>Let me make certain I understand the debate correctly. Just to take an example, Stbalbach would defend use of the term "barbarian" in the sentence "[The Romans] gradually outsourced their duties to defend the Empire to barbarian mercenaries who eventually turned on them" and WWW would oppose it, substituting "German." Stbalbach would counter that "German" is an anachronism (and let me add that not all of those bar... er soldiers would be considered Germans, even by modern standards). WWW is not averse to the use of the term "barbarian" as part of a quote or to express the point-of-view of the Romans, but does not believe that this should be the standard term used to refer to the peoples in question. Is this correct?</p>
<p>If it is, I think WWW should propose alternative language that he thinks would be more accurate and neutral. I also think it would be useful to see if there has been any criticism in academia of the use of this word by modern academics in describing these peoples. We should remember we are writing for a general, not an academic, audience, so <a href="../../../i/f/f/Iff.html" title="Iff">iff</a> we can find a replacement for barbarian that is less confusing to non-historians and that can be used without introducing imprecision to the article or requiring lengthy parenthetical explanation, we should consider using this term. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 23:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In most instances, the source material itself cites the more accurate tribe and name of the group. (Vegetius and Tacitus being prime examples.) Wikipedia articles are not to be written in the technical jargon of academia, this is a layman's resource. An example of the sloppy editing in question directly from the article:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>the theory also ignores the fact that barbarian horsemen served in enormous numbers as foederati in the Roman military</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Which barbarians? What is the source for this statement? Surely the source states whether these were Visigoths, Vandals or Alans? If it doesn't, why not provide a direct quote? A simple work around, yet totally objectionable to some. This topic has been touched upon by the media <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-2168328,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-2168328,00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> in <i>Decline and fall of the Roman myth</i> and elsewhere.

<dd>"At all times the Greeks regarded all Blacks as <i>barbaroi</i>. Greeks called all Non-Greeks – regardless whether their skin color was White or Black or whatever – <i>barbaroi</i> – people speaking a foreign language. The Greeks regarded the <i>barbaroi</i> as being different and this led to sweeping prejudicial statements at the worst, to differentiated opinions about them at the best. The <i>barbaros</i>, as cultural “anti-model”, which suggests despotism, submissiveness, excessive luxury, wildness or rudeness has its roots in the refusal of “the Persian <i>barbaros</i>” who had invaded Greece in order to rob the Greeks’ of their freedom. This meaning culminates in the anti-Barbarian racism of Aristotle (Politics 1252b5-9): <i>barbaroi</i> are slaves by nature. But on the other side an interest in and an appreciation for the variety of people and the cultural creations of <i>barbaroi</i> arose. Here the term <i>barbaroi</i> often is used as objective, descriptive expression for people who belonged to another nation or who lived outside Greece, respectively outside these areas where inhabited by Greeks"<a href="http://www.cafyd.com/HistDeporte/htm/pdf/3-8.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cafyd.com/HistDeporte/htm/pdf/3-8.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

<dd>I agree, specific names should be used when available. There were a lot of tribes, and a lot of tribes with no names we know existed. We refer to them as a group as Barbarian like with the term "Indian". Also, if we name specific tribes, we by default exclude others, which has to be done carefully. You referenced Peter Wells. Amazon Look Inside shows he uses the term Barbarian 72 times, or on roughly %20 of the books pages - Peter is not lazy, it just doesn't make sense to keep repeating the same list of "tribes" over and over with an "etc.." catch-all. For one, it costs less money to print. That's not lazy, just common fiscal sense - and it spares the reader from banal prose. Authors on Wikipedia often do the same thing, for the same reason we say "Indian" instead of listing every tribe in America. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 06:45, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's alright, it's a mistake a lot of people seem to be making in this discussion. The argument is that the term is too general, carries negative connotations due to the very origins of the word and, really, it doesn't do anyone a service to just lump a bunch of groups together under a single slur when you could be specific and precise about it. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloodofox_6b7d.html" title="User:Bloodofox">:bloodofox:</a> 18:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hmm ... I agree that the anachronistic (and often incorrect) use of German/Germanic should be avoided, but I don't know that "barbarian" is always the answer. Often, "barbarian" avoids historical specificity. For example, are we talking about Huns, Goths, Lombards, Visigoths, etc. My personal preference would be for the most precise and accuarate term possible, which is my main objection to "barbarian." I find it to be <b>occassionally</b> helpful, when placed in proper historical context; but would usually avoid it, prefering to name the "outsiders" in question. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 23:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi. I'm responding to the RFC for this page. Although "barbarian" was often used as a term by Romans for non-Romans, it is not a neutral term. Even though the Romans often used the term, it was a biased term then and it's a biased term now. It would be like writing an article about Racism in the American South and using the word "nigger" instead of "black" because it was the term used at the time. A pejorative term is a pejorative term no matter which way you slice it; and as such, it doesn't belong as the primary term for a group or set of groups. Certainly it should be made known that Romans called them "Barbarians", but "Barbarians" shouldn't be used as the default word. <a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><font style="color:blue"><b>.V.</b></font></a> -- <i>(<a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V."><sup>Talk</sup></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V."><sub>Email</sub></a>)</i> 09:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one suggested it be a default. The word has multiple meanings and only makes sense in the context of its usage.

<dd>The problem is that none of these 'contexts' are neutral due to the definition and history of the word. Not to mention popular usage. <i>Barbarous</i>, anyone? <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloodofox_6b7d.html" title="User:Bloodofox">:bloodofox:</a> 16:35, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We keep going round in circles - yes, the definition is not historically neutral, that is clear and understood, <i>you are right</i>. However, what you have not recognized is the art and craft of the history profession and its usage of historical terms, even pejorative ones, in scholarly articles - Middle Ages, Barbarian, Renaissance, Ancient Regime - are all pejorative terms which are widely used in a neutral manner by historians - they describe things in a historical context, they don't reflect the users opinions about them. They are <i>neutral descriptors</i> and not the historians personal value judgment. This is done to avoid anachronisms and it increases the historical understanding and perspectives of the period by using historically accurate terms. It appears, to me, the only reason you have a problem with Barbarian (and not Middle Ages which BTW is equally if not even more offensive to the Germanic peoples and others), is because of barbarian has a "popular" meaning - which, in the context of a scholarly article, is further discussed at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html#Modern_academia" title="Barbarian">Barbarian#Modern academia</a> and so is not an issue. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 17:51, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

So when the Romans themselves used descriptors other than <i>barbarian</i> to describe which tribes made the best horsemen (Vegetius) and to describe particular groups like Gauls, Raetians, Pannonians, Sarmatians and Dacians (Tacitus) they were writing anachronistically?

<dd>In that case, use the names available. No one is suggesting Barbarian must be used everywhere - rather, that it is acceptable within some contexts.

Wasn't this area supposed to be for outside comments? You guys sort of took it over. I think all three of you need to show some control. There's no need to leap to conclusions, or assume bad faith, or anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Now, the fact is that the term 'barbarian' is used in academic parlance to refer to the same groups that the Greeks and Romans used it to refer to (it is a mistake to think that the Greeks or Romans used the term as a slur. It's more about a collective and willful ignorance to make distinctions between tribes than a judgment of character. It was an insult to call a citizen a barbarian basically because you're calling them a NON citizen and/or someone who can't speak the language correctly, neither of which were good things in that culture). Since academic circles use this term, we should too. There is no Wiki policy that claims we should lower standards of language in order to cowtow to people who just don't know any better. If someone sees 'barbarian' in an article on ancient Rome and gets confused, they will click its wikilink, go to its own article page, and learn something (and, I might add, something very valuable regarding how ideas of cultural and linguistic superiority permeate our tradition and affect our culture today). Now, if the source gives the tribes, you name the tribes in the FIRST mention of the source and then you say 'barbarians' (meaning, of course, the non-Romans) in the second mention for brevity and clarity. 'Barbarian' is not a POV term. It's not even an NPOV term. There IS no VIEW here. Barbarian within the academic context of ancient history refers to those who either were not Greek or were not Roman (the Greeks, by the way, called the Romans barbarians). The modern connotation of the word does not apply here. Academic language and academic consensus is the way to go here. After all, Wiki wants to be an encyclopedia (and beyond that, an encyclopedia that can actually be used in research). So, in general, we should <b>use specifics where we have them, but otherwise always defer to academic terminology.</b> <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 21:05, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree to this usage as stated. I don't agree the term should be in quotes, unless the term is used in an article that is out of its normal academic context, where there may be confusion. The notion that historians, or Wikipedians, are using the term in a POV manner has no basis in reality, such a POV does not exist in academia (except in some fringe political groups or individuals personal opinions). Barbarian would also profit by being linked to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html#Modern_academia" title="Barbarian">Barbarian#Modern academia</a>, and that the focus should be on improving that section to a common consensus about its usage in modern academia. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 15:14, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would encourage the use of the term "barbarian" <i>only</i> where it <i>appears</i> in quotes from sources. There, of course, it is not only appropriate but necessary--you do not modify quotations without clearly indicating that you have done so, and in this case, there is no reason to, as this term is considered an appropriate one in modern scholastic usage... when discussing a certain period, <i>from</i> a certain point of view. Other than in this situation, I feel it would be better to substitute another term--the proper name of the tribe/nation, where available. If not, the region being referred to; if the reference is to "any foreigner" (e.g. "the Roman army contained large numbers of barbarians"--I made that up; don't look for it in the article), then simply say "foreign soldiers," "non-Romans," "non-Latins," etc. I would discourage using the term "barbarian" in such instances--in quotation marks or otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In particular, I would see any appearance of the word "barbarian" occur in such a context that it is clear that it is reflecting the views of the civilization under discussion. I agree with Stbalbach that a link to the modern academic usage of this word would help--so that it can be clearly stated just <i>what</i> the modern academic usage is (and if is considered controversial in that context, and if so, why)--unless we'd rather just add this to the main Barbarian page, rather than as a separate link. (This would probably depend on the length of the "academic usage" discussion.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Stbalbach frequently compares the use of "barbarian" with that of "Indian"--without observing that "Indian" is itself regarded as pejorative by many Native Americans. (Nor did I see anyone else noting this; don't know if I missed it.) What is the Wiki policy on the use of "Indian" vs. "Native American"? Any decision on "barbarian" should probably be similar--and certainly should take the policy about the use of "Indian" into account. (This may require a review of <i>that</i> policy as well.) (I would add that I personally find the use of the term "Indian" ambiguous and confusing; wherever I see it, I always think first of the Subcontinent. That's a separate discussion, though.) -- Vyasa Ozsvar 23:05, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The term 'non-Romans' is not academic by any stretch of the imagination and should not be used in an encyclopedia that is aiming to be a research guide for those writing papers or such. If you wrote a paper with 'non-Romans' in a research paper, you'd get red-inked...because there is a much better use in the term 'barbarian', which has an academic tradition behind it. Not only that, but everyone is making the false comparison to the 'indian-native american' paradigm. The analog her with 'barbarian' is 'native american' (since it is a term that is used to describe a vast variety of a regional people who belong to many different tribes). What it being suggested by some here is actually the replacing of 'indian' OR 'native american' in articles with either a list of tribes, or by the term 'non-colonialists'.</dd>

If you wish, you can go to your local library and search the L'Annee Philologique which will not only give articles grouped into the category of 'barbarians', but will contain plenty of articles referring to these tribes as such. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 23:17, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We are starting to go in circles here. To keep this conversation from starting to go over ground that has already been covered, I would suggest that we close this RfC. I have posted the above recommendation (which seemed to be accepted by general consensus) on the Barbarian talk page. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 23:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an outsider who participated in none of the discussion, but has just now reviewed the whole lot, and noticed the relatively long passage of time since Pastordavid's suggestion for closing, I have moved the entry from the RFC page to the RFC/user conduct/archive page (apologies for lack of wiki formatting) <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetershank_bb1a.html" title="User:Petershank">Petershank</a> 21:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
