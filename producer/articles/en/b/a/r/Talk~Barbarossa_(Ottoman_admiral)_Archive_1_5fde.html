<p>"But the names, begining from their father Yacub (English Jacob), Ishak (English Isaac), Illias (English Eliajah), Aruj ( English Aaron), Khidr (from Hebrew word Kheider which has a meaning Hebrew religious school) makes them forcefully converted to Islam Jews. To this conclusion we can arrive based on the following evidence: (a) they became privateers only after members of their family of tradesman was robbed, put in slavery, killed by Christian "Knights of Rhodes" as a some sort of a revanche; (b) so called Barbarian coast insluded modern Greece, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon with very large presence of Jewish tradesman and sailors; (c) Their nickname Barbarossa has a translation "barba" (red) + "rossa" (bird) because as high rank Jews in the Bible they got red hair birds which they, usually, colored with henna from India. Their heir on the head was light brown and the noses were distinct to a classic type of a Jew. Neither ordinary Turkes, nor Arabs or Greecs didn't have normally such look; (d) as we well know today, Islam always practised cultural genocide and everything what was good and admirable in converted to Islam people they tried to falsify as their own achievement. The same practice was very common in medieval Europe. Nobody ever bothered to analyze contradictions of their mythology because of Anti-Semitism shared by both religions."</p>
<p>This text is full of grammatical and semantic errors. And additionally, there is no reference to be associated with it. All the names of Barbarossa brothers were Islamic names. Of course, they have affinity with Hebrew names since both religions are semitic and have similar names and content to some extent. Moreover translation of "barbarossa" is wrong, barba means "beard" and rosso(a) means "red" in Italian. Furthermore, color of the beard or shape of the nose cannot determine one's ethnicity. I've got lots of Jewish acquaintances with different hair colors and various types of nose.</p>
<p>So, I invite the writer of this text to a discussion here. Otherwise, by a couple of days from now, I will have deleted this content.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I deleted the the text in question and wanted to make a note of the change here. The whole passage, apparently driven solely by the author's distress over what he sees as the "culturally genocidal" aspect of conversion, reads very unacademic, to put it mildly. If there is a credible hypothesis that Barbarossa is of Jewish origin, it may be noted in passing, as in: '... while others make him a Janissary from Vardar, near Thessaloniki, possibly of Sephardic Jewish origin.'</p>

There is even no proof that his father was of <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devshirmeh.html" title="Devshirmeh">devshirmeh</a> background, let alone Jew. And we shouldn't forget that Sephardic Jews were majorly settled in the area after 1492.</dd>

<p>The most common name in English for this man is "Barbarossa". Although ife we wanted to be correct about things, the page should be at "Barbaros Hayreddin Paşa" or "Barbarossa (Hayreddin Pasha)". The thing is, we must remind ourselves that the policy is about frequency, not accuracy. I know how you feel, E104421. I would like to move <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> to it's proper Turkish spelling, <b>İ</b>stanbul. However, the policy goes against me, in the same way it goes against you here. Just how the correct name for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> is <i>Cristoforo Colombo</i>, the former is his common name in English, and that's why we have the page there. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></span> 09:46, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, then, should we choose the version of Britannica? I still do not understand why we do not write the correct version in paranthesis. Since this is not the case of spelling as in Istanbul. Writing the common version first, then the correct version in paranthesis in order to prevent disambiguation. (Note for the google search, if you search: barbarossa ottoman admiral, you'll get more but if you search: "barbarossa ottoman admiral" in quatation marks you'll get less results. That's what i mean.) <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 10:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC) 10:21, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The simple answer I can give you is because it's against Wikipedia policy, namely <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>. It's like moving <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Calvin_f3ea.html" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a> to John Calvin (Jean Calvin), the latter of which is his correct name. You are more than welcome, however, to add the correct spelling of Barbarossa's name in the <i>intro</i>, but the title should reflect what someone or something is most commonly known as in English.</dd>
<dd>As for the Google search, the only reason why I'm having "ottoman admiral" next his name in the title, is because <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarossa.html" title="Barbarossa">Barbarossa</a> is already a disambig. page, so the title is to distinguish him from <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_b965.html" title="Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor">Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/u/Aruj.html" title="Aruj">Aruj</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarossa_%28board_game%29.html" title="Barbarossa (board game)">Barbarossa (board game)</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarossa_%28album%29.html" title="Barbarossa (album)">Barbarossa (album)</a>.

<dd>Correcting my version above cause of edit conflict: Ok, then, should we choose the version of Britannica? I still do not understand why we do not write the correct version (actually, this is his name Hayreddin) in paranthesis. Since this is not the case of spelling as in Istanbul cause his actual name is missing in the case of Barbarossa (Ottoman Admiral). Labeling with the nickname is not a good way, causes misleading. Writing the common one (nickname) first, then the correct version (real name) in paranthesis is better (also prevents disambiguation). {P/s: Note for the google search, if you search: barbarossa ottoman admiral, you'll get more but if you search: "barbarossa ottoman admiral" in quatation marks you'll get less results.

<dd>By writing the name as Barbarossa (Hayreddin Pasha) {first nickname, then real name} or better Hayreddin Pasha (Barbarossa) {first real name, then nickname} prevents all the disambiguation. I checked the wikipolicy page <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>, there is no reason for us to remove his real name. Even the current version is better than naming it as Barbarossa (Ottoman General) cause the current version labels him with his real name not with the nickname. Furthermore, if you google by writing his name as <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbaros_Hayreddin_Pasha_b751.html" title="Barbaros Hayreddin Pasha">Barbaros Hayreddin Pasha</a> here [<a href="http://www.google.com.tr/search?hl=tr&amp;q=barbaros+hayreddin+pasha&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.tr/search?hl=tr&amp;q=barbaros+hayreddin+pasha&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], you'll get 588 results the highest score and this satisfies the common labeling condition. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 10:47, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I fail to see why it would make such a difference to have his full name up there.. I mean, the article would have more coverage if it was only <i>barbarossa</i>.. His full name will always be mentioned directly in the beginning of the intro.. <i>In any case</i>, <b>barbaros</b> is <b>out</b> and will never be used, no matter what.. His name in English is <b>Barbarossa</b>, very good analogy being Christopher Colombus.. We should remember that this is English Wikipedia, this is the same exact logic that stops Turkey article being titled Turkiye.. Even for humans, the common sense and logical rule is that his most commonly known name should be used.. I have never heard anyone anywhere outside Turkey refer to him as <i>barbaros hayreddin pasa</i>..

<dd>Yes, but see also <b>the nicknames policy</b>. <i>Barbarossa is not his common name, it's his nickname</i>. <b>Nicknames can only be redirect, not the title of the article.</b> For example, King Billy can be a redirect, but not the article name for William III of England: there's no reason to use the short name or nickname. For this reason, the best choice is Hayreddin Pasha (Barbarossa). Cheers! <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 23:15, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Barbarossa was the "name" by which he was commonly known, then and now. Maybe we should recall that <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genghis_Khan_804b.html" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>'s name in fact was Temujin and redirect everything about him to "Temujin"? I don't believe rigidity in applying some "rule" is needed here, but the kind of common sense that makes it easy for an English-language user to find what he/she is looking for. <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosal_6b18.html" title="User:Cosal">Cosal</a> 23:32, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Barbarossa is his "<b>nickname</b>". For this reason, Hayreddin Pasha (Barbarossa) is better. In this way, we not only label the article with his name "Hayreddin Pasha" but also mention the nickname (Barbarossa). For the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genghis_Khan_804b.html" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> case, "Temujin" is not a nickname. It's one of his names. Another example from wikipedia is "Yavuz" Sultan <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selim_I_67da.html" title="Selim I">Selim I</a>. Selim is his real name (used as the title). Maybe cause of the language barrier the "redirect" is misunderstood. The title cannot be a nickname, see wikipolicy here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28people%29#Nick_names.2C_pen_names.2C_stage_names.2C_cognomens" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28people%29#Nick_names.2C_pen_names.2C_stage_names.2C_cognomens" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 23:57, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Answer is simple. Nickname is the name given by others to a person (maybe different from place to place as in our case) but pen name is the name chosen by the person himself/herself (it's unique). This is also quite clear here[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28people%29#Nick_names.2C_pen_names.2C_stage_names.2C_cognomens" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28people%29#Nick_names.2C_pen_names.2C_stage_names.2C_cognomens" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>].</dd>

<dd>No, Sinan is his real name, Koca is the nickname, Mimar is his title, Agha is a kind of title (like Mr). To prevent disambiguity, it might be labeled as Mimar Sinan (in english Sinan, the Architect). If we adapt this case to ours, we should write only Hayreddin Pasha (Hayreddin is his real name, Pasha is his title), but i'm proposing here to write also the english nickname in parathesis as Hayreddin Pasha (Barbarossa) in order to prevent the disambiguity. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 01:11, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And no, dear E104421, "Temujin" was not a nicknsame, but his real name, and he only later became known as Genghis Khan. As to the person being discussed here, "Barbarossa" was hardly a "nickname, but instead a honorific by which he became known (and certainly much better known than by his birth name Hizir. Remember, too, that even Khair ad Din was not his name, but a honorific bestowed upon him by Sultan Suleiman. <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosal_6b18.html" title="User:Cosal">Cosal</a> 01:20, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, be careful. Read my comments above. Temujin is one his real names as i said before. In our case, Barbarossa is obviously a "nickname" meaning "redbeard".

<li><b>Support</b> per Khoikhoi. Even in Turkish we call him "Barbaros Hayreddin Pasha".

</ul>
<p>1) Barbarossa is nickname and doesn't meet the exact title. Because there are historical personalities called as Barbarossa other than Hayreddin Pasha. Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor is also called as Barbarossa.(Frederick I (German: Friedrich) (1122 – June 10, 1190), called Barbarossa (meaning Redbeard), was elected king of Germany on March 4, 1152 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor on June 18, 1155.)<br />
2) When we search with "Barbarossa" keyword in Wikipedia, we take "disambiguation" alert. However if we change topic as Hayreddin Pasha (Barbarossa) this provide more healthy search results.<br />
3) In Ancient Greece, Greks called non-Greks as Barbarossa. So, Barbarossa doesn't remind only historical characters. This increases the disambiguation.--Karcha 17:08, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It will be pretty much guaranteed that no user interested in this historically significant person, unless they are Turkish speakers or fairly sophisticated Ottoman history buffs, will find what he/she is looking for unless Wiki lists him under his most widely known name -- Barbarossa, with whatever addition after that in parentheses.
