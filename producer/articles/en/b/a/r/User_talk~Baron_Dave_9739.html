<p>I remember you from the late 1980s when you were a user on my BBS, Second City. I was going by the alias "Shadow Warrior" back then, but now I use "Elkman" all over the place.

<p>Wasn't I co-Sysop for a while? Last I heard you were in Texas, or somesuch. Laurel mentioned contacting you recently, but I wasn't sure of the situation. Anyway, I have lots of questions. I'm good with html, but Wiki formatting is sufficiently different as to be annoying. I'm building the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_Radio_Theater_d166.html" title="Shockwave Radio Theater">Shockwave Radio Theater</a> page (no one else wanted to start it and I know the most) and wonder what the limitations will be...</p>

<dd>Yes, you were a co-sysop for a while. You were one of the people I could trust to keep the kids in line, after all. I lived in Texas from January 1990 through about August of 1994, but I didn't really like Texas. (Too many rich people flaunting their wealth, and all my friends and family were back up in Minnesota.) I've seen Laurel and SPK floating around LiveJournal a bit (mine is at <a href="http://elkman.livejournal.com" class="external free" title="http://elkman.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">http://elkman.livejournal.com</a>), but I have to admit I haven't really kept up with them that much. On the other hand, I see Sy Borg and his wife pretty regularly. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 21:22, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know you were talking about your father, but some of what you added to the article was either just POV or unsourced.

<p>I tried to find journalism awards given in NY in the 60s, but couldn't immediately locate a source. I don't recall which award (hey, I was a kid) but I remember that he had won something like 8 out of the 17 times he was eligible for Best Editorial in the state. I didn't even try to find the Woodstock references; I suppose I'd have to search the various books and such he's in. I'd love to find the editorials he wrote basically encouraging the festival; locals were largely against it and the final location was the third they tried. After my father's death in 1999, there was talk at the paper of collecting his editorials (he wrote virtually all of them from the paper's founding in 1956 to sometime in the mid 70s), but I'm not sure what came of that project.</p>
<p>Is "immemorable" a word? My spell check doesn't recognize it. Certainly at the time Thompson wasn't a big deal, just another jerk. Thompson himself confirmed being fired by my father, though that was in a private conversation. Let me see about other changes... <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaron_Dave_3cea.html" title="User:Baron Dave">David E Romm</a> 12:35, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to let you know, it took a few weeks but I finally properly formatted them this afternoon. Have a look. It's one of several footnoting formats we use, and while I think it makes the articles a little bit more confusing for novice editors I have been won over to it in the year or so since we started using it. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 18:59, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Thompson confirmed that your father fired him personally in a private conversation, that's <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, inherently unverifiable and you can't have it in the article (However, if you report this conversation to someone or write an account published somewhere reliable, we <i>can</i> use it (we just can't be the reporter of first instance).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When Thompson died, you'd have thought it was quite a big deal ... they talked to every old-timer at the paper they could and put a story together (I think Barbara Bedell remembered him surprisingly well). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 19:13, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That my father fired Thompson (as opposed to nobody, in the original) is documented. See the reference I added. The part that's a personal memory from my father and later confirmed by Thompson in a conversation with my brother is that many years later, neither were sorry about it. I grew up around all these people (including Doty and Bedell) and never heard the Record/Thompson connection until years later, when my brother confirmed with Thompson that my father was the first person to fire him. When Thompson hit it big, I'm sure the stories came out. When he died, I'm sure the stories got enhanced a bit. I don't know how long he worked for the Record, but I gather it was weeks, not months.</p>
<p>For more information on my father's contribution to the paper and to the community, see Doty and Bedell's obituaries of AN Romm archived on my site, linked in the article. Most of his contributions are in the form of getting public support of worthwhile projects. My mother always calls the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge "Daddy's Bridge". Apparently, the main proposal was for a single bridge with one lane in either direction, and my father editorialized enough that they eventually built a much better separate-direction bridge with two lanes either way. Similarly, the Middletown Arts Council, and even OCCC. Without seeing the editorials (still not online) I have no cite, but The Record was the largest paper between NYC and Albany and exerted considerable influence, and much of that was due to my father. He should get credit.</p>
<p>I'm more than a little annoyed that I haven 't been able to find the listing for <i>any</i> New York journalism awards before they went online just a few years ago. Suggestions are welcome.</p>
