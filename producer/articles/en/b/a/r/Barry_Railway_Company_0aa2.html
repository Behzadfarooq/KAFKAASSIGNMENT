<p>Starting in 1885, the company constructed 7 miles (11km) of track from <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and the construction of railways of about 26 miles (41.6km) in length from the docks to the <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhondda_Valley_1ae3.html" title="Rhondda Valley">Rhondda Valley</a>. Additionally, access was created to junctions with the existing and authorised railways to all the other great mineral-producing districts of South Wales. Eventually the Company’s route mileage was 66 miles, but with 140 miles of sidings: 100 miles of them were around the docks. The head office of the railway was at Barry. Apart from owning the docks themselves - which consisted of three docks entered by locks - the four main portions of the rail network were:</p>
<ul>
<li>the main line from Barry to <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trehafod.html" title="Trehafod">Trehafod</a></li>
<li>a branch from <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadoxton%2C_Vale_of_Glamorgan_f5aa.html" title="Cadoxton, Vale of Glamorgan">Cadoxton</a> giving access to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> via the <a href="../../../t/a/f/Taff_Vale_Railway_2221.html" title="Taff Vale Railway">Taff Vale Railway</a></li>

<li>the Barry Island branch</li>
<li>the line via <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberthaw.html" title="Aberthaw">Aberthaw</a> to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend.html" title="Bridgend">Bridgend</a>, linking with the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a>. This was the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_of_Glamorgan_Railway_ea5c.html" title="Vale of Glamorgan Railway">Vale of Glamorgan Railway</a>, promoted by the Barry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Vale of Glamorgan Railway was worked and managed by the Barry Railway but remained independent until grouping in 1922. At first, passenger services on the Barry were only run on the Cogan branch, but soon further services were run, including those for passengers using the steamers in the docks. There were 150 coaching vehicles owned in 1912; and 138 locomotives. Llandow Halt was opened on 1st May 1915, St. Athan Halt on 1st September 1939 and Llandow (Wick Road) Halt on 19th April 1943.</p>

<p>In 1905 they started to build their own fleet of four ships, but as a railway company, parliamentary powers were required to operate steamships and the powers granted generally included provisions which limited operations to routes genuinely associated with the mother company's principal business (ie railway connections to non-accessible locations). The powers were also granted to take account of the legitimate interests of existing operators.</p>
<p>The Company were limited to calls on the southern bank of the Channel between Weston and Ilfracombe, with additional summer excursion destinations allowed so long as the cruises started and finished at Barry. To circumvent these restrictions, the company resorted to the ploy of registering their vessels in the names of its directors and set up an operating company, the Barry and Bristol Channel Steamship Company. <a href="../../../p/_/a/P_and_A_Campbell_eb6e.html" title="P and A Campbell">P and A Campbell</a> resorted to successful legal action which ensured that by July 1907, the Barry Railway Company was required to abide by the terms of the original legislation.</p>
<p>Services were maintained despite deteriorating financial fortunes, but as a cost saving measure, PS Gwalia was sold to the Furness Railway Company on May 7th 1910. Five days later the remaining three steamers were sold to Bristol Channel Passenger Boats Ltd. The latter company struggled to make the business pay and after two seasons, sold out to <a href="../../../p/_/a/P_and_A_Campbell_eb6e.html" title="P and A Campbell">P and A Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>The Barry Railway became a constituent part of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> in 1923, post the railway grouping <a href="http://www.railfuture.org.uk/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=39" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.railfuture.org.uk/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=39" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Local traffic on the line included that from the limestone quarries and the cement works Aberthaw, and Rhoose cement works at the eastern end of the line. <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Wartime</a> traffic was created from from Tremains and Brackla Hill at Bridgend and the RAF base at St. Athan. More recent developments were the opening of Aberthaw power station in February <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> and the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford.html" title="Ford">Ford</a> engine plant at Bridgend in January <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>.</p>
<p>The Barry-Bridgend passenger service finished on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">13 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, but the line continued to be used by through passenger trains between Cardiff and Bridgend when the main line via <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontyclun.html" title="Pontyclun">Pontyclun</a> was closed. This still frequently happens at night and on Sundays and train operators ran empty coaching stock and empty mail trains via this route to retain train crew route knowledge.</p>
<p>By the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>'s, a daily train runs between Ford’s plants at <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagenham.html" title="Dagenham">Dagenham</a> and Bridgend and merry-go-round coal trains run between Onllwyn and Cwmgwrach (to the west), <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_Colliery_7f0e.html" title="Tower Colliery">Tower Colliery</a>, Newport Docks and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avonmouth.html" title="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a> (to the east), to Aberthaw power station averaging some 10 trains a day. Rhoose cement works has closed, and a connection is retained to Aberthaw cement works where wagons are stored</p>

<p>A pressure group called <i>Railfuture</i> produced a booklet “Rails to the Vale” in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> in which it was stated: <i>that the Railway Development Society believes that a new daily passenger service through the vale could cover its costs – and even generate profits given time</i></p>
<p>With traffic increasing to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff_International_Airport_c8bd.html" title="Cardiff International Airport">Cardiff airport</a>, the Local Government transport consortium SWIFT also identified the potential for reopening the Vale of Glamorgan line. The scheme was promoted by the Vale of Glamorgan and Bridgend Borough Councils to the Welsh Assembly Government in August <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. After agreeing funding, track upgrading and signalling works commenced in June 2004 with: 3.5miles of new track laid; 6.5miles of track upgraded; 15000 tonnes of ballast used; three new section signals (2 on the up and 1 on the down) were installed together with three distant signals and one repeater signal required by the curved approach to Llantwit Major Station. Final planning permission for the new stations and interchanges at Rhoose, Cardiff International Airport and Llantwit Major was granted in 2004 and from October 2004 the line was closed daily between Bridgend and Abethaw or Barry for the station construction, with goods traffic passing at night. At Bridgend, the Barry bay was relaid and a new platform face built. <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Rail_3734.html" title="Network Rail">Network Rail</a> used three contractors: <a href="../../../m/o/w/Mowlem.html" title="Mowlem">Mowlem</a> for the permanent way; <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carillion.html" title="Carillion">Carillion</a> for signals and telephones; and Galliford Try for civil engineering, including the platforms. The Vale of Glamorgan Council was responsible for the construction of the interchanges at Rhoose, Cardiff International Airport and Llantwit Major. Network Rail spent £15m and the Vale of Glamorgan Council £2m making a grand total of £17m for the whole project. The daytime closures were shortened from April to enable crew training to commence.</p>
<p>The line officially reopened to fare paying passengers on Sunday <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">12 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> with <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_143_3180.html" title="British Rail Class 143">143606/624</a> working 0840 Cardiff-Bridgend and 0945 return</p>
