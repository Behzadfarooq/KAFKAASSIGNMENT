<p>Dear Barnetj, would you please help in editing <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_Lolita_in_Tehran_631c.html" title="Reading Lolita in Tehran">this article</a>? Azar Nafisi who is the writer of the book is now associated with US neoconservatives unfortunately. <a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">User:CltFn</a> who is busy writing anti-Islamic pages, insists on advertizing Nafisi and ruining the face of Iranians by adding nonsense to the article.

<dd>I would really like to help but unfortunately i have very little information on Azar Nafisi and the subject of the article, therefore i don't feel confident editing or getting involved in the article. not unless i find some time to investigate the matter.

<dd>I'm sorry, I don't really know what I'm supposed to do about Patchouli. Much of what has to be done you can do: refer articles for deletion (I can show you how to do this if you need help) and revert his bad edits (you can find the old state of articles by examining history). I am an administrator, but I don't do much by way of blocks and bans. Since Patchouli has a named account and has been around for a while, some sort of due process through arbitration is allowed, I think. I posted something on the administor's noticeboard about it, but have not gotten any responses yet. I haven't had much time for Wikipedia, lately. Since you know more about this conflict that me, you'd be better at this all than me. Here are some useful links: <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> to delete his pages, <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">WP:RFM</a> for mediation and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> for arbitration. I'm sorry that I can't do more. But the thing that you <i>shouldn't</i> do is randomly contact adminstrators about this (I have been contacted this way, and it is really annoying and ineffective). Could you try to work through those channels? If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, but I can't do everything. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 20:44, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS, by the way, Patrick987 has not filed any sort of "official" complaint to me, because that doesn't exist. An "official complaint" is doing something through AfD, RfM, etc. Almost everything done against vandals can be done by anyone, short of the raw enforcement power that must be justified by a broad concensus. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 20:46, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please look at <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Iran" class="external text" title="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Iran" rel="nofollow"><b>Iran</b></a> on Uncyclopedia. The article was just a piece of "Fahhashi" on Iran. I tried to change it. If you compare the version before my edits with pages of other countries like Germany and France ... you will see that Iran's page is written in a very bad way. It is not humerous. It's just a place to insult. Please help. Unfortunately very few Iranians are active on wikipedia. Pages on Iran have been written by those who hate Iran. Please help if you have time.

<p>Have you taken your issue with Patchouli to ArbCom? If you are going to please inform me. He has unilaterally added POV to numerous article, and then re added them once someone removes them. An example of this is with the neologism "Mullahcracy". His POV pushing is highly deconstruction to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 17:12, 14 February 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</p>

Do you think we should move the ANI to an RFC? I think that we need an admin to do something, but perhaps they consider the RFC a more appropriate venue. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 17:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, this ANI is currently a good place to gather the diffs that will be necessary to demonstrate the problem at any ArbCom, so if we do go to ArbCom, we will have quite a bit to work with for starts. But I am still concerned about that jkelly thing about RFC; I'm afraid we may not get anymore admin responses for the ANI. However, I think ArbCom may be a good direction since Patchouli is clearly unwilling to neutralize his contributions, so some sort of lasting intervention is called for. I'm going to start reading up on the ArbCom process. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 17:18, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, I'll list you in our party when I begin the process. It seems we need a section showing our efforts to resolve this dispute. I think will probably link this to the talk page sections where we specifically tried to negotiate with Patchouli, so I'll definitely include the links you put on the ANI page. I'll look around for other pages. The main obstacle in this process is not lack of evidence but an overwhelming amount. If you see anything else I should note, put it in the ANI or on my talk page.

<p>Hello, I'ld like to explain why I'm removing your text on the Persians' garb in <i>300</i>. There are undoubtedly <i>many</i> historical inaccuracies in the film, so to prevent this section from turning into a laundry list, we've been maintaining a policy of limiting it to assessments of the film by professional historians (along with the statement of the filmmaker). I have no doubt that your suggestions are true; the problem is that any number of other equally true observations could be made, and the article would end up being 100 kb long. If some professional historian has made this point in a published source, then that would be a different case, and of course I'ld support including it. If you feel this is an unfair criterion, please feel free to take it up on the talk page. Best, --<a href="../../../j/a/v/User%7EJavits2000_0fa8.html" title="User:Javits2000">Javits2000</a> 12:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, I myself would probably consider it "OR" in that context as well, but of course I'm just one editor, and there are a number of us who have been working fairly steadily on this article. If you think it's important I'ld suggest floating the idea on the talk page first to see what other people think.
