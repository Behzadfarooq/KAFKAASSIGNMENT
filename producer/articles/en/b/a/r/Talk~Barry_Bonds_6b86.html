<p>i removed the POV portion:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It has been suggested by some observers that Bonds' disdain for his fans, in conjunction with his behavior off the field, has negatively impacted his professional reputation (and, by extension, baseball's). This thesis is arguable, but the fact remains that much less was made of his record-breaking home-run streak than was made of McGwire's, and the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> -- in which he was the star -- garnered the worst ratings of any World Series in the history of television."</li>

<p>It is a phenomenon that should be discussed though. People are happy about Ruth, and to a somewhat lesser extent, McGwire, but generally seem to be much less happy about Bonds. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 11:26, Oct 27, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not a racial issue at all. Compare the love people have for Kirby Puckett to the disdain they show for Barry Bonds. This is an issue of one being a great, positive person, vesus the other being a self-centered, lying boor.</p>
<p>Good agent he had. He was a good ballplayer and an outwardly garrulous guy. Great and positive are both a stretch. Or does the smoke and fire supposition only apply to "lying boors"?--Buckboard 21:02, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Stretches or not, they are both the same race, and the point is the public in general embraced and loved Kirby and can't stand Barry. If you actually believe Barry isn't both a liar and a boor then you're hiding your head in the sand.</p>
<p>But you have to look at the steroid issue as a major contributor to why people are less happy about <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bonds_ea55.html" title="Barry Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>. Although steroids have not been proven to be used by Bonds, there are allegations and these allegations tarnish his baseball reputation. As for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_McGwire_face.html" title="Mark McGwire">Mark McGwire</a>, he is also under scrutiny for the use of steroids and after the March 17th Congressional hearing in which he decided to "not talk about the past" people have also thought less of him. These are the major reasons on why people are less happy with Bonds and McGwire rather than <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>.J8J3B</p>
<p>Go back and read old Rick Reilly columns in Sports Illustrated pre-dating the steroid mess. He's been in the "people have also thought less of him" category--vehemently so--going back to his Pirates days.--Buckboard 21:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason that the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> got the worst ratings is probably due to the fact it was a battle between Anaheim and San Francisco, two California cities.Kwikstah</p>
<p>From an independent baseball fans point of view, I thought he was great with the Pirates, but after he became such a late bloomer with serious home run power right after McGwire/Sosa, with a huge increase in helmet size and body size, it certainly raised ethical questions with me.</p>
<p>McGwire is being kept out of the Hall of Fame because he's white. He has a negative public image now because of his race. See how silly this really sounds?</p>

<dd><i>SAN FRANCISCO Mar 25, 2006 (AP)— A judge denied Barry Bonds' bid to block the authors and publishers from making money on a book claiming the San Francisco Giants slugger used steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, and said Bonds' suit against them has little chance of success. Bonds' attorneys argued that the authors, publisher Gotham Books, the San Francisco Chronicle and Sports Illustrated, which published excerpts of the book, should be held liable for publishing "illegally obtained grand jury transcripts."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>there is no indication Bonds intends to challenge the assertions made in the book in court through a libel suit, only challenge the fact that the documents used as sources were obtained illegally. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthonymendoza_ebee.html" title="User:Anthonymendoza">Anthonymendoza</a> 01:03, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Substance Abuser... That is what bonds is... But you have to give him credit, since he was tested positive for steroids he has still hit homeruns, not as many, but he has hit some.</p>

<li>He has NEVER tested positive for steroids. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:55, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Baseball has not had a steroid testing program for too long. Never testing positive doesn't mean he never used them</li>
</ul>
<p>No, but he didn't test positive this season, with testing, and still hit 26 home runs at age 42 in limited playing time. No other player has ever put up the numbers he did last year at his age. This article needs to mention that as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong again. He did test positive this season for amphetamines in 2006. But you can keep your defense of Barry, I have already figured out that you probably won't change your mind until you actually see barry shoot steriods into himself.</li>

<li>If there is nothing wrong with Bonds taking steroids, why doesn't he admit he has??</li>
<li>It is a more complicated issue than you are making it out to be. First of all, I have never heard anyone call for that. I have only heard calls for "asterisks", which is not new at all, see Maris (and even Ichiro, more recently). That being said, possibly the reason is that Caminiti is dead. Taking an award from a dead man would not look good for MLB. Also, remember that steroids, at that point in time, were NOT illegal in terms of MLB. Everyone forgets that. So really, you could argue much better that spitballer's stats/awards should be astrascized (?) than Bonds', Giambi's, Caminiti's, etc. <a href="../../../z/e/l/User%7EZellin_c962.html" title="User:Zellin">Zellin</a> 20:30, Apr 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think anyone could make a reasonable argument that we should allow steroids in the game. The poster was just arguing against putting asterisks on records. Kwikstah
<ul>
<li>"We"? Congress's incorrect assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, MLB is a private organization and as such has every right to set its own rules without outside interference. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 16:06, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Aside from Caminiti being dead, and the pseudo-legality of steroids in his time, the simple fact is that he didn't achieve anywhere near as much as Bonds. The reason you don't hear people "calling" for Caminiti to be stripped of his MVP is.... why would anyone use him as a talking point? People pay more attention to the controversy surronding Bonds' accomplishments because they are much more noteworthy - not because he is black. Also, GWO, there's a difference between a player who uses legal medical technology and a player that cheats. Ridiculous argument, not everything in this world is about race, don't try so hard to make it out to be.
<ul>
<li>While steriods were not "against the rules", per MLB guidelines, they need not have been, as they were, and are, a federally regulated controlled substance. The use, distribution, or dispensation of steroids is regulated per the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. In this case MLB did not even say that steroids were within the rules; they didn't say anything at all. Even if MLB had explicitly said the use of steroids were within the rules, it would still be a moot point. While it is true that MLB is a private organization, they do not have the right to set rules that contradict local, state or federal law. Even if state and local laws allowed for steroid use (which they don't), the federal law would trump them all(see the DEA's shameful prosecution of medical marijuana users if you need this substantiated).<a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevi_P._7191.html" title="User:Levi P.">Levi P.</a> 00:01, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonds has not been found guilty of steroid use - nor has be been indicted. There is only an article written by a newspaper that claims a source leaked grand jury information. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 04:43, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a lifelong SF Giants fan (48 years) who saw Mays, McCovey, Marichal, Cepeda and even Felipe play in person (but not Bonds--have not been a Californian since 1965), I think factors other than race is in play regarding the steroid allegations. Bonds has long been held in scorn by many fans for his churlishness towards the media, and by media extension, the fans. The steroid mess is manna from heaven for the Barry haters. That he "brought it on himself" is inarguable--except that he long ago chose to "go his own way" and has stuck to it, despite enormous pressures to act like baseball's Michael Jordan. Secondly, a great deal of this feud is between Bonds and the SF Chronicle--which has its own axe to grind. Just some things to keep in mind when editting articles. The chips shall fall where they may.--Buckboard 20:54, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the whole racism idea is BS, and I'll tell you why. The reason people don't like Bonds is not because he's black, it's because he's really arrogant. People don't appreciate that, lets think back to 1998. Mark McGuire hit 70 homeruns, everyone loved him, was it because he's white? No, it's because he wasn't an arrogant jerk. Remember Sammy Sosa? He also his a lot of homeruns in 1998, and everyone loved him too. Was it because he was a dark-skinned latino? No, it's cause he wasn't an arrogant jerk.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by user name or ip (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUser_name_or_ip_ab3c.html" title="User talk:User name or ip">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_user_name_or_ip_1983.html" title="Special:Contributions/user name or ip">contribs</a>) date.</small></p>
<ul>
<li>And, in fact, the fans turned on Sammy after he started to become an arrogant jerk and stopped hitting home runs.

<p>Even though Barry Bonds was a gold glove left fielder, I still find it rather amusing that Barry was unable to throw out Sid Bream of the Atlanta Braves. Bream was one of the slowest men in baseball. Barry threw from shallow left/deep short as Bream chugged home with the winning run in the ninth of the seventh game of the 1992 NLCS against Atlanta. The ball bounced several times before it reached the plate and was like a wiffle ball. The throw was miserable.I dont know really why he is trying to fool himself he is not an all-around good ball player. He is at best just average!!!!!!!! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by user name or ip (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUser_name_or_ip_ab3c.html" title="User talk:User name or ip">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_user_name_or_ip_1983.html" title="Special:Contributions/user name or ip">contribs</a>) date.</small></p>

<p>This article seems to be slanted towards Bonds having used steroids. Particularly the references to Game of Shadows. That book is a subject of a dispute. Some baseball fans think it is fact while others don't believe it, so it can't be quoted as fact here.</p>

<dd>While I agree with you that steroid allegations can't be quoted as fact, I disagree with some of the changes you've made to the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>* The line "is notorious for his alleged involvement with performance enhancing drugs" is problematic (due to the word "notorious"), but a variant of it needs to be included in the lead section, as the lead section is supposed to be a brief form of the entire article.</dd>
<dd>* The section on being "tarred with negative notoriety" strikes me as perfectly reasonable. I don't see that as POV at all. In fact, the phrase "retroactive hostility" was an excellent one, in my opinion.</dd>
<dd>* To mention Game of Shadows as fact would be wrong (and the wording of the passage you deleted was poor). However, to not mention Game of Shadows at all is equally wrong.</dd>
<dd>* your removal of the "link spam" was a good one. Totally agree there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Admission of the controvery doesn't qualify as being "slanted." Denial of controversy does. After your alterations, the steroid controversy is so invisible in the article that I would argue it now has a "didn't do steroids" slant. <a href="../../../j/w/a/User%7EJwadeg_a6ac.html" title="User:Jwadeg">Jwadeg</a> 16:29, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have restored much of what was removed, with some adjusments to the language to hopefully make it more neutral in its point of view. I'm still not comfortable with the section on "Game of Shadows," and think that the anonymous user is right that it is misleading (even in my rewritten form). But some inclusion of the book is necessary at this time, as it is such a hot issue. <a href="../../../j/w/a/User%7EJwadeg_a6ac.html" title="User:Jwadeg">Jwadeg</a> 20:38, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does ballball really want to clean up its act? Are they afraid someone will lead the major league in homers with 38 dingers, a clear indication that steroids (and HGH) made a very real difference. I don't know why more individuals and experts are not asking ---"Why are they not?" <i>akula1957</i></p>
<p>Blood tests for hGH are still in development - while hGH is on the IOC's banned substances list, there is still no approved test being used for it at present time. Either way, this isn't directly relevant to the Bonds entry. -Dan Szymborski</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure why you would argue that human growth hormone is not relevant to this article - Bonds has clearly been accused of taking HGH (see <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/07/sportsline/main1378997.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/07/sportsline/main1378997.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/07/sportsline/main1378997.shtml</a>, for example).--Rkstafford 16:00, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the disclaimer that began "All information within this section is highly debated..." for several reasons. 1) It is factually incorrect, as there is very little info contained within the section that is disputed at all. The existence of the Grand Jury testimony is not in dispute. Barry Bond's reaction to the testimony is not in dispute; 2) the section is already, appropriately, under the heading "Controversy", so there is no need to further instruct the reader that the section is controversial.

<p>I'm of the opinion that the sections "2005 injury problems" and "2006 season his last?" are unnecessary.</p>
<p>"2005 injury problems," due to its size, gives a ridiculous amount of attention to his injury year. It's nearly as long as the "Resurgence" section, which deals with Bonds's five most productive seasons. I think that the section on 2005 should either be rewritten into a more general section on his recent troubles, or removed altogether. Devoting so much time to month by month updates on what was arguably Bonds's least eventful season seems pointless (March, May, August, and September updates are all given in the section).</p>
<p>"2006 season his last" just seems frivolous. It seems to me that any active baseball player's consideration of retirement should be dealt with in a line or two, not an entire section. Again, it could easily be collapsed into a rewritten section on his recent troubles. But it doesn't need its own heading.</p>

<p>Legacy section: "Bonds can easily be mentioned in any discussion of who is the greatest of all time, a short list that may only be six names deep (with Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron, Ted Williams, Willie Mays). Any of the aforementioned players may have excelled beyond Bonds accomplishments in any single category (hitting, fielding, etc...) but when considering the total on-field contributions of a player for home runs, hits, stolen bases, walks, fielding, Bonds is arguably the best ever. Bonds is the greatest left handed batter of his time. Unfortunately, new controversies regarding his accomplishments have arisen; these threaten to give him an entirely different legacy than his numbers would suggest." I think this badly needs to be cleaned up for POV, and if there's any source for that "top 6 of all time" that needs to be cited, because I'm sure a lot of people could argue other names that should be on that list. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 17:27, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can he pitch too? Didn't think so.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Statistically speaking, Bonds (along with Babe Ruth and Ted Williams) is typically regarded as one of the top three hitters in the history of the game." This really isnt true and should be changed. Bonds is a career .300 hitter which is nowhere near "top 3" territory. Ruth and Williams, for example, are both .344 career hitters. Bonds is one of the best POWER hitters ever (depending on the whole steriod thing) but one of the best HITTERs ever, not even close.</p>
<p>The best measure of hitting skill isn't batting average its on base percentage were Bonds ranks 6th all time. The only people ahead of him on the list played during the color barrier which is at the least just as big an asterick as steroids if not more. Bonds is clearly one of the greatest if not the greatest hitter of all time.</p>
<p>Did he get to play in a league that didn't let people outside of his own race play?</p>
<p>Didn't think so</p>
<p><br />
OBP is hardly the end all be all of hitting. But even if it was, you just pointed out that he is 6th all time. Which of course contradicts the statement in the article that he is often regarded as top 3 all time. Also, by mentioning Ted Williams its pretty clear that the originaly author was reffering to pure hittins ability, as Williams is renown for being a fantastic all around hitter. Bonds isnt a fantastic all around hitter. In fact he isnt even the best int he game right now (Pujols and Ichiro are outclass him in that, just to name a few) so to say he is regarded as one of the best hitters of all time isnt really accurate. Power Hitter, definatly. But as a hitter in general, he isnt anything all that special (relativly speaking).</p>

<p>It's amazing how people think that steroids can accually enable a player to hit a baseball. Why dosn't the media also look at the tools that Barry Bonds uses. Back in 1996 A prototype bat was introduced to major league baseball. In 1997 it went into full production. We are talking about the "Sam Bat". A bat made out of Solid Maple. A harder and denser bat than that of the ash bat. In combination of tighter wound balls a much harder bat in relation to it's weight. (33oz) Take into account the physics of baseball. When the inpact of a 90 mile an hour fastball with a much harder force due to less obsorbsion, and greater bat speed, the ball will leave the bat at a much greater velocity.</p>

<p>Can someone explain what's going on in this paragraph?</p>
<dl>
<dd>In a 2005 interview with MLB.com, Bonds stated that he could play into 2007 if he remains healthy and if he is close to Aaron's 755 homeruns, although he also noted that he might retire before then if he is able to win a World Series title. [<a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050623&amp;content_id=1101660&amp;vkey=news_sf&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sf" class="external autonumber" title="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050623&amp;content_id=1101660&amp;vkey=news_sf&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

<p>The final paragraph under the Balco Scandal has no business being in an encyclopedic source. Bonds' statistics are already on the page in the proper section and the years of likely steroid use are also in the proper section. Deciding which of the steroids years are "fully juiced" (whatever that means) and then adding the statistic for those years together constitutes original research. This paragraph should be deleted.</p>
<p>--DSZ 14:43, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>JDG is continually reverting to include a paragraph that has no business being in an encyclopedia entry. Barry Bonds' stats are on record on the page, as are the differing accounts of his steroid use. There's no reason for stats from 2000-2004 to be added together as a seperate point as it is pure speculation, not to mention vague (what is fully juiced? was he partially juiced before and after? slightly juiced? mostly juiced?). The article itself doesn't even agree, containing accounts that Bonds was using in 1999, which is not included in JDG's original research and there's nothing sourced that would indicate an endpoint of this subset of seasons. How does the community feel about this?--DSZ 03:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I concur. I removed 2 paragraphs (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barry_Bonds&amp;diff=64341852&amp;oldid=64332137" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barry_Bonds&amp;diff=64341852&amp;oldid=64332137" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) on the grounds that they were uncited and constituted original research. JDG restored those edits (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barry_Bonds&amp;diff=64376452&amp;oldid=64371498" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barry_Bonds&amp;diff=64376452&amp;oldid=64371498" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) a few hours later, along with the edit comment "anymore pro-Bonds pov deletions and I petition for page freeze." While that comment doesn't rise to the level of a threat, to me it indicates an unwillingness to compromise on this issue, as does the fact that JDG keeps adding this content back in. The collection of data about the purported "juiced," "fully juiced" and/or "non-juiced" years smells like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> to me: a new, statistical synthesis clearly aimed at proving steroid use by comparing numbers during the periods in question. At the very least, it needs to be cited, and even then I don't think it belongs unless Bonds' injuries are discussed as well (which, incidentally, seems to me a lot better circumstantial evidence than on-field performance). <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 04:27, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately, Dan Szymborski and Simishag have a skewed view of what "Original Research" is meant to express in Wikipedia guidelines. There is no rule against taking agreed-upon facts and linking them in plain ways to give the reader a clear view of the controversy. The paragraph of mine they keep deleting is not even an original expression of these facts and their implications-- it is simply a clear distillation of what many sports writers, other journalists and millions of baseball aficionados have put together by themselves. In seeking to supress this clear description of the matter at hand they are in effect pursuing a course of POV editing in undue favor of Mr. Bonds' contentions... Sadly I am quite ill and can't keep monitoring this page, and I don't foresee bringing these two editors to mediation. Perhaps one or two other fair-minded editors will take up the cause (and by "fair-minded" I do not mean "anti-Bonds", I mean "pro-honesty" and "pro-clarity"). <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 04:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no rule about taking agreed-upon facts, but this subset of years is not agreed upon. What is the source for "1999-2004" being Bonds' fully-juiced years? Why not 1998-2003? Or 1999-2006? There's no generally agreed-upon date for the start of his steroid use or for the ending (if ever) of his steroid use. So what does it add to what an encyclopedia entry? The facts of his steroid use and statistics are outlined in the article. I find you bringing up the "anti/pro-bonds" stuff to be quite puzzling - your paragraph hasn't been deleted multiple times by different people because it's Anti-Bonds but because it's not suitable as-written for an encylopedia.

A statistical analysis of Bonds' career, which purports to show that Bonds was a better player while "juiced," is not the kind of thing that can be done in 1 or 2 paragraphs without resorting to external sources. There are any number of other variables which need to be accounted for, and any number of counter-arguments to your analysis, which is why we don't do that sort of thing here. Incidentally, I've been through similar arguments recently on NBA player pages, in which a user, who was clearly a fan with an agenda, has added data that, while factual, is presented in an obviously biased way. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 04:29, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I removed it. The "please note" that Bonds hasn't actually been indicted is POV, and unnecessary as it makes it clear in the paragraph above that he hasn't been indicted. There doesn't seem to be any need to "remind" readers that he hasn't been convicted of anything. Also, the line about the lead prosecutor potentially leaking information doesn't seem to have anything to do with whether or not Bonds perjured himself or commited tax fraud; seems to be in there as just a knock on the prosecutor. I think the line about the alleged girlfriend could stay, but as it stood there was no source to support it. Oh, and in a minor edit, I changed the tag for "US Attorney's Office" because it was linking to the US District Court page.<a href="../../../j/c/o/User%7EJCO312_9c68.html" title="User:JCO312">JCO312</a> 16:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>These events have lead some to questions the MLB's motives in regards to this issue.

<p>this paragraph makes no sense, besides being blatantly POV. MLB has nothing to do with the ongoing investigation. and how would an indictment "shift attention away" from the steroids issue, since if Bonds is charged with perjury, it would be for lying to a grand jury about using steroids. wouldn't an indictment further bolster the impending report by George Mitchell? this paragraph should be removed. does anyone disagree?<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthonymendoza_ebee.html" title="User:Anthonymendoza">Anthonymendoza</a> 01:28, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree - I think this is speculation and should be removed. It's certainly unsourced, not to be illogical - I would think that MLB would be much happier if this all just quietly went away, like various amphetamine and cocaine bombshells in the past. DSZ</p>

<p>there has been some recent changing of the intro regarding barry bonds' status as one of the top 3 hitters of all time. i believe its generally accepted that ruth, williams and bonds are the 3 best but some people like to edit in other hitters. we should reach a consensus and people's thoughts on the matter should be listed below. --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucsrsafe_541f.html" title="User:Bucsrsafe">Bucsrsafe</a> 17:40, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't mean to be a saber-geek here, but valuing batting average over slugging percentage is POV.

<dd>It's not just the average, he smacked lots of home runs as well. And Ted Williams <i>learned from him</i>, so he apparently had something going for him.

<p>ok guys, my turn to chime in. bonds has it all, as does ruth and williams. they were power hitters and could hit for average too. bonds is a .300 hitter for his whole career. this hornsby guy was good but he didnt hit that many home runs. at the end of the day, statistically speaking ruth, williams and bonds are the top 3. how many mvps did hornsby win, was it 7? i think we could change the intro to saying statistically speaking that bonds, ruth and williams are the 3 best, but putting in "pure base hit" men like hornsby and cobb is just rubbish. these 3 and maybe aaron stand above all else as overall hitters in that they could do everything. thoughts? --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucsrsafe_541f.html" title="User:Bucsrsafe">Bucsrsafe</a> 21:06, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're arguing for your personal viewpoint in the article, which is against wiki policy the last time I checked (the flip side of the guy who insisted on correlating Bonds' years of suspected steroid use with his stats).

<p>even if barry did use steroids, is it such a big deal? steroids dont make you more talented at baseball, they make you hit the ball further, barry certainly had no problem hitting long balls in the mid 90's either. maybe steroids meant a few more landed in mccovey cove but the man would be one of the greatest hitters of all time, steroids or no steroids. steroids dont make you hit better for average either, because you take steroids, it doesnt mean you can get singles easier, he battled .370 in 2002, an amazing achievement. he might have taken steroids but he was still strong enough to hit a huge number of home runs anyway, people talk about it like he would have been rubbish if it werent for the supposed steroids he took. even if he did take them, it doesnt make you a better ball player, it means you can hit it harder and further, so a few more long balls into the cove for the canoists to chase, those balls would have been homers with or without steroids, it doesnt make a difference. greatest hitter of all time, most feared hitter of all time, most prolific hitter of all time, one of the best all around players of all time, all those accolades belong to #25 of the giants, no question. --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucsrsafe_541f.html" title="User:Bucsrsafe">Bucsrsafe</a> 16:24, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>For one thing, it's against the rules. For another, it's dangerous and allowing it encourages others to engage in dangerous behavior.

<p>well it wasnt against the rules before 2003 actually, mlb didnt ban steroids. it might help a player recover quicker but it doesnt make players more talented, barry bonds is a special ball player, always has been and always will be, it just doesnt matter, all this backlash against him is just jealousy and because people dont like the man anyway because of his persona. its funny how mlb refuse to acknowledge him passing ruth, yet they were loving it when sosa, bonds and mcgwire were whacking homers and bringing fans back to a sport in which interest was declining. barry is not doing well now because the man is 43, who was the last ball player that you saw could still be among the best at 43? thought as much, there isnt really one. to be fair the man is still batting 250 and has had 17 homers and 50 rbi's, thats not an awful season, his knees are giving in, yet he can still play the game. the man is a true legend, anyone who says against that is just misguided. steroids can only do so much and help power mainly. mcgwire is a prime example, he was a pure power hitter who was obviously beefed up on steroids. he couldnt hit for average like bonds can do or defend like bonds could do. steroids didnt make him better in either of those fields, baseball isnt just about home runs like people who are anti-barry seem to think it is. --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucsrsafe_541f.html" title="User:Bucsrsafe">Bucsrsafe</a> 17:37, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>actually it was against the rules. Players are prohibited to take illegal drugs. Barry Bonds was taking illegal drugs. He was breaking the law.</p>
<p>Also if steroids warrents an asterick, then babe ruth deserves one as well because he didn't have to compete all of the best players due to the color barrier.</p>
<p>You all need to start signing your posts to keep them separate. Use 4 tildes to do that. Bonds has never been proven to have taken steroids or any other illegal substances.

<p>Guys, this discussion is getting a little off point. We're not here to judge what Bonds did or what Bonds didn't do but to maintain an encylopedia entry. Things such as the in-game legality of steroid use prior to the change in the CBA (for example, the Howe and Hoyt cases pretty clearly established what MLB could and could not do - the drugs banned and the punishments had to be specifically negotiated into the CBA - just being illegal wasn't enough to allow MLB to take action) that aren't specific to Bonds really don't belong here. Of course, I just broke that rule, too!DSZ 04:26, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was leaked, and he didn't deny his statements. There's a reason his trainer refuses to say anything, including that Barry never took steroids.

<dd>A few reminders (as I see them). This talk page is only for discussing the article and not necessarily everything about Barry Bonds. There's no objective way to rank Barry Bonds among the all-time best hitters of the game. Which stats you chose and what weight you give to them depends on personal opinion. It's a bit like asking who the best-looking hitter in history is. You could look at things like height, weight, distance between the eyes (sorry bizarre example) but when it comes down to it you're left with someone's opinion, even if it is the opinion of more than one person.</dd>

<p>Is the times on base record in the other records subsection official? The given total seems to be lacking.

<dd>I believe not. Reaching on errors and fielders choices are both treated as failure to reach base in batting average and on-base percentage calculations. If you were measuring some sort of "absolute" streak of times on base you might count them, but such a record would be unofficial, I think. <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZakath_8d11.html" title="User:Zakath">Zakath</a> 22:07, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In that case, I think the proper term should be reached base safely not times on base despite the popular On Base Percentage term.<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 21:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As the one who removed this the first time, I should say that I don't mind the mention about Giambi all that much. My real objection was adding the fact that Bonds is black to the very first sentence of the article. I don't think that adds any value, and might be likely to stir up more controversy, at least among editors. If it could be mentioned down in the same section in the same way ("Bonds (who is black) yadda yadda Giambi (who is white)"), then I think it's a valid addition. Either way, thanks for checking here and attempting to build consensus before just starting an edit war. A refreshing change. -- <a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakern74_d8cc.html" title="User:Dakern74">dakern74</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/k/User_talk%7EDakern74_b9a5.html" title="User talk:Dakern74">talk</a>) 04:30, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that it's worth including, but we need an actual allegation of racism over this issue. The first link GrandWizard provided (San Diego Tribune) never mentions Giambi; it's about Bonds' statement that Boston was a racist city. The second link also doesn't support the allegation of racism. If we can source it though, then I'd say put it in. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 04:50, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bingo. Just make sure that whatever you add (you should do the honors) indicates that Torii Hunter, a centerfielder for the Minnesota Twins and a contemporary of Bonds, is the one who raised the allegation (rather than a vague "some believe" type of phrasing).

<dd>Done. I took out the link to the San Diego Trib (Bonds saying Boston was a racist city), and a link that pointed to reader comments on Bonds' treatment. I also converted the two remaining links to {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">cite news</a>}}. Looks good right now.

<p>I think that maybe we should start putting additional references or articles concerning Bonds and the controversy surrounding him. Such as the article</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/12/02/MNG80A523H1.DTL" class="external free" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/12/02/MNG80A523H1.DTL" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/12/02/MNG80A523H1.DTL</a></p>
<p>I also find it very unusual that the Jason Giambi article barely touch's on Balco <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Giambi#BALCO_Scandal" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Giambi#BALCO_Scandal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Giambi#BALCO_Scandal</a> . Even Mark McGwire has a short controversy section in comparison to Bonds.

<dd>The Giambi article, at a quick glance, is a mess. I saw a lot of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> in there. I'm going to stick with this article for a while until we clean some of it up. As for the link you included, what does that article tell us that isn't currently cited in the article? It appears to be much more about Giambi (and would make a nice citation in his article) than about Bonds.

<p>I added a small section for <i>Game of Shadows</i> due to its importance in the Bonds history for a couple of reasons: it needs one due to its importance, the SI cover in the article only passes fair use criteria if it depicts the issue's mention in the article, and it seemed odd to reference a totally obscure book (<i>Love Me, Hate Me</i>) and not the more famous one. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 13:10, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
