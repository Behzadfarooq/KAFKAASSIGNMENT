<p>Barış! To the best of my knowledge, Murat Karayalçın does have immediate Hamsheni roots, although he was born in Samsun. For Mesut Yılmaz, I do think that he has a Hamsheni connection but it's very distant and is really not worth mentioning. He has Bosniak connections too and even a Russian grandmother, but after all he is not mentioned in the articles on Bosniaks and Russians:) You will see that <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacukali_5373.html" title="User:Macukali">User:Macukali</a> wrote a beautiful article on Hamshenis in the Turkish wikipedia. It is always better to have someone who has direct knowledge of the people who constitute the subject matter. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECretanforever_4f45.html" title="User:Cretanforever">Cretanforever</a> 21:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Allah ud-Din</span></h2>
<p>The name is certainly <i>Allāh ud-Dīn</i> - that's the correct transliteration from Arabic. I know that many people spell and pronounce it worng. The <i>ud-</i> is actually an <i>al-</i> ... but <i>al-Dīn</i> is usually turned into an <i>ud-Dīn</i> in Arabic. I guess you are referring to Allāh ud-Dīn Kay-Qubā<u>dh</u>. The second part of his name, <i>Kay-Qubā<u>dh</u></i>, is taken from Persian <i>Kay Kubād</i>, a mythical Iranian hero. In Ferdousi's <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahnameh.html" title="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a>, it's mentioned as <i>Kay-Qubā<u>dh</u></i> - very obiously Arabicized.</p>

<p>"<i>It is funny that you should mention the Ottomans, since Greeks have a much more legimate right to lay claim to the Ottoman legacy than any other nation in the world. It is them who ran the economy, navy and politics of the empire, so when the young Turks abolished the Ottomans and Greeks, their civilisation went down to zero. It is the Greeks who inherited directly many aspects of the Ottoman culture, and its most important geographical part. Turkey has a very good case too, so let's call it equal... Of course I'm partly kidding, I'm just using those claims as an example of how original research and imperfect education can lead into silly beliefs. Baristarim it's obvious that you weren't brought up in Turkey, you're missing the fundamental notions of the Turkish national self-image, let alone a basic understanding of modern historiography. Your imperfect knowledge on the topic prevents you from acknowledging the irony of your claims. However I'm glad that you realises in what degree Ottoman society and state were founded on and preserved by the modern Greek (late Byzantine) element.</i>"</p>

<p>Hey man, I noticed the little conflict over at that page, and I have to agree with Mardavich this time. I'm not sure what the Azerbaijani language has to do with Turkey, besides the fact that Azeri and Turkish are both Turkic languages (but then again, so are Turkmen, Yakut, Kazakh, etc.). On the other hand, most Azeris live in Iran, not Azerbaijan. Anyways, you're the judge.

<dd>Hi Baristarim, Ishalah haliniz yakhchidir. I appreciate your change of tone. The Iranian template is there because there are more Azeri-speakers in Iran than in any other country, Iran is Azeris' main home. If we add Turkey, then we'll have to add Russia, Georgia, there will be no end to it.

<p>This is just a silly edit-war. Please look at Parishan's old comments on the talk pages of those two pages, he's from Azerbaijan Republic. The template is just there as a navigation bar linking the dynasties that ruled Iran by timeline, when you remove it, the time line from 1300's to 1400's goes missing. Ak Koyunlu's capital was <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabriz.html" title="Tabriz">Tabriz</a>, Kara Koyunlu's center was in Iran. Yesssss, they were Turkic, just as were many other rulers of Iran, there is no contradiction there. I'm Turkic and I'm Iranian.

<p>And how the following translates?</p>
<p>please translate:</p>
<p>Türk Milleti’ni simgeleyen BOZKURT’u sembol alan TMT; Kıbrıs’ın Türk kalma ve Kıbrıs Türkü’nün var olma mücadelesinde Türk Milleti’ne karşı tarihsel sorumluluğunu başarıyla yerine getirir... Tıpkı “örgütlenmesini” daha önceleri Hacı Bektaş-ı Veli’nin dergahından çıkarak “Anadolu’da tecrübe” etmiş gibi... Sanki Hz. Türkistan Ahmet YESEVİ’nin ocağından geldiğini ispatlar gibi... <b>TMT’nin kurutulmuş oğlak etiyle beslenen Bozkurtlar’ı, Kuvay-ı Milliye’nin dipdiri ayakta olduğunu gösterir gibiydiler</b>... thanks <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAristovoul0s_1a5a.html" title="User:Aristovoul0s"><span style="color:white;background:#007">&#160;<span style="background:#009"><span style="background:#00a"><span style="background:#00b">Ari<span style="background:#00c">st<span style="background:#00e">o</span>vo</span>uλ</span>os</span></span> &#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/r/i/User_talk%7EAristovoul0s_b421.html" title="User talk:Aristovoul0s"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 18:36, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look dude. The web-site's name doguturkistan.net translates into "eastturkistan.net" - East Turkistan is in China. Extremist web-sites cannot be cited to give the impression that it is a hundred percent confirmed fact. All I am saying is that it would be better if we could use some impartial books on the Cyprus issue as sources. Eastturkistan.net has nothing to do with this, they could be simply trying to "recuparate" political points by connecting itself with TMT. I am not saying they did or didn't use any particular symbol, but you cannot simply say "ultra-nationalist pan-turkist" where as the EOKA-B article, an organization that was recognized as terrorist not only by TR but also UK, has this for the intro "EOKA-B was a Greek Cypriot right-wing pro-enosis paramilitary organisation formed in 1971 that ..." See the difference in tone? That's all.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 18:43, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Better, Baris, however for the lives lost, i think it is a minor contribution to include Turkish Cypriots killed by TMT... We have a turkish Cypriot newspaper stating that... lives lost is a different issue thought isnt it? <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAristovoul0s_1a5a.html" title="User:Aristovoul0s"><span style="color:white;background:#007">&#160;<span style="background:#009"><span style="background:#00a"><span style="background:#00b">Ari<span style="background:#00c">st<span style="background:#00e">o</span>vo</span>uλ</span>os</span></span> &#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/r/i/User_talk%7EAristovoul0s_b421.html" title="User talk:Aristovoul0s"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 19:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look at the final version, at the end of the intro I said why the wolf was used&#160;:)) I tried to clean up a little bit, however the article seriously needs a clean-up sources and timeline wise. Lives lost is not a different issue, I have no problem with them being mentioned in <i>any way</i>. The problem is that the article is in dire encyclopedic situation. Don't get me wrong, I am willing to help out with any revision or rewrite of the article, I am just trying to make it look more formal and serious. As for the lives lost.. There is no problem with them being mentioned, all I am saying is that we should have some good sources on this, otherwise, others, today or in the future, will have an excuse to edit-war citing the unreliability of the sources. The article would also need a good restructuring to have seperate "background, organization, acts, timeline and aftermath" sections. That way all of these could be easily aboarded. However I am not a Cypriot, so my knowledge can be lacking with this subject. I will try to contact some other users to see if they can lend a hand. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 19:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Barış GA nomination page is on my watchlist. I've been watching it since i've written TK1476 GA article. If you want to get 3rd person views, you can check <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer review</a>. But peer review thing isn't working very very good. My best advice is first handle "well referenced" part, because everyday GA is becoming somekind of FA:) Even they can speedly de-list some of them due to reference problems. Also they are de-listing GA articles for same reason.--<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 00:26, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>Hello, I saw your edits to both of these articles, as well as the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> article, changing the name of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> to Istanbul. My source says Natalie attended the St. James Orphanage in Constantinople before 1900. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> article says that the name change to Istanbul occurred in 1930.

<p>I just wanted to point out that it was not <b>my version</b> as you state, but an alteration to the original made 48h ago by an anonymous user (82.13.151.249). And <b>it made no references to the origin of the product</b> (this is outlined in a separate paragraph further down) (remember, you remarked: <i>and your version implies that it is equally Bosnian, Turkish and Armenian at the same time. It is eaten much more in Turkey, as well as being Turkish as its name implies.</i>). In Cyprus for example, Turkish delights have a universal presence (most Greek-Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot restaurants will have it on the menu) and whole communities make a living out of its production (which is most probably a legacy left from the Ottoman rule of the island). Remember I am not questioning the origins of the product I am just trying to relay the fact that you wont find it in <b>traces</b> in neighbouring countries and that it is actually a common desert. I am afraid it looks like you might have taken this as an insult to the Turkishness of the product. I see it more of a compliment as its continued production illustrates remnants of bygone Ottoman influence in the area. Anyway I agree that the version you have left now is probably a true reflection.

<dd>I generally do many upkeep tasks around so I tend not to have too much time to analyze the whole issues, I take a look and try to fix it. That's why I had done a simple revert in the first place, then when you pointed out that "traces" could be an understatement, I tried to fix it. Sorry if it might not have seemed correct to do such a revert.. However, I agree, so I tried to improve it a little bit.

<dd>Yeah, whatever.. I have all those pages on my watchlist (if any admins are interested they can have a look at my watchlist if it is possible), and I suddenly saw numerous edits by you on those articles simply titled "rv" or "rv vandalism". There is no stalking, it is <i>the articles</i> that I am watching, not you... You can report anything to anyone you want, I had those articles on my watchlist for ages, it is not my fault that we seem to be running into each other since we are interested in similar articles.. Whether u believe me about the stalking is your choice, but there is nothing wrong with having such cross of interests from time to time between users. Don't be accusing me of stalking, if you hadn't started your wiki session only by blind reverts, I wouldn't have had to revert you. Simple really..

<dd>Definitely OK with me <i>as long as he can have access to my watchlist to see when I added it</i>. It was my first edit, yes, however, I had that article on my watchlist for over ten days, I swear on my honor. Whether you believe me after that is not something I can do anything about. I am smarter than to simply open your contributions list and headdive into articles that you have edited right after you have. I don't mean that in a conspiratorial way, I am just trying to say that I am not going to go to articles that I have no knowledge about just to piss you off. I have had <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> on my watchlist as well for the last three months, however I have still not made a single edit. I just keep it there to see what is going on and to see if I can revert some random vandalism if I come across. In any case, let's drop it..

<dd>I do not care what you think about the Iranica or about the Encyclopaedia of Islam. You guys only recite Britannica when it serves your purpose. But whenever Britannica oposes your views, you suddenly change your minds and delete the info (for example Britannica's second article on <a href="http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9273044" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9273044" rel="nofollow">Babur</a> which clearly states that both Babur and Timur, as well as the Mughals were "Mongols" and not "Turks"). Besides that, you have been told many times that there are "good sources", like Britannica, and "excellent scholarly" sources, such as Iranica or EI, which not only cite other scholarly source, but also the author of the article who - in 99% of the cases - is himself an academic expert on the toppic. Britannica does neither cite an author (because Britannica's articles are NOT written by experts or academics) nor any secodary literature or sources.</dd>
<dd>As for the edit in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>: my version makes clear that - unlike the information of the CIA Factbook or Britannica - the EIr clearly cites its sources regarding Afghanistan's population and makes clear that it is mostly based on official governmental census numbers from 1960 to 1980. Britannica does not give ANY source and simply guesses the numbers. THAT's the difference. And THAT's the reason why Britannica is only a "good" source while Iranica is an "EXCELLENT" source. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 18:42, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Of course, during the whole time, you were absent, not interested in the article. And now, when you friend E104421 started to edit the article, within a few minutes you jumped in with your usual nonsense about the status of <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a>. Sorry to say that, but all proofs are againt you ... no matter how often you swear on your honor.

<dd>First of all, talk with more respect. I have tried to approach in a conciliatory way, however you are not up to it I see. I have been reading the Iranica link that was mentioned in the Afghanistan article. For vandal-wars. Look dude.. Similar vandal attacks also happen in Italy and France articles that I have on my watchlist, I never edit them since there are enough people fighting vandals for those pages, I have other fish to fry.. Ok? I am not the vandal patrol for every single article. Even for Turkey article I rarely do vandal reverts. Nobody is stalking you, so cut down on the paranoia. I have asked you the reason for your edits on other articles, instead of blindly reverting them, like in Allah ud-Din ... So please don't insult my intelligence by saying that I just open up your contributions list and head-dive head-on. A) I have no time for such low-level play B)There are smarter ways of doing that. All of those edits showed up when I refreshed my watchlist: Afghanistan, White Huns and Timurid articles all titled "rvv" by Tajik at one-minute intervals.

<dd>That is normal, since Seljuq Turks refer to the people as a whole, not just the dynasty. There are two different articles for Ottoman dynasty (House of Osman) and the Ottoman Empire. Same thing. In the near future, there will be another article created called "Seljuk Turks" that will be about the people in the same way, don't worry. Scholarly sources do not only use the q-spelling I am afraid, FPAS himself said that for .edu searches, the outcome was even between the K and Q spelling, see the relevant talk pages. Of course, I can see your point if you consider the <i>Iranic</i> as the only scholarly source and the Bible of God&#160;:)) In the <b>English</b> language, there is no difference in pronounciation between Q and K in that particular word structure, and that's what counts: English. And most common name obviously. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 13:56, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Seljuqs were not a "people", they were family, named after their ancestor Seljuq. Their clan was not called "Seljuq" but "Kinik" (even that's mentioned in the article). Do you have ANY sources for your claim? Id o not think so ... The problem with you remains: you falsefy facts, you reject scholarly sources, and you stalk ... and you try to hinde all of this behind <i>hot air</i> ... Don't talk, act! Why don't you show me sources from your most favourite source, the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Britannica_9113.html" title="Encyclopaedia Britannica">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>, that could actually support your <i>hot air</i> that the Seljuqs were "an entire people"?!</dd>
<dd>Besides that, I consider the Iranica (in this case, the talk is not about Iranica, but about the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> ... but it does not matter anyway, since you reject both ... I mean, since you reject every single source that's written by an educated academic) an excellent work, because it's written by ACADEMICS and because it ceites SOURCES. Britannica neither gives any reference to its authors nor to its sources - THAT's the difference.</dd>
<dd>And your comparison with the Ottomans is really hillarious. The Ottoman Empire was not a nation based on ethnicity (even if Turkish nationalists propagate nonsense like this) ... the same goes to the Seljuq EMPIRE. However, the article I am talking about is about the SELJUQ FAMILY. In any case, the expression "Seljuq Turks" is wrong ... and - let's come back to your own ideology of "wikiuniformity": there is no article called "Seljuq Turks".</dd>
<dd>Stop being a hypocrite and follow your own words.</dd>

Is that so hard to understand? Gees..

<p>Regarding the dispute in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Talk%7ETurkey_3c00.html" title="Talk:Turkey">Talk:Turkey</a>, I'm not discussing this because of a bias against Turkey, it has to rather with the fact that such edits can have socio-political and historical implications on modern territories. For example, to imply in the infobox that Ottoman Empire is aka Turkey, implies that all countries of the Balkans and the middle east were actually stolen from Turkey. The suggestions/ideas of OttomanReference verify this. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 19:15, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Khwarizm Shahs are not part of the Turkish history, and there is no need to mention a Turkish spelling of the name. They are known as the "Khwarizm Shahs", and since this is a Persian name, only the Persian spelling should be added.</dd>
<dd>There are many scholars who have worked on the history of the Khwarizm Shahs, most of all because they were the reason for the Mongol attacks on the Islamic world. This does not mean that every mother-tongue of those scholars has to be mentioned in the article.</dd>
<dd>The Khwarizm Shahs have never ruled over Anatolia and their history has nothing to do with the history or language of Turkey.</dd>
<dd>Adding their name to the article is just like adding Swahili, Japanese, or Armenian to the article - it has absolutely no point and no importance.</dd>

<p>Baris bey ben anlatayim size ne oldugunu. Surekli Turk ve Yunan mutfağı sayfalarını edit eden kisiler hep aynı dikkat ederseniz. Ve bilinçli olarak siyasi amaçlarla sayfalarda değişiklik yapıp duruyorlar. Ben Miskin bey/bayan ile çok çok uzun süren tartışmalar neticesinde tam tavırlarını anlayabildim. O yuzden hangi edit'i niye yaptıklarını çok iyi biliyorum. Bir kere kesinlikle Ottoman "influence" kelimesini kabul etmiyorlar. Neden? Tamamen siyasi milliyetçi sebeplerle. Yok Döneri bunlar Avrupa'da tanıtmış. Yok Türk kahvesi değilmiş kahve asla Türk olamazmış. Olsa olsa Arap olabilirmiş? Adamlara kaynak getiriyorsun bu kaynak geçerli değil diyorlar. Yok yogurt aslında Bulgarlardan geçmişmiş? Tabii bunlar öyle olmuş olmasını tercih edebilirler ama gerçek bu değil. Bu kadar basit. Commonality ne demek bir kere? 1. Commonality olsa olsa Türk-Yunan mutfağı arasındadır (çağdaş mutfaklardan bahsediyorsak eğer?). Yani Osmanlı mutfağı v. Yunan mutfağı olabilir mi? Turkish cuisine page'in başlangıcında öyle bir giriş vardı ki ilk başta akıllara zarar. Osmanlı mutfağı sanki fusion mutfağı gibi takdim ediliyor. Adeta Amerikan mutfağı. Bunların izin verdiği oranda birkaç değişiklikle toparladık durumu. Ayrıca hem bir zamanlar Osmanlı mutfağının parçası olduklarını iddia ediyorlar hem de "commonality" vardır bunların arasında diyorlar. Parçası olduğun bir şeyle nasıl ortak olursun. Commonality değil, Ottoman influence vardır dedik, kıyamet koptu. Dolma, döner ve şiş'in etimolojik açıklamalarını sürekli silip duruyorlar vs.</p>
<p>Ben bu işe çok tesadüfen bulaştım. Turkish cuisine sayfasını mümkün olduğunca toparlamaya çalıştım. Normalde bana ne Yunan sayfasından ama bunlar zırt pırt Turkish cuisine sayfasında baklava, etler, mezeler vs. ile ilgili değişiklikler yapıp durduklarından başladım bunların sayfasına da bakmaya. Tabii milliyetçi-şöven biri değilim kesinlikle. Benim en yakın arkadaşlarım Yunanlılar yurtdışında. Ama bu sayfalarla sürekli uğraşanlarla birilerinin ilgilenmesi lazım diye düşünüyorum. Konuşup anlaşmayı denedim olmadı. Durum budur.

<p>My problems is not with Turks (if you take a look at my user page, you'll see that I am descendant of <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayat.html" title="Bayat">Bayat</a> Oghuz Turks who were part of <a href="../../../k/i/z/Kizilbash.html" title="Kizilbash">Kizilbash</a> army of the Safavids), but with Turkish nationalists.</p>
<p>You people need to understand that the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> are NOT "one people" or "one migrating people", but a whole bunch of unrelated peoples who simply happen to speak realted languages.</p>
<p>I know that the Turkish state propagates pseudo-scientific nonsense, claiming that all dynasties and peoples were actually Turks. But this is BS.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_people.html" title="Turkish people">Turkish people</a> (citizens of Turkey) have nothing to do with Central Asian Turks except their related languages. They are NOT genetically related; they are NOT historically related.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../k/h/w/Khwarezm_Shahs_378e.html" title="Khwarezm Shahs">Khwarezm Shahs</a> were a dynasty of unknown origin that rose out of the chaos following the collapse of the Seljuq Empire in Central Asia. If they were Turks, then deffinitly not Oghuz.</p>
<p>I do not know why you are pushing for the Turkish translation of the name. The Khwarezm Shahs have NO IMPORTANCE and NO RELEVANCE to the history of Turkey. By the time of the Khwarezm Shahs, the Seljuqs had already established their Rum-Seljuqid dynasty in Konya.</p>
<p>Your claim is totally irrelevant and illogical. It's like giving certain Spanish dynasties of South-America Persian and Bengali names, only because their languages are related. The people of South America and Persia are neither genetically nor historically related - only their languages are related. The same goes to the Turks of Turkey and those of Central Asia: ONLY the languages are related. And in case of Khwarezm Shahs: they were - if their Turkic origin is confirmed - of Qipchaq or Qarluq origin, but certainly not Oghuz!</p>
<p>A Persian translation of the <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythians.html" title="Scythians">Scythians</a> was rejected because of the same reasons, and I fully support that decision. The Scythians were related to the Persians, but they were not Persians! The Khwarezm Shahs, on the other hand, were a totally Persianized dynasty - either of Turkic or Iranian origin - and they have relevance in the Iranian history pages. The Persian name must be given, the Turkish name is totally irelevant and only servs Pan-Turkist propaganda.</p>

<dd>I am not misinformed ... in fact, it's the Turks themselvs who are totally misinformed, and much of it has to do with the sick nationalism introduced by Atatürk.</dd>
<dd>The number of Turkish citizens who may have some Central Asian (=original Turkic) origins is less than 9% (the source is given in the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_people.html" title="Turkish people">Turkish people</a> article). The Turkish language itself with its lack of original Turkic sounds, the massive adoption of Arabic, Persian, and European loanwords, etc, is the best proof that the overwehlming majority of modern Turkey-Turks are not "Turks" by origin.</dd>
<dd>But this is not the point. The point is that Anatolian Turks want the entire Turkic history of Central Asia to be "Anatolian Turkish". That's why you push for the Anatolian Turkish spelling of the name "Khorezmshahs" although it has absolutely no relevance: first of all, it's only the Turkish pronounciation of the Persian original, and secondly because it's the typical Anatolian pronounciation ("H" instead of the correct "Kh") of it - although the Khorezmshahs had absolutely nothing to do with Anatolia.</dd>
<dd>What you fail to understand is that the Turkic languages are only one family, NOT the same language. An Anatolian Turk won't be able to understand Yaqut Turkic ... the difference is as big as between modern English and modern French. What you are doing is the same as claiming that French, English, German, and Italian are "dialects of the same language" ... which is pure nonsense.</dd>

<dd>Because it contradicts the article <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anush_Tigin_Gharchai_7c1a.html" title="Anush Tigin Gharchai">Anush Tigin Gharchai</a> ... and besides that, has no importance. The Khwarezmshahs neither acted as Persians nor as Turks (they started several "Jihads" against "pagan Turks" in Central Asia; see <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a>).</dd>
<dd>That's the best solution.</dd>

As for Turkey: the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_people.html" title="Turkish people">Turkish people</a> have nothing to do with the Khwarezmshahs ... their history are "Turks" starts with the Ottoman Empire, because they were the ones who - as "Beyliqs" - linguistically Turkicized the population. Claiming that the Khwarezmshahs are part of the Turkish history, is like claiming that the Indo-European migration into India is part of the history of Brazilians. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 21:27, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You last edit is OK ... the Turkic origin has minor importance, what's important is that he was a slave and not where he came from. As for "Shah": no, he was not the Shah, but only the governor who ruled in the name of the Seljuq Sultan.

<p><small>because you seem to be all out to highlight negative aspects in turkey. Singling out Kurds and arabs for backwardness is racism.</small></p>
<p><small>There is no rule about putting literacy figures which makes turkey look bad (along with a racist attribution of it to Kurds) and Laz are a discernable ethnicity on the black sea. You do not own this page.</small></p>
<p><small>I dont care about kurds actually (i am neutral to them) but i dont want Turkey depicted as some backward ass third world shitehole that your trying to make it look like. I will do anything to stop it.

<dl>
<dd><small>Trying to make it look bad? I have been spending hours to clean that article up so that it can reach FA status. When I rewrote the economy section, I also put in many mentions of the economic development. Expecting me to remove the illiteracy figures simply because I am Turkish is also racist since it assumes that all Turks are part of a "gang" to advertise Turkey. Take a deep breath, and raise the issues in the talk page. All that information that you have mentioned was sourced by hard-rock sources (Turkish government and the BBC), so they will stay. It is not my fault that the literacy figures among women in southeastern Turkey are low.. But they are, and such figures form an integral part of demographics. Don't forget that turning a blind eye is worse, maybe it should be mentioned so that some people will do something about it. In any case, that is not relevant, I only put them there since other country articles mention them too, there was no political agenda. As for the ethnicity list, see my notes on the talk page of Turkey. I didn't touch when you modified Zaza to Circassians, however that list is not going to get any longer, that's my main concern. There is no need to mention twenty ethnicities.. I am sure that when that article gets to FA and is displayed in the main page of Wikipedia, than you will see that it is a better way of "advertising" than some dubious edits in a lame article.

<p>My Edit in Turkey page: 18:02, 16 December 2006 172.193.24.83 (Talk) (Correct name is Turkia, like Estonia, Austria, Australia, but changed to a slang name of Turkey by mocking Europeans making fun of Turks in the 16-17th century with the starting decline of Ottoman Emp)</p>
<p>I really believe Turkish Parliament should pass a prompt legislation with immediate international effect on the name of TURKIA to bring an end to this mockery of slang name of TURKEY imposed on us by the English speaking! When I say I am Turkish, half of the time I hear 'Oh you are a turkey arent you!!) If we were not unhappy with it, our airlines would have write Turkey Air on it rather than Turkish, trying to avoid the externally instigated humiliation.</p>

<p>Hi Baristarim. Nice to meet you and thanks for your comment which I answered as below; Have you read the Muazzez Ilmiye Cig, who translated the memoirs of a Sumerian teacher who wrote the history of the emmigration of his people upon sustained drought in their native land in the northeast next to a big sea where colored eye people (scyhtians likely) were their oppressive neighbours (fits to the east of Hazer and Black Seas)? If this was not Central West Asia, where can it be?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Could be true, I am not a professional historian nor an anthropologist. However, I suggest that you raise edits that might seem "controversial" in the talk page, <i>especially</i> for big articles. That's all. I was not judging the merit of your edits, I am only acting in a way so that the page doesn't become the scene of an edit-war. There have been so many edit wars over Ataturk and Turkey that, the article got protected a hundred times.&#160;:) Happy editing, however!<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 16:18, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you. I appreciate it. Also, about your reversal of the'national identity of Kurds', I would like to remind that the national identity of any citizen of Turkish Republic is defined as Turk (like American) if they were part of founding the nation, and the Kurds agreed officially to this, by means of Turkish constitution since the time of Ataturk. PKK and any separatist activity in Turkey has nothing to do with any national identity. I would encourge you to please consider working further on the sentences you reversed as well as perhaps aiming to take them out completely because it has nothing to the with Ataturk, in my humble opinion.

<dd>Well.. All I am saying is that it was the version adopted after weeks of discussion on the talk page, and I just cannot take another dispute of the kind&#160;:)) I wrote the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Constitution_2f82.html" title="Turkish Constitution">Turkish Constitution</a> article, I know what you are trying to say however. In fact, I was wondering about the mention of the PKK, I thought that it was going to be taken out and just leave the mention of the Kurds in general. I wonder who put it back in (or if it was never removed in the first place). I will try to take a look at it tonight or tomorrow and maybe contact some of the other contributors.

<p>Thanks Baristarim. Also, I think there are some other sentences appear very lopsided erroneous and in conflict of better statements touching on the same issues in the article on Turkey, again on headscarf, religous gruntling etc in the legacy section which may also be better off deleted. When you have a chance, can you please take a look at that too? Nice talking to you. 194.81.124.199 16:38, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure. I am currently working on the main <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> article, and it has been taking me a long time to get it to a good standard. With some more work it should make the FA. I will look a bit into Ataturk article tonight, and contact another user that has contributed more to the article.

<dd>??? I had that article on my watchlist since October. I have nearly 5000 articles on my watchlist. So cut down on the paranoia, I had enough of people accusing me of stalking. It is the articles that I am watching, not the people&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 12:17, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So <i>Eirenaie</i> (presumed Greek <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=ireneus" class="external text" title="http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=ireneus" rel="nofollow">translation</a> of Baris), I'll tell you something -- feel free to check my edits and follow me (I know you are doing it anyway, I know everyone is as well...) and I will do likewise (as if I'm not doing it already...). <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">Wikistalking</a> requires the <i>mens rea</i> of <i>intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor</i>. If all you have is the intent of keeping an eye on users with a history of POV edits and (N)POV pushing yourself then I see no reason why it should be wikistalking. If it is, then half the wiki is liable to be banned, so it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>As for Turkish, <b>I hate it I hate it I hate it...</b> <a href="../../../a/g/g/Agglutinative_language.html" title="Agglutinative language">agglutinative languages</a> are the dregs of all (European) languages. Changing suffixes, the first suffix one learns "-dir" becoming "-tür" in the appropriate circumstances and people who don't have a background in vowel harmony languages are wondering WTF that is. Then after you've added a few suffixes the word is unrecognizable (especially if it ends in -k, for example if you know <i>köpek</i> means dog, try picking it out in the phrase <i>şu kemik köpeğindir</i> if you don't know what you're doing). I don't think I've ever uttered a full phrase in Turkish correctly (thankfully most people in Turkey know some English nowadays so it's not really much of a problem).</p>
<p>Finally, how did you get 5,000 pages on your watchlist? I'm only about 2,000. //Dirak 16:23, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Baristarim, you've got to turn your anger down a few notches before posting here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADenial_of_the_Armenian_Genocide&amp;diff=94691612&amp;oldid=94688583" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADenial_of_the_Armenian_Genocide&amp;diff=94691612&amp;oldid=94688583" rel="nofollow">These</a> edits (and their summaries) are really over the line. Why do you feel it is necessary to attack me for the opinions I've expressed on a survey someone else has launched? Stay calm, stay civil, avoid appeals to emotion and avoid bad language. I'd like us to be able to work together, but lashing out like this will not get you anywhere. Cheers. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 11:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
