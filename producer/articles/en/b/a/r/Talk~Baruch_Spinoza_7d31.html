<p>It was suggested that this article should be renamed <i><a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictus_de_Spinoza_4119.html" title="Benedictus de Spinoza">Benedictus de Spinoza</a></i>. The vote is shown below:</p>
<p>"Benedictus" was the name under which he published his work, and corresponded with his peers. "Baruch" was his formal name within the Jewish community, but since they viciously anathematized him as a young man, severing all ties and even denying him his inheritance, I don't believe it would be appropriate to use it as his "real" name -- he was not a part of that community after the age of 23. Personally, I doubt he would've appreciated it. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreases_43bf.html" title="User:Creases">creases</a></p>

<dd>I'm afraid I'm not yet familiar enough with Wiki to know what anyone will think is provocative or not. His synagogue anathematized him in the strongest language; the community severed ties with him; and his family denied him his inheritance. The whole affair was horribly bitter. Thenceforth neither he nor they considered him a part of the community that used that name. My use of the word "vicious" was meant to suggest the acrimony and the strong language of the anathematization, not meant to be a judgment on those who did it. My last remark was only personal opinion, obviously purely speculative, and not meant to represent a judgment on anything but the use of the name, which is the topic under consideration. If you could let me know how my tone could be made less provocative, I'd appreciate it, so I can be more confident in my future Wiki activity. --<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreases_43bf.html" title="User:Creases">creases</a> 03:58, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>Not</i> normal English usage; in English he's generally known as "Baruch Spinoza." (Google finds five times as many hits on "Baruch" as "Benedictus *", and that's the name by which he's known in every philosophical overview I've ever seen.)</li>

<dd>"Baruch" seems to be common among Jewish scholars, and has caught on with amateurs. Nonetheless, "Benedictus" is the standard. The Library of Congress information on the publication page of my copy of Hackett's edition of Spinoza's <i>Complete Works</i>, for example, uses "Benedictus". --<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreases_43bf.html" title="User:Creases">creases</a> 21:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Google tallies should be carefully done and evaluated. If you compare "Baruch Spinoza" to "Benedict Spinoza" OR "Benedictus Spinoza" the difference is actually a more narrow 2:1. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. At first I was supportive of the move, despite the nominator's tone, because "Benedictus de Spinoza" is certainly how he has traditionally been refered to among philosophers. However, the striking Google results convince me otherwise; apparently "Baruch" has caught on popularly, and the Wikipedia policy is to go with common names.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 20:27, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Consider: Google "Spinoza": 787,000; "Baruch Spinoza": 69,000; "Benedict Spinoza" OR "Benedictus Spinoza": 29,000. So by the Google test either first name is cited less than 1/10 as often as the last name. I don't think popularity on Google is always the best criterion, although it certainly should be one element. A search of my local libray (500k volumes) gives 23 volumes on Spinoza, 2 on Baruch Spinoza, and 3 on Benedict or Benedictus Spinoza. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 00:19, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Even if it is a minor aspect of Spinoza's life, why should it not be said, in the article, that he was of judeo-portuguese origin (of course Sephardic), as stated in many sources (see, for instance, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy online here <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/" class="external autonumber" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). He was, in fact a member of the Judeo-Portuguese Congregation of Amsterdam (Synagogue Talmud Tora - see the pages in Portuguese <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinagoga_Portuguesa_de_Amsterd%C3%A3o" class="external autonumber" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinagoga_Portuguesa_de_Amsterd%C3%A3o" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and Dutch <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugees-Isra%C3%ABlietische_Synagoge" class="external autonumber" title="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugees-Isra%C3%ABlietische_Synagoge" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>; you can see also the references done by the World Jewish Congress here <a href="http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/communities/world/weurope/netherlands.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/communities/world/weurope/netherlands.cfm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). Even if this congregation could receive jews with other origins (such as Spanish; or even Ashkenazim, whom they help establish in the Nederlands and to build their own synagogues), the fact remains that it was a Sephardic Portuguese community, as can clearly be verified <i>in situ</i> in Amsterdam. Spinoza was born in Amsterdam to Miguel de Espinosa and Ana Débora, Miguel's second wife who died when Spinoza was a little boy of six - they were <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marranos.html" title="Marranos">Marranos</a> who had fled from Portugal in order to escape the Portuguese Inquisition and return to Judaism. Some say that the Spinoza family had, in fact, its remote origins in Spain, others claim that they were portuguese jews who had moved to Spain and them returned in 1492 to their country of origin - Portugal. There, they were forcebly converted to Catholicism in 1498. Spinoza's father, Miguel de Spinoza, would be born about a century after this forced convertion in the small portuguese city of <a href="../../../v/i/d/Vidigueira.html" title="Vidigueira">Vidigueira</a>, near <a href="../../../b/e/j/Beja.html" title="Beja">Beja</a> in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alentejo.html" title="Alentejo">Alentejo</a>. When Spinoza's father was still a child, Spinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Spinoza (who was from <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>), went with all his family to <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantes.html" title="Nantes">Nantes</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. They were expelled in 1615 and moved to Roterdam, were Isaac died in 1627. Spinoza's father and his uncle, Miguel and Manuel respectively, them moved to Amsterdam, were they assumed their judaism (Manuel even changed his name to Abraão de Spinoza, though his «commercial» name was still the same). Spinoza spoke portuguese and this was the language he spoke at home and in the jewish community he was a member of before expulsion. He also spoke hebrew, latin, dutch and spanish. Portugal and Spain are not the same reality and the Iberian peninsula, with all it's internal differences, should not be reduced to Spain (and even more so to Castille!). I'm not reverting your change, Blainster, but I'm adding the fact that Baruch Spinoza was a member of the Portuguese-Jewish Community of Amsterdam. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ogre_8ae7.html" title="User:The Ogre">The Ogre</a></p>

<dd>I intended no slight of the origins of this great philosopher. It simply seems that to describe him as both Sephardic <i>and</i> from Portugal is partly redundant, because the term Sephardic means his family is from either Spain or Portugal. But you responded as if I had removed the word Sephardic, too. In an encyclopedic article I think that book length explorations of family origins should be subordinate to the philosophical work of the man. Notice that I have removed two additional redundancies (Amsterdam and Jew were both listed <i>twice</i> in the same sentence! Shouldn't we have a goal of communicating as concisely as possible? The word Sephardic is good for this purpose since it communicates both religious and geographical background in a single term. I like that. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 23:52, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your comments. Einsteins views on God and religion have been made quite clear through his extensive publications and correspondences. See <i>Einstein and Religion</i> by his friend Max Jammer, Princeton U. Press, 1999, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-691-00699-7</a> for a detailed examination of these views based not only on Einstein's published work, but also on the Einstein Archives at Jerusalem. However, the use of the term God may be a semantic stumbling block for some. Einstein stated that he had "a clear idea of God", but not "a clear image of God.. for of God no image can be made". He said that his view could be considered <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheistic.html" title="Pantheistic">pantheistic</a> (p. 75 ref. Jammer). He never discussed miracles, and did not believe in influence of prayer, but saw scientific pursuit as a form of revelation. In his opinion, "the laws of nature manifest the existence of a spirit vastly superior to that of men." (p. 93) So he did believe in what he described as God, just not a personal God --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 19:05, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If Einstein's view is pantheistic, that means "everything is God." It is another way of saying that all of Nature is God. This makes the concept of God so different from the traditional definition that it almost destroys it as a meaningful concept. As you say, Einstein thought that scientific pursuits and study of the laws of nature were similar to religious activities. I would venture to say that this explanation by Einstein was his way of appeasing the common person's curiosity while, at the same time, not indulging in an untruth.</dd>

<dd>Although Spinoza gives repeated warnings that his "Deus" is far from the anthropomorphic {<a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcendent.html" title="Transcendent">transcendent</a>} conception of God prevalent in the {<a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaeo-Christian_5e9c.html" title="Judaeo-Christian">Judaeo-Christian</a>-Islamic} theology of his time, the reader will find it difficult to bear this constantly in mind.

So Spinoza's frequent use of the phrase "Deus sive Natura"—G-D that is Nature—is intended as a salutary corrective. For Spinoza G-D is all <b>Being</b>, all Reality, in all its aspects and in all its infinite richness.</dd>

<p>Let's admit that Spinoza , by asserting that the whole natural world is God, was an atheist. If God is not anthropomorphic, or humanoid, then he is not God. Nature is simply nature, not a god. Spinoza used the word "God" to signify the concept "Nature." This is totally opposed to Judaism, and its appendix, Christianity.

<dd>It is important to note that Spinoza doesn't use a standard definition of attribute, either - an attribute for him is a way for the intellect to perceive substance. . . so human beings can perceive the two attributes of mind and body. God for him is not a cognitive being, being the entirety of everything. God is also necessarily bound to do everything that God does, unless you accept Spinoza's definition of freedom, which is something whose grounds for its existence is contained within itself. Spinoza's god is not the standard judeo-christian god. <a href="../../../w/r/i/User%7EWriterPhilosopher_0d64.html" title="User:WriterPhilosopher">WriterPhilosopher</a> 08:48, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wrote, in agreement with Schopenhauer, that the word "God", with a capital "G", designates the concept of a cause of the world that possesses a humanoid personality. This concept is what Spinoza wisely eliminated, leaving only Nature or Substance as the cause of itself, which is obviously the truth.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 16:41, 7 July 2006 (UTC)Lestrade

<dd>i disagree with both of you on this point (for example, jewish mysticism has a long history of people saying that God is utterly incomprehensible to, and totally unlike, humanity. also, i'll note that atheism does not specifically refer to capital-g God, but to theism generally. (i hope this isn't coming off like an attack, by the way. i like debates). of course, if you wanted to mention schopenhauer's view in the article with claims people have made about spinoza being an atheist, that would fit well. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingnixon_2fcb.html" title="User:Kingnixon">dan</a> 03:26, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a quote, I cannot remember from where, that compares Spinoza's 'God' to the Hindu concept of Brahman. The quote goes something along the lines of "Spinoza would have been happy on the banks of the Ganges" though this is a paraphrase. Spinoza, for his whole life, protested the label of "atheist" upon him. He has been referred to as a "God obssessed atheist" (though again, the reference escapes me).</p>
<p>A great reference material for this article is the book "The Courtier and the Heretic", which delves into the relationship between Leibniz and Spinoza. The summary of the book states that Spinoza's 'God' is one in which no one could believe. However, it is a stretch to go from this to then call him an atheist.</p>
<p>His Treatise Theologico-Politicus, and his use of God as a ground for reality (as in "Deus sive Natura", properly translated as "God, or Nature") seem to exclude him from status as an atheist, unless by "atheist" is meant "not a believer in the Judeo-Christian God."</p>

<dd>Spinoza's <i>Grammar of the Hebrew Language</i> calls attention to another fact about that language which is of surpassing importance for understanding Spinoza. This is that all the words in the language with a few exceptions made by later grammarians) were originally verbs. Thus all the words whether or not they are still used as verbs contain the verbal idea. Thus, to be brief, when Spinoza uses the word "<i>Being</i>" as a name {a title} for G-D (and he often does, regarding it as the proper name for G-D), the word has the verbal sense {a process}, not the nominal {a noun}. It is not used as in "a being" or an entity but in the sense of "a state or act of being," or a way of doing something: living, say. It might be said that Spinoza's is a philosophy of change.

<dd>After the judgment of the Angels, and with that of the Saints, we excommunicate, expel and curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of the holy Scrolls with the six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts which are written therein, with the excommunication with which Joshua banned Jericho, with the curse with which Elisha cursed the boys, and with all the curses which are written in the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in. The Lord will not pardon him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law, and the Lord will destroy his name from under the Heavens, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the firmament, which are written in the Book of the Law. But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that nobody should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favor, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four ells of him, or read anything composed or written by him.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Two possible reasons for Spinoza's excommunication are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spinoza violated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham-ben-M%C3%A9ir_Aben-Ezra" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham-ben-M%C3%A9ir_Aben-Ezra" rel="nofollow">Aben Ezra</a>'s dictum of "silence." This violation is seditious in that it tends to break down a functioning society. It takes away an existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaeo-Christian" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaeo-Christian" rel="nofollow">Judaeo-Christian</a> faith without quickly replacing it with a new faith; only evolution can do this peaceably. This resistance to change is the society's (<a href="../../../i/n/e/Inertia.html" title="Inertia">inertia</a>) stability.

<ol>
<li>I am writing a paper on Spinoza currently, and from what I can tell he was born as Baruch Despinoza, not Baruch Spinoza as is mentioned in the article.</li>
<li>Secondly, it is someone what offensive to call him the greatest Jew, because he was in fact given the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herem.html" title="Herem">herem</a>. So it seems some what anti-semetic to call the greatest Jew a man who was banned from Judaism. --Anon. <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">19 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a></li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>On your second point; I think the "Greatest Jew" comes from Ernest Renan's book <i>Life of Jesus</i> where he writes: "The greatest men of a nation are those whom it puts to death. Socrates was the glory of the Athenians, who would not suffer him to live among them. Spinoza was the greatest Jew of modern times, and the synagogue expelled him with ignominy. Jesus was the glory of the people of Israel, who crucified him."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although it is questionable whether the quotation in this book is a sufficient authority for calling Spinoza the Greatest Jew (unless it is used anywhere else I am not aware of), I think calling that particular quote anti-semetic is somewhat of a misuse of the word.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do have to add that Ernest Renan was apparently the inspiration for the term anti-semetic (see wikipedia article on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a>). <a href="../../../m/c/m/User%7EMcmvanbree_8c45.html" title="User:Mcmvanbree">Mcmvanbree</a> 20:53, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have seen Spinoza called the greatest Jew on several occasions. I think this is in an effort to say that he was great because he was less like a Jew. -Unknown</dd>

<dd>In 1655/5/21 he is witness at a notary document and signed "Bento despinoza". At the same year the notary writes "Bento d'Espinosa" (twice) and "Bento d'Espinoza" (once).</dd>

<p>'Animals can be used in any way by people for the benefit of the human race.' This is a quote from the main article. ANy reference to any articles will be helpful. Also, does this mean Spinoza endorsed meat-eating? Sam mishra 19:01, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I located this quote on page 100 of Spinoza's <i>Ethics</i>: "men have a far greater right against the lower animals than they have against men. I’m not denying that the lower animals can feel. But I do deny that their having feelings debars us from considering our own advantage, using them as we please, and treating them in whatever way best suits us." He is talking in the passage about not having a problem with killing animals, but he does not explicitly state (at least here) whether he eats them or not.

<dd>when quoting, could you* please use section numbers, eg IIIP57S, instead of page numbers; I don't have the same edition of the Ethics and it took a fair while to locate that quote.</dd>
<dd>FYI, the standard system for quoting the ethics is as so: WXYZ, W=part number, X=type of comment, eg definition, proposition etc, Y=number of that type, Z=the sub-part, eg demonstration or scholium. Hence to quote the Scolium to 57th proposition of part three, I'd say IIIP57S, or 3P57S. This way, the quote can be located in any copy of the ethics. Many thanks.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>[1] This is the time to return to Spinoza and to consider the possible meaning of what he wrote on body and mind. Whatever interpretation we favor for the pronouncements he made on the issue, we can be certain Spinoza was changing the perspective he inherited from Descartes when he said,
<p>in <a href="http://www.yesselman.com/e1elwes.htm#Endnote14:5c-DamasioBodyMind" class="external text" title="http://www.yesselman.com/e1elwes.htm#Endnote14:5c-DamasioBodyMind" rel="nofollow">The Ethics, Part I</a>, that thought and extension, while distinguishable, are nonetheless attributes of the same substance, <a href="http://www.yesselman.com/glosindx.htm#Deus" class="external text" title="http://www.yesselman.com/glosindx.htm#Deus" rel="nofollow">G-D or Nature</a>. The reference to a single substance serves the purpose of claiming mind as inseparable {organically interdependent} from body, both created, somehow, from the same cloth {<a href="http://www.yesselman.com/TwainSpn.htm#Spinoza-Descartes" class="external text" title="http://www.yesselman.com/TwainSpn.htm#Spinoza-Descartes" rel="nofollow">Mark Twain</a>}.The reference to the two attributes, mind and body, acknowledged the distinction of two kinds of phenomena, a formulation that preserved an entirely sensible "aspect" <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dualism.html" title="Dualism">dualism</a> , but rejected substance dualism. By placing thought and extension on equal footing, and by tying both to a single substance, spinoza wished to overcome a problem that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ren%C3%A9_Descartes#Damasio_on_Descartes_Error" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ren%C3%A9_Descartes#Damasio_on_Descartes_Error" rel="nofollow">Descartes faced</a> and failed to solve: the presence of two substances and the need to integrate them. On the face of it, Spinoza's solution no longer required mind and body to integrate or interact; mind and body would spring in parallel from the same substance, fully and mutually mimicking each other in their different manifestations. In a strict sense, the mind did not cause the body and the body did not cause the mind.</p>
</dd>
<dd>[2] (p. 216)..... At numerous junctions in The Ethics, namely in <a href="http://www.yesselman.com/e5elwes.htm#XXI" class="external text" title="http://www.yesselman.com/e5elwes.htm#XXI" rel="nofollow">Part V</a>, Spinoza defines eternity as the existence of eternal truth, the essence of a <a href="http://www.yesselman.com/glosindx.htm#Thing" class="external text" title="http://www.yesselman.com/glosindx.htm#Thing" rel="nofollow">thing</a>, rather than a continuance over time. The eternal essence of the mind is not to be confused with immortality. In Spinoza's thinking the essence of our minds existed before our minds ever were, and persists after our minds perish with our bodies. Minds are both mortal and eternal. (p. 217) Besides, elsewhere in The Ethics and in the <a href="http://www.yesselman.com/ttpelws1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.yesselman.com/ttpelws1.htm" rel="nofollow">Tractatus</a>, Spinoza declares the mind perishable with the body. In fact, his denial of the immortality of the mind, a feature of his thinking from his early twenties, may have been a principal reason for his expulsion from his religious community (Damasio:326note26).</dd>
<dd>[3] What is Spinoza's insight then? That mind and body are parallel and mutually correlated processes, mimicking each other at every crossroad, as two faces of the samething. That deep inside these parallel phenomena there is a mechanism for representing body events in the mind. That in spite of the equal footing of mind and body, as far as they are manifest to the percipient, there is an asymmetry in the mechanism underlying these phenomena. He suggested that the body shapes the mind's contents more so than the mind shapes the body's, although mind processes are mirrored in body processes to a considerable extent. On the other hand, the ideas in the mind can double up {memories, plans, etc.} on each other, something that bodies cannot do. If my interpretation of Spinoza's statements is even faintly correct, his insight was revolutionary for its time but it had no impact in science. A tree fell silently in the forest and no one was there to serve witness.

<dd>This comes back again to what I've been saying elsewhere in the discussion about defining the basic prinicples of Spinoza's metaphyics. You need Substance as something that contains the ratio (that's rat-ee-oh. Latin.) for its existence within its essence. You should probably define essence as well in order to highlight how Substance necessarily exists. Regardless this doesn't matter too much so long as we agree that there is only ONE substance that is infinite.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Once you've got Substance you need Attribute - a way of perceiving substance. There are an infinite number of attributes; humans can perceive two (maybe one): the mind and the body. All attributes are isomorphic (I have argued that they are STRICTLY isomorphic but that might not be the case) so that any even that happens in one has an indenticate in the other. In all of them even though we can't perceive them. That's ANY event; even events that aren't contained as ideas in our minds.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So a tree in the material world has as its identicate an idea of a tree in the mental world that doesn't have to be in anyone's mind. Ideas, the kind we think, have as their identicates in the material world brain states. That's it. If you are thinking of a tree then this is a neurological state that is reflected in the mental realm as an idea of a tree. This is where the argument about strict/non-strict isomorphism comes in, because in one way it is possible to have disanalgous events in one attribute that don't translate perfectly to the other.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So Spinoza, as you said, basically sidesteps the entire problem that comes hand in hand with Descartes' acceptance of the intential model of perceptual awareness.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I just want to mention that youre comment about "there is a mechanism for representing body events in the mind" is somewhat off kilter. All events happen in Substance; these events can be perceived in different ways. Two of these ways are the mental and the material perceptions. There is no mechanism; there is Substance. As for the comment about one shaping the other more readily, that's just silly. There's an idea of ME that has as its identicate the material ME. Attributes don't affect each other in a casual way. Substance affects itself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>When in doubt appeal to Substance. Spinoza is so logical. I love him. <a href="../../../w/r/i/User%7EWriterPhilosopher_0d64.html" title="User:WriterPhilosopher">WriterPhilosopher</a> 09:23, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spinoza "simply" was addressing Descartes' alleged solution to the mind body "problem" and of course the ridiculous pineal gland solution given by Descartes. The way Spinoza addresses this issue is to imply that all matter is concious. So-called mind is nothing but the inward sence that all matter contains, thereby tying mind to matter, this does not admit to the primacy of matter. It disregards the importance of mind, along with "problems" such as free-will("A stone in flight no doubt believes it is the cause of it's own flight...") mind/body mechanics and so on. If all matter is concious, not imbibed with a spirit or soul, just self-aware (like coma victims that dream) then matter is the only thing one need worry about in philosophizing (my own conclusion). The implications of his monist view are myriad and indeed logicaly, one can call him an athiest in his time. The monist doctrines of India however cast his philosophy in an entirely different light to "moderns." I have seemed to meandered off track but I hope this is helpful. 71.212.242.187 19:32, 18 November 2006 (UTC)Gmoney the funkster, Spinoza enthusiast.</dd>

<p>There should definitely be an article on Spinoza's Ethics, it's a very major philosophical work. -Unknown</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is curious that Spinoza titled his book <i>Ethics</i> because <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a> are one of the weakest parts of his philosophy. As Schopenhauer wrote: "<i>It is true that here and there Spinoza attempts to save it by sophisms, but he often gives it up altogether, and with an audacity that excites astonishment and indignation he declares the difference between right and wrong, and in general between good and evil, to be merely conventional, and therefore in itself hollow and empty</i> (e.g., <i>Ethics</i>, IV, prop. 37, schol. 2)." (The <i>World as Will and Representation</i>, vol. II, ch. 47) There is a contradiction between <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">pantheism</a> and ethics. "<i>All pantheism must ultimately be shipwrecked on the inescapable demands of ethics, and then on the <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a> and suffering of the world. If the world is the appearance of a god, then everything done by man, and even by the animal, is equally divine and excellent; nothing can be more censurable and nothing more praiseworthy than anything else; hence there is no ethics.</i>" (<i>The World as Will and Representation, ibid.</i>) Such an obvious contradiction between pantheism and ethics deserves a place in an encyclopedia article.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 18:31, 20 January 2006 (UTC)Lestrade

<dd>Yes, it is clear that his work would be better served if it were called "Metaphysics", just as Hegel's "Science of Logic" isn't particularly scientific or logical.

<p>I have to disagree with this point. Spinoza named his Ethics so because this is its primary concern. The fact that you quote Schopenhauer to make this point only confirms that you are stuck within the post-Kantian paradigm of ethics and judge Spinoza accordingly, but of course, Spinoza was no Kantian and his conception of Ethics cannot be so judged. The "metaphysics" of the first part and the "epistemology" of the second are all ancillary to the task of describing human flourishing, and nothing could more clearly show this than the appendix to the first part of the Ethics, where Spinoza unveils his critique of teleology and all of its consequences.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I agree the contradiction between pantheism and ethics deserves some mention because it is a remarkable moment in the effective history of Spinozism, especially considering the latter's effects during the Pantheismusstreit of the 1780s and Schelling's own Freiheitsschrift which takes up this precise problem. But the key here is to acknowledge that Spinoza did not understand his system as pantheistic (if not merely because the word hadn't yet been coined) and his ethics are not Kantian, so the effective history rests on a misinterpretation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mr. or Ms. Anonymous, Schopenhauer's historical position as a Kantian has nothing to do with the truth of his words. His judgment on the absence of ethics in Spinoza's <i>Ethics</i> stands alone and is not related to a period or phase in the history of philosophy.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 13:05, 22 June 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</dd>

<p>Actually, it does, because it is his understanding of ethics from a post-Kantian position which allows him to cast this judgment. The basis of that ethics is the freedom of the will, but Spinoza is very clear in abandoning the concept of the will that his contemporaries, Descartes and Leibniz, for example, cling to. Rather, his conception of ethics is based on removing the prejudices that restrict our capacity for acting, undermining the power of passive affects which determine us, and appropriating our affects positively such that we are agents, such that we approach something like human freedom. Second, as far as the incoherence of pantheism with ethics, this is certainly not true. Even Schophenhauer's predecessor Schelling saw this in his Freiheitschrift. Namely, that pantheism does not neutralize the possibility of freedom, but require freedom to be conceived in a specific way. Herder was Schelling's predecessor in this matter (see his dialogue God, Some Conversations). Far from ethics being a secondary concern for Spinoza, everything only makes sense in the context of an ethical project. --Ashleyuv 05:28, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Spinoza's "Ethic's" is a book whose title is it's essence! Yes there is much meaphysical talk in the begining, it is the basis for everything later. Spinoza is interested in ethics in the same way as the Epicurean, Stoic, and other Helenic schools of philosophy were, as a guide to the best way to live your life. His metaphysics go to pains to remove the good/evil dichotomy, as well as the divine/sinful, etc. These ideas (including free-will) are nesecarilly left out of a mechanist philosophy. So why then do we percieve ourselves to suffer, the only real question in ethics, is the only problem the philosopher addresses throughout the entire book, in a very roundabout way I will concede. The method though is, when understood, the only real conclusions a rational mind will come to (alright this is my belief but one really should give him an earnest try)! If you are still confused about where the ethics in the "Ethic's" are, here is one goal Spinoza gives: controll your passions. 71.212.242.187 19:49, 18 November 2006 (UTC)Gmoney the funkster</dd>

<p>User Thinkingfreely changed, in the article, the sentence "The natural world made itself" to "The natural world is infinite." But, in Spinoza's philosophy, Substance is another name for Nature. Nature, in turn, is another name for God. "...[B]y nature viewed as active we should understand ... God...." (Part I, Prop. XXIX, Note) The world of nature, therefore, made itself. Spinoza wrote, "<b>Substance cannot be produced by anything external, it must, therefore, be its own cause</b> ...." (Part I, Prop. VII, Proof).<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 14:30, 14 February 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>His change is correct if you think about it logically. Substance is infinite; it is not finite and unbounded. (I am using Substance and God interchangeably). Substance has the ratio for its existence contained within its essence; therefore it necessarily exists. Substance is. There can't have been a time when Substance didn't exist because it necessarily exists. It didn't make itself; it is. What you describe would require substance to prior exist itself which is logically impossible.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next issue is with the definition of cause. Spinoza doesn't prescribe to a push-pull mechanical theory of causeality a la Descartes. For Spinoza, something causes another thing if it can logically explain the other thing. In essence, X causes Y if, and only if, X contains all the ratio (rat-ee-oh. Latin) for Y. And X contains the ratio for Y because W contained the ratio for X, which necessarily contained the ratio for Y. . . and so on all the way back to Substance, the ultimate antecedent. Thus Substance contains the ratio for its existence within itself, and that is why it caused itself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'll go one step further. Since Substance IS the Universe, Substance contains time within itself. Thus substance transcends time. The argument for the causation of substance falls down right at the start because the notion of "prior" can't possibly be applied to the definition of an entity that is atemporal. It's like saying the Universe "began" 13 billion years ago; no, as far back as we can perceive began 13 billion years ago. <a href="../../../w/r/i/User%7EWriterPhilosopher_0d64.html" title="User:WriterPhilosopher">WriterPhilosopher</a> 09:05, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Proof: If they share an attribute, they would be identical.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I find this confusing. Wouldn't this imply that all substances possessed only a single attribute? As far as I know, sharing an attribute only means you are similar, since we have multiple attributes. For example, I am similar to my dog in that we have four limbs, we share that attribute. We are not identical, because I am bipedal. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 08:07, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>You're confused because the article is misleading in not establishing the basic principles of Spinoza's metaphysics. Substance has an infinite number of infinitely complex attributes. An attribute is a way for an intellect to perceive substance. Since there is only one substance, which is ontologically complete (having its essence contain existence), and it has the infinite number of infinitely complex attributes, a second substance would have to have an attribute that it does not. Since attributes are ways of perceiving substance, this second substance would be imperceivable; an imperceivable attribute is not an attribute. This conclusion is reached by way of Identity of Indiscernables, where a two things are the same thing if they share ALL of the same properties. You are not your dog because you have properties it does not. However, you are both a "part" of substance. Thus, if two substances shared an attribute they would both be perceived the same way, and they'd both be perceived the same way because they'd have to have identical properties.

<dd>Spinoza's philosophy has much in common with Stoicism inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil&#160;:a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness (or eudaimonia, for the Stoics).&#160;:However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected&#160;:their contention that reason could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can be&#160;:displaced or overcome only by a stronger emotion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is incorrect - no stoic ever claimed to be able to "defeat" emotion but instead develop clear judgment (apatheia) by not allowing our emotions to cloud our judgment. Stoicism asks us to not be ruled by our emotion, but it never says to remove (defeat) emotion. Although a stoic may love a woman he should not let this love spell the end of his country because she wants a exotic palace that would deplete the treasury. SO although stoicism does say we must control our emotions so that they do not compromise rational judgments, decisions and actions, it never asks us to supress emotion altogether.--<a href="../../../b/a/a/User%7EBaalhammon_3c8d.html" title="User:Baalhammon">Baalhammon</a></p>

<p>"Also, his Theologico-Political Treatise was highly critical of orthodox readings of the Torah and challenged the idea that Jews were a chosen people.

In 1665 he notified Oldenburg that he had started to work on a new book, the Theologico-Political Treatise, published in 1670."</p>
<p>my interpretation of this section is that in 1656 he is excommunicated for a book that he published in 1670. this section is just generally confusing for me. i am not remotely qualified to fix it, but hopefully someone who knows about him can. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingnixon_2fcb.html" title="User:Kingnixon">dan</a> 08:19, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When he says, in <i>Ethics</i> Part 4, Proposition 37, Note 1, that he <b>denies</b> that we <b>may not</b> consult our own advantage and use animals as we please, he means that he <b>affirms</b> that we <b>may</b> consult our own advantage and use animals as we please. This confusion is the price we pay for reading a philosopher who delights in the play of concepts and the words that designate them.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 03:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>
<p>In the article's "Overview of his philosophy" section, User Sightbeyondsite read about Spinoza's thoughts on the treatment of animals. Naturally repelled by its lack of feeling, the user asked for a reference. I indicated the reference as <i>Ethics</i>, Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1. Then User Détruire claimed that Spinoza actually said the opposite of what the article asserted. However, it is my opinion that Détruire was confused by Spinoza's use of double negatives. Below is the passage with the double negatives converted into clear and simple affirmatives:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason. The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us. Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.</p>

<p>"Look at the barbarians their ultimate deed&#160;!" Spinoza wanted to post these words next to the eviscerated bodies of Cornelis and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_de_Witt_96c6.html" title="Johan de Witt">Johan de Witt</a> when they hung exposed at the gallows in the Hague (1672), after they had been lynched and mutilated by a crowd of fanatics. His friends had to retain him with force.</p>
<p>It's a detail one misses in the present description of his life.</p>
<p>After his stay in Rijnsburg with the Collegiants (1660-1663) and in Voorburg near the Hague (1663-1670), he moved permanently to the Hague in 1670 eventually to stay at the home of the painter Van der Spijck, bringing with him his "Tractatus Theologico-Politicus" in which he developed ideas on religious tolerance as a matter of state, ideas held by Johan de Witt (following <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_van_Oldenbarnevelt_7699.html" title="Johan van Oldenbarnevelt">Johan van Oldenbarnevelt</a>) who provided Spinoza with a pension. In 1674 the "Tractatus..." was officially prohibited in the Netherlands...</p>
<p>In the accessible Dover edition (1951:"Works of Spinoza" reprint of G.Bell &amp; Son ed. 1883; VOL.I): Benedict de Spinoza translated by R.H.M.Elwes, the latter uses the biography of Johannes Colerus (1703) to paint a touching portrait of the philosopher. Colerus told how Spinoza himself used to draw portraits in charcoal and ink of his friends; Colerus owned a book of such drawings that included a self-portrait of Spinoza <i>"in the costume of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masaniello.html" title="Masaniello">Masaniello</a>".</i></p>
<p>Ultimi Barbarorum&#160;! Today the words are often jokingly used to designate the rape of Spinoza by the editors of cheap encyclopediae. We, as it so happens.</p>

<p>I remember having read something about Spinoza along the lines that he had not much to learn from the more renowned Greek philosophers - Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and instead regarded other lesser known Greeks like <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epictetus.html" title="Epictetus">Epictetus</a> as influences.

<p>As I recently pointed out on the Malebranche talk page, the suggestion in the Schopenhauer quotation (which also keeps turning up in the Malebranche article) of an influence from Malebranche to Spinoza, cannot be right. Spinoza's system was already firmly in place before Malebranche's philosophy started to appear in print (1674), and there is no evidence of any private contact between them either. Spinoza also didn't endorse anything like Malebranche's occasionalism or vision in God. (It is of course true, for Spinoza, that all causation and knowledge, and everything else too, are 'in God' in some sense: but he spells this out in a very different way from Malebranche). Since, among the various claims contained in the quotation, the only ones that have any bearing at all on the subject of the present article are false, I would be inclined to propose that it should be removed altogether, together with the preceding sentence about "his reading of Malebranche".

<dl>
<dd>I've gone ahead and removed the Schopenhauer remark, on grounds of both historical and philosophical innaccuracy, as well as irrelevance. I've also added references to George Eliot and Somerset Maugham, and I've rewritten the Wittgenstein bit. On the last of these, I left in as much of the existing material as I felt, in all good conscience, that I could; and I even went so far as to add the 'sub specie aeternitatis' reference. My principal concern about the previous paragraph was that Spinoza's <i>Tractatus</i> simply does not possess the structure that was ascribed to it. Whoever wrote that was almost certainly thinking of his <i>Ethics</i>. But then, although, in my revision, I suggested a comparison between Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus</i> and the <i>Ethics</i>, I'm really not even comfortable with that. Moore's suggestion of a title for the translation of Wittgenstein's <i>Abhandlung</i> might well be worthy of a mention in this article: but I'm really not certain that any more than that is genuinely worth mentioning, even the new bit that I myself added.
