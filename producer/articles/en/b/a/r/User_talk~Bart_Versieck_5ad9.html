<p>Bart, why do you insist on de-capitalizing titles, such as "Veterans by Country." Surely a newspaper capitalizes titles! Also, please stop deleting links to "Longevity Claims." Look, the purpose of "Longevity Claims" is to list claimed ages, so we can see that while one person might claim to be 115, another claims to be 118. Also, I prefer to consider Pawel Parniak a longevity claim, not a longevity myth. To me, a "myth" is not true (but may have some allegorical or storytelling value). Clearly, claims to 160, 150, 140 are clearly myths. However, age "115" is possible (if not very likely). Thus, we cannot say for sure that Pawel Parniak is a myth unless evidence is found to support that contention. In the meantime, let's list gray-area cases in longevity claims. As noted, the rules for inclusion:</p>
<p>1. Must be less than 130 years old (mainly 113-129). '</p>
<p>2. Must have a claim in the news, including a birthdate.</p>
<p>3. The claim has not been validated or invalidated.</p>
<p>If a claim is invalidated, we can move them to "longevity myth."</p>

<dd>Robert, first of all, "country" is written without a capital letter "c", and, secondly, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longevity_claims.html" title="Longevity claims">longevity claims</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longevity_myths.html" title="Longevity myths">longevity myths</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Bart Versieck</a> 23:44, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I just noticed <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longevity_Claims_82ad.html" title="Longevity Claims">longevity Claims</a> should be changed into <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longevity_claims.html" title="Longevity claims">longevity claims</a>, which is currently a redirect to <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longevity_myths.html" title="Longevity myths">longevity myths</a>, so I asked the administrators to delete it in order for me to be ably to change its title. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Bart Versieck</a> 23:59, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi.

<p>Hello there, Bart,<br />
Ahh! now I see your point. In fact, at first I didn't understand because you unlinked only one Schlieffen-Plan where there were many others <i>after</i> it, which you at first did not unlinked as well. It was for that reason that I relinked it. Especially that I see no trouble at all in linking one item many times or whenever it occurres in the one article. On the contrary, I think it is quite very useful, especially if the linked item is so strongly related to the article: Sometimes the reader at first is not really interested in that linked item, but then, as He or She goes on reading and find that item appearing again and again, they start becoming interested in it. At this moment, if the item is linked only once when it was first mentioned, the reader will have to interupt his reading in order to find it, which itself might take sometime especially if He or She is of the kind that does not make use of the search capabilities of their web-browsers (and how many those are!&#160;:-)), this applies too much to the Schlieffen-Plan. At the same time, there doesn't seem to be any <i>harm</i> in linking things afterall, especially if they were so closely related to the main topic (again such with the S. Plan!) apart from that the text will appear all in blue each time! But most of Wikipedia pages are already full of such blue text, of course, including the WWI page, so it doesn't really matter, nor that the reader will really notice it (unless He or She <i>wants</i> to notice it!).<br />
But I noticed in your response, in your "edit summary", that your were <i>upset</i> at my rv: "For your information, I unlinked it again, because there is already a link to it in a previous alinea"_ that was what you siad, and I know that this sort of response might have been caused by an assumption of yours that I was being unappreciative of your contribution, which is indeed, I assure you, the last thing I would want to do! Nothing really makes me more happy than when someone makes a constructive and useful edit - that's what the whole thing is really about, in the most practical and abstract senses of the thing that is Wikipedia. But the truth is that my rv came in misunderstanding, or in fact, no understanding at all of your edit, as I tried to explain above: That you unlinked only one item where there were still many others later-on. Here, in the first place, I must ask you to try to describe or indicate in the <i>"edit summary"</i> box what your edit is about as briefly as you may - it is always better than nothing. Because sometimes when you do this, a potential misunderstanding of your edit may be avoided. You see here now, after you wrote an explanation in your second edit, I got ya!! But generally, I noticed that also in your other contributions, you generally seldom write anything in the "edit summary" box. Of course, it is in the end always up to you, as well as what should happen with all those unlinked Schlieffen-Plan ex-links(!), but this is just an advice - it is only fortunate that in this great project, no one really has an authority over another! writing in the edit-summary box also is useful as to indicate whether the edit is made by a vandal or not; sometimes I just don't compare versions if the newer revision is being supplied with good and comprehensive edit-summary note.<br />
Sorry for the long note, but still one more thing to be mentioned here: As you have seen it was all this misunderstanding that derived me to rv your edit, and nothing else. Misunderstanding is something that is very likely to occur in our activity here and in most other online interaction among the people. This I personally believe is because the online interaction is more difficult and more demanding than the other forms of interaction which indeed always depend on more than just mere <i>language</i> all the time. So, please, I must ask you to try to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStaying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot_762d.html" title="Wikipedia:Staying cool when the editing gets hot">cool down</a>, and do not so promptly assume that whomever interferes with you in the editing of whatever detail is someone who's doing it in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">bad faith</a>. The ideal is that editors and contributors WANT to build a good article, that's the aim, and nothing really that pertains to them personally and directly. In this regard I have read a number of articles on that matter, which were really helpful for me, not only in determining how my ACTION would be, in Wikipedia, but more significantly, how my REaction <i>should</i> be. I found so many responses so far, and I am always contented that non of them can ever upset my own relationship with what I'm doing here, because I really must by enjoying it if I am to continue doing it! Here are those articles: <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikipedia:Etiquette</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a>, <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CriticismIsFeedback" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CriticismIsFeedback" rel="nofollow">Criticism is Feedback</a> , <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ForgiveAndForget" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ForgiveAndForget" rel="nofollow">Forgive &amp; Forget</a> , <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?PrincipleOfConstantRespect" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?PrincipleOfConstantRespect" rel="nofollow">Principle of Constant Respect</a>, Along with the links provided earlier, these might be of great help as to the, yes, BEST kind of social behavior in such a great project. the last 3 links are particularly intersting and I am convinced that eventually, most users of Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../s/i/s/Wikipedia%7ESister_projects_1129.html" title="Wikipedia:Sister projects">similar projects</a>, will most inevitably become so accustomed to it.<br />

<p>Counting three "World War I ERA" veterans as actual World War I veterans is shamefully dishonest. This list is not an accounting of "World War I ERA" veterans -- it is a list of Wolrd War I veterans, period. A World War I veteran is someone who serve in the armed forces during World War I, a conflict which ended with an armistice on November 11, 1918. A man who enlisted in 1919 did not serve in World War I. What's more, since he enlisted after the war was over, he did not even enlist with the intention of serving in the war. "World War I ERA" veterans do not receive a World War I pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs; no one, except a few cranks on this board, considers them to be the equivalent of World War I veterans. No other nation on this list includes "World War I ERA veterans" on their rolls; why should they be included on the U.S. list? It comes across as an embarrassing attempt to pad our numbers. If the purpose of this page is to keep an ACCURATE census of living World War I veterans worldwide -- and that's what I thought it was, anyway -- then these three men should be removed from the list permanently. If not, then heck, let's put Merlyn Krueger back up there, too. Hey, he SAID he was a World War I veteran, didn't he? 68.175.88.20 04:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've reverted your nomination of this article for speedy deletion. There are a number of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't give any reason for speedy deleting it. Please don't use the {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-reason_8c33.html" title="Template:Db-reason">delete</a>}} tag as it gives admins no information abut why you believe the article should be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You replaced the content of the article with the tag. This is not the proper procedure. You should add the tag to the top of the article, leaving the content in place. Again this makes it possible for admins to see whether the article should be deleted or not.</li>
</ul>

<li>Most importantly, I see nothing wrong with this redirect. Since you offer no explanation of why it should be deleted, I have reverted it back to its former state.</li>

The fact that an article may be written in the future isn't a good reason to delete the redirects now.

These are legitimate redirects: Johanna Booyson is mentioned in the longevity article so redirecting from <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johanna_Booyson_efa3.html" title="Johanna Booyson">Johanna Booyson</a> to that article makes perfect sense. Someone searching for "Johanna Booyson" gets redirected to the article that at least has some information about that person. When someone is ready to write a full article about Booyson they can do so simply by editing the article and replacing the Redirect (hopefully adding at least a "See also" link to the longevity article).

If a user states a date in an article, say for instance the 6th day of June and writes it like June 6 in square brackets the wikipedia software will make it appear in the format which a signed in user prefers. It knows which format the user prefers as it is set in "Date and Time" of tab their "My Preferences" page.

<dd>Wikifying dates has nothing to do with redundancy and everything to do with displaying the date properly for folks used to reading dates with a different format. The wikified date will display according to the preferences expressed by each user. For example, many Europeans would type today's date as 28 November 2006. By wikifying each and every instance of a date in an article, we ensure that users, no matter where they are from, read the date in a format friendly for them. As a result, I must ask you to not de-wikify any dates. It's disruptive. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 01:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Bart, I reverted what appeared to be typographical errors: excessive space before the 'See also' and using a lower case for the <a href="../../../e/g/g/Egg_%28biology%29.html" title="Egg (biology)">egg</a> link. If you have any question about any of these changes let me know. Thanks, <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:04, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It should be lower case, and this excessive space is necessary, since the picture should be with the correct text. Extremely sexy 13:23, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In general, a wikilink which is overriden by a link text such as this one should reflect the exact spelling of the entry. In this case the spelling in the entry is 'Egg (biology)', as all WP entries must have a capitalized first letter. The overriding link text is 'egg' which is of course lower case, as is grammatically required by the sentence. Regarding the excess space, I am not sure what you mean; when I look at the article, there appears to be excessive (and ugly) amount of space before the 'See also' section - why do you want that? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 14:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>However, I noticed that all Wikipedia links referred too in articles are in lower case (apart from names, of course, which always are capitalized), unless they are at the very beginning of a sentence, and in this particular article itself the "See also" section should be written exactly under that very picture belonging to the previous section, hence. Extremely sexy 14:30, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bart, please sign your messages, as providing just the date is confusing. Also, we use lower case if there is no text override needed (e.g. if 'egg' was a single unique article we would use it in lower case), but once an override is needed or used, we use the exact spelling (including capitalization) of the entry (copy-paste) for the actual link, and the grammatically required spelling for the overriding hyperlink text. Hence in this case we need to use 'Egg (biology)' in the hidden link as it matches the actual spelling of the entry, and 'egg' as the overriding hypertext link. Regarding the excessive spaces, you keep saying 'sexy', I am sorry but I don't see what leaving all this empty space in an article has to do with 'sex'. To me it's just ugly and unnecessary. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 14:38, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bart, I am assuming that you are doing this in good faith and not trying to disrupt, but the overall effect is still disruptive.

<p>Bart, someone inserted a libelous attack message on the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_churches.html" title="Local churches">local churches</a> talk page which includes some kind of illegal insertion to prevent further editing. When I tried to respond, the SPAM FILTER blocked me...but only for this section. Clearly, whoever planted this 'bomb' knew what they were doing. How can labeling a church as 'organized crime' be a fair discussion? How can not allowing an alternative viewpoint be fair (the sheer hypocrisy of which is astounding...the charge made below is not allowing alternative viewpoints, yet the user inserted a Trojan spam to prevent alternative viewpoints). Please forward this to a higher editor.

<p>I deleted two trivia pieces in the John Kerry article, because they can already be found in the Personal Life section and it seems silly to put them in trivia when they are already in the main body of the article. I am fairly sure that it is Wikipedia policy to cut down on Trivia sections as much as possible and to work it into the actual article, so I am very unsure as to why you reverted it.

<dd>Well, first I checked this, but could not find a reference at all to his height apart from the one in that particular section, and the other statement, i.e. the one about his fondness for icehockey, isn't explained that clearly at all. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Extremely sexy</a> 17:53, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So how many times does his height need to be mentioned for it to be taken out of the trivia section? How many times does it need to be mentioned that he likes ice hockey? Is he an avid ice hockey fan, but not an avid windsurfing fan? Is there any evidence for that? If not, why repeat ice hockey? I think it looks very bad and disjointed for an article to repeat itself this way, and I cannot imagine a print encyclopedia doing the same. Pick one place such information belongs, and remove repetition. Mullibok 21:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, I agree, but I wrote (read it again, please) that I can't find his height mentioned somewhere else in the article, and, concerning his love for ice hockey, that's not really stated that obviously in my honest opinion, hence revert. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Extremely sexy</a> 23:09, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I did read it, and I still don't see why you think his height needs to keep being mentioned. It's in personal life; how many other sections should it be in before it can be un-trivialized? And Personal Life also states he enjoy ice hockey, so how is it unclear that he is a fan? I've seen you say it, but I don't really see an explanation. Here's what I would like to see: 1) why his height needs to be mentioned multiple times 2) how does stating that he enjoys ice hockey not clearly indicate he is a fan?Mullibok 15:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I strongly encourage you to re-think your selected course of action. As several experienced editors have pointed out, it is bad form to correct others' errors in talk comments. Unlike articles, in which editors are encouraged to make corrections, talkpages are signed and owned by the poster, and are not subject to publication or correction. Continued defiance and reverting after experienced editors have expressed disapproval only serves to show your willingness to disregard our norms and is generally disruptive. Even if it's not against <i>policy</i>, it is considered generally unacceptable; re-instituting the same changes twice after being asked to stop by multiple editors doesn't accomplish anything. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 02:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. Just noticed you undid my removal of the semiprotected tag to John Kerry. The reason that I removed the tag is because the page <i>isn't</i> semi-protected: I assumed that tagging it would protect it, but of course it doesn't (try logging out and editing the page). The page needs to be protected by an administrator and then tagged as such. In the meanwhile though, the tag does seem to deter vandals!

<p>Frankly, I believe both constructions are incorrect. I would have said "When he died at the age of 115 years and five months, ...".

<dd>Ah, I see. My apologies. In that case, I've seen it both ways, so, I won't argue there. By the way, the comma is not required after the word "died" in the article sentence.

<dd>I don't know if it's "wrong" per se. My writing handbook states that "although commas should be used with distinctly parenthetical expressions, do not use them to set off elements that are only mildly parenthetical." In my opinion, the age is only mildly parenthetical and the first comma disrupts the flow of the sentence. But I'm not going to argue extensively over this. —<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGintar77_15e1.html" title="User:Gintar77">Gintar77</a> 16:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But you would still leave a comma? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Extremely sexy</a> 17:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I had to go to work for a while. Yes, the second comma (after "months") is required, because you're setting off an adverbial phrase at the beginning of a sentence (note that a comma is not required if it comes at the end. Ex.: When I was learning to ride bike, I fell off a lot. Compared to: <i>But</i> I fell off my bike a lot when I was learning to ride it.) —<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGintar77_15e1.html" title="User:Gintar77">Gintar77</a> 22:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wouldn't it be more appropriate to simply leave it as uppercase? Since it's something that's only visible when editing the page, I would think that making the link work for everyone would be much better than having it only work for some (1/3, going by this conversation) because of some invisible-to-readers stylistic concern.

<dd>Ok, I just tried it in Internet Explorer, and that seems to be the difference -- usually I use Firefox, and it doesn't work there, but in IE it does.

<dd>Actually, the link in the article still doesn't work for me in Firefox -- since I proved that simply capitalizing it works in <i>both</i> browsers, isn't that the best choice? Your question of which browser is used more is irrelevant, I think, if there is a solution that works correctly in every browser, which I assume you agree with, since you implemented the underscore suggestion. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 15:52, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Lower case #сurrent_status does not work in Firefox 2.0.0.3 (and probably others)&#160;! But Microsoft IE (in it's 6.0 version on my PC) is highly tolerant to errors and will accept any. If you will look in HTML for target page - you will see anchor with name="Current_status" used. Whitespaces will be replaced to _ automatically by Wiki software. But capitalization will not be changed. So it's clear for me that uppercase C must be used and Bart_Versieck has violated 3RR by reverting without finishing discussion. --<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETAG.Odessa_b6cd.html" title="User:TAG.Odessa">TAG</a> 16:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have Firefox 1.5.0.11, and I get the same results as TAG did with Firefox 2 -- only the first two work. I don't think you actually do see TAG's point, or mine... it's not "wait for an admin to reply and do as he or she says" (which isn't even the answer, in this case -- Clown's suggestion doesn't actually work without the capitals.) The point is to <i>not</i> keep reverting an edit without discussing with the other editor <i>why</i> you're having a conflict and coming to a resolution. In this case, I'm still unclear on exactly why you kept reverting it, since we all were agreed, even at the beginning of this process, that the link with the capital letters worked -- is there any reason at all to do it the other way? <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 17:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're again missing the point, Bart. Even if what Postoak wrote was incorrectly spelled or ungrammatical, you should <b>not</b> edit his comment. Read the <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">talk page guidelines</a> again, please, especially the section on editing comments. Notice the two statements "It is not necessary to bring talk pages to publishing standards, so there is no need to correct typing errors, grammar, etc." and "Editing others' comments is generally not allowed." Therefore, it is both <i>unnecessary</i> and <i>inappropriate</i> to change other users' posts on talk pages for spelling or grammar errors. Also, in this particular case, you were actually changing the meaning of Postoak's statement: your version of the sentence, "I noticed that I should have reverted several versions prior to eliminating the vandalism", while perfectly grammatical, is <i>not</i> what Postoak was trying to say with his original statement. He did make two typos, but his intended statement was "I noticed that I should have reverted several versions prior to eliminate the vandalism." That <i>would</i> be ungrammatical if he were using the phrase "prior to"; however, in this case, those two words just happen to be next to each other. The intended meaning is the same as "I should have reverted to a version that was several versions before the current version in order to eliminate the vandalism." Does this make sense to you? And do you understand all three of the reasons that you should not change other user's comments? Looking back at your edit history, I see several places where you've done this. As I said before, it's always inappropriate, and more than once you have (inadvertently, I hope) not just violated policy but also changed the meaning of the comment in the process. You do some very good work here at the English Wikipedia, especially in keeping up with all the pages on supercentenarians, and I want to help you continue that by making sure you're clear on policy. Looking at your talk page (which you might want to <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EARCHIVE_af20.html" title="WP:ARCHIVE">archive</a> some time, as it's getting rather long), I see that you've gotten into several arguments that appear to have arisen from misunderstandings, either of other users' meaning or of policy. I suspect this is largely a language thing -- your English is good, but it looks like sometimes you're not quite clear on some things. If you're ever not completely sure of the meaning of something, please be careful about editing it -- just ask on the article's talk page before making the change, or check with another user. Personally, I'm always happy to help, and I'm sure most other users would be as well. Sorry for the length of this comment, but I wanted to make sure I got my point across, and also to be clear that I mean this as constructive criticism to assist you in becoming an even better editor, which I'm sure you can be. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 16:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bart, I'm disappointed you deleted the 115+ list from the "oldest people" page. Even if someone makes a long list elsewhere, the 115+ list belongs on this page.</p>
<p>What is your problem? Why do you insist on un-capitalizing everything? You are wrong most of the time; most people simply don't want to bother with you so they let you have your way.

<dd>Is this a threat? =&gt; well, for your information, you are not an moderator (luckily, God is still around), and I did not delete it (please, do check your facts first), plus decapitalization is the policy over here, so, please, stop making such ridiculous accusations, and if you don't like it, just quit editing (for the better of "Wikipedia" as well). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Extremely sexy</a> 14:34, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you did not delete it, then why do you keep reverting to the deleted version? Second, I live in the USA and 'decapitalization' is NOT the policy in America. Third, I 'threaten' only in terms of what is legal to do. You don't give me credit when I find Jennie Newhouse's death date or Earnest MacPherson, 108, but you choose to criticize all the time. I can withhold information that you want, if you want to play dirty. Also, I only play 'hardball' when others throw things at me.

<dd>That isn't necessary at all since you are already giving yourself credit all the time, and, by the way you have just been warned at your own talk page (all too rightly) for your series of uncivilized manners towards a lot of fellow editors (next time you will be blocked again), several users at the yahoo group about supercentenarians and the oldest people (like Jeff Knight f.e.) are having exactly the same problems with you as I'm having right now and right here, etc., so, I'm quite sure you get the picture, and I did revert it since the discussion about it is still going on. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Extremely sexy</a> 22:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment on capitalization</b>: the two of you have had several arguments about capitalization, and I think all the problems can be worked out by reading <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSCAP_4527.html" title="WP:MOSCAP">the capitalization section of the manual of style</a>. Ryoung, you're of course right that the standard style for headlines in English is to capitalize all significant words. Reading <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSCAP_4527.html" title="WP:MOSCAP">the guidelines</a>, though, Bart is right about article titles and section headings on the Wikipedia: they should have only the first letter capitalized unless they would have other words capitalized within a normal sentence (as with the title of a book, for example.) However, Bart, this does <i>not</i> mean that words in wikilinks need to be decapitalized -- as we discussed earlier, links need to <i>exactly</i> match the title capitalization of the article (including capitalization of a target section if the link includes one) to be sure that they work correctly. Also, since <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">the guidelines for talk pages</a> state that they do not need to be brought up to publishing standards, there's no need to alter section titles to match the standard capitalization style, and since (as I discussed with you before) editing other users' comments is discouraged, edits such as this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Richard_Nixon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118037070" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Richard_Nixon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118037070" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> are therefore unnecessary and inappropriate. I hope this clarifies things for both of you -- please, when discussing a style or policy matter, try to reference the appropriate page that you're using as the basis for your edits; generalizations such as "decapitalization is the policy over here", without a link to the policy in question, serve only to confuse and frustrate others. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 14:18, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm making a new section here to be sure you see this. Over a month ago you said, in response to complaints by users Triona and Blaxthos about your editing of other users' comments on talk pages: "Point taken, so I honestly won't anymore." However, you continued to do so, eventually causing user Postoak to complain here. You did not appear to be understanding his point, so I tried, two days ago, to make it clear, and after the discussion we had, you said, "Right: now it is clear, and thank you for your very constructive criticism indeed." I assumed from this that you understood that you should not edit comments made by other people on talk pages, but then you did exactly that three times in the next day, as shown in these diffs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118112988" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118112988" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118110785" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118110785" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118072582" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118072582" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. I left you another message yesterday explaining again, as clearly as I know how, that <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a> <i>prohibits</i> this, but since then you've edited the comments of others <i>four more times</i>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Drinking_game&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118554922" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Drinking_game&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118554922" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_the_oldest_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118524057" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_the_oldest_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118524057" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Oldest_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118523340" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Oldest_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118523340" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118516284" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118516284" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>Your repeated assurances that you won't violate the talk page guidelines again, followed almost immediately by multiple violations of those guidelines each time, lead me to two possible conclusions: either your understanding of English is much worse than I thought and you do not understand the rules listed at <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a> or my (and other users') explanations of them, or you are simply telling users who complain about your behavior that you understand and will follow the rules, and then deliberately break those rules. I hope that it's the former, but the number of times this has happened, not just with the guidelines for talk page editing, but also with other Wikipedia policies, is beginning to make me think that it's the latter. I'm not giving up hope yet, though, and so I'm going to state this again, as clearly as possible:</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a>, which lists the guidelines for use of talk pages on the Wikipedia, makes the following important points:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Editing others' comments is generally not allowed.</b></li>
<li><b>Never</b> edit someone's words to change their meaning.</li>
<li>It is <b>not</b> necessary to bring talk pages to publishing standards, so there is no need to correct typing errors, grammar, etc.</li>
<li>There are exceptions, but <b>only</b> in the cases of removal of prohibited material, formatting errors, addition of the unsigned tag, and placing brief comments within a long post instead of at the end if necessary to more clearly respond.</li>
<li>You may edit another user's comments if you have permission of the <b>user who left the comment</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify a few of the points made by the guideline, please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Formatting errors" refers to spacing and markup issues only, <i>not</i> grammar, spelling, or punctuation; even spacing and markup changes should only be made when absolutely necessary for readability.</li>
<li>Permission means permission of the commenter, <i>not</i> permission of the user whose talk page the comment appears on.</li>
<li>The fact that it says it is not <i>necessary</i> to correct spelling and grammar errors in comments is <i>not</i> meant to imply that it is allowed, just to clarify that such cases are <i>not</i> exceptions to the general rule that editing others' comments is not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up: I'm concerned that you may be deliberately refusing to follow Wikipedia policies and guidelines, especially those described at <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a>. The general rule that you should follow is <b>never</b> edit a comment left by another user for any reason. If there is something about this, or any other policy, that you do not understand, please ask me or someone else to explain it to you. I'd like to see a reply from you that indicates that you completely understand what I've written here and will <b>not</b> edit other users' comments again. I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible, since I know many of your edits are constructive, and I realize there may be a language barrier involved, but if you continue to ignore policies, guidelines, and the concerns of your fellow Wikipedians, someone will eventually move to stop your disruptive behavior. Please help me help you become a better editor before it comes to that. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 20:09, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did obey though by not reverting once more that comment made about the merger (I suppose you know what I mean), but it's very difficult indeed for me not to correct spelling mistakes, or other errors for that matter, made by others in talk pages, so I understand completely what you are complaining about to me and I honestly didn't do it deliberately: it's an obsession of some sort, and I was really convinced that it was allowed, since several other users told me, hence, plus it is my humble opinion that "it is not necessary" doesn't actually mean "it's forbidden", or does it? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Extremely sexy</a> 00:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you actually have <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder.html" title="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, I understand how something like this could be very difficult, as I have it too. Unfortunately, saying that that's why you do it doesn't make it any less likely that some user is going to get angry with your repeated violations of the guidelines and attempt to have you banned. No, "it is not necessary" is not equivalent to "it's forbidden", in general. In this particular case, though, I think the intent really is to clarify that you shouldn't use that as an exception to the rule, especially since grammar and spelling corrections are not in the list of exceptions following the line "Editing others' comments is generally not allowed." While some users may have told you it's OK, obviously many feel it isn't, and so you need to go by the more restrictive interpretation to be sure to avoid conflict -- as it says in the sentence following the 'is not necessary' one, and as you've no doubt observed from the repeated complaints from other editors, "It tends to irritate the users whose comments you are correcting." In addition, the next line says, "Never edit someone's words to change their meaning." Since (as you saw in the discussion about your edit to Postoak's comment) it's very easy to inadvertently change the meaning of someone's words when you only intend to fix their grammar, this is another reason to avoid making even minor changes to other users' posts. Finally, beyond any argument about the exact intent of/guideline status of <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a>, edit wars based on this are likely to result in you violating the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert rule</a>, which is official policy and generally taken very seriously -- as it says, "The rule does not convey an entitlement to revert three times each day, nor does it endorse reverting as an editing technique; rather, the rule is an "electric fence". Editors may still be blocked <i>even if they have not made more than three edits in any given 24 hour period</i>, if their behavior is clearly disruptive." As I said, I can see why this might be hard, but it's <i>really</i> important that you stop -- if you keep doing it, at some point a less-patient editor will come along and report you for violating guidelines, and your history of continuing to do so despite repeated warnings is likely to look like willful disobedience to an admin considering a block. I hope this helps you understand how important this is, and if you seriously have OCD, a psychiatrist or behavior modification therapist can really help. I also highly recommend this book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Lock-Yourself-Obsessive-Compulsive-Behavior/dp/0060987111/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6419583-7369527?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1175182484&amp;sr=8-1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Lock-Yourself-Obsessive-Compulsive-Behavior/dp/0060987111/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6419583-7369527?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1175182484&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> -- the method described in it is very helpful in learning to deal with compulsions. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 15:58, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
