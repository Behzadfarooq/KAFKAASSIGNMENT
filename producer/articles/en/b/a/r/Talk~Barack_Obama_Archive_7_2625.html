<dd>Unless you can come forward with some non-trivial and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources that show any notable controversies or <i>personal</i> criticisms, there doesn't need to be a "criticisms" section. We have what his stances are on many of the issues - those link to sites where there is a discussion of the arguments for and against them.

<dd>He's not given a "free ride" anywhere. He's been slandered by Insight Magazine and Fox News. CNN and MSNBC have done little Obama-Osama hit jobs on him. All this for a guy who's not been in one notable controversy. Obama did not commit any wrongdoing in the Rezko matter, and the event is simply not relevant to his notability. We're not going to create a criticisms section just because other people have one, or just because one editor thinks the absence of one is "unfair". Something actually has to happen that warrants us making an entire criticisms section. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 09:40, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I seriously question the relevance of this, unless it can be proved that CNN etc. did it intentionally.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 22:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Intent may never be found, and, in-fact may not have been intentional, but the relevancy lies in the reality of a political race, how media on one or both sides of a perceived political aisle can subtly paint a picture one way or another to bias or promote a candidate. The NY Post is not known for it lack of political bias, just as the NY Times has been accused of being left, and the Washington Times to the right. Voters will decide on a candidate for a variety of reasons from actual abilities and experiences to the low and dirty aspects of race, religion, color, etc. While the latter is an unfortunate truth, they are factors; and the factors that are used are always relevant to a balanced story. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudae1_994a.html" title="User:Judae1">Juda S. Engelmayer</a> 23:00, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know the Post is a right-wing paper. The problem is, there are no reliable sources proving either intentional or unconscious bias as the cause of the "Osama" errors. As such, I don't think this type of thing belongs in an encyclopedia article.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 23:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I said, it does not have to be intentional. The fact that it was printed in a public forum now makes it relevant, as people within the general population will incorporate these messages into their minds, and find truths where they deem it convenient. Obama's race for the White House will, at some point, be reflective of what the media presented - truth, lies, intent, accidental, etc. I believe that popular media coverage that can and will impact some aspect of his future is totally relevant to an encyclopedic piece that defines the person, his life and his challenges.</dd>

<dd>This is hardly extrapolation, it is fact, and a very important fact. This is not some random sourced ad rag, it is from CNN, the AP and the New York Post.

<dd>As long as it meets RS and is notable, then it should merit inclusion. So far the only bit in the article that meets Wikipedia's standards is CNN's screw up as it is supported by an AP article to support the criticism. The NY Post is original research supported by a blog at this point, so shouldn't be included until a reliable source can be found that is critical of the NY Post article. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 23:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I meant the "Earlier, on January 20, 2007, the New York Post received some criticism for running a potentially misleading headline, "Osama' Mud Flies at Obama", for a story that discussed rumors that Sen. Obama had been raised as a Muslim and concealed it. The story itself never mentioned the Saudi terrorist, and the rumor is false." portion. A blog criticizing the Post for the article's title does not qualify as a reliable source for saying the post was criticized for the article's title. <s>I'm going to delete that sentence, but you can find a reliable source criticizing the article's title.</s> --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 00:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maureen Dowd writes about a lot of things in her opinion column, in a rather sharp, witty style. She does not write straight news articles. There has been minimal coverage of this as actual news, and one of the things we are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> anyway is a newspaper.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 00:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It seems like even if we were to exclude the Dowd column, the AP and CNN are still reliable (and wide-spread) sources that reported this as a news story (as are CBS News, Salon.com, the CBC, etc.) (Though Dowd is a reliable source in any event regardless of her style or focus, and should not be excluded). If you run a search for this, it was apparently covered in places like Israel and Kenya - I'd say that's pretty widespread coverage. We're not a newspaper, but that doesn't mean that we cannot include facts from newspapers so long as they otherwise meet our criteria. With coverage this wide-spread and with an issue that so far seems to have a long shelf-life, this does not strike me as "news." --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 01:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>CNN apologizing for its own typo does not count as a news story. Many newspapers reprint short, quirky AP stories like this; that is not a sign of global importance. Now I ask you, does that AP story seriously allege that the typo was due to CNN bias?--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 01:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>CNN reporting on its own mistake is a news story. (If they had apologized in a personal letter, that would not be a news story.) Worldwide reprinting is significant - this isn't a story about a <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladys_the_Swiss_Dairy_Cow_8ce7.html" title="Gladys the Swiss Dairy Cow">painted cow</a> that small papers picked up off the wire to fill the human interest section. It's a (I think) relatively significant, if minor, event in the career of a politician picked up by multiple reliable sources...</dd>
<dd>Which brings me to your last sentence, and helps me for the first time understand this dispute, I think. CNN bias? I don't see anything about the inclusion of these facts that seeks to, or does, demonstrate CNN bias. The reason I support the inclusion of this fact is because it happened, it was widely picked up by the press, and it's widely known about by the public (which is to say I asked three people randomly and they all knew what I was talking about...ok, not scientific). I don't think this event proves anything, nor do I think that the person wanted to include it to prove anything. I just think it happened and was deemed significant by the press, and therefore should be included. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 03:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It was a trivial but embarrassing mistake, and it would have been irresponsible of CNN not to publicly apologize. That doesn't make it notable.

<dd>And he's probably wrong about that. But to my mind the fact that so many reliable sources thought it was significant makes it significant. I don't know (or want to know) what the facts mean here - whether it represents media bias, etc. To me, the fact that a more primary source than us decided the event was significant means that it's more than just trivia. But I think we're <a href="../../../b/d/h/WP%7EBDH_c29e.html" title="WP:BDH">beating some sort of deceased equine</a> here - my view is that there are a lot of sources, and widespread coverage. You're looking at the same stuff and seeing limited sources, and minimal coverage. That happens sometimes, and doesn't necessarily mean either of us is wrong - but I don't really see a way to bridge that gap and reach consensus. (Which is fine - I think adding this fact makes the article better, but I don't think the article will be significantly incomplete without it.) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 05:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The madrassa "scandal"/"slander", "He's not black enough" complaints from the African-American community, and Howard comments can be worked into the 2008 Presidential election section/article as that seems to be the cause of those issues. As for the "first African American" comment in the lead, take a stroll through the archives. It's been brought up over and over again. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 20:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your comments tend to be just a colossal waste of my time.

<dd>I pointed you towards the controversy section on Bill O'Reilly's page to show you what happens when a controversy section is included in an article and all the trivial crap that ends up in that section. I thought I was being clear about that, but apparently I was not. The only thing in that section that is even remotely encyclopedic is the Al Franken lawsuit and that can easily be worked into either the broadcasting career section, the O'Reilly Factor section of the article, or change the title of the Sexual Harassment lawsuits section to Lawsuits and work it in there. None of the controversies that you've brought up so far can't be worked into the existing prose of this article. I haven't looked into if reliable sources have been found regarding the controversies, but if there are reliable sources, then I can't think of a reason why they shouldn't be worked into this article, just not under a "Controversy" section. The fact that they are controversies should be self-evident without the need to label them as such. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 19:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As this article is a <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_f54b.html" title="WP:Biographies of living persons">biography of a living person</a> we need to use caution when adding controversial statements to the article so my suggestion would be for you to write up a user page for a Barack Obama controversies article similar to <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_controversies_9e16.html" title="Hillary Rodham Clinton controversies">Hillary Rodham Clinton controversies</a> that meets <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a> and tag it with the userpage tag until it is completed before we add a controversy section to this article. I agree with <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> that criticism and controversy sections are generally unnecessary and can be worked into the article and when dealing with a living person it can cause unnecessary trouble for Wikipedia yet I recognize that there is a desire in respect to public figures to focus on controversies as this allows people to get on their soapboxes. I have the same problem with this as I do with those who seek to get on soapboxes in favor of living people as well.</dd>

<dd>There is absolutely no place in a biographical article for listing opinions that contradict OTHERS religions as there is no opinion held by Obama that contradicts HIS religion as religion is a personal belief set. This would be like saying that his opinions contradict his opinions.

<li>Calling troop deaths "wasted lives".</li>

<dd>It's not what you think fits in a controversy section that matters or whether a section is warranted because you think that this information cannot fit elsewhere because it can. It seems to me that you simply want to give undue weight (i.e., by prominence) to controversies by creating a section that gives greater weight to the differences of opinions surounding Obama. Also, the ACTUAL <b>controversy</b> must be mentioned in a <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">reliable</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verifiable</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> source. For example, the article "<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/02/04/obamas_race_dilemma/" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/02/04/obamas_race_dilemma/" rel="nofollow">Obama's race dilemma</a>" in the Boston Globe refers to his race as being a dilemma but does not refer to it as being controversial but does refer to Biden's comments as a controversy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This source among others can be fitted into the article text fairly easily. The problem I see with what you suggest is that it requires a "POV" determination of what is and is not controversial and the section then becomes a dumping ground for editors who troll the internet and find a news article about Obama that they then add to the controversy section. Creating a new section simply because editors do not want to write a holistic article concerns me. If you can cite a source that actually labels any of these things as a controversy than you should as a part of the article cite those sources but it is original research to decide that a news article that reports person A believes Obama is not African-American while person B believes that he is and it gives the information undue weight in the article. Also, unless the article refers to it as a controversy it is original research to label it a controversy. This also goes to your point about Obama's opinions being contradicted by his religion. That is original research unless an actual source says "Barack Obama holds opinion A, and his religion teaches B and Paster C says that opinion A conflicts with B while Paster D disagrees. This has resulted in a controversy over whether Barack Obama's opinion on A conflicts with teaching B of his denomination." <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 00:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I formatted your list, Ernham. A serious consideration is that for both the "wasted" incident and the real estate deal, <i>Obama publicly acknowledged the "controversy" and apologized.</i> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0702130131feb13,0,3537685.story" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0702130131feb13,0,3537685.story" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/213786,CST-NWS-obama17.article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/213786,CST-NWS-obama17.article" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> These are just two citations, one for each, but they're reliable sources (the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times), verifiable, and neutral (both are reports, not columns or opinions). I'm sure we can find other articles on these two issues, but I'm willing to back you up on these two at least. And while we may not need to create a "controversy" section, they could easily be incorporated in the main article during the relevant portions of his career. --Zz414 02:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with ZZ414, the "wasted" and real estate incidents should be included. I also think the madrassa "story" should be included. There should definitely be a criticism section. Any subject that has been criticized should have one. 71.198.52.89 06:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

These are some major "hot-button" issues, too, including things like abortion rights, gun control/enforcement, etc. bhttp://news.yahoo.com/s/realclearpolitics/20070213/cm_rcp/the_everpresent_obama</dd>

<p>Why are so many editors so reluctent to make Obama look bad in any way. Many politicians have an extensive criticism/controversies section i.e Hillary Clinton and George Bush etc. It is unfair to them for Obama to be exempt. Many people have brought up valid criticism's/controversies that should be included.

<dd>You know, saying this over and over again doesn't make your argument more valid, nor does it produce any sort of actionable sources that could be used to meaningfully discuss the article.

<dd>You're also failing to show why a criticism/controversy section itself is required in order to include "negative" things about Obama. You and the others trying to get a criticism section seem to be overly fixated on the belief that unless there is a criticism/controversy section then criticisms/controversies can not be included in the article. That simply isn't the case. Come up with some reliable sources to back up your claims of notability for the controversies/criticisms and work them into the article, just not into a section called "Criticisms" or "Controversies".--<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 20:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bobblehead - I can speak from experience that there are a few "Hawks" out there watching this page and removing anything critical, followed by a discussion of other supporters, and thus the input is removed and "voted" to not be allowed. For instance, the issues of cocaine use to which he admitted is a felony crime. This has been discussed a LOT on the talk page, but gets almost no mention in the article. This is a HUGE issue for a Presidential Candidate, as one who openly admits to a felony. A Criticisms / controversies section would give an appropriate place to place facts, cited of course, and get them out of the reach of the criticism hawks!

<dd>Eisenmond, how would having a criticism section stop the "hawks" from "removing anything critical"? If they can remove it from the existing prose of the article, then they can just as easily remove it from a criticism section. If anything, it would make it easier for them to remove because now all they have to do is look in the criticism section. Wikipedia has a content dispute resolution process.

<p>Hello folks, Im one of the regular mediators. I anticipate much more discussion on this article, and as such I want to try an experiment for a high-traffic controversial topic talk page, (this seems to qualify). <i>The idea is to organize the talk page according to a topic-based system,</i> archiving the discussion in a topical way, rather than just in a linear way.</p>
<p>The first thing to do would be to work out a system for doing this. The basic system would be a topical list at the top, which link to subpages titled after the major issues relevant to this article. There are of course some potential problems with people editing other peoples comments - the important rule must be to be principled and consistent - making linkages to specific archive sections.</p>
<p>Im curious how this sounds to people.

<dd>I generally like the idea. Is there any <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedent</a> for this on an article talk page, though? I've seen topical archiving on user talk pages, but I don't know that I have on an article talk page. I ask for two reasons: (1) perhaps talk page guidelines/help pages have something to say on point and (2) if this has been done before, the preexisting organization could possibly be a guide for this page. I know of nothing that would prevent such organization. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 14:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That of course wouldnt be the way to go here - all comments should be viewable on the main talk. Nor should the standard archiving method be replaced: We can have some plain redundancy, and that should satisfy those who are afraid their comments would get mangled. We need to of course identify the main threads of conversation for this article.

Well, this seems well-intentioned, and could be useful, but my initial reaction is that we have enough to do to keep the article itself organized and I for one don't relish having to think about where and how I post my comments on Talk. But I'm certainly interested in listening to how it would work, and who would maintain it. If I understand you correctly - having read this very quickly - this would take talk page comments and categorize them but leave them in place as well?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Can someone please give the source for this information? I question whether he made such a statement on MSNBC and the context it was made in if he did do so. Often statements can be taken out of context or outright fabricated. I found one reference on ABC that said that Obama admitted to using cocaine and marijuanna as a teenager. This statement was not correct as he has explicitly denied using cocaine and has clearly stated that he "only" considered using cocaine and I do not recall if they did a retraction. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 20:28, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not correct at all. He admits to smoking marijuana and "doing some blow when I could afford it" (paraphrased, as I don't have the book in front of me) in <i>Dreams from My Father</i>. The interview in 60 Minutes on Sunday quoted him directly from his book, when the interviewer asked whether he thought it would be an issue in his campaign.

<p>I changed the word "conversely" to "on the other hand", exact same meaning but I liked the sound better.

<p>I see that "conversely" has been put back. The sentence just before the one about Crouch's statement reads: "Another article in The Nation analyzed Obama's ability to "transcend race" with white audiences." I am not sure if what Crouch said is exactly "converse" to this. On the other hand, it is a "contrary opinion". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 07:22, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you haven't convinced me. To my New York ears, "contrarily" is absurd and never used; "conversely" is common usage. I am with <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> on this one. We also could try the simple "However" to indicate that Crouch's statement takes a different point of view from the "everyman" quote. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 04:14, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, "Conversely" is in <i>extremely</i> common usage, especially in formal contexts (like encyclopedias and other academic works). It is also, however, quite common in colloquial contexts. "Conversely" gets <b>26,500,000 hits</b> on Google; "Contrarily" gets <b>841,000</b> hits on Google. There is clearly no grounds whatsoever for favoring the latter over the former on grounds of common usage. If anything, the opposite is the case (by more than thirtyfold!).</dd>
<dd>Besides, "Contrarily" is actually being <i>misused</i> in this context. "Conversely" was being used correctly in the original sentence. Conversely, "Contrarily" is being used in a way that misunderstands the word's common meaning. "Contrarily" means either "in a contrary disobedient manner" or, less commonly, "contrary to expectations"; it almost <i>never</i> means "on the other hand" or "conversely" in common speech. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 05:34, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Incidentally (oh, sorry, is that another word that "regular people" supposedly never use? damned adverbs!), the best option that's been proposed so far seems to be simply using "On the other hand". It resolves most of the issues that have been brought up above, its only disadvantages being that (1) it's less concise than "Conversely" (though since this was argued to be an <i>advantage</i> above, it's not really significant), and (2) it's <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idiomatic</a>. Numerous style guides, especially for formal writing (e.g., encyclopedic writing), strongly discourage relying on idioms when normal words (like "conversely") are available in their stead. However, since "on the other hand" is such a <i>common</i> idiom, I don't see this as a major issue; if others agree that this isn't a serious cause for concern, then I don't see any reason not to just use "on the other hand". In most situations, however, "conversely" is indeed perfectly acceptable wherever its meaning is appropriate to the context; the idea that it is more opaque or arcane than words like "contrarily" is pure nonsense. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 05:46, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "popular culture" section is mostly political commentary. Nothing wrong with political commentary on a presidential candidate, but it should be labelled as such.

But NYT (Brooks), Daily News (Crouch), and WSJ (Noonan) columnists, along with his own book, can hardly be considered "pop culture" references. Can we move those into a different section?

<p>Wikipedia's fair use policy is quite clear. In the event that free use images exist, they are always preferred over fair use images. We have not been able to confirm what parts of Obama's website are covered under CC, and, based on their Flickr photostream, it would not be compatible with Wikipedia anyway (they are presently released using the NC clause). I'm very sad my pictures from the Austin rally didn't come out very well so I can't contribute&#160;:( —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 18:15, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>So If the problem is getting the images as free use... is there anyone in here who works on the campaign? Or does someone want to contact the campaign? All the new candidates seems to be falling over themselves to be internet friendly I wouldn't be surprised if they would release the campaign images with a license that works here. After all it can't hurt.

<p>We should strive to obtain some free example of the campaign material and the non-free images don’t seem particularly original or important. However, I don’t understand why the <i>Time</i> cover was removed; to appear on the cover of <i>Time</i> is definitely significant. Additionally, the image was doing a good job of representing the press coverage as a whole (again due to the magazine’s cover’s importance) and I don’t see from where a free replacement could come that would be similarly representative. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 11:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, so we're fascist tyrant Obama volunteers. We get the message. Now could you actually talk about the issues rather than engaging in attacks upon everyone else? I've seen you bring up two so far; smoking and whether or not he is Muslim. The second is addressed in the article rather clearly, and the first has been determined by a consensus of editors to not be notable enough to be in a featured article. You have previously stated that you believe that anyone coming to an encyclopedia to read about Mr. Obama will want to know whether he smokes; I disagree, and feel that people looking for that sort of information would be better served by The Inquirer. Oops, does that make me Hitler? We're building an encyclopedia here, not a tabloid chronicling every little fact about Obama (either positive or negative). The most notable facts and events in his life are included, and if you want to read more, you can follow our links and sources; as tertiary sources, that's what encyclopedias are supposed to do. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 23:54, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But Wikipedia is not attempting to "report" anything; it's an encyclopedia. (<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addendum.html" title="Addendum">Add.</a>: See <a href="../../../r/e/c/WP%7ERECENT_2836.html" title="WP:RECENT">WP:RECENT</a>.) HRC has been in the public's eye for much longer, and has accumulated many more controversies in that amount of time than has Mr. Obama. Just because HRC has had a lot of controversies does not mean that we should manufacture "controversies" that aren't controversies at all for a political opponent of hers. I also think you're overestimating Wikipedia's role in the 2008 primary&#160;:) —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#555">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><font color="#2C9191" size="3">✍</font></a> 00:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, and again, this argument comes up - "X has a section like this, why not Y" - as if the Encyclopedia is somehow bound to include every factoid and attempted smear campaign equally. This is simply not the case - not all controversies are created equal, and the simple fact is that Mr Obama has not been a party to any which are particularly notable outside of his campaign; which there is a separate page for. Comparing something like "Whitewater" to what is essentially a semantic argument over whether Mr Obama is "black" is ridiculous in the extreme. The difference should be self-evident.

Less than two months after ascending to the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama bought more than $50,000 worth of stock in two speculative companies whose major investors included some of his biggest political donors, the NYT will splash on Wednesday Page Ones.</p>
<p>The paper claims, according to newsroom sources: One of the companies was a biotech concern that was starting to develop a drug to treat avian flu. In March 2005, two weeks after buying about $5,000 of its shares, Obama took the lead in a legislative push for more federal spending to battle the disease.</p>
<p>The paper's Mike McIntire and Chris Drew get front placement [side by side with Libby Coverage] for details of Obama's most recent financial disclosure:</p>
<p>It shows that he bought more than $50,000 in stock in a satellite communications business whose principal backers include four friends and donors who had raised more than $150,000 for his political committees.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Obama says the senator did not know that he had invested in either company.</p>

<p>As this story develops, its just might, might merit mention along with the Tony Rezko deal. Obama could kill someone and you libs wouldn't mention it, because it's not "relevent" or "npov". What part of "all sum of human knowledge" don't you administrators on a power trip understand. Because you power abusers think it's trivial doesn't make it so, notability is subjective. It's hilarious how glossed over he is, no negative mentions of him at all, and yet it's featured, that's the plutocracy wikipedia for you. Wikitruth is right.

<dd>There was no wrongdoing by Obama in the Rezko matter. It would be pointless to put it in his article. As far as this "controversy" goes, Obama apparently did not know he owned the stocks until several months after they were purchased. When he learned of them, he immediately sold them to avoid any perceived conflict of interest (he sold them for a net loss of 13,000). This doesn't seem to be much of a scandal or controversy at all.</dd>

<dd>Agree completely with sprot - this is a chronic problem on this article, and it's time that this page get long-term semi-protection, like many others have. This is an embarrassment and only goes to further make Wikipedia look amateuristic and unreliable. I would hope that the regular editors here who have objected in the past will get the message that this is not going to stop in the foreseeable future, despite everyone's hope that it will, and that far greater damage is done by allowing this vicious vandalism than by restricting edits to people who take the 2 minutes it takes to register (as anonymously as they like). I have said this repeatedly - see the archives - and others have agreed. To those who are against sprot: we tried it your way, over and over and over, each time with the hope that this time would be different, but it isn't.

<p>Obama is more correctly referred to as an African-African-American. Contemporary use of the term African-American refers to those Americans of African descent that trace their heritage to the black experience in America before the 20th century. Being that neither his maternal, nor his paternal heritage can claim such an experience, makes calling him African-American extreme disinformation. - JC</p>
<p>He's African and he's American, thus he's African American. 23:30 February 21, 200 - Fentoro</p>
<p>My God this is a stupid title. Most African Americans have some White ancestry and 1 out of 6 White Americans have some non-White ancestry. You know what-- he is 100% American, Can we get over this idiocy and focus on what the man has to offer as a potential President?</p>
<p>Commitment to the black community, the black family, the black work ethic, another reference to the black community, black leadership, black value system. This isn't racism?? Has very little to do with Obama, but if I started a Caucaso-Centric church based on promoting the white community and white leaders, you think people would let it slide as easily?

<dd>That sentence could be tweeked a bit. As for the categories, I don't think we want to say that he is NOT an African American when he says he is one. Getting back to Ernham's post: A "mulatto" or a "person of mixed race" can be a member of the group of people called "African Americans".<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 06:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then it would be superfluous to have the words "mulatto" and "mixed-race" if the aren't really definitive. I know one thing for sure, if/when the exploratory committee decides he should run, the article should read, "If elected, he would be the first African-American (I know I'm not going to win this on here so I guess I'll let you all have your little fun), as well as the first biracial president." <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 06:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When one refers to something such as "african amrican", you are refering to a cultural element that is found in north america. This unique cultural element is completely different on an ethnic level than someone that is the first generation son of an African immigrant(with a phd no less) raised in upper middle-class suburbia. To correctly refer to him in a "racial way", you would have to call him half caucasoid and half negroid. We don't usually use terms like that. Someone said that because he is "black" and lives in the US he can use the term "afircan-american". That's interesting because I have an Indian(ethnically indian!) friend at college that is at least two shades darker than Barack. Here's the kicker: he also came from african immigrants(south africa). Is he really African American too?

<p>So, he can call himself African American, even if he's not? Seriously, he's half white, half black. He's no more African American, than he is white. How do you think people would react if he called himself white? It's amazing how reverse racism works. Anyone can call themselves African American, while it's a crime to be white.</p>

<dd>"<i>The only legitimate source as to whether he is an African American is Obama himself.</i>" - This is not in line with WP policy. This has been discussed <b>to death</b> in the archives. Please look back through them before throwing more verbiage out her. Basically what it breaks down to is that you use the racial designation used in the source you are quoting/paraphrasing/summarizing. For example you will notice in the first paragraph he is referred to indirectly as the first African American senator. That designation was used because the source being cited used it. It is notable, verifiable, etc. There is no need to gratuitously add racial designators. But if you cite a newspaper article calling him "black" then use black. If you refer to a quote from Obama himself that uses "African American" use that. There is no need to use one "true" designation. His racial/ethnic/national history is well discussed in the article. Adding your own arbitrarily decided designators is not acceptable no matter what standard "you" (this means any one editor) believes is the "standard." Use your cites and don't add extraneous racial designators. It is that simple. --<a href="../../../r/t/r/User%7ERtrev_b641.html" title="User:Rtrev">Rtrev</a> 02:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If there are points made in the archives before other editors have arrived that you feel are important than you should mention them but don't assume that new editors or editors who have chosen to have input on this article are going to rely heavily upon past discussions. That you and others may have discussed this before does not give you immunity from having to discuss it with those of us who were not a part of those discussions. I also do not think that your interpretation of Wikipedia policy regarding racial desgination is correct. There are sources which state that he is African American and therefore it makes sense to state as a part of this article that he is based on those sources with citation. If there is a conflicting reliable source than that can be provided for but sources which conflict with statements that have been made by a living person are required to be removed.

It is fine to say he is an African-American presidential candidate if you have a nice cite talking about it (which there are many).

<dd>If you are able to show based on policy that using racial designations that the subject of the biography uses to describe themselves as editors think appropriate than you would have a point yet there is nothing in policy which prohibits or otherwise requires that such descriptions not be used. If this is not the case than you should reference the policy in question. The Manual of Style refers to this as, "Where known, use terminology that subjects use for themselves" and "this can mean using the term an individual uses for himself or herself." I don't intend to edit this article so you need not worry about whether I will ever use the word African-American anywhere in the article. I am here simply to add to the discussions on the talk page. I don't agree that it's inappropriate to refer to Obama as African-American wherever an editor feels it appropriate to mention and I believe that only one citation (with multiple sources as necessary) at the first mention of his being African-American is sufficent and that each reference to his being African-American need not be cited. The statements included in the article about Obama being African American stand alone on the few citations. Another example is religious designators which need to be cited once and then the person can be referred throughout the article as Catholic if they are consistent with other policies such as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>. It may have happened in the past that people included "racial designators wherever they thought that it sounds nice" and on the face there is nothing inappropriate about this except where it violates other policies. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 19:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unique or no that is not the point. The point is that you should use your sources. IT IS NOT OUR CALL. Wikipedia editors do not make reality we simply report what is out there. The fact is that a lot of people refer to him as "African American" and it is included in many verifiable, notable, and neutral sources. When citing those sources use African American.

<dd>Just jumping into this discussion, I don't see what's to argue about. He's mulatto, and that's really all there is to it.

<p>The reality is, if he does in fact want to use the term African American--and we do place that in the lead-- there MUST be a controversy/ criticism establishing that many other African Americans think he is a pretender. If it's not bleated about in the article, then we don't have to include that criticism/controversy. Apparently Barack has even gone as far to defend his usage of the term by claiming "decendents of slaves and recent african immigrants have a lot in common ", a mind bogglingly ridiculous statement if I ever heard one. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnham_36c9.html" title="User:Ernham">Ernham</a> 17:48, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In what way is that ridiculous? The examples he cites are based on skin color. A cab wasn't more likely to stop for him because he wasn't descended from slaves or because his mother was white, a security guard less likely to watch him, a real estate agent more likely to show him a property. He specifically cites the case of African immigrant <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadou_Diallo_24c5.html" title="Amadou Diallo">Amadou Diallo</a>. That seems pretty straight forward. My input, and granted I'm new here, is that he qualifies under all three descriptors: black, African-American, mulatto (or mixed race). However, he isn't designated as being the only mixed-race Senator in the Senate <a href="http://search.eb.com/blackhistory/article-9399848" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.eb.com/blackhistory/article-9399848" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> or the first mixed-race editor of the Harvard Law Review <a href="http://obama.senate.gov/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://obama.senate.gov/about/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. He is listed as African American. Those are two pretty decent sources to cite in an encyclopedia article, regardless of what some editors of the article believe to be the case.--<a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykll42_ca06.html" title="User:Mykll42">Mykll42</a> 21:47, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you Mykll42 - well put. To my mind, anyone who would seriously question whether Obama should be called black, African American, or a person of color - any of those <i>interchangeable</i> terms - is either blind, illiterate, or with an agenda. And just so you know, I believe that most of the regular editors here would totally agree with you on this and have worked diligently to use common sense and obvious fact when describing him. It is only a few who are hell-bent on squeezing controversy out of the most innocuous statements, and twisting reality to fit their own positions. None of which belongs here, as far as I'm concerned. Good to have you here - I hope you'll stick around and help us keep this article on course. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 06:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, well put Mykll42. I'll just throw in my two cents here; does it make <i>any sense at all</i> to not call him "black" or "African American"? It doesn't matter exactly what his ethnicity is, his skin tone speaks for itself. Why is this even being debated? He is a "halfrican", which is the same as "mulatto", which is defined as "black". --<a href="../../../h/o/j/User%7EHojimachong_c483.html" title="User:Hojimachong"><font color="#0000CC" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Hojimachong</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../h/o/j/User_talk%7EHojimachong_5367.html" title="User talk:Hojimachong"><font color="#00FFAA">talk</font></a></sup> 06:40, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnham_36c9.html" title="User:Ernham">Ernham</a>, we try hard here to make decisions based on consensus, and you do not have consensus for removing the term, so I expect it will be reverted.

<p>Didn't Stephen Colbert interview a women who said Barack is not an African American? While I think he is an African American, and so does the dictionary, a fair amount of published material says he isnt; just do a quick web search and you'll find some of it. I think you should make either a controversy section about his racial identity here, or make or find an article which covers the debate over what is the proper defenition of African American, and put a link to it here. For the record, I am for refering to Barack as an African American in this article, as he fits the dictionary defenition of being one, and it is fairly linear and unblamable to accept the dictionary as the final authority on all questions of what words mean. Some people might argue that Bush is not the president of the United States, because he didn't get more votes then Gore in Florida, or the popular vote. They deserve to be mentioned in wikipedia; it is not proper however that because of their opinions, wikipedia does not flatly call Bush president in his article, and where relevant.-Somebody</p>

<p>Having taken a glance at the article, I really don't think it would fit it, to have an section about the debate over whether or not Barack Obama is an African American or not. A sentence could be slipped in, or a link which goes to an article covering the debate over what the proper citerion are for being an African American.-Somebody <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Frelt (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frelt_395f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frelt">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Could those looking to change how african-american or black is used in Wikipedia articles please start by focusing on articles with less noteworthy individuals. I would be much more likely to support a change if a number of other articles were changed in a way that went against how individuals identified themselves as black, and instead started assigning them non-black labels. This is not the article to be having that debate about. Frankly I think that this idea of telling people of a certain race or ethnicity that they don't fit the wikipedia version of that race is going to be a tricky business, and would suggest that it start elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The carpetbagging black Republican Alan Keyes opened up this racialist can of worms when he opposed Mr. Obama in the Illinois Senate race back in 2004. Badly outmatched and reaching for any brick he could find, Mr. Keyes blurted out that Mr. Obama was not black because he was not descended from slaves. The Daily News columnist Stanley Crouch later seemed to second that view, saying that Mr. Obama had not “lived the life of a black American.”</p>

<p>A minority of any action volunteers automatically all the distinguishing features of that minority. Should the minority be human, then colour, speech, education, and roots, are going to prejudice each of us, according to our own unique background. Obama is black; being black will be mentioned. Obama is university educated; being university educated will be mentioned. Obama smokes; being a smoker will be mentioned. All the demarcations will come out that we can imagine, because he is part of an American minority. Similarly with those in a majority, but the restraint of exposing every nuance is in effect. Clinton is white; being white is not mentioned, while other demarcations are. What I mean by all of this is that African-American, black, et al, is going to get plenty of, inevitable, exposure in the press and public.

<p>I've had stuff deleted even if there was a citation. There was no discussion about it, just someone deleting it. Therefore, a citation does not prevent deletion. We need to clean up the article and eliminate irrelavent stuff. So what if Obama cosponsored a bill. Senators do that thousands of times during their senate term. What is relevant is if Obama's bill is passed as was the case in the Congo bill. Also relevant is if he has a bill jointly with the GOP, such as with Senator McCain. Also revelant is when he submits a bill about his pet subject, withdrawal in Iraq.</p>
<p>Why is the pastor that married him so important. It just detracts from Obama. Why not list which airlines he's an elite frequent flyer or what brand of tires he uses? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDereks1x_34d9.html" title="User:Dereks1x">Dereks1x</a> 20:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Stuff deleted without a citation does not fly on this article. You need consensus which is why your edits have been reverted. Your deletions are throwing off the POV of this article. If material is properly introduced into an article with citations, deleting it because it "does not seem important" to you becomes opinionated editting. As for mundane info, there are enough editors on this article that if one or more had objected to it, it would have been deleted. Not every piece of minutia will be introduced into an article but some things like who married whom are present in many other articles.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Consider deleting fluff</span></h2>
<p>For example, "In September 2006, Obama supported a related bill, the Secure Fence Act, authorizing construction of fencing and other security improvements along the United States–Mexico border." under the legislation section. He simply voted on the bill. This is not newsworthy. 80 senators voted for the bill. The bill was not Obama's idea. If he wrote a bill with McCain, that's worthy of wikipedia. If he has a pet issue, such as not fighting in Iraq, that's worthy of mention. If you mention a bill that he voted yes or no, then you should list all the hundreds of bills that he voted on. If one includes the Secure Fence Act trying to fool the reader to thinking that it's Obama's idea, this is fraud. For a neutral viewpoint, I think the sentence should be deleted. If not deleted, there should be a note that Obama was simply voted on the measure, one of hundreds of votes, and that it wasn't his idea.<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDereks1x_34d9.html" title="User:Dereks1x">Dereks1x</a> 20:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Things like smoking shouldn't really be on the radar.

However, I don't expect that the president should be a vegan cross-country runner who drives a SmartCar. To be fair, this is slightly bigger news than if Obama once hit the bumper of a parked car while backing out of a parking space.But this isn't the sort of thing that would have any effect on his campaign.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">to dereks1x regarding major edits</span></h2>
<p>Dereks1x - I am sure you mean well in your editing of Barack Obama, but there is a problem with the way you are doing it. Some of your edits are not careful, and introduce errors in language and wording; some of them are taking an article that many editors have worked hard to keep NPOV and making it less so. Also the article has been given featured status, and we have recently undergone a review of that featured status, and one of the criteria is stability - that means, once wording has been established for sections that are not current events, for example, editors are supposed to try to keep that wording as it is without making lots of changes. His early life, for example, has been gone over and over and the wording is fair, accurate, and not changing, so there's no need to edit it further beyond an occasional tweak. Also the reference style has been under scrutiny and editors have worked hard to keep it consistent and in compliance with standards. PLease believe me when I tell you that the regular editors on this article are diligent and non-partisan. We're not pushing any agenda, pro or anti the Senator regarding his Presidential ambition. What we want is for there to be a fair article, with a reasonable level of detail but not too much - that's another issue in Featured status - with reliable references, and a consistent style. If anyone has ideas for additions or major changes, we try to discuss them on the Talk page before implementing them. I'm asking you, then, to do that. I'm speaking for myself here - as one editor of the page - and one of the ones who has reverted some of your multiple edits yesterday and today. It's very time consuming to do this over and over - you are today reinstating things that were removed yesterday. Please stop doing that and come over to talk instead and say why you think your changes are needed, and I assure you that fair changes will get a fair hearing. I'm posting this on your user talk page and on <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarack_Obama_36f7.html" title="Talk:Barack Obama">Talk:Barack Obama</a> where it can be discussed more. I hope you don't take offense, and I hope you will be a cooperative editor on this highly-visible featured article.

<dd>Dereks1x, I removed your addition to the legislation section because it was an uninformative list of non-notable bills that Obama has filed in 2007. The point of this article is not to act as a legislative record for Obama, but to record only the notable legislation that he's a sponsor on. None of those were particularly notable and none of them have even made it out of committee yet. Also, links to Thomas do not work once you close your browser session. They are unique to your browser session and will not work for anyone else that tries to follow those links. Additionally, including the full bill title is not informative as they don't say what the bill actually does. If you want to include Obama's legislative record for this year, find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">secondary source</a> that explains what the bills actually mean. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 22:44, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">removed paragraph</span></h2>
<p>"Senator Obama has taken positive steps to eliminate actions which might be deemed improper. In an agreement with his wife, Obama agreed to stop smoking in exchange for her helping him run.[99] He has said that he will only invest in mutual funds or money market accounts after critics accused him of buying individual stocks which would benefit from government funding that Obama was proposing.[100] Obama also paid 15 parking tickets which were issued to him 17 years ago.[101]"</p>
<p>This is an absurd paragraph and I removed it. Is he stopping smoking because it "might be deemed improper"? Gee, I would have thought it was a health issue. Or maybe an image issue. But not a matter of propriety. And neither of the other two items are notable. Even consensus on your own "survey" here (a method I don't particularly subscribe to because we don't do these things by vote) says they are not notable or we should wait and see. NOne of this belongs in the article. If people insist on including something about his trying to stop smoking - and the importance of this escapes me - then come up with some better wording than that it mught be deemed improper. My opinion, as a long time editor of this article, is that including it gives it undue weight, and I see no need for it at all. There is a whole lot that has been left off of this article, for space reasons, and because you can't include every detail.

<dd>I didn't write the paragraph you removed, nor do I approve of its wording, and I don't appreciate you attributing it to me. I'd note that the paragraph includes mentions of the blind trust and parking tickets, which I (along with Talk consensus) opposed here as being notable enough for inclusion. Again, if you don't like surveys, don't participate; they're plenty useful.

<dd>Whoa- hold it - where did I attribute it to you? I know you didn't add that paragraph - it was added by an IP address User:71.212.111.238 - and I never suggested that you had anything to do with it. In fact my comment says that the paragraph is <i>not</i> what the survey results revealed, and although I don't like the idea of the survey I didn't do a thing to disrupt it - I didn't participate, but I also didn't comment on it until now. You owe me an apology for that snide edit summary and your accusation above. And by the way - the survey was introduced here without your signature attached to it, other than in the edit summary, for whatever reason you had. When I said "your survey" I actually was talking to all of the participants in it - in fact, I hadn't even noticed who posted the opener. My comment about a survey not being a vote was precisely speaking to the point that we attempt to edit here by discussion and consensus, not majority rule. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 21:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then why does your criticism of an anon's insertion belong here, in this survey? You're boycotting all surveys, but your criticism of some anon's shoddy insertion belongs in a sub-section of this one?

<dd>There ya go. Moved the header out so that it's not part of the survey. As far as Tvoz's actions. The quitting smoking is notable because Obama made it notable and a sentence saying he made an agreement of his wife to stop smoking in exchange for her helping him run is hardly undue weight. The Obama's made it notable by including it in every interview they gave in the weeks following his announcement. Now, concentrating it in a paragraph along with the non-notable parking tickets and stock purchases and preceding it with the "might be deemed inappropriate" is a bit much. So getting rid of the paragraph was probably a good thing. Just need to figure some way to work the quitting smoking sentence into the article somewhere.</dd>
<dd>The only thing evil about "voting" is if all you do is count noses. Going by pure discussion is often more contentious as a vocal minority can often out talk a majority, which is just as evil. That's why you take surveys. Not only is the "agree" or "disagree" important(but to a far lesser degree), you also get the most important thing, why people feel the way they do.--<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 01:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just one point here about what is being characterized as the "polling is evil" opinion essay: I personally did not say here or anywhere that I thought polling is evil (nor does that essay say that, actually), nor have I seen anyone say that anywhere. So perhaps the hyperbole could be dialed down a bit. I said I don't like surveys, and I chose not to participate in - or disrupt - this one. I do, however, think it is helpful to re-read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> from time to time - and regarding this discussion, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DEMOCRACY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DEMOCRACY</a> in particular. By the way, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in its entirety is official policy - not a guideline, not an opinion essay - so I guess we ought to keep it in mind. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 05:26, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DEMOCRACY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DEMOCRACY</a> applies to <b>polling</b>: name counting, head counting, and tilde counting. This survey was in no way a vote, it was a place where individuals may express their opinions in an organized, structured manner. The summary consensus of those opinions is now available for all to see. You are more than welcome to abstain from this survey on principle, but it reeks awfully of just doing so to make a point. You are wrong that no one has cited the "polling is evil" essay in the past on this Talk page, and obviously missed Bbatshell and Edward Lalone (the latter of which went on to disrupt the entire survey on principle) last month. Anyhow, this is not hyperbole, and I don't appreciate your misrepresenting it as such. I know <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> very well, and it doesn't apply in this case (though you're welcome to keep insinuating otherwise all night). <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaliavivi_ad2e.html" title="User:Italiavivi">Italiavivi</a> 21:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(outdent) Since I was dragged into this (kicking and screaming while on a wikibreak, no less), the above is <i>not a poll</i>. It's structured discussion. A poll looks like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obama's smoking is not notable.</dd>
<dd><b>Yes</b>
<dl>
<dd>-- fake user 1</dd>
<dd>-- fake user 2</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><b>No</b>
<dl>
<dd>--fake user 1</dd>
<dd>--fake user 2</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my example, no discussion is taking place, just a straight up head count. Those types of polls, in the absence of other discussion, are pretty much not permitted on Wikipedia, and <i>not</i> through an essay, but through a pretty clear guideline: <a href="../../../%21/v/o/WP%7E%21VOTE_d780.html" title="WP:!VOTE">WP:!VOTE</a>. I imagine Tvoz originally placed it under that section because the added paragraph incorporated a good portion of the issues discussed there, and not to personally attack your efforts, Italiavivi. Can we put this behind us and keep moving forward on discussing and writing the article at hand? <a href="../../../f/a/c/Image%7EFace-grin.svg_306f.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/bc/Face-grin.svg/25px-Face-grin.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="25" longdesc="../../../f/a/c/Image%7EFace-grin.svg_306f.html" /></a> —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bbatsell_a457.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bbatsell"><span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span></a> 22:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, Bbatsell, thank you - that is why I placed it there, as I have explained above and elsewhere. My reminders of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DEMOCRACY" title="WP:NOT">official policy</a> that Wikipedia is not a democracy were prompted by the comment down below by an editor who suggested that his or her "side" "won". And that's why I don't particularly like the survey method, because it can be misconstrued as a vote. But nonetheless, I did not disrupt it. The hyperbole I refer to is using the word "evil", which I didn't, and the WP:VOTE essay doesn't either. And yes, I'd like to move on too. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 00:46, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I did so in order to keep the text as succinct and specific to the senator himself as possible - probably the same reason the description of his father's home village was shortened.

<p>Hi all, first time that i write on a discussion and i'm not so good with english&#160;:) The question is: i see that <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudy_Giuliani_d5f0.html" title="Rudy Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> has his {{<a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_election_candidate_802e.html" title="Template:Future election candidate">Future election candidate</a>}} template on the top of the article, why there's no such thing on Obama's? I see that Obama's article is blocked too, why did you choose not to place the template {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_7bf5.html" title="Template:Protected">protected</a>}}? Not a criticism at all, just to know!-- <b><a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBella_Situazione_c53a.html" title="User:Bella Situazione">bs</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../b/e/l/User_talk%7EBella_Situazione_71d2.html" title="User talk:Bella Situazione">talk</a>)</small> 18:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Bella - your English is fine! We do have the future election template, but it's in the section specifically about the 2008 presidential campaign, because that is the section expected to change rapidly as events unfold. Most of the rest of the article shouldn't be changing so quickly, so the template on top might be misleading and isn't needed there. There's no rule about where it goes, but when I see them on top for articles like this, I tend to move them down to the appropriate section. As for the semi-protection - the lock on the top indicates semi-protection, and the only users blocked are anonymous IP addresses and brand new user accounts. If you have a named account you';re welcome to edit - the reason is we've had a tremendous amount of vandalism, sometimes vicious, on this article by IP addresses. Not all editors here agree about this, and we've taken it off numerous times, but so far semi-protection has had to be reinstated because the vandalism quickly returns. Many of the major candidates, and many other articles on wikipedia, have similar semi-protection. As for the template - some of the editors here felt that the lock in the corner was sufficient and did not deface the article as much as the big template. It means the same thing, but is less obtrusive. The main purpose of the encyclopedia is to allow readers to get information as easily as possible, so some of us think the less obtrusive lock serves the purpose of protecting the article, but allows readers to read in a less distracted manner. Hope this answers your questions - just my opinion, of course.

<p>What do you think? From Obama's Past: An Old Classmate, A Surprising Call, Wall Street Journal, Vol. CCXLIX No. 68, March 23, 2007, p.A1</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Keith Kakugawa, his Punahou classmate, is mentioned in "Dreams From My Father". The article has Keith's picture. Called "Ray" in the book.</li>
<li>2. describes Punahou School as "exclusive, mostly white Honolulu high school." WSJ article says "The two bonded, Mr. Obama wrote 'due in no small part to the fact that together we made up almost half of Punahou's black high school population' in a student body of about 1,700.</li>
<li>3. Kevin called Obama recently and "tensions rose when Mr. Kakugawa asked for some money to be wired via Western Union, according to both him and Ms. Adler. Ms. Adler brought in senior advisor Robert Gibbs, and together, they phoned Mr. Kakugawa last Saturday...the exchange left Mr. Kakugawa upset."</li>
<li>I think #1 might be relevant for wikipedia, but just a brief mention that Obama was featured in a front page article of the WSJ regarding an old friend who called him for monetary assistance, which was denied. It's front page news. That's news.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think #2 and #3 are not relevant unless you want to modify the reference to Punahou school being "exclusive". It really it exclusive. That's now verified by the Wall St. Journal and about half a million Hawaiians can vouch for that. It's no surprise because the race to the Prez is tough. You need help like Punahou or Phillips Academy like the Bushs. MLK High in the inner city is not good enough. That's just life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some wikipedia articles have a "trivia" section, particularly the airline articles. Is that good for this article????<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDereks1x_34d9.html" title="User:Dereks1x">Dereks1x</a> 20:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's that relevant. In Dreams From My Father, Obama used different names to shield the identity of many people, not just Mr. Kakugawa. Also, I'm sure Obama has been asked for favors by many people, an old friend asking for financial assistance is nothing special. - <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPoliticalJunkie_1864.html" title="User:PoliticalJunkie">PoliticalJunkie</a> 20:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with PoliticalJunkie - this happens all the time as someone moves into prominence and is not notable. As for Punahou, it is accurately described now. About a trivia section, no it is not good for this article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">law firm</span></h2>
<p>Obama's former law firm was described in the article as "civil rights law firm". This is biased so it's against wikipedia policy. It's also false. The firm does a whole lot of plaintiff stuff. Originally, I summarized it in one phrase. However, someone edited it out. As a compromise, I placed a link and just refered to it as a law firm.</p>
<p>Before people edited out the description of Punahou School as being well respected. If you're going to edit that out, then you should agree that "civil rights" law firm should also be edited out. There's an even stronger case because Punahou is well respected (no dispute) but it's a lie to say that the firm is primarly a civil rights law firm. Furthermore, wiki editors said people could just click the link to Punahou to see how good it is. The same now goes for the law firm.</p>
<p>The neutral POV is not to lie and mischaracterize the law firm. Either describe it in its entiretly (got edited out) or give a link and just describe it as a law firm. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDereks1x_34d9.html" title="User:Dereks1x">Dereks1x</a> 21:32, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From the Miner, Barnhill, &amp; Galland website... the "About Us" section. <a href="http://www.lawmbg.com/about.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lawmbg.com/about.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. "The firm has acquired a national reputation in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development work." Referring to something as a "civil rights law firm" is not giving it a POV. Calling it the "<i>renowned</i> civil rights firm" would be. Which is why that isn't what we did. Referring to the Punahou School as a private school is not POV, referring to it as "the famous and well respected private Punahou School" is. I hate to not assume good faith, but this appears to be more of a vendetta against us for disagreeing with the Punahou descriptor than a genuine intent to improve the article. <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykll42_ca06.html" title="User:Mykll42">Mykll42</a> 22:40, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As someone who stumbled on this page, I looked at the law firm's website. It looks like that do a whole lot more than civil rights. They also don't appear to be funded by donations. I suspect that civil rights is a small part of the firm's work. So my two cents are that it would be inaccurate to call it a civil rights law firm unless one wants to paint a false picture (perhaps as a campaign tactic). There's nothing wrong with a law firm doing other kinds of work! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/l/5/User%7ETL500_188b.html" title="User:TL500">TL500</a> (<a href="../../../t/l/5/User_talk%7ETL500_946c.html" title="User talk:TL500">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TL500_b0f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/TL500">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>I see that this sentence was reworked to be more specific: it now indicates the nature of Obama's work in the firm, rather than characterizing the firm itself, so this complaint is now moot. Not necessary, by the way, to suggest that this was a "campaign tactic" or that anyone "wants to paint a false picture". You might notice that the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/20/america/NA-POL-US-Obama-Attorney-at-Law.php" class="external text" title="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/20/america/NA-POL-US-Obama-Attorney-at-Law.php" rel="nofollow">referenced article</a> refers to the firm as a "civil rights" practice which is likely where the original poster picked that phrase up from.

<p>Rather than a blanket (and somewhat vague and inaccurate) one word characterization of his law practice, more specifics were added. For example, a reference was added to pre-existing text in the article backing up the notion that he did employment cases and some voting issues. Also he continued to work part time after being a state senator, he did not quit as the old wikipedia version implies. Everything is neutrally worded. Someone (Bobbelhead) reverted the change....please don't do this especially because the old version was less specific and less accurate. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDereks1x_34d9.html" title="User:Dereks1x">Dereks1x</a> 18:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's no evidence that he's board certified in civil rights. Attorneys can be board certified in a number of areas. Furthermore, employment cases, his main work, is not necessarily civil rights cases. One can sue for wrongful termination for many reasons. The current wording makes presumptions. It is more accurate to just say what kind of work he did, i.e. employment, voting, rather than a blanket statement of being a civil rights attorney doing employment and voting. That's like saying "GWB is an environmental president who was president during the cleanup of the World Trade Center". The first part of the phrase is opinion, the second is fact. The same goes for Obama's description.<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDereks1x_34d9.html" title="User:Dereks1x">Dereks1x</a> 18:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Except there isn't a variety of sources saying Bush is an environmental President like there is saying Obama is a civil rights attorney.

<li>This is extremely DISTURBING that this wikipedia editor is suggesting that it's ok to put false information as long as it's verified (meaning that old lies are ok as long as someone else told the same lie before in print). In a related law firm matter in the Obama article (under the family life part), someone deleted the part that Obama and Mrs. Obama met at Sidley Austin LLP. This law firm is significant in that Mrs. Abe Lincoln was a client, that they are a very big and (disputable) prestigous firm, and they even have a long established wikipedia article.

<dl>
<dd>Bobblehead said nothing of the kind - what Bobblehead said is that the threshhold for inclusion is verifiability, in other words, truth <i>alone</i> is not enough, facts must be verifiable. So stop making accusations. As far as you r question above, no, I don't think the name of the law firm where Obama spent a summer and met his wife is particularly notable - I don't think it matters one way or the other and as you;ve been told, one of the things we try to do is keep the wordcount manageable. The context of that section is family - where they met hardly matters. The rest of the article by definition will grow, so there is no need for excess in these minor details. What we have is accurate, verified, and plenty comprehensive. Of great concern to me also is that you keep reverting the sentences about Miner. The wording I reverted to, which a number of editors have worked on and pretty much come to the same essence, are, again, accurate, verified, and enough detail. Continuing to re-insert the wording you want is not helpful and is disruptive. The sentence about working on law briefs is completely unnotable and unnecessary - that's why several editors have deleted it. So please stop re-inserting your wording unless you find consensus to do so here. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please do not keep reverting changes about Obama's law firm. The old version had a blanket and potentially misleading statement that he was a civil rights lawyer. His cases were mostly employment cases. The new language has been developed as a compromise by several editors but you, Tvoz, all of sudden changed it back to the old wording. The compromise language had been there for a few days. Even wiki's policy is to revise, not blanket revert it back.

<dd>Dereks1x, I don't think there is consensus on your preferred wording, especially the removal of "civil rights". The wording is basically me trying to incorporate your additions in an NPOV manner and attributing the areas where you have concerns. As far as whether or not the wording should be in the article, I don't care. Based on edits, Tvoz and Hailfire appear to favor the removal of your edits. Based on that it seems one in favor of including, two against including, and one neutral. If you'd like, you can create an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and present your preferred wording and Tvoz and Hailfire's preferred version and see if a consensus exists for the inclusion of one over the other. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 21:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

I must say that I disagree with Tvoz as far as her reverting back to the oldest version. To have some description appears to be better than blanket "he was a civil rights lawyer". Without commenting on Tvoz' political beliefs, an ardent supporter of Obama probably likes the blanket "civil rights lawyer" because it portrays a do-gooder but a lawyer who does employment law and some voting issues is less dramatic but more accurate. Furthermore, I see that compromise language incorporating both the "civil rights" term and a more description phrase has been added (and deleted by...let's not name names).

<dd>I did not revert to the oldest version or to "he was a civil rights lawyer". I reverted to HailFire's wording from the 21st which seemed to more accurately and succinctly describe this short part of his career. Further, I don't see the consensus that Dereks1x is claiming. I don't know what the point is of the sentence about not participating in any trials and writing law briefs (by the way, that's what non-trial lawyers do, it's quite far from notable). This is far more detail than is needed in this very minor part of the man's career, it seems to me, and I see no attempt to get consensus here for the additions. Finally, I don't know who you are, and you don't know what my political beliefs are, nor do you know who, if anyone, I am an ardent supporter of.

<dd>Looking over it again, this entire issue is specious. The firm is <a href="http://pview.findlaw.com/view/3253015_1" class="external text" title="http://pview.findlaw.com/view/3253015_1" rel="nofollow">described here</a>, a neutral source, as having "a national reputation in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development work" and does other legal work as well, but that sentence is the lead. The AP article printed in the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/20/america/NA-POL-US-Obama-Attorney-at-Law.php?page=1" class="external text" title="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/20/america/NA-POL-US-Obama-Attorney-at-Law.php?page=1" rel="nofollow">International Herald Tribune</a> that is cited quite clearly states that Obama "chose Miner's Chicago civil rights firm, where he represented community organizers, discrimination victims and black voters trying to force a redrawing of city ward boundaries." So characterizing it as a civil rights firm was never incorrect or POV or anything but accurate. We can go into more detail about what specifically he worked on, but it is excessive considering the short period of time - 3 years in the beginning of his career. I'm leaving that for now, but I would favor shortening it, as we have had to shorten all over the article. I've removed the entirely unnotable sentence that describes the common practices of an associate in a law firm: they work on briefs, contracts, and legal documents. There's nothing unusual or notable about this - I don't see it mentioned in other articles about people who were associates at the beginning of their careers, and it is not needed here. I am not saying it is untrue, and I know it is mentioned in the article cited, but a lot of other material is also true but also not notable for an encyclopedia article. And saying he "never participated in a trial while at the firm" sounds POV to me - as if that somehow diminishes his status. Perhaps you don't know how law firms work - most associates are not trial lawyers, they write briefs and appeals, and do the day-to-day work that is needed. So this is simply unnotable. FInally, I previously changed the incorrect syntax "as an Of counsel" and see it was reverted without explanation. An attorney does not work as an of counsel. They are of counsel. It is a legal term, slightly awkward, not all that familiar to the public, but if we're going to use it, we have to use it properly. His of counsel affiliation is minor - he maintained an association with the firm as lawyers often do when they move on to other activities or retire, and the article doesn't say that he worked there parttime for all of those years - being of counsel doesn't mean you necessarily work parttime throughout the time you have the affiliation. It says he "agreed to work for the firm in summer when the legislature was out of session." but that doesnt even clearly state that he did so throughout that time. His CV notes that he maintained an of counsel relationship, but without more research we don't really know what the nature of the association was (perhaps others have some other documentation). But the point is that all of this is extremely minor and unnotable, and I don't see the necessity for including it in the article. It is not a matter of coming up with compromise wording, it is a matter of accurate and verified representation of the notable items in his career - given the fact that we want to keep the article to a manageable size. I'm editing this paragraph again, accordingly. I see absolutely no consensus here among the editors who generally work on this piece, saying that we need all of that detail. And I think this issue has gotten way more attention than was needed. Sorry this is so long, but I think it was needed to be clear. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 09:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the latest Tvox revision is close enough for a compromise. It doesn't give him the blanket term "civil rights lawyer" which is too close to "civil rights leader" which is what MLK is. Obama is no MLK. However, it does refer to his civil rights caseload. A small suggestion and revision, however. Not everyone knows what an associate lawyer does so a modifier, sort of a descriptive phrase, is appropriate. On the positive side, it shows that the guy is a team player, not a prima donna that insists on talking in court. <i>The preceding comment was entered by <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDereks1x_34d9.html" title="User:Dereks1x">User: Dereks1x</a>.</i></p>

<dd>To the best of my recollection it never said he was a "civil rights lawyer", has nothing to do with "civil rights leader" or Martin Luther King so stop bringing up red herrings or your opinion of Obama - whether you think he is like MLK, a team player, a prima donna or anything else. No one else is trying to show that the guy is anything - are you? I continue to say that the phrase about what he did on a day to day basis for 3 years at the beginning of his career is utterly unnotable and even the reason you just gave for including it smacks of POV. No one but you has said that it should be in, or why. So, once more, I'm taking it out which brings us back to wording that reflects what has been on this page for a long time and is consistent with what other editors have included and excluded. If you want to make some kind of reasonable argument, and achieve consensus here, that's another conversation. As far as people not knowing what associate attorneys do, the wiki article that has been linked there -<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">attorney</a> - spells it out quite clearly, but I'll change the link to point <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html#The_job_of_an_attorney" title="Attorney">directly</a> at the section description if that helps you. And could you please try to remember to sign your talk page comments?

<p>It smacks on original research when you expect people to read the jobs an attorney link and think that's what Obama did. Furthermore, the link is flawed because there is no evidence that Obama wrote wills, trusts, deeds, real estate closings, derived a solution, disbursement of settlement funds, or other things that the wikipedia link says.</p>
<p>Since you don't like the truth, i.e. that he did not participate in any trials, I think that can slide providing it's mentioned what he did...contracts, briefs, etc.</p>
<p>This is done in the spirit of compromise, i.e. ok, you can delete the phrase I put in this morning but don't delete other older stuff. In wikipedia, you're supposed to revise as oppose to delete, when possible. I can (and did) compromise, can you?<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDereks1x_34d9.html" title="User:Dereks1x">Dereks1x</a> 23:32, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
