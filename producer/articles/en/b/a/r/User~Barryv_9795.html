<p>Born in London, UK in 1959 by Jamaican parents Linda Wright (St.Elizabeth) and Rudolph Vincent (Clarendon), at age 6 Barry Vincent migrated to Jamaica, West Indies. He fell in love with the sound of the guitar and made a crude instrument with fishing line, and a sardine can. At age 11 he was given a real instrument and the lifelong pursuit of perfection began. It was soon discovered that he had a natural aptitude for the instrument and after a few years he was performing on television and the road with the Grace Gospel Thrillers and The Jamaica National Folk Singers.</p>
<p>He later attended the Jamaica School of Music under the eagle eye of the late jazz trombonist/arranger Melba Liston and found himself in a theory class taught by jazz guitarist Ernest Ranglin. But such was his natural talent that by the age of 14 he was offered his first professional job playing in a nightclub in Kingston and performances with the National Pantomime Theatre as a resident musician followed. In 1975 he was referred to Bob Marley who auditioned him at 56 Hope Road, in Kingston, on their first meeting. With Jah B's (Bob) blessing he was allowed to come and go at leisure and has fond memories of eating steamed fish and playing soccer with Bob and the guys in the front yard. He also jammed with Jimmy Cliff in JA, and Peter Tosh in New York City.</p>
<p>This period was abruptly cut short when immigration papers came through and his mother had him on a New York-bound jet at age 16. After settling down, he contacted former teacher and friend Melba Liston. As a result he found himself in the presence of a lady pianist, in an informal setting in a Harlem apartment on Lenox Avenue . There was a piano there. She encouraged him to jam a 12 bar blues with her. (This was arranged by my Melba). He remembers the speed of her fingers , creating a ripple-like effect! This lady had amazing technique. Her name was Mary Lou Williams. These 2 legends in jazz have since passed away but Barry will always remember their humanity and kindness.</p>
<p>In 1978-1980 he attended the Berklee College of Music where he received a Professional Diploma in Arranging &amp; Composition. He returned to New York to do various live and studio sessions. In 1981 he returned to London employed as bandleader for the reggae singer John Holt. After the performances Barry stayed in the UK working with Dennis Brown, Alton Ellis, Sugar Minnot, Owen Grey, Carrol Thompson, Caron Wheeler and the Marvellettes to name a few. He also did an original 8 composition project for `Themes International' (KPM) Label London, U.K.</p>
<p>He returned to New York 1985 and three years later migrated to Florida where he freelanced and worked with jazz organist Dr. Lonnie Smith in Hollywood at one point. Barry moved to Atlanta in 1999 and worked the corporate circuit as well as church but after staying for 2 years decided to try his luck in New Orleans and landed a residency with entertainer/saxophonist Gary Brown at the 544 Club on Bourbon St. He played the Umbria Jazz Festival (Italy) and Bregenz Music Festival with Gary Brown in 2003 . By 2003 Barry Vincent had moved back to London with the intention to explore the UK and European markets . He has recently performed at London Night Club China Whites, 'The Big Chill' UK Music festival and Southeast Asia (Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam) with UK act Faze Action, and with Loose Ends and RnB artist Wayne Marshall. Barry has recently been writing and in pre-production for his new CD project, and also performing as a freelance musician.</p>
