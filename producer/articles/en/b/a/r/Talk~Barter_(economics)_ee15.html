<p>If you consider these quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Money is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal- that there is no human relation between master and slave</i> - <b>Leon N. Tolstoy</b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who makes it's laws</i> - <b>Mayer Amshchel Rothschild</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can figure out why most economic experts are not seriously interested by this matter, and also why contributions are accepted only if they describe barter as the outdated ancestor of money or if the subject discussed is, from an economic quantitative point of view, inexistant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The money power preys on the nation in time of peace, and conspires againts it in time of adversity. It is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucracy. It denouces, as pubic enemies, all who question it's methods or throw light upon it's crimes.</i> <b>Abraham Lincoln</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article is now a no man's land of economy. It's quality will grow only if contributions are understood and really discussed before being deleted, or it will remain as it is now.</p>

<dd>I also wary a little bit for the same reason, but since swapping does not use any monetary system and is a trade, swapping is welcome. The en.wiktionary already considers the two words are synonyms.</dd>

<p>Bartering, as I understand it, has tax repercussions. It might be profitable to add something about that. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.6.162.160.html" title="User:69.6.162.160">69.6.162.160</a> 23:44, 17 April 2006 (UTC)Brian Pearson</p>
<p>Yes, bartering does have tax consequences. As the owner of a barter exchange, I must issue 1099B forms to my membership each year. What many businesses don't realize is that taxes are also due when companies barter one-to-one my service for your product. Each product or service has a value and that value for the product you "sold" through barter must be considered in taxes.</p>
<p>Swapping isn't really barter, and then again it is the original barter. Swapping is trading this for that. But swapping (in my opinion) has come to mean this old thing I don't need for that old thing you don't need. Barter is more a business deal where you exchange another item (usually new and something you manufacture or sell) for another item or service.</p>
<p>Barter Groups, such as mine, throw a wrench in because we don't exchange one to one but rather se a point system.</p>

<p>I cleaned up the external links section. More than half of it was commercial sites trying to promote themselves, which is frowned upon according to Wikipedia standards. I left groups of exchanges like NATE and BANC and so on, though, since they don't really represent anyone in particular. -- Andrer9999 00:55, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How did you made the filter? I do not consider the link I gave was of that sort, so I added it again. I propose you to sort information instead of removing it. They are organisations (most of them try to promote themselves), sofware, nets of organisations, etc. The link was erased again by someone I did not found any way to speak with. I will not fight for this. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivierchaussavoine_a6e9.html" title="User:Olivierchaussavoine">Olivierchaussavoine</a> 22:54, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd like to know why the editors who cleaned the "Self-Promotion links" consider The World Trade Banc which is one of the largest privately held exchanges, or Barter Center International aka BCI software which is used by over 500 trade exchanges self promotional links? Why then is DoBarter allowed a link over BCI? I'd suggest the editors may have special interest themselves and what annoys me the most is the fact that The International Barter Alliance and DoBarter are the same software sites! I don't have anything against the DoBarter software as I represent a member exchange, but I also use about every other available barter software in the industry and belong to no less than 4 barter networks... I'm disappointed enough with the bias demonstrated in this publications description of barter knowledge, it's worthy of a formal complaint! I also made it a lot easier to find me to discuss any of my editing actions and find the topic of unbiased editing worthy of fighting for... -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoerinehart_6ce6.html" title="User:Joerinehart">Joerinehart</a> 04:04, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't there be some page specifically for a BARTER ECONOMY? --herbivore 17:32, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Probably. Pretty much everything on this page is about a barter economy, not actual barter as most people think of it. -- Andrer9999 22:24, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am very surprised that you think of barter outside economy, and interested to know what most people think of it. I consider myself that money and barter are both different means to make the balance of economic exchanges. We should make this clear on the article and ask for the integration of barter in economic topics. It is not for the moment. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivierchaussavoine_a6e9.html" title="User:Olivierchaussavoine">Olivierchaussavoine</a> 22:55, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article let think that barter is for poor economic actors who have not access to money, and let feel that barter is economically inexistant. The reality of barter is very different since big organizations are using it since the beginning of mankind. I suggest that we move subjects as <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_living.html" title="Simple living">simple living</a> in a special chapter we could call "uses of barter&gt;when money lacks", and that we give to the word barter it's real meaning. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivierchaussavoine_a6e9.html" title="User:Olivierchaussavoine">Olivierchaussavoine</a> 07:16, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This model makes barter practice easier for exchange of stocks measurable as quantities of quality standards. It allows the settlement of an electronic market place where each participant can find the best economic opportunity.</p>
<p>Using this model, a participant can search for the best association with one or more partners that would produce the lowest rate between the quantity he provides and the quantity he receives.</p>
<p>It does not use any <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetary_system.html" title="Monetary system">monetary system</a>, as required by the definition of barter.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarter_%28economics%29_ee15.html" title="Edit section: Definitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definitions</span></h3>
<p>When exchanged goods are measurable by quantities of standard values, barter agreements can be modelized using the following definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <b>barter commitment</b> is a unilateral statement of one economic actor to provide a quantity of a standard good he owns in exchange of an other quantity of an other standard good he is looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <b>price</b> is the ratio between provided and delivered quantities.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarter_%28economics%29_ee15.html" title="Edit section: Search for the best barter agreement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Search for the best barter agreement</span></h3>
<p>A barter agreement is a list of barter commitments where partners form a loop exchange that can be modelized as a loop on a <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directed_graph.html" title="Directed graph">directed graph</a>.</p>
<p>Using the new definition of price, the equality of price of the buyer and of the seller has no meaning since the units are not the same, but the product of prices has one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>A barter agreement is possible when product of prices of partners equals to 1.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement remains true if we consider barter between more than two partners.</p>
<p>One can view the set of barter commitments as <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertices.html" title="Vertices">vertices</a>. An <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graph_theory.html" title="Graph theory">edge</a> exists between two commitments when the good proposed by one is the same as the good provided by the other. The definition of <i>price</i> is used to give a weight to each <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertex.html" title="Vertex">vertex</a> and paths on this graph by the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The weight of a path is the product of the weight of it's <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertices.html" title="Vertices">vertices</a>, and the weight of a vertex is the price of the barter commitment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Find the best barter opportunity consists in searching for the possible loop that would give the lowest price ( it is created by looping the path having the highest price, since product of prices on a loop must be 1.).</p>
<p>An economic actor looking for a possible commitment proposing a stock he owns and asking for an other, can find the best economic opportunity for him, and define the best list of commitment, and set of partners for it's trade.</p>
<p>Those who are not choosen for the trade and want to barter are naturally incited to propose lower prices.</p>
<p>This model creates a market mecanism without using any <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetary_system.html" title="Monetary system">monetary system</a> but only quantities of exchanged stocks.</p>

<p>A price is usually conditioned to a minimum quantity sold.</p>
<p>A more advanced model can be defined that finds the best associations between commitments where this other constraint is added, using this new definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <b>barter commitment</b> is a unilateral statement of one economic actor to provide such quantity of such standard good he owns in exchange of an other quantity of an other standard good, for a minimum quantity provided.</p>

<p>Is there any interest in a discussion on the different financial models used by third party barter companies and how they set up their trading environments? --Itch 02:11, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This subject could be developed in the chapter <b>barter and money</b>. I am very interested to learn about it-- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivierchaussavoine_a6e9.html" title="User:Olivierchaussavoine">Olivierchaussavoine</a> 09:20, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since barter is a trade that do not use any monetary system, links to local currencies is out of the scope of the subject of barter.</p>

<p>I removed all the external links from the article. There were about 15 of htem at least and it looks more like a spamlink list than useful links.

<p>I see * <a href="http://www.u-exchange.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.u-exchange.com/" rel="nofollow">U-Exchange</a> being useful to users as they are the largest free barter site with over 13,000 members. They are also truly free as they do not charge to add photos and contact other people for trades. * <a href="http://www.u-exchange.com/barter101.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.u-exchange.com/barter101.asp" rel="nofollow">How to Barter</a> gives useful information to people new to bartering online. I think it should be added to external links.</p>
<p>This is a link to a Barter riddle which I think it's sort of interesting. In the interest of full disclosure, I did come up with it, and it is on my homepage, but there's no banners etc on the page, so I think it should be kosher. I guess it could be considered somewhat whimsical. <a href="http://andreamatranga.googlepages.com/thebarterriddle" class="external text" title="http://andreamatranga.googlepages.com/thebarterriddle" rel="nofollow">The Barte Riddle</a> <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedfax_2001.html" title="User:Redfax">Redfax</a> 18:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
