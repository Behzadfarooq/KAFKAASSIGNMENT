<p>If I can put my head above the trenches, it seems this article has been partially at least plagiarised from an article in last weekends Age. So some one has been naughty. Thus the article has a slick journalistic flavour-not encyclopediacal. Personally I cant see why BJ's wife's ethnicity should be mentioned-let alone the wedding. Further BJ was educated at Riverview (StIgnatius) in Sydney. Please see <a href="http://www.riverview.nsw.edu.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.riverview.nsw.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.riverview.nsw.edu.au/</a> There is no geographical location called Riverview as such. Thus overall I would support EAWarbuton's editing. I'd fix it myself but I really dont want to suffer the possibility of hostile attack-there seems to be too much bullying going on. So I shall leave it to the experts amongst you. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransylvanianTwist_ec42.html" title="User:TransylvanianTwist">TransylvanianTwist</a> 05:01, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point is (and I am no friend of Barnaby Joyce) that this statement (until it was recently deleted) preceded a statement demonstrating his opposition to extremism and thus fit in and was in no sense POV. The feel that I seem to be getting from some who are deleting it is that "because Barnaby is religious and conservative, he must be an extremist and therefore it is POV to say that he opposes extremism". I must say that that is highly offensive and is extremely POV. The comment about Barnaby opposing extremism belongs there, and no person who has opposed its placement there has made any argument here, in the discussion as to why it does not. As such, the page should be unprotected, it should be returned and those who kept on removing it should refrain from doing so. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 11:17, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The comments by anonymous Xtra lack logic.</p>
<p>If the preceding sentence before the phrase saying he opposes extremism demonstrates Joyce is not an extremist then there is no need to add the redundancy.</p>
<p>My dictionary defines extremism as "Any political theory favoring immoderate uncompromising policies". Given Joyce's implacable opposition to abortion I think this fits.</p>
<p>If extremism is alternatively defined as the outlier on a normal curve and given that Joyce is among a small minority of a minority in this stance (ie catholics are a minority in Australia and catholics opposing abortion are a minority within catholics), and a tiny minority within the wider Australian population then he is indeed extremist and any attempt to say he is not is merely trying to support him politically.</p>
<p>Further, Joyce has said his main purpose in political life is the single issue of preventing women having choice over their pregnancies - ie preventing them choosing abortion. Such dogmatic attempts to control other people and being so focussed on the single issue is extreme. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 07:08, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may see Joyce as an extremist, however, from the way you are talking, he appears far more to the centre than you. Just because someone does not agree with <b>you</b> and those who share <b>your</b> ideology does not make them extremists and I find your assertion to the contrary highly offensive. Your view is not the only correct view and people like Barnaby Joyce are entitled to have their own oppinions. Or is Australia no longer a democracy with free speech? Or is free speech only reserved for left wing people? I am sick of this hypocracy. You need to respect other's views! The phrase makes perfect sense, fits in, is not POV, and is not superfluous. I am sick of defending articles about normal people against morons who do not accept that someone can hold an opinion unless it is identical to their own. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 07:18, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By the way, 84% of Australians identify themselves as a member of a religion. The largest religion being catholocism with 27%. Gee a lot of extremists in Australia! I mean, get real! <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 07:22, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the phrase belongs in the article, for all the reasons articulated by Extra. I will reinsert the phrase upon unprotection. I won't do it right now, because as an "interested party" (I wrote the article in the first place) it would violate policy for me to edit the article while it is protected. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 09:02, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Anonymous Xtra's personal attack on me violates the wiki code and does little to address the argument. David Gannon's pre-emting of any decision and support for vituperation over logic doesn't help. I request both of you to address the arguments above. In addition, 27% of 84% and then a small minority within the 27% equals the far end of the normal curve. Joyce does not represent the views of the majority of his electorate. I know many catholics and not one supports Joyce's views on abortion. I believe that in addition to addressing the arguments, both anonymous Xtra and David Cannon owe me an apology for this type of behaviour. (Unsigned comment by Mccready)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you owe all people who oppose unnecessary abortion on moral grounds an apology for calling them extremists. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 06:56, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'll justifiably call them extremists too if you like. That said, it is a relative term, and if one actually reads the context of the "not extreme" statement in this article, it makes perfect sense to have it there. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:25, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now at least the discussion begins. yes it can be a relative term and in that sense not very useful. it might be useful if the anti-abortionists would like to put a figure on the percentage of australians who share their POV.

<dd>I agree that the <code>&lt;POV&gt;</code> bizzo was out of line, but the "Unsigned comment by Mccready" is standard practice when somebody forgets to sign their words, to avoid confusion. In both cases, the spirit of your words weren't altered: the POV thing was clearly marked as being David Cannon's work, and the unsigned thing was entirely appropriate. David's problem here was being <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a>, not altering another's text.

<dd>Use of the word 'extreme' (especially in relation to something as controversial as abortion) leans to a particular stance/view and hence is not NPOV. - <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/24px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png" alt="" width="24" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" /></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">G</a><sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">t</a></sup> 06:33, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your gracious apology David, and I apologise for forgetting to sign my post. If we are agreed that saying either someone is extreme or someone is not extreme is indeed POV, then would it be better to leave it out and all get onto doing other things on wikipedia?&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 06:05, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the first time I have dropped by this article for a while, and I'm glad to see you have all been having fun. Can someone tell me what this section is doing in this article?</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to the Cochrane Collabortion Systematic Reviews, medical abortion using RU 486 plus a prostaglandin is both "safe and effective." This is backed up by the World Health Organisation and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Induced abortion, whether done surgically or medically, is according to the WHO one of the safest medical procedures. The risk of mortality from both surgical and medical abortion is around 1:1,000,000.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also the paragraph on VSU is out of date since the bill has now passed. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 16:02, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I put the Cochrane stuff there after someone asked for evidence that Joyce's claim in the Catholic Weekly was incorrect. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 16:16, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've unprotected the article and made the changes you suggested.

<p>I know that this actually took place, but the tone of the text seems somewhat POV. Is there any better way to put the sentence at end of 1st section in more civil tone? --Brynic 06:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see what you mean. I actually don't see anything wrong with Barnaby's actions: There's a difference between doing preference deals, and giving and receiving preferences (Personally I find the former abhorrent). So perhaps the article should make that distinction (although it's already implied). <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 06:41, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Oh wait, it also says he didn't want their preferences at all. I missed that before. That is a little ironic, if that's what he said. Of course, preferences come from voters, not parties (though voting tickets and preference deals subvert this). <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocksong_29c7.html" title="User:Rocksong">Rocksong</a> 07:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Joyce did not give the coalition the majority:</p>
<dl>
<dd>a) he was not the last coalition senator elected for Queensland</dd>
<dd>b) he was elected at the same time as ~ 20 others and has no claim to individualy taking the coalition over the line.</dd>
