<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for your useful intellectual contribution to the Turkish National Security Council page. The following is another request placed at the talk page with some metatagging for improvements. ( 'The author and third party readers are referred to the page history, article history and user history pages regarding why this article is more of a user page, reflecting the views of one single individual who prevents others from legitimate edits and good-faith entries. In respect to his protest, one meta-tag accusing him of misuse of the article as a user page is temporarily removed. The author is encouraged to address in a responsible way in the talk pages to each of the meta tags and mend the deficiencies for consideration of removal of metatag, rather than exhibiting further oppositional defiance.') Your continuing supervision and corrections will be much appreciated. You may remove this message at your convenience. Thank you and have great day.</p>

<dd>Have you looked at the current state of the the article <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian-Turkish_relations_5512.html" title="Armenian-Turkish relations">Armenian-Turkish_relations</a>?? and pls also have a look at its talk page <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmenian-Turkish_relations_bd96.html" title="Talk:Armenian-Turkish relations">talk:Armenian-Turkish_relations</a>... I rewrote it and enriched it, and there is also a comment by the guy who created the article user:Fedayee who confirmed that it was nice editing.. This deletion that u mentioned ONLY took place because I am new to Wikipedia and I didn't have much experience on how editing works.. The current state of the article CLEARLY shows this, that part of the article is still there and it has much more clarity... I have also copy-edited the <a href="../../../p/k/k/PKK_1685.html" title="PKK">PKK</a> article from TOP to BOTTOM, something nobody was willing to do for AGES, if you have any evidence of bias there, pls feel free to change it... Pls stop trolling.. I have lived in Turkey, the US and France (still there) during my life, I went to schools that 99 percent of the people of this world doesn't have the luck to go and I speak three languages fluently, the Hagia Sophia picture definitely DIDN'T piss me off, in fact I see it as a good evidence of how intertwined Turkish and Greek cultures are, and as such, a wealth to be cherished, when I saw the picture, that's not at all what I was thinking, that kind of animosity belongs in the past... ANYONE, Turkish, Greek, French, Russian etc. that puts so many quotes about the greatness of his country is a nationalist, if you can point me to a Turk that has so many quotes on his page, I give you my WORD that I will write on his page exactly what I just wrote. I have not claimed to be the unique (or any) example of democracy and never will... And please let's not skirt the issue, being democratic doesn't mean blindly accepting every political claim of grievance put forward for the sake of political correctness.. You have still not been able to anwser my posts in the talk page... If, for one reason or the other, you got some beef with the Young Turks, pls keep it to yourself UNLESS you got the proof to back it up.. I have not even mentioned or defended, or attacked the Young Turks in any of my postings, where did this come from???? I most probably know about the atrocities that the Young Turks have committed or influenced much more than you do, I have made extensive research on European legal history, as I said I am an international lawyer, I have read hundreds of thousands of pages concerning history, law and philosophy to this day. As i said, again, you don't know me, you don't know what i do in life and you don't know what experiences I had in life to this point.. If you are assuming that all Turks are chauvinistic nationalists, than u r wrong and that's not cool; if u don't however, pls act accordingly.. What I am saying is, however, that allegations have to be substantiated... But, I am definitely not someone to lay down and give people free reign to settle old scores on the other hand, FYI.. If there is enough PROOF of anything, I WILL believe it.. I am an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheist</a> and I believe that the only valid form of proof is the scientific one, and as such, claims have to be proven using the Scientific Method.. Why don't u spend your time trying to answer my posts rather than engaging in ad hominim attacks?? Regards..</dd>

<p>Note: Look, I don't want to create animosity, if I did so, I apologize.. I didn't mean to offend u or anyone... But the inaction on this issue has pushed me over the edge.. If we (or other editors that have shown an interest in this page) cannot engage in a constructive dialogue, I will definitely seek outside help.. Baristarim 23:34, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, as for the quotes, I have said nothing about them or their authors, I don't think that they are Greek nationalists nor do I think that the content of the quotes are incorrect, quite the contrary actually... I repeat again, I don't think that this issue is a who-is-better issue, it only gives me pleasure that such rich cultures have existed and continue to exist in our planet.. What I am SAYING, however, is the EXCESSIVE USE of such quotes by ANYONE about their country would be nationalistic behaviour, that's all. Pls don't try to portray me as a Greek-hater (culturally or individually) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 23:56, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no reason not to believe that the things that u said about yourself are not true. But as i do not personally know u, u also don't personally know me. i did not call u a nationalist, but u did. after personal attacks, now u have just accused me of trolling (first who ever accused me of that!)... Honestly, where do u think i can find good faith to assume? About the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian-Turkish_relations_5512.html" title="Armenian-Turkish relations">Armenian-Turkish relations</a> article and its talk, be sure that i read everything before making that comment here. I also checked the history of the article: u did not do it once <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenian-Turkish_relations&amp;diff=73387085&amp;oldid=72074971" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenian-Turkish_relations&amp;diff=73387085&amp;oldid=72074971" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, but twice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenian-Turkish_relations&amp;diff=73390452&amp;oldid=73388101" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armenian-Turkish_relations&amp;diff=73390452&amp;oldid=73388101" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. And, since u say u have studied philosophy, this is not a good sign: <i>Το δις εξαμαρτείν, ουκ ανδρός σοφού</i>... Don't think that my unwillingness to reply to your last comment on <a href="../../../p/o/n/Talk%7EPontian_Greek_Genocide_92ce.html" title="Talk:Pontian Greek Genocide">Talk:Pontian Greek Genocide</a> is because i "cannot" reply... It is because i am tired in explaining the same things over and over again to the same people. As for my quotes, i have nothing to say... If those who said them are not nationalists, i am not either for reproducing them... If i used negative quotes for the Greeks (cause, of course, such quotes exist too), would i be a greek-hater? lol. Personally i avoid to put 'labels' on people, so i am not gonna call u anything. Nor am i going to accuse all modern Turks for what the Young Turks had done. All i care are the facts, and since they exist, i let them talk in everycase.

<dd>So where does that get us really?? Pfff... We will be going around in circles till the morning, so let's call it quits for a while, I got stuff to do for a couple of days anyways.. I still think that we desperately need some outside review of this; I was talking to a French friend of mine about this today and as soon as I started talking he said 'ah, the Greeks and the Turks again, huh???' As for the article in question, my only intention was to make the article better, since my post on the talk page has been answered, I like its current form. When I said I didn't know the editing process, I meant that I should have probably written it in the talk page, before deleting (I wrote the comment on the talk page right after deletion), that's all, I give you my word of honor on that. I know that Mimar Sinan was most probably a Christian convert to Islam, I heard that when I was 10 from my father..&#160;:) Don't forget, I am just getting the hang of Wiki. lol.. let's try to see the glass as half full.. Hmm, if u could give me the translation of what u wrote, that would be a good start, sadly i don't know any Greek&#160;:)) Well, have a good day... <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 01:01, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that everything can be solved through dialogue, so i generally tend to be optimistic in any aspect of my life. About the article in question, i believe u that u had no bad intentions. This is what i believed at first place anyway... but I wanted to saw u that jumbing in conclusions and characterizations about other wikipedians is very easy... U are new here... u will learn things on time... (i have to admit that when i came in wikipedia i was somewhat close minded, not been very willing to see the views of the others). About Sinan, i have visited many times a work of his here in Greece. According to most accounts he was a christian convert to islam... According to my POV (and most of these accounts), he was not Armenian, but Greek:). however, i am not pushing my POV... The translation of what i said: 'making the same mistake twice, is not a wise man's characteristic'. Sorry if i had been too aggressive in some of my posts. Have a nice good day too and welcome in Wikipedia (since i have not welcomed u so far:)...) --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 01:21, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Baristarim. Sorry I couldn't respond earlier, I've been pretty busy in real life lately. It seems that you've worked things out with Hectorian, but of course the <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontian_Greek_Genocide_8ec9.html" title="Pontian Greek Genocide">larger issue</a> remains unsolved. When I first saw that article back in May, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pontian_Greek_Genocide&amp;oldid=52607249" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pontian_Greek_Genocide&amp;oldid=52607249" rel="nofollow">this</a> is what it looked like. I think it's imporved in neutrality since then, but of course still needs a lot of work. BTW, in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> article, the link worked for me. Am I missing something here?</p>
<p>I saw your work on the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana.html" title="Adana">Adana</a> article, <b>teşekkür ederim</b>!&#160;:) That page badly needed copyediting, as it was written mainly by a user who's English was...very bad.

I will try to attempt it when I am in Istanbul actually, I am going there for one week this Wednesday.. Then I will also try to <i>neutralize</i> some extremely sensitive subject matter, such as the section about the football clubs of Istanbul.

<dd>As for the <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontian_Greek_Genocide_8ec9.html" title="Pontian Greek Genocide">Pontian Greek Genocide</a> article, I am actually trying to come up with ideas.. The best thing in my opinion would be the involvement of some trusted and impartial members of Wiki community who can contribute not just their ideas and views, but also their time and efforts by revamping the article from its current version and making the appropriate changes to make this an ordinary encyclopedic entry.. I don't know if the way forward is mediation, arbitration, dialogue etc.. On the other hand, I am worried about the consequences of this article if it stays in its current state.. I don't like the idea that a badly written article has the potential to pit Greeks against Turks. Look what happenned between me and Hectorian. If we met on the street most probably we would have gotten along extremely well from the start. <i>Fortunately</i> things calmed down. That's my worry at this point more than anything else. We simply deserve a better article. The best way is always letting complete strangers investigate the matter at hand, ex letting China-Japan wars to be investigated by a South American etc. Again that's my POV&#160;:))) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 20:25, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've referred to the guidelines and naming conventions which I advise you to familiarise yourself with, my comments were not against you but towards some of your edits. Although you do have a point concerning the translation of words into English, you must not remember that as an encyclopedia, Wikipedia's editors have made a point ot be precise and accurate, as well as sourced. Most politcal and geographical terms are used in their original form as they do not literally exist translated, only in similar term. Commune and region are two examples of terms not translated as they are the official naming of administrative division, as are counties (where the French, comtés, equivalent exists).

<p>Hi. First of all, I thank you very much for valuing my input. As I have said, however, that was my one and ONLY contribution to the debate. I <i><b>truly</b></i> don't care who "wins", I just want the title that *I* think is the least POV -- and after reading through the debate, I think that the suggestion that I re-iterated suits that description. Lest you take this as an indication of me supporting your point of view, please be advised (and I mean no offense) that I think that <i>you</i> have been the most inflammatory party in the debate. Whether you are right or wrong, I don't know -- and frankly I don't care very much -- but PLEASE keep a cool head when responding to others, and regardless of whether you think there's a Greek conspiracy writing the article (which I might actually agree with), please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Personally, I think I agree in part with <a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a>, who (in my humble opinion) has responded to all attacks very level-headedly, simply asking for <b>independent</b> facts. Whether or not I agree with the article's contents, it <i><b>MUST</b></i> be backed by independent facts. I will resolutely refuse to get involved in this debate on the talk page. But please, please, <i>please</i> take my advice to heart. I am really not meaning to criticize your beliefs or anything, and I am sure you hold them very strongly. To Wikipedia, however, this is (I am sorry to say) totally and utterly irrelevant. If it weren't, there's a lot that I would have contributed to a number of articles. I CANNOT, though -- I am inherently biased on <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Paisley_879b.html" title="Ian Paisley">1</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Adams_0812.html" title="Gerry Adams">2</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mair%C3%A9ad_Farrell_9f3a.html" title="Mairéad Farrell">3</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Sands_2dc2.html" title="Bobby Sands">4</a>, etc.. I hope you understand that I was just trying to offer what _should_ be a totally neutral alternative to all the bickering. And again, it wasn't my suggestion in the first place. If it gets accepted, all credit for defusing the debate should go to <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilhan_1962.html" title="User:Kilhan">User:Kilhan</a>.

<p>Merhaba.&#160;:) You are correct, the dispute tags should stay up. You should also not give up...you really haven't been here for that long! Regarding <a href="http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2000/zn071800.html" class="external text" title="http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2000/zn071800.html" rel="nofollow">Panayiotis Diamadis</a>, it should definately be phrased in the "according to..." manner. I see nothing wrong with that. Therefore, please <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and attribute the source properly. Hopefully you do it at a time when I'm online, so I can monitor whether an edit war is going to brake out or not. Anything else?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Firstly apologies for the late reply, i've been away on a break. As you know the article does need a new title and also a complete rewrite, but there is strong opposition to this from the editors there. All i have asked for is impartial sources, these have not been provided simply because they do not exist. There really is little reason other than Greek opinion to allow that article to continue in its current state. When i have time i will get involved in the discussion again, thanks --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 09:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, I am very very busy those days and will be busy before late. I admit that article need a heavy rewrite and probably a name change. I just could not understand the Greek conributors here on Wikipedia, there are plenty of available materials published about the fire of Smyrna and they are short of contributing there, but they seem really attracted by an article which current state rander it compleatly useless and unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:30, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, and welcome back. i've waited a looong time to hear from a Turk honestly saying that he wishes the re-openning of the Theological School of Halki... I do not know, maybe cause u live in liberal France?:). I have read, watched and heard many things about religious freedom in Turkey (mostly about the Greek Orthodox, of course). But nothing can drive me more crazy, than some speeches of Turkish politicians! e.g., i heard today Erdogan talking about the 'religious persecution of the Muslims in W.Thrace' cause they do not elect their muftis! <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 02:27, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a differene between trying and managing to. Your messages and their subsequent deletions were premeditated in my view. If they weren't, you wouldn't have repeated the same action twice; one in the article talk and one in Mitsos' talk. If it makes a difference to you, I have some Turkish wiki-friends; we even exchanged raki/ouzo over DHL. I also dissapprove extremity, whichever side it may come from. All in all, I understand your frustration, but I don't understand your action. In any case, you weren't angry because he vandalised, as you say, but because of his userpage, as you had said then.</p>
<p>And "vandalism" is a double-edged knife, I'm afraid. Both removing tags from really disputed articles and adding them to non-disputed ones can be considered as such. This is a content dispute, and Mitsos (with whom I disagree for his views) did what he thought was 'removal of vandalism'. Since you and A.Garnet are so persistent in this, you'll have to state your reasons. And be damn certain that these reasons are going to be adequately responded.

<dd>If you bother to take a look at the etymology page of Istanbul, you ll see the Greek name. If there had been a big Greek population in Istanbul, it would be logical to have it in Istanbul article. But, there are less than 2000 Greeks in Istanbul. In Thessaloniki article, the Turkish name should have been placed in the etymology or history section. Actually, it was in the history section a month ago. What is your reason to have the Greek name in the first sentence of the Istanbul article? Osmanaral 03:11, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have seen that you endorsed the Telex's view. Calm down - you are very excited.&#160;:) Who is moving who in Istanbul? That's not my worry. What are you talking about?&#160;:D And, am I so offensive? I am not changing the Istanbul article as you see now. I am trying to see your logic of having the Greek name in the first sentence of the article even though it is in the etymology page. The Istanbul article is not only for Greeks or Turkish. Adding the Greek name in the first sentence is only to the favor of Greeks. And, it is Greek chauvinism. If you are saying that it is for historical reasons, the Constantinople is more appropriate - which was used worldwide.

<p>Hi, Baristarim. I've had a quick look to your recent contributions to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Turkey_49d2.html" title="Constitution of Turkey">Constitution of Turkey</a> article. I think the article is a lot improved now and the information you added seems comprehensive, well done!</p>
<p>Having said that, I have a few remarks / suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article still lacks a history section and there is still no mention of the previous constitutions of Turkey. I see on your userpage that you are a lawyer from Turkey, so I guess you should know better than me about <a href="../../../../tr/1/9/2/1921_Anayasas%C4%B1_253f.html" class="extiw" title="tr:1921_Anayasası">tr:1921 Anayasası</a>, <a href="../../../../tr/1/9/2/1924_Anayasas%C4%B1_77e8.html" class="extiw" title="tr:1924_Anayasası">tr:1924 Anayasası</a>, and others. There should definitely be a mention of the first constitution by the first <a href="../../../t/b/m/TBMM_d22e.html" title="TBMM">TBMM</a> and all the following revisions up to the current one.</li>
<li>It could also be good to create English versions of the articles on the Turkish Wikipedia I linked above and refer to these from within the main article.</li>
<li>The external link you provided for the ratification of UDHR does not seem to work.</li>

<p>Hi again. I checked the new UN reference regarding the UDHR. And it's good that you added the date of ratification (the reason I did click on the link was to find the ratification date and incorporate that into the paragraph).

<p>Hi, Baristarim. I think it's not a good practice to leave a portion of Turkish text in an article on the main namespace of the English wikipedia (obviously, when not a quotation or something). That looks pretty bad and I'm sure it's against several guidelines as well. The better way to do it is to create a subpage under your <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a> and transfer the work to the article space when it's ready (or at least, totally in the target language).

<p>Hello Baristarim, and thanks for the message:). Firstly, don't say that u are offended with the comparison i made with N. Korea. i avoid making personal attacks, and if someone saying something against Kemal, it is certainly <b>not</b> a personal attack for a Turk. i am not sure if he was the one who said that the sumerians were turks, but i am sure that he said that turks are aboriginal in Anatolia, so that was more or less what my the comment was about, and this what the turkish schoolbooks say (no need to mention that this is unhistorical and stupid...). don't be so sure that greek politicians ever said <i>Greece for the Greeks</i> that time... i've never heard it. as for his worship in Turkey today, i wouldn't say that "it is just some people", but it is just the state and army that are trying to make him appear as a "god". listen, there is no country in the world that did not have a national leader. and all the national leaders of each country contributed the most for the independance and freedom and democracy of their people... Italy had Garibaldi (the man who unified the country), Greece had Venizelos (the strongest leader we had), France had de Gaul (who liberated France from the Nazis), USA had Washington. but in <b>no</b> other country the portraits of a leader are in every single state building, in every single school (large portraits in the entrance!), in various places in the cities, in army camps, in coffee shops, etc etc; in no other country that leader and his ideas are mentioned by the media and the politicians that much and in every occasion. i know that Turkey needs to support his "personal cult"... for internal reasons. As for the 'Megali Idea', me, all the people i know here, and also the greek schoolbooks and politicians, do not like him, not cause he "single-handedly stopped the Megali Idea"... the 'Megali Idea' was a historical and political concept, for the Greeks, what made the most difference and harm, and what they do not like kemal and his ideas for, is the expulsion, extermination and uprooting of the Asia Minor Greeks. <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 01:45, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am definitely not giving up for the moment, but I had enough of this minimization of Turks, u know, if you let some people have their way, they would get away with all sorts of historical revisionism.. There are way too many judgements passed <i>Azeris are Iranian people that speak Turkish</i>?? Azeris are not Iranian people that speak Turkish.. They might be Persian, but they are definitely NOT Iranian.. <b>It is like claiming that ancient Romans are all Italians!!!</b> French and Spanish are all originally (more or less) Roman, but they are NOT Italian.. I am just saying that you become aware of some other types of POV pushing that is taking place, some people make so that Turks are Iranians originally.. Nothing can be farther than the truth.. Iranians are shias whereas Turks are Sunni, so much for same culture, same religion..

<dd>I know pov pushing has become quite an issue lately with Turkish related articles. I try my best to get my argument across, but it really is tiring. I mean this is an encylopedia, and i really dont have time to chase after nationalist edits all day. Its a shame Wikiproject Turkey has become inactive, perhaps someone could restart it by getting people to work on a article to FA status, at least that would be constructive and not a waste of time like it arguing with people who simply will not compromise their nationalist views. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 13:27, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do whatever you want. But be clear that we will undo it. Changing the name of the article to "Seljuq dynasty" was voted and agreed upon, you can't just switch it back to "Seljuq Turks", only because your nationalistic feelings are hurt.</p>
<p>Your threats are meaningless to me and only prove that you lack sources and evidences. I have quotes authirtative sources - namely <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a>, and if you delete these sources only because of your nationalistic behaviour, be sure that admins will ban you.</p>
<p>The Seljuqs were a dynasty, and this article is about the dynasty, not about their Turkic ancestry. Many other articles, like the <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavid_dynasty.html" title="Safavid dynasty">Safavid dynasty</a> and <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghaznavid_Empire_1e98.html" title="Ghaznavid Empire">Ghaznavid Empire</a>, have the same lemma. If youn't stand that, it's your own problem, not that of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The way you are talking, the total lack of sources, your failure to provide a SINGLE OFFICIAL Seljuq source written in Turkish, or a single proof that the Seljuqs were Turkic-speaking ... all of these point to the fact that your major aim is to push for nationalistic POV. We have dealt with these kinds of Pan-Turkic nonsense before, and we will deal with it again.</p>
<p>This is not Turkey, where every intellectual is put into prison because of "insulting the Turkish nation".</p>

<dd>Well, you can blame me for being a pan-turkist or whatever, but pls take a look at my user page, as well, I am atheist, and a well educated man such as you would know that atheists don't become pan-turkists, nor pan-turkists want them to do so.. I am also a communist, so throwing out such insults by calling me nationalistic POV pusher is also inappropriate.. Seljuq dynasty can be discussed under Seljuk Turks.. Please look at what I posted on the talk page of the article, I also put sources about Seljuk dynasty being Turks, and not from some loony encyclopedia like enc:Iran<i>ica</i> (ica??) but from Encyclopaedia Brittanica, whatever you might believe I bring my sources with me when I talk, Brittanica also refers to Seljuks as a <i>Muslim Turkmen</i> dynasty, when I will add these to the article, they will all be well-sourced from Britannica and others.. And don't warn me like I am some sort of school boy, I most probably know more about the world and travelled it more than you have.. I know wikipedia, I never said I was going to remove any sources, everything that I will add have proper and good sources (not the weirdo Iranica encyc, Brittanica is ten times better than that <i>supposed</i> encyc), read my posts on the talk page before trying to push your pan-iranist views.. This is also not afganistan where everyone makes a living by the death of young people (heroin) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 14:33, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not care what you are and what you believe in. But it's very clear that you are pushing for a pan-turkic POV. Only the fact that you call the renowned and well-respected <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> "loony" (which, btw, is the standard speech of ALL Pan-Turkists in Wikipedia) proves that you are no expert on this issue, and that you are only here, because your Turkish-nationalistic feelings are hurt.</dd>
<dd>I do not care ... I am neither Turk, nor Iranian. I am from Afghanistan, born to a mixed <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijani_people.html" title="Azerbaijani people">Azeri</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtun.html" title="Pashtun">Pashtun</a> family (that's why I chose the neutral name "Tajik"), and I am into oriental studies in real life.</dd>
<dd>I am only interested in the credibility of Wikipedia, and it just happens that in almost ALL Wikipedias, the articles related to Turks are totally messed up by Turkic nationalists. In the German Wikipedia, for examples, more than 100 articles were deleted because it was totally impossible to repait the mess. Several Turkish members were banned, including user <a href="../../../../de/p/o/s/Benutzer%7EPostmann_Michael_2f51.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Postmann_Michael">de:Benutzer:Postmann Michael</a> who has created most of the maps and graphs regarding Turkic history.</dd>
<dd>The English Wikipdia is not that wose, but it constantly being attacked by Pan-Turkist trolls.</dd>
<dd>You reject the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a>, well, that's your problem ... leading experts on Oriental studies have a totally different opinion (see: <a href="http://iranica.com/opinion/main.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://iranica.com/opinion/main.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>), and you can be sure about it that Wikipedia admins rather go with credible sources than some wanna-be experts who actually know nothing about the Seljuqs or Muslim history. You have already disqualified yourself by proving that you do not even know the difference between "Persian" and "Iranian".</dd>

<dd>And you have already disqualified yourself by not responding to what Britannica says <i>a Muslim Turmen dynasty</i> and <i>Seljuq Turks (seljuk-seljuq don't matter).. You are also here because your nationalistic views are hurt for some reason.. Turkey or Turkish people don't need a wikipedia article to tell them what is their history, so I couldn't care less about my nationalistic feelings getting hurt. You have also disqualified yourself by not understanding the difference between pan-turkist and communist and that they are completely incompatible.. Your attempts to discredit others by name calling won't get you anywhere mr pust-un. I also don't care where you are and what you do (hopefully not afganistan though as pointed above&#160;:)) but you also don't understand the fact that Iranians cannot impose on the English language, please go to a law and political sciences school to learn why Persian and Iranian would not be the same thing in English.. You can pretend that your definitions are valid, but so far you have not responded to my comments in the talk page.. I have my sources, Brittanica clearly refers to them as Seljuq Turks and as a Muslim Turkmen dynasty.. Even if your claims are true about iranica, Brittanica is still the standard as an encyclopaedia and your claim that</i> they are some wanna-be experts who actually know nothing about the Seljuks or Muslim history <i>(which, BTW, is the standard speech of ALL Pan-iranists in wikipedia) is not valid.. I will also add what I have mentioned about definitions with proper sourcing, and if you remove them be sure that admins will ban you. I have dealt with pan-iranism before and be sure that I will deal with it again.. This is also not the country where we build nukes in our garage so stop trolling... <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 15:04, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>You totally miss the point, Baristarim. The discussion is not about the Turkic origin of the Seljuqs which has NEVER been disputed (see the very first sentense of the article: <i>The Seljuqs ... Muslim dynasty of Oghuz Turkic descent that ruled parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to 14th centuries.</i>) The discussion is about wether the Seljuqs were still Turkic-speaking after decades of rule in Persia, or wether they were linguistically assimilated by the Persian majority, the same way the British and Dutch royals were assimilated by their subjects. THIS IS THE POINT. Your quotes from Britannica do NOT ANSWER this question. You cann call them "Seljuk Turks", "Seljuk Turkomans", or whatever you want ... this still does NOT answer the question.</dd>
<dd>You purposely ignore FACTS that there is not A SINGLE HISTORICAL DOCUMENT left from the Seljuq era that was written in Turkish.</dd>
<dd>Comparing the Seljuqs to other Iranian royals of Turkic origin, it seems clear that the Seljuqs, too, were assimilated by the Persians just as did the <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghaznavids.html" title="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/k/Ilkhan.html" title="Ilkhan">Ilkhans</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timurids.html" title="Timurids">Timurids</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughals.html" title="Mughals">Mughals</a>, <a href="../../../q/a/j/Qajars.html" title="Qajars">Qajars</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/h/Pahlavi_dynasty.html" title="Pahlavi dynasty">Pahlavis</a>. This was nothing uncommon in that region, because almost ALL ruling houses sooner or later adopted the Persian language as their "house languages". Even the Pashtun kings of Afghanistan, the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barakzai_Dynasty_e0cf.html" title="Barakzai Dynasty">Muhammadzai</a>, had become Persian-speaking, to en extent that the last king of Afghanistan, <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahir_Shah_df9c.html" title="Zahir Shah">Zahir Shah</a> - though nominally a Muhammadzai <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtun.html" title="Pashtun">Pashtun</a> - does not even know Pashto.</dd>
<dd>What you are doing is very clearly a push for a Pan-Turkist POV. You may call yourself "communist", but your writing prove that in real you are a Turkish nationalist, ignoring facts!</dd>
<dd>Instead of quoting useless sentenses from Britannica (which have nothing to do with this discussion), try to find authoritative and historical documents proving that the Seljuqs remained Turkic-speaking! You own opinion and words are nothing but hot-air!</dd>
<dd>As for the spelling: it's <b>Seljuq</b>, not the modern Turkish pronounciation "Selcük". The "S" is pronounced like the "s" in "super", the&#160;!q" is pronounced like the "q" in "Qur'an". Modern Turkish pronounces the name wrong, because certain Altaic intonations have been lost in that language.</dd>

<p>Well, {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistory_of_Iran_6211.html" title="Template:History of Iran">History of Iran</a>}} is vertical (if it was at the bottom it would leave a lot of extra white space).

Herneyse konu bu degil.</p>
<p>dog)Buyukanit olayinda, Hukumet'in birkac "kraldan daha kralci" bakanini saymazsak, kendisi de dahil kimse "Sabetayist degildir" demedi. Evet herkes sabetayist oldugu gerekcesiyle engellenmeye calisilmasina karsi cikti, kopurdu, doldu tasti. Ancak iddiayi bertaraf etmek icin Fatih Cekirge'nin sundugu Filistin Cephesi argumanindan baska bir sey yok ortada. Oysa secere malum. Kimse o konuda agzini acmiyor. Isim gelenegi de bizzat Ilgaz Zorlu'nun degindigi bir konu. Mesela, Fethullah Gulen icin bu tur iddilar ortaya atildiginda avukati cikip aninda tekzip etmis ve Gulen'in seceresini aciklamistir. Buyukanit laiklik ve teror konusunda asiri hassas diyerek topu taca atmak, avukatin "F.G. vatansever ve egitim duskunu bir din adamidir" demesi gibidir, zira konu laik veya pkk karsiti olup olmamasi degil burada, sabetayist olup olmadigi...</p>
<p>Konu hakkinda biraz arastirma yapmis olsaniz, ordu ve disleri'nde sabetayist oldugu iddia edilen hayli komutan ve elci oldugunu bilirsiniz. Turkiye-Israil iliskilerinin de (Filistin yanlisi musluman ve sosyalistler ezici cogunlukta olmasina ragmen) temelde ordu ve disisleri uzerinden sekillendigi zaten malumunuzdur.</p>
<p>Bu konu benim icin o kadar da onemli degildi esasinda, ancak sizin o satira obsesif yaklasmaniza da sasirdim acikcasi. Sabetayist iseniz, dindasinizin dinini inkar etmek yerine Ilgaz Zorlu gibi durustce gercekleri kabul edip, kendi inancinizi Buyukanit gibi medya figurleri uzerinden kamuoyu onunde daha sempatiklestirmeyi deneyebilir, inanc ozgurlugu semsiye altina gorebilirsiniz. Ya da hic ugrasmadan "OK, he is Sabbetean. But, so what?" diyebilirsiniz. Turkiye, laik bir ulke nihayetinde...</p>
<p>Sabetayist degilseniz, "Buyukanit, (buraya "bircok gazeteciye gore" ifadesini eklemeyi dusunuyorum, dilerseniz link de verebilirim) sert 31 Agustos konusmasinda bile sabetayist iddialarini tekzip etmedi" satirindan nicin o kadar rahatsiz oluyorsunuz?..</p>

Siz herhalde o cumlenin ingilizce'de ifade etmis oldugu seyin farkinda degilsiniz ve de buranin bir gazete veya blog olmadigini anlamadiniz.. Burasi bir ansiklopedi, bu da demektir ki bazi seylerin yazilmasi için arkasinda bilimsel kanitlar olmasi gerekir.. Buyukanit'in Yahudi veya herhangi birsey olmasi birsey ifade etmez, eger Turk'um diyorsa o da Turk'tur, gerisi beni ilgilendirmez, ayrica Turkiye laiktir, isteyen insan istedigi dine sahip olabilir.. Fethullah Gulen'le Buyukanit'i karsilastirmaniz bile dusundurucu, Gulen gibi orospu cocuklariyla ayni kategoriye girdigini dusunmuyorum ama tabi o sizin dusunceniz.. Dedigim gibi, yanit vermemis olmasi hic bir sey ifade etmez, siz ilk once onun sebatik olduguna dair Osmanli arsivlerinden, bilimsel kanitlar getirin, o zaman istediginiz seyi ekleyebilirsiniz, burasi bir ansiklopedi lutfen unutmayin, birkaç Islamci sitede lagaluga yapildi diye buraya eklenecek degildir... Sebatik olsaydim, inanin bana derdim, sizden izin alacak degilim...</p>

<p>Kusuru bakmayin, sanirim onceki mesajim fazla sert idi. Nitekim sizin de gittikce nahos bir uslup takindiginizi goruyorum. Dilerseniz biraz ara verelim. Uzerinde anlasacagimiz onlarca ulusal mesele (Amerika'da yasayan Turkler olarak birlikte savunacagimiz onca arguman) varken, Buyukanit'in sabetayist olup olmamasina takili kalmayi dogru bulmuyorum, ozellikle de henuz gerekli nezaket kivamini yakalayamamisken...

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Turkey restructure</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I have to say i'm not a big fan of the restructuring of the page. It doesn't seem logical to have the Geography first. If you look at other Feature Article pages such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> you'll see that History, Politics, Foreign relations/Military, Geography, Economics, Demographics, Culture etc seems to be the best sequence. Let me know what you think, thanks --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 23:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah i'd like to get Turkey to FA status, I think the basics of whats needed is there. Will need more referencing, better prose, more concise explanations, balancing out (e.g. shortening Economics, expanding culture etc), fewer but high quality pictures. It needs work, but like i say i think the foundation is there. Hopefully we can sort it out, thanks --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 00:01, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont know if Origin or Etymology is better, can be either i guess. As for the sub-articles, i dont think their quality has an effect on the Turkey article for FA status.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your recent edits</span></h2>
<p>Stop messing up the articles <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timurids.html" title="Timurids">Timurids</a> and- especially - <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>. Your recent edit in <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> was totally unnecessairy, because that information is already given in the article:</p>
<p><i>... He was born on February 14, 1483 in the town of Andijan, in the Fergana Valley which is in modern Uzbekistan. He was the eldest son of Omar Sheikh Mīrzā, ruler of the Fergana Valley - who he described as "short and stout, round-bearded and fleshy faced", and his wife Qutlugh Nigar Khanum. Although Babur hailed from the Barlas tribe which was of Mongol origin, his tribe had embraced Turkic and Persian culture[2][3] (see Turco-Mongol, Turco-Persian), converted to Islam and resided in Turkestan and Khorasan. His mother tongue was the Chaghatai language (known to Babur as Tōrkī, "Turkish") and he was equally at home in Persian, the lingua franca of the Timurid elite[4]; he wrote his famous memoirs, the Baburnama, in the former language, that of his birthplace. ...</i></p>
<p>The article <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> was mostly written by <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">User:Sikandarji</a> who is an expert on Indian and Central Asian history and <u>who holds lectures at Oxford</u></p>
<p>Your information about Timur is wrong - Britannica has made a mistake. Authoritative sources, such as the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> (see the article <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timur.html" title="Timur">Timur</a>; B.F. Manz, "Tīmūr Lang", in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Online Edition, 2006) call him "Mongol" and underline this with other authoritative sources. Even minor encyclopaedias, such as the <i>The Columbia Encyclopedia</i> (published by the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>) call him "Mongol" (<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/ti/Timurids.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/ti/Timurids.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>).</p>
<p>Babur's upbringing was not Turkic but Persian. See F. Lehman (who is one of the leading experts on Mughal history, and an author of the <i>Journal of the American Oriental Society</i>) in his "Zaher ud-Din Babor" (<a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a>, page 320ff): <i>... His origin, milieu, training, and culture were steeped in Persian culture and so Babor was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural infleunce in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results ...</i> <a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/pdfarticles/v3_articles/babor_zahir-al-din_mohammad&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/logs/pdfdownload.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/pdfarticles/v3_articles/babor_zahir-al-din_mohammad&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/logs/pdfdownload.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 02:29, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Only your claim that the "<a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> is only about Iranian history and has nothing to do with Babur" (which is total nonsense, because a) Babur and his tribe were part of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Iran_9eef.html" title="Greater Iran">Iranian culture and geography</a>, and b) the Iranica is a master-piece for the entile field of Oriental studies! For example: it has the most detailed information about the <a href="../../../o/g/h/Oghuz_Turks_8aeb.html" title="Oghuz Turks">Oghuz Turks</a> than any other Encyclopaedia: <a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v11f2/v11f2076.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v11f2/v11f2076.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>). And I am leaving out the fact that you are rejecting the work of Prof. F. Lehman. Who are you to say that Prof. F. Lehman is wrong?! If Iranica has nothing to do with Babur, then how come "Britannica" has anything to do with him?! Has Babur ever been in Britain?! (*irony*) And what about the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a>?! Is that encyclopaedia wrong, too, because "Babur was a Turk and not a Muslim"?
<dl>
<dd>Babur's memoirs (which also includes 20 poems in Persian, as well as small texts in poems) do not define his ethnicty. If that were the case, then his children would be Persian, because his daughter - Gulbdana Begum - wrote her famous <i>Humayun-Nama</i> in Persian (that much about your claim that the Mughals (a word which means "Mongol") were "Turkic")! <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 03:06, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. sorry for the misunderstanding, and i trust u that u will <i>keep your word</i>:). in fact it really seemed that u were disputing <i>the existance</i> of the article. i do not speak german either, but, as a post in <a href="../../../p/o/n/Talk%7EPontian_Greek_Genocide_92ce.html" title="Talk:Pontian Greek Genocide">Talk:Pontian Greek Genocide</a> says, it got deleted there. so, having in mind that another user said will propose this one for deletion, u simply seemed to think this way too. as for its deletion in german wikipedia, for which u said <i>not to say that it happened cause of the many Turks who live there/speak German</i>, i consider it at least as valid (always having in mind the differences and importance of these cases, which i am trying to give some "stupid" balance:)...) as the US states' recognitions: u claimed that it is all due to the greek lobby, but u also say that the turkish lobby in germany is "innocent"... About the whole 'grey wolves'-'pan turkist'-'nationalist' talking that has been taken place recently, have in mind that for some users (me included) all these along with 'kemalist' are synonymous. And, cause i just noticed your comment in Tekleni's talk, i can't understand how it is possible for someone to be 'communist' and 'kemalist' at the same time...
