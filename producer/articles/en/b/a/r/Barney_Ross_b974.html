<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Ross_b974.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Dov-Ber (or Beryl) Rasofsky was born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> to Isidore "Itchik" Rasofsky and Sarah Epstein Rasofsky. His father was a Talmudic scholar who had emigrated to America from his native Brest-Litovsk after barely surviving a pogrom. In America, Isidore became a <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a> and store owner.</p>
<p>The Rasofsky family later moved from New York to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, living on its west side, which at the time was a Jewish <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghetto.html" title="Ghetto">ghetto</a>. The young Beryl Rasofsky grew up on Chicago's mean streets, ignoring his beloved father's admonition that Jews do not fight back.</p>
<p>"'Let the atheists be the fighters,'" Ross later recalled being told by his father. "'The trumbeniks, the murderers - we are the scholars.'" Ross' ambition in life was to become a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> teacher and a <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmudic</a> scholar, but his life was changed forever when, at the age of 13, his father was shot dead resisting a robbery at his small grocery. Prostrate from grief, his mother Sarah suffered a nervous breakdown and his younger siblings -- Ida, Sam and George -- were placed in an orphanage or farmed out to other members of the extended family. Barney and his brothers Maurice and Benjamin were left to their own devices.</p>
<p>In the wake of the tragedy, Beryl became vindictive towards everything and turned his back on the orthodox religion of his father. He began running around with local toughs (including another wayward Jewish ghetto kid, the future <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Ruby_12b9.html" title="Jack Ruby">Jack Ruby</a>), developing into a street brawler, thief and money runner; for a time he was even employed by <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capone_36a3.html" title="Al Capone">Al Capone</a>.</p>
<p>Thinking that he would need good money to try to get his family back together, the young Rasofsky became an amateur boxer. He pawned a series of awards and set the money aside for his family. Before he turned professional, his mother had returned to her senses and, as she deeply opposed boxing, he started using the name of "Barney Ross" as an alias. Strong, fast and possessed of a powerful will, Ross was soon a Golden Gloves championship and went on to dominate the lighter divisions as a pro.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Ross_b974.html" title="Edit section: Boxing career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Boxing career</span></h2>
<p>His first paid fight was on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, when he beat Ramon Lugo by a decision in six rounds. After ten wins in a row, he lost for the first time, to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Garcia_d5b6.html" title="Carlos Garcia">Carlos Garcia</a>, on a decision in ten.</p>
<p>Over the next 35 bouts, his record was 32–1–2, including a win over former world champion Bat Battalino, and, interestingly enough, one over a <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxer</a> named <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, like the legendary <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> player. Another legendary bout included former world champion Cameron Welter. Then, in <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_26.html" title="March 26">March 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, Ross was given his first shot at a world title, when he faced world Lightweight and Jr. Welterweight champion and fellow three divisions world champions club member <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Canzoneri_30a3.html" title="Tony Canzoneri">Tony Canzoneri</a> in Chicago. In only one night, Ross became a two division world champion when he beat Canzoneri by a decision in ten rounds. It should be pointed out that Ross campaigned heavily in the city of Chicago. After two more wins, including a <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knockout.html" title="Knockout">knockout</a> in six over Johnny Farr, Ross and Canzoneri boxed again, and Ross won again by decision, but this time in 15.</p>
<p>Ross was known as a smart fighter with great stamina. He retained his title by decision against Sammy Fuller to finish 1933, and against Peter Nebo to begin <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>. Then he defended against former world champion Frankie Klick, against whom he drew in ten. Then came the first of three bouts versus <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McLarnin_db46.html" title="Jimmy McLarnin">Jimmy McLarnin</a>. Ross vacated the Jr. Welter title to go after McLarnin's belt and won by a 15 round decision, joining the three division world champions club. However, in a rematch a few weeks later, McLarnin beat Ross by a decision recovering the title, and after that, Ross went back down to the Jr. Weterweights and reclamed his title in a fight for the belt left vacant by himself, with a 12 round decision over <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Pacho_149e.html" title="Bobby Pacho">Bobby Pacho</a>. After beating Klick and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Woods_e496.html" title="Henry Woods">Henry Woods</a> by decision to retain that title, he went back up in weight for the last fight in his trilogy with McLarnin, and recovered the title by outpointing McLarnin again over 15 rounds. He won 16 bouts in a row after that, including three over future world Middleweight champion <a href="../../../c/e/f/Ceferino_Garcia_feb3.html" title="Ceferino Garcia">Ceferino Garcia</a>, and one against Al Manfredo. His only two defenses, however, on that stretch were against Garcia and against <a href="../../../i/z/z/Izzy_Jannazzo_4b50.html" title="Izzy Jannazzo">Izzy Jannazzo</a> beaten on points in 15.</p>
<p>In his last fight, Ross defended his title, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, against the fellow member of the three division world champions' club <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Armstrong_14af.html" title="Henry Armstrong">Henry Armstrong</a> who beat him by a decision in 15.</p>
<p>Ross retired with a record of 72 wins, 4 losses, 3 draws and 2 no-contests, with 22 wins by way of knockout.</p>

<p>In retirement in his early thirties, Ross decided to fight in World War II and joined the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marine_Corps_e7db.html" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>. However, the Marines wanted to keep him stateside, because they wanted him to teach boxing to the trainees. He waived off the licensing, however, choosing to go to training instead, and, upon graduation, he was sent to fight overseas. He was sent to <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guadalcanal.html" title="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>, where one night, he and three other comrades were trapped under enemy fire. All three of his fellow Marines were wounded, as was Ross, but he withstood the attack, shooting about 400 bullets and throwing 22 <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand_grenade.html" title="Hand grenade">grenades</a> at his attackers, killing 20 of the enemy. Two of the Marines with him had died in the battle, but he carried the remaining man on his shoulders to safety; the other man weighed 230&#160;lb (104&#160;kg) compared to Ross' 140&#160;lb (64&#160;kg). Because of his heroism, Ross was awarded America's third highest military honor, the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Star_18bc.html" title="Silver Star">Silver Star</a>.</p>

<p>During his recovery at the hospital from his wounds suffered in that battle, Ross developed a habit for the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphine.html" title="Morphine">morphine</a> administered for pain. This habit became so bad he would sometimes spend $500 a day on the drug. Ross went to a recovery center and beat his addiction. He gave lectures to high school students about the dangers of drug addiction. In 1957, Ross' life and battle with addiction were depicted in the film <i>Monkey on My Back</i>, directed by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_De_Toth_13fd.html" title="André De Toth">André De Toth</a> and starring <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameron_Mitchell_%28actor%29_c937.html" title="Cameron Mitchell (actor)">Cameron Mitchell</a> as Ross.</p>

<p>Ross spent his last days doing a few things outside boxing. He was happy he reached the two goals he had set to reach: reunite his family and become a world champion in boxing. He wrote an autobiography titled <i>No Man Stands Alone</i>, and he had a role as an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a> in the movie <i><a href="../../../r/e/q/Requiem_for_a_Heavyweight_daf4.html" title="Requiem for a Heavyweight">Requiem for a Heavyweight</a></i>. He was also a strong advocate for the creation and survival of the State of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>.</p>
<p>Ross died in his hometown Chicago when he was 57 years old. He is a member of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Boxing_Hall_Of_Fame_c502.html" title="International Boxing Hall Of Fame">International Boxing Hall Of Fame</a>.</p>
