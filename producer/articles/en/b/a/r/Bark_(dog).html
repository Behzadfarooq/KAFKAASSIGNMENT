<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bark_%28dog%29.html" title="Edit section: Why dogs bark">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why dogs bark</span></h2>
<p>Although dogs are a subspecies of the <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf.html" title="Wolf">wolf</a>, <i>Canis lupus</i>, their barking constitutes a significant difference from their parent species. Although wolves do bark (or more accurately, howl or bay), they do so only in specific situations. According to Coppinger and Feinstein, dogs bark in long, rhythmic stanzas but adult wolf barks tend to be brief and isolated.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Dogs, by contrast, bark frequently and in many different situations.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the reason for the difference lies in the dog's domestication by humans. Dogs present a striking example of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoteny.html" title="Neoteny">neoteny</a>, the retention of juvenile characteristics in the adults. They are similar to young wolves in many of their mannerisms and physical features, such as large heads, flat faces, large eyes, submissiveness and vocalizing – all of which are exhibited in wolf puppies.</p>
<p>Some believe that these characteristics were deliberately selected for soon after domestication. There may have been a number of reasons for this. For instance, an overgrown puppy would very likely have been seen as a more engaging companion than a more mature but less amusing pet, as well as being less aggressive. More prosaically, an increased tendency to bark could have been useful to humans to provide an early warning system. Dogs may have been used to alert their owners that another unfamiliar band of humans or a predatory animal was in the area.</p>
<p>Individual dogs bark for a variety of reasons. They may bark to attract attention, to communicate a message, or to express excitement. Dog barks do not constitute an information-rich message in the same fashion as human speech, but they do nonetheless constitute more than mere noise. Statistical analysis has revealed that barks can be divided into different subtypes based on context and that individual dogs can be identified by their barks. Disturbance barks tend to be harsh, low frequency, and unmodulated, whereas isolation and play barks tend to be tonal, higher frequency, and modulated. Barks are often accompanied by body movements as part of a broader package of <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_communication.html" title="Dog communication">dog communication</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>Labradors often give a warning bark in response to an unusual event that they feel needs your attention, such as "Hey, a car pulled into the driveway!"</i> <a href="http://www.dogbreedadvice.com/Labrador-FAQ" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dogbreedadvice.com/Labrador-FAQ" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>This kind of barking is known as 'alarm barking', and is common within a variety of breeds. It is a dog's attempt to be alert, attentive, and informative to his human "pack", as regarding unusual events. It does not signify aggression, and (although often associated with unusual noises intruding on the dog's 'territory') is not the same as territoriality type barking. It may take the form of just one or a few barks, or it may give rise to sustained barking until the dog sees that some action has been taken.</p>
<p>Alarm barking is more likely to arise when a dog can hear, but not see the source of, some noise. Examples of sounds which commonly cause alarm barking include doorbells, cars, noises from adjacent dwellings, and the like. It is a behavior that tends to develop with age and maturity, and also can be related to whether there are others around who might need to be informed of such events - often an alarm barker will remain quiet if alone and there is nobody to 'tell'.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bark_%28dog%29.html" title="Edit section: Bark control">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bark control</span></h3>
<p>Canine barking can be a <a href="../../../n/u/i/Nuisance.html" title="Nuisance">nuisance</a> to neighbors, and is a common problem dog owners or their neighbors may face. It is important to realize that a dog which barks is attempting to communicate something, be it anxiety, discomfort, friendliness, assertiveness, loneliness, warning, alarm, deterrent, or other meanings. Different kinds of barking often require different kinds of approach to reduction.</p>
<p>Common approaches are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attempt to understand the cause. Know what triggers the barking. Treat any causes which can be treated.</li>
<li>Use positive training methods to correct the behavior. Dogs are more likely to bark from anxiety or stress, than otherwise, so punishment can often cause problems by reinforcing a cycle of bad behavior. Instead consider:
<ul>
<li><i>Repeated exposure -</i> to strangers or telephone rings (the "stimulus"), whilst you calm the dog and persuade it to remain quiet</li>
<li><i>Distraction -</i> as the stimulus happens, offer treats, give praise, do something to take the dog's mind off it or an alternate preferred behavior.</li>
<li><i>Correct other dominant behavior -</i> dogs often bark if they believe they are responsible for the pack. Make clear that you are responsible for the matter, and that he/she should hold back.</li>
<li><i>Reshaping -</i> use <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clicker_training.html" title="Clicker training">clicker training</a> (a form of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operant_conditioning.html" title="Operant conditioning">operant conditioning</a>) or other means to obtain barking behavior on command, and then shape that control to give you control over silence too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seek professional advice. For example <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/Environment/noise/research/barkingdogs/constantbarking.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.defra.gov.uk/Environment/noise/research/barkingdogs/constantbarking.pdf" rel="nofollow">this advice</a> on barking from the UK Department for the Environment (<a href="../../../d/e/f/DEFRA_8a48.html" title="DEFRA">DEFRA</a>), or a dog trainer, or vet.</li>
<li>Use a mechanical device such as a bark collar. There are several types, all of which use a collar device that produces a response to barking that the dog notices:
<ul>
<li><i>Citrus spray ("citronella") -</i> dogs as a rule do not like citrus. At the least, it is very noticeable and disrupts the pattern through surprise. These collars spray citrus around the dog's <a href="../../../m/u/z/Muzzle.html" title="Muzzle">muzzle</a> when he/she barks. (Sometimes these devices make a "hissing" noise before spraying, as an additional deterrent - see "escalation devices")</li>
<li><i>Sonic/ultrasonic (including vibration) -</i> these collars produce a tone which humans may or may not be able to hear, in response to barking. Over time, the sound becomes annoying or distracting enough to deter barking.</li>
<li><i>Electrical -</i> these collars produce a mild stinging or tingling sensation in response to a bark. It is important that such devices have a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Failsafe.html" title="Failsafe">failsafe</a> mechanism and shut off after a certain time, to prevent ongoing operation.</li>
<li><i>Combination and escalation devices -</i> many sound and/or electrical collars have combination or escalation systems. A <b>combination</b> system is one that (for example) uses both sound and spray together. An <b>escalation</b> device is one that uses quiet sounds, or low levels of output, rising gradually until barking ceases. Escalation devices are effective since they "reward" the dog for stopping sooner by not having "all-or-nothing" action, so the dog can learn to react by stopping before much happens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different bark collars have been both praised, and criticised, and some are considered inhumane by various people and groups. Electrical devices especially come under criticism by people who consider them <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torturous</a> and akin to <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_shock.html" title="Electric shock">electrocution</a>. However most <a href="../../../s/p/c/SPCA_7a0b.html" title="SPCA">SPCAs</a> agree that in a last resort even an electric collar is better than <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a> if it comes to an ultimatum, for a stubborn dog that will not stop any other way. It is generally agreed that understanding the communication and retraining by reward is the most effective and most humane way.</li>
<li>The use of self-contained ultrasonic bark deterrent devices is one of the few means a person may have to deter barking by <i>another</i> person's dog which they do not have control over. (In such circumstances though it is always best to speak directly with the dog's owner first)</li>

<p>The controversial <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgical_procedure.html" title="Surgical procedure">surgical procedure</a> known as 'debarking' is a veterinary procedure for modifying the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_box.html" title="Voice box">voice box</a> so that a barking dog will make a significantly reduced <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise.html" title="Noise">noise</a>. It is considered a last resort by some owners, on the basis that it is better than <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a>, seizure, or legal problems if the matter has proven incapable of being reliably corrected any other way.</p>
<p>Debarking is illegal in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> and opposed by many animal welfare bodies.</p>
<p>But before considering debarking your dog, you should try to train your dogs by making a loud quick S-H-H sound and firmly but not harshly or in any way cruelly touch them in between the rib and thigh section or on the neck about in the middle. Do this ONLY when you sense the dog is going to bark, like if it runs out the door as if it were pursuing an animal. Make sure to try to have a CALM and assertive energy. Do not panic, do not get angry. Dogs address you by your energy and submissiveness or dominance, not your name. By doing this you give it rules, boundaries, and limitations.</p>
