<p>Born in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_Norton_16fd.html" title="Kings Norton">Kings Norton</a> and christened in <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgbaston.html" title="Edgbaston">Edgbaston</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, she was the only daughter and eldest child of a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_army.html" title="British army">British army</a> officer, Major Bertram Cartland, and his wife, Mary (Polly) Hamilton Scobell. Though she was born into an enviable degree of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-class.html" title="Middle-class">middle-class</a> comfort, the family's security was severely shaken after the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> of her paternal grandfather, James Cartland, a financier, who shot himself in the wake of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>This was followed soon after by her father's death on a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> battlefield in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. However, her enterprising mother opened a <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> dress shop to make ends meet — "Poor I may be," Polly Cartland once remarked, "but common I am not" — and to raise Cartland and her two brothers, Anthony and Ronald, both of whom were eventually <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killed_in_action.html" title="Killed in action">killed in battle</a>, one day apart, in 1940.</p>

Cartland admitted she was inspired in her early work by the novels of Edwardian author <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elinor_Glyn_7c55.html" title="Elinor Glyn">Elinor Glyn</a>, whom she idolised and eventually befriended.</p>

</dl>
<p>After a year as a gossip columnist for the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Express_36b6.html" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a></i>, Cartland published her first novel, <i>Jigsaw</i> (1923), a slightly naughty society thriller that became a bestseller. She also began writing and producing somewhat racy plays, one of which, <i>Blood Money</i> (1926), was banned by the Lord Chamberlain's Office. In the 1920s and '30s Cartland was one of the leading young hostesses in London society, noted for her beauty, energetic charm and daring parties. Her fashion sense also had a part in launching her fame. She was in fact one of the first clients of designer <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Norman_Hartnell_9ae2.html" title="Sir Norman Hartnell">Sir Norman Hartnell</a>, who was later appointed dressmaker to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</p>
<p>Barbara Cartland's image as a self-appointed "expert" on romance drew some ridicule in her later years, when her social views became more conservative. Indeed, although her first novels were considered sensational, Barbara Cartland's later (and arguably most popular) titles were comparatively tame with virginal heroines and few, if any, suggestive situations. Almost all of Cartland's later books were historical in theme, which allowed for the believability of chastity.</p>
<p>Despite their softcore story lines, Barbara Cartland's later novels were highly successful. By 1983 she rated the longest entry in the British <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Who_098a.html" title="Who's Who">Who's Who</a></i>, and was named the top-selling author in the world by the <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records_9c82.html" title="Guinness Book of World Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a></i>. In the mid-1990s, by which time she had sold over a billion books, <i><a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue_%28magazine%29.html" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a></i> magazine called her "the true Queen of Romance". She became a mainstay of the popular media in her trademark pink dresses and plumed hats, discoursing on matters of love, marriage, politics, religion, health and fashion. She was publicly opposed to the removal of prayer from state schools and spoke against infidelity and divorce, although she admitted to being acquainted with both "sins".</p>

<p>Privately, Cartland took an interest in the early <a href="../../../g/l/i/Gliding.html" title="Gliding">gliding</a> movement. Although aerotowing for launching <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glider.html" title="Glider">gliders</a> first occurred in Germany, she thought of long distance tows in 1931 and did a 200 mile tow in a two-seater glider.

In 1984, she was awarded the Bishop Wright Air Industry Award for this contribution<a href="http://www.barbaracartland.com/static/life.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.barbaracartland.com/static/life.aspx" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>According to an obituary published in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Telegraph_eab7.html" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">22 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Cartland reportedly broke off her first engagement, to a Guards officer, when she learned about the facts of life and recoiled. Eventually, she got over the shock of the physical mechanics involved and was married, from 1927 to 1932, to Alexander George McCorquodale, an Army officer who was heir to a British printing fortune (he died in 1964).</p>

After the McCorquodales' 1936 divorce, which involved charges and countercharges of infidelity, Cartland married a man her husband had accused her of dallying with — his cousin Hugh McCorquodale, a former military officer. She and her second husband, who died in 1963, had two sons, Ian and Glen.</p>
<p>Cartland maintained a long-time friendship with <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Mountbatten%2C_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma_0c4b.html" title="Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma">Lord Mountbatten of Burma</a>, whose 1979 death she claimed was the "greatest sadness of my life".

<p>Her high-profile in the UK, France and the United States between the 1970s and 1990s was aided greatly through her frequent appearance on TV talk shows. Her daughter's social success, which repeated and surpassed her own, also brought her added attention.

</div>
</div>
<p>Her physical and mental health began to fail in her mid-90s but her spirit and courage were undiminished, and she remained a favorite with the press, granting interviews to international news agencies even during the final months of her life. Two of her last interviews were with the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and US journalist Randy Bryan Bigham.</p>
<p>Her last project was to be filmed and interviewed for her life story (Directed by Steven Glen for Blue Melon Films). The documentary, titled 'Virgins and Heroes', includes unique early home cine footage and Dame Barbara launching her website with pink computers in early 2000. At that time, her publishers estimated that since her writing career began in 1923, Dame Barbara Cartland had produced a total of 723 titles. After years of wearing her trademark anti-wrinkle cream and heavy makeup, she had herself photographed repeatedly without any cosmetics before she died. She was 98 years of age at her death.</p>
<p>Due to her concern for the environment, she requested to be buried in a cardboard coffin. This request was honoured and she was buried at her estate in <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatfield%2C_Hertfordshire_3ca8.html" title="Hatfield, Hertfordshire">Hatfield</a> under a tree that had been planted by Queen Elizabeth I. <a href="http://obits.com/cartlanddamebarb.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://obits.com/cartlanddamebarb.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
