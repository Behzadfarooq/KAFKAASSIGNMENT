	    <p>This page appears to be a rephrasing of an <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ekay/MEbaro.html" class="external text" title="http://faculty.washington.edu/ekay/MEbaro.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> by one Edmond Kay, M.D., in which he coins the phrase "Ear fear". This seems to fall into the catagory of original work, not encyclopedic articles. Please let me know if I have misuderstood something. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_6f2b.html" title="User:JesseW">JesseW</a> 00:56, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just learned to swim recently (I was a self-wired-up cyborg in my childhood, so obviously didn't then). In addition to the obvious adaptation issues (a not-computer-mediated world), the main problem I'm having is blockage, general stuffiness, like having a cold all the time.</p>
<p>Part of this is reverse adaptation from removal of computer equipment I've worn many years (always feeling cold no matter what the ambient air temperature actually is), but I also believe that it's not a unique situation, and have begun to realize that there are quite a few other people who have blocked sinus passages, or blocked eustachian tubes.</p>
<p>I know of many others who are afraid of elevators, airplanes, and pools, so I began searching around to find out more (after seeing a doctor, and subsequent referral to the Canadian Hearing Society)...</p>
<p>Maybe the article needs a different name, but I think there should be an article that deals with the topic of chronic blockage, i.e. for people unable to comfortably use airplanes, elevators, or pools, and if there is a way to "fix" this problem, which many doctors don't seem to be aware of, or know how to fix.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I've found out, through google searches, and talking with doctors; I would welcome any thoughts on how to work this knowledge into a well written article, as well as on what a good name for that article might be (maybe it should be called something other than "ear fear"):</p>
<p><br />
barotrauma: Sinus squeeze occurs with eustachian tube dysfunction, which may result in inner ear hemorrhage, tearing of the labyrinthine membrane, or perilymphatic fistula. Risk is increased in divers with asthma or pulmonary blebs. ear barotrauma: tympanic membrane, tympanogram ... I always recommend that individuals practice pressurization of their middle ears prior to diving in order to test their Eustachian tubes for patency, and to perform middle ear pressurization before beginning actual descent to cushion the ears against trauma.. ... individuals who have widely patent Eustachian tubes and never have problems with equalization. ... In a very few individuals allergies, acute or chronic infection or nasal polyps may play a role. By far the most common reason for middle ear barotrauma however is inadequate pressurization of the middle ears due to a lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms involved. "Ear Fear" must always be considered as a possible complicating factor and an instructor must be sensitive to the issues surrounding the reluctance of a diver to fully and aggressively pressurize the middle ears. ... ...chronic sinusitis... ... Problems with nasal anatomy such as a deviated nasal septum, intranasal polyps, or obstructed sinuses must be addressed by a medical practitioner and occasionally these will require surgery. Recent advances in endoscopic surgery offer vast improvements over older techniques. There is much that a professional diving safety officer or a good friend can do to help an individual learn safe middle ear equalization practices, but don't forget to look for the obvious. A person with cold symptoms should not dive until the cold has cleared and the Eustachian tube clearly pops with a swallow. ... Decongestants never help when cold or trauma symptoms are present, but at the very end of a cold, when just a little minor stuffiness remains, the occasional use of an inhaled decongestant like Afrin (oxymetazalone) spray will do no harm and may help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Never use a nasal decongestant spray more than three consecutive days</li>
</ul>
<p>whether diving or not, and if symptoms are severe or prolonged, medical evaluation is advisable. ... The most frequently en-countered problem on descent is middle ear "squeeze," an ear discomfort or pain from shrinkage of the middle ear space (Figure 2). This problem may begin at only a few feet depth. The earliest symptoms are similar to the "ear stuffiness" we sometimes feel when a plane rapidly descends. Unchecked during a dive, the feeling can rapidly progress to actual pain and ear damage. ... Squeeze on the middle ear is prevented by making sure inhaled compressed air travels from the back of the nose (nasopharynx) into the middle ear spaces. The only route of passage into the middle ear is through a tiny, compressible canal called the eustachian tube (after its discoverer, the Italian Bartolommeo Eustachi, 1524-74). Anatomically, this is a soft and flexible canal that functions as a one-way flutter valve; it easily opens up when pressure in the middle ear is higher than in the nasopharynx, but tends to close shut when pressure in the nasopharynx is higher than in the middle ear. As a result, gas flow is passive from the middle ear to the nasopharynx on ascent (you don't have to think about it), but "active" on descent (you have to make it happen). ... prevent middle ear squeeze by forcing air through the eustachian tubes before symptoms occur, just before or at the beginning of descent... "Equalize early and often" ... otolaryngologist ... The inner ear can also be affected, with rupture of the round or oval windows, cochlear damage and permanent hearing loss. Tinnitus, vertigo, and deafness after a dive are the classic symptoms of inner ear barotrauma. ... External ear squeeze may occur if the ear canal is blocked with ear wax or ear plugs; divers should never wear ear plugs for this reason. Another common cause of external ear squeeze is a tight-fitting wetsuit hood. ... Barotrauma commonly occurs with altitude changes, such as with flying, scuba diving, or driving in the mountains. If you have a congested nose from allergies, colds, or upper respiratory infection, barotrauma is more likely. Blockage of the eustachian tube could also be congenital or may occur because of swelling in the throat. ... Do you have Eustachian Tube Blockage? ... If you suffer from constant catarrh, you might gain some relief by sniffing wate r up the nose to prevent the inside from drying out; make sure the water is warm , sniff it half-way up the nose, then blow it out; do not draw the water all the</p>

<p>e sinuses and lead to infection. Over-the-counter nasal sprays or drops should o nly be used if stuffiness prevents you sleeping or if you suffer from pressuriza tion problems when flying; they can be given to babies if catarrh is causing fee ding or sleeping difficulties, but make sure they are the right strength and use</p>

<p>clicking and tinnitus and noise sensitivity( whch i have a bit of) are from blocked e tube- walt-any way to safely unblock the eustachian?willdecongestants help? i do s/r religiously btw. NEVER blow your nose! Always sniff. Every time you blow, you force fluid back into the ear. I use papaya enzymes when I get blocked Eustachian tubes...I just let one dissolve on the side that's blocked. I haven't had this in awhile - but as I recall the pain subsided in 20 minutes or so. I learned about this years ago at Dr. Murray Grossan's site. Looks like he now recommends a product called Clear-Ease, which contains Papain and Bromelain. ... <a href="http://www.entdr.com/eaat.html" class="external free" title="http://www.entdr.com/eaat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.entdr.com/eaat.html</a> If the tube remains blocked for a period of time, fluid (like blood serum) will seep into the area from the membranes in an attempt to fill up the ear to overcome the vacuum. This is called "fluid in the ear," serious otitis or aero-otitis. ... The most common cause for a blocked Eustachian tube is the common "cold". Sinus infections and nasal allergies (hayfever, etc) are also frequent causes. This is because the membranes that line the Eustachian tube are similar to and continuous with nasal membranes. Consequently, a stuffy nose leads to stuffy ears because the swollen membranes block the opening of the Eustachian tube. Another cause of blocked Eustachian tubes is infection of the middle ear which creates swollen membranes. Children are especially vulnerable to blockages as their Eustachian tubes are narrower than adults. ... in elevators of tall buildings or when diving to the bottom of a swimming pool. ... swallowing activates the muscle that opens the Eustachian tube. You swallow more often when you chew gum or let mints melt in your mouth. These are good practices, especially just before and during descent. Yawning is even better. It is a stronger activator of that muscle. Be sure to avoid sleeping during descent, because you may not be swallowing enough to keep up with the pressure changes. (The flight attendant will be happy to awaken you just before descent.) ... Feed your baby, and do not allow him to sleep during descent. ... When inflating you ears, you should not use force from your chest (lungs) or abdomen (diaphragm) which can create pressures that are too high. The proper technique involves only pressure created by your cheek and throat muscles. ... If you have a cold, a sinus infection, or an allergy attack, it is best to postpone an airplane trip. ... experienced air travelers use a decongestant pill or nasal spray an hour or so before descent. ... avoid making a habit of nose sprays. After a few days they may cause more congestant than they relieve.</p>
