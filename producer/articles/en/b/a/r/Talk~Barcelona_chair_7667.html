	    <p>The text that was reposted has been deleted. The reason is the STRUCTURE of the article and wording of the article has been taken from our article and is therefore an infringement in copyright. I suggest that the person that is responsible for re-posting this article become fully acquainted with copyright issues.</p>
<p>The article would not appear so similar to our if the article had been originally researched and written independently without reference to our work. WIKI cannot take our article and use it as a basis for creating a WIKI article and then simply rephrase it. You must research fully your own article and uniquely write it completely from scratch ie to create your own structure and your own content without using our article to build your article.</p>
<p>We are requesting that the person/s that have posted this article back up make themselves know by giving their full name, contact details and e-mail address and submit that information to our contact form at our website. Please also state if you are also the person that wrote the majority of the "new article" that was based on ours.</p>

<p>Please understand I do support the WIKI initiative and I welcome that information is being made available to the public. However please try to understand our point of view as well. We have paid good money and time to research these articles. We paid to visit the pavillion in Barcelona, to visit shops that sold the Barcelona chair and to talk with the staff members and curators - in all 2 days research along with another 2 days to further research, edit and write the article. We created an original piece of work that has structure and content which is copyrightable.</p>
<p>Please re-search your own article and spend the time to develop your own structure - this is where the hard work is - and it costs money and time to do this. By taking our article and re-working it you are actually undermining organizations like ours that are working hard to create original content.</p>

<p>Dear John,</p>
<p>Thank you for your mail. The material to which you are referring seems to have been removed. Feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.</p>

<p>21st December 2006 The WIKI text that was written based on our original article has now been deleted. Please do not use our articles for the basis of building your WIKI article.</p>
<p>We think WIKI it is a wonderful idea however not at the expense of a legitimate publishing businesses.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Dear Wiki Management</p>
<p>I wish to bring to the attention of WIKI officials / Management that our original written article on the Barcelona Chair appears to have been used extensively as the basis of this Wiki article and has sections which are almost identical to our work both in content and structure. Not only is the phrasing similar but also the order of facts and logical progression of the article also very closely match our original article.</p>
<p>It is not acceptable to take our work as a basis for an article and simply re-phrase / reword our content. The research and logical thought processes required to create this article cost us time and money and forms the basis of a copyrightable work.</p>
<p>We would therefore claim that the WIKI article would appear to be in breach of our copyright and we are therefore requesting that this article be permanently removed from the WIKI site.</p>
<p>Our terms for using our written material are very clear on our site. No organization may reference our work without our written agreement. We did not give rights to anyone to use our work in this manner and therefore we are requesting the work be removed permanently from the WIKI site.</p>
<p>We are also requesting that WIKI contact all other internet sites that have now used this article or replicated it and have ensure that is is removed from those sites since WIKI is making this work available under copyleft. Wiki does not have a right to do this when the work is based on our work. This will also constitute damage to our business that relies on creating quality original content.</p>
<p>We are also requesting that the full contact details of the author/s of this WIKI article be disclosed to us so that we can take appropriate action against the authors of this article. If deemed necessary we will need to request for compensation for the time required to follow up on this action to protect our work.</p>
<p>I appreciate that wiki is creating a valuable resource for people however it should not be at the expense of organizations like ours that have spent a lot of time and money to build, research and write original content only to have free sites like WIKI create very similar copies of our work and then make it available under copyleft. This seriously degrades the value of the content on our site and also degrades the value our articles which we have worked hard to create. It also does not do any favours for publishers like ours that add valuable content on the internet.</p>
<p>Here are the sections of work that were in our article and appear in the wiki article: I would appreciate it if someone from WIKI management can investigate this. We can provide evidence to prove our article existed before that of wiki and our work was originally created by us if required. If proof is required then we will need to charge WIKI administration costs for the time required for us to prove our ownership. If you need to check quickly when our articles first appeared online then I suggest you go to the internet archive and you will see a time stamp when our article was published.</p>
<p>Here are some portions of the text that we see as infringing our coprights.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our original text: "The Exposition was a world affair, an important event with the Spanish royals and several European government officials attending. Mies fully appreciated the significance of the occasion.</p>
<p>He knew that what he designed had to be “an important chair, a very elegant chair and costly. It had to be monumental. You couldn’t just use a kitchen chair”.- Mies 1929 "</p>
<p>Wiki Text: "The exhibition was an occasion of international importance, attended by the Spanish Royal family as well as many government officials from around Europe. Mies was well aware of this significance and of the challenges that faced him when he set about designing the chair for the Pavilion, he commented at the time that this was to be</p>
<p>"an important chair, a very elegant chair and costly. It had to be monumental. You couldn't just use a kitchen chair" Mies 1929."</p>
<hr />
<p>Our original text: "Constructing the Chair frame in stainless steel meant that the whole frame could now be made from one fluid piece of metal.</p>
<p><br />
Wiki text "The originals pre-dated stainless steel and seamless (ground) welds so the legs had to be bolted together. Today's This allowed the frame to be formed from a single piece of metal, and so it was that the bolts of the original were replaced by the smooth lines that we are familiar with today.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our original text:</p>
<p>In 1929 Barcelona was host to the World Arts Fair, and the German government commissioned Mies to design the German Pavilion at Montjuic as part of the exposition.</p>
<p>Mies Van der Rohe Pavillion in Barcelona housing the 2 Chairs designed for the king and queen of Spain With the Pavilion Mies succeeded in his vision of a modern building with a free spatial flow, built with glass, steel and four kinds of marble.</p>
<p>However once he had created the building his mind turned to designing the furniture that would be used in it. Creating furniture may be a simple task compared to a whole building some might say, but not according to Mies:</p>
<p>The chair is a very difficult object. Everyone who has ever tried to make one knows that. There are endless possibilities and many problems - the chair has to be light, it has to be strong, it has to be comfortable. It is almost easier to build a sky scraper than a chair.” - Mies 1930</p>
<p><br />
Wiki Text: Mies was commissioned by the German Government to design the German Pavilion at the Barcelona World Arts Fair to be held at Montjuic in Spain in 1929. ... Built of glass, steel and three types of marble, its linear simplicity is characterized by great flowing expanses, utilizing unbroken planes of each material, juxtaposed with one another.</p>
<p>Having completed the design for the building, Mies and Lilly began work on the furniture for its interior. In an interview the year following the fair Mies said the following regarding chair design:</p>
<p>"The chair is a very difficult object. Everyone who has ever tried to make one knows that. There are endless possibilities and many problems - the chair has to be light, it has to be strong, it has to be comfortable It is almost easier to build a skyscraper than a chair" Mies 1930.</p>
<hr />
<p><br />
Our original text:</p>
<pre>
In fact now you can also find footstools, sofa versions and the like, none of which have been designed by Mies, but follow the design rules of the Barcelona Chair, i.e. the same legs and quilted square style upholstery. 
</pre>
<p>Wiki Text: The rest of the Barcelona range was not designed by Mies, but true to his design, they use the same style legs, and the same type of quilted and piped leather upholstery.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our text: However Mies was meant to be a Bauhaus designer, someone who believed in functional furniture, that could be mass produced for workers .... and herein lies the contradiction as the Barcelona Chair is actually both expensive and difficult to mass produce.</p>
<p>Wiki Text</p>
<p>Philosophically mid century modernists including Mies generally subscribed to the idea that modern furniture should be accessible to the masses, both financially and aesthetically. However the Barcelona chair is an exception to this rule. The materials and construction are too expensive, too labor intensive and therefor too costly to make it widely accessible.</p>

<p>I note also that the wiki webpage originally referenced our work as an external link. However once the new WIKI article appeared with our content our reference URL was removed. This is further evidence that someone used our article as the basis to create the wiki article and then removed our reference link. This is the url of our page:</p>
