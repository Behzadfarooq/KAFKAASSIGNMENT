<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ley Guard</span></h2>
<p>The Ley guard, or rubber guard has certainly been a huge help to my BJJ career. Having quite long legs, I am naturally inclined towards going for a triangle choke when I am underneath. It takes a bit of courage to sacrifice the standard guard for the Ley Guard, but from there it only a short step to the triangle. Definitely keep this article in. The Ley Guard is now part of the sport. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesthorburn_a872.html" title="User:Jamesthorburn">Jamesthorburn</a> 08:16, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes. Keep this article. The Ley Guard is definitely for taller people, but is a valid contribution nontheless. <a href="../../../k/b/e/User%7EKbenton_de63.html" title="User:Kbenton">Kbenton</a> 11:40, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Citation_issues" id="Citation_issues"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citation issues</span></h2>
<p>KentKent, you seem to feel that the Taz Academy blog is a good citation to prove that this "Ley Guard" has significantly changed groundfighting in BJJ. Can you point out where exactly the site demonstrates this, and do you have any references that are not Ley's own academy that demonstrate the "Ley Guard" being used in competition or referenced in competition? I would say that if it significantly changed BJJ, it would be very easy to find at least one outside reference to it. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowWTG_1378.html" title="User:FlowWTG">FlowWTG</a> 16:18, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>New users which all have exactly the same writing style does not constitute proof. Users cannot constitute proof. Please provide a citation or multiple citations that does these things: 1) Demonstrates that Ley developed the Rubber Guard. Please note that most American BJJ practitioners at least have heard of Eddie Bravo, and that Bravo has been putting out free instructionals on the Rubber Guard on the internet for years. 2) Demonstrates Ley is recognized as having developed the rubber guard by some authority - preferably De La Riva or whoever he trains under.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Insinuations</span></h2>
<p>Crumbs! Kentkent was right. Agree with DrParkes and you are almost instantly attacked. Same writing style, huh? Well I´ll take that as a comlpement but I think it is quite clear what you are insinuating. You are saying that I either am, or am being told what to write by, one or more of the people who agree with my sentiments. Untrue I´m afraid but no doubt you allready have plans to block out my input, just like you did to the much maligned DrParkes. Well. Attacks and vandalism on the article in question have all come from 3 or 4 users with EXACTLY the same writing style too if anyone cares to check. From what I have seen of this unholy alliance, they will soon be after me. FlowWTG? Or should I say NATE? Or LOUDENVIER? By the way, Bravo has been using a version of the rubber guard for a long time but has made no claim that he developed it. The version that Ley developed is his own. Bravo does not call it the Bravo Guard. Only Ley´´s version is original enough to warrant being named after him. Meanwhile, from all of your fans, DrParkes, we are here and trying to help. <a href="../../../k/b/e/User%7EKbenton_de63.html" title="User:Kbenton">Kbenton</a> 16:46, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I looked up Barry Ley on Google and there are more than a million entries, rather than the 569 your computer found. Strange. There are not as many on ASK.COM but that is usually the case. I also notice from your own page that you are a purple belt in Judo. Again strange as I have yet to find the judo system that uses a purple belt in its grading system. Perhaps your club has its own grading methods. I wonder if you have some other motivation for your attacks on these articles? (the preceding was made by an anonymous user warned repeatedly for removing notices and tags) (The preceding unsigned comment in brackets was made by an anonymous user warned repeatedly for vandalising DrParkes' work and articles on BJJ) <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 09:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article reads like an autobiography. It's about a possibly non-notable living person. This article states that the person had a tremendous impact in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Jiu-Jitsu_8a36.html" title="Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> when in fact he is completely unknown in the BJJ sport scene (possibly not locally tough). Recently the article about Rolker Gracie who is the head of the Gracie Centro Academy here in Rio de Janeiro was deleted because of notability issues, so there is no argument to keep this article in wikipedia. If the book written by the author is notable enough (I don't think so after reading <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> guidelines about books), then all information about his BJJ background should be limited to a trivia section (which is also questionable).

<dd><i>The following is partially copied from my (<a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a>) talk page to be discussed here</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I've found some strange things. I went to inspect this book entry on amazon. I've found only good reviews, all looking the same, with the same written style. Strange... But stranger yet is the surname of two such reviewers: Parkes... Hum... Remember DrParkes (he was the person vandalizing the BJJ article origins and putting links to de La Riva)? Now the links for the reviewers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3TVK1YC5PY3HO/ref=cm_cr_auth/102-1484367-2679331" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3TVK1YC5PY3HO/ref=cm_cr_auth/102-1484367-2679331" rel="nofollow">Martin Parkes</a></li>

</ul>
<p><a name="English_and_American_surnames." id="English_and_American_surnames."></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">English and American surnames.</span></h2>
<p>As I am sure you are aware, more than one family can have the same surname without being related, or even knowing each other. Try to think of the surname "Silva" in Brazil. I am sure you would find it ridiculous if somebody jumped to the conclusion that everybody with this surname knew each other, or shared the same motivations. Parkes is a very common surname in UK and USA. If you are going to slander DrParkes' reputation still further (and it seems even more vindictive, knowing that he is still blocked and unable to defend himself) can you at least please do it without such laughable evidence as people sharing the same surname. Thank you. And as an afterthought, maybe his wikipedia name is not his actual surname. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 09:25, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>(<a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKentkent_1e81.html" title="User talk:Kentkent">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kentkent_0c56.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kentkent">contribs</a>) 07:56, 17 March 2007 (UTC). I think this DrParkes is a spammer, perhaps he is even Barry Ley himself... Too much coincidence. Wikipedia is not promotional media. I think his autobiographic article should be deleted or heavily changed. How could this be a best seller if its amazon sales rank is #1,480,420 in books? Best Judo from Isao Inokuma, never an international best-seller ranks an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_magnitude.html" title="Order of magnitude">order of magnitude</a> better at #174,665. Dom Casmurro, by <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machado_de_Assis_c7ea.html" title="Machado de Assis">Machado de Assis</a>, a brazillian book still fares better than the <i>international bestseller</i> blaggers... I will change that when my block expires (ridiculous block!)</p>
<p><a name="Attitudes" id="Attitudes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Attitudes</span></h2>
<p>He probably thinks YOU are a spammer. The sales rank seems low but that is all time sales. Amazon to date has had nealy 100 million seperate book titles in its inventory. That puts Ley in the 98th percantile. Maybe Blaggers sold well enough to make it to the top for a short period then trailed off. And do I detect a hint of jelousy? Ley is a published author. No mean feat. They say that those who can not do, teach; those who can do neither, critisise. Why not try to acheive something yourself instead of trying to pull Ley and DrParkes down. DrParkes is still blocked and not even able to defend himself, by the way. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 08:06, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also Barry Ley is only a BJJ blue belt!!! He is a <b>blue</b> belt! He talks like he was one of the best BJJers in the world. He still has many years until he is able to wear a black belt. Unless his teachers are lenient and irresponsible. Here in Rio at a Gracie academy he would hardly earn a purple belt in one or two years from now. Overseas BJJ progression is much easier because the professors do not want to loose students because BJJ is too hard... But believe me, BJJ is too hard... A black belt is an enormous prize... See the youtube channel for him: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Barryleon" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Barryleon" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 18:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps these articles should be nominated for deletion. A blue belt is far from a notable BJJ player; Google returns 594 results for him, many of which might not even be the Barry Ley in question; and as for the Blaggers article: I don't see any articles on the higher-selling books you mention, why does this one deserve it? <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowWTG_1378.html" title="User:FlowWTG">FlowWTG</a> 19:55, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is happening because DrParkes is the person promoting this book and Barry Ley in wikipedia. I think he is actually Barry Ley. Those articles will be nominated for deletion. I will call NYC JD (hope he doesn't block me again!) for help. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 19:57, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The difference is between looking for either word Barry <i>or</i> Ley and the exact phrase "Barry Ley" which is the more appropriate, also read <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a>. The main thing I'm trying to improve is the quality of the article <i>if</i> it stays, right now nominating as AFD would be reasonable, possibly with an option to merge Blaggers since notability of that is disputed too. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate</a> 09:31, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have to know how to search, and you still have to take out homonyms: try "Barry Ley", put the " so that you search for the entire name, or else you will be finding all Barry and Ley in the world. The figure is 562 as of March 2007. Regards <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 15:37, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A million and a half. Two minutes ago.</p>
<p>Sorry, you're doing it wrong. "Barry Ley" is the correct method and returns exactly 547 as of March 16. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowWTG_1378.html" title="User:FlowWTG">FlowWTG</a> 23:17, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree but its still over a million. "Barry Ley" is definitely the correct method though. You are correct about that. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 09:29, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're still misunderstanding. You literally enter, with the quotation marks, <b>"Barry Ley"</b>. This method returns around 550 results. Entering <b>Barry Ley</b> will return over a million because it searches for all Barry and all Ley on Google. Of which, around 550 are about someone named Barry Ley. It is without doubt <b>not</b> over a million; it's much less than a thousand. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowWTG_1378.html" title="User:FlowWTG">FlowWTG</a> 15:59, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No misunderstandins here. "Barry Ley" With quotation marks ("). More than a million hits. Not all about him, there are acouple of other Barry Leys. But the name is not a particularly common one, so a lot of them will be him.He is a published author after all. Commercially published I mean. Not like people putting stuff on Wikipedia.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biased editing</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone else get the impression that martial arts articles or articles by people with a genuine interest in martial artists in this encyclopedia, are being hijacked by certain cliques? DrParkes has told me that after all the attacks on his articles, not only have people been putting all sorts of ridiculous notices about notability and citations needed (far more than any other articles we have come across, especially those contributed by the offenders themselves) but then they went as far as to block him so that he would be unable to defend himself from their attacks.</p>
<p>What we have noticed is that there is a theme of people trying to promote Judo over Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Even trying to take credit for this entirely functional, modern martial art by claimimg that it sprung from Judo instead of the antiquated Japanese version of Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>If you try to correct this propaganda you find that you are banded against and blocked out by little cliques of Judo fans who know how to work the system of this encyclopedia for their own ends. Close inspection of these people´s web pages tells more than you need to know about them. Someone even lists his "partner" is a boxer dog, and what makes that even worse, is that the dog (named after some <s>bodybuilder</s> bodyboarder) is already, according to this person, "married".</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocked because of his own vandalism</span></h2>
<p>Loudenvier was clearly blocked because of his vandalism of DrParkes' articles. Only, he knows the system, and so wormed his way back in. In the section below, he blames DrParkes. In fact, he was blocked for constant and vindictive vandalism. Wikipedia is not a forum for expressing POV. It is for massing together all human knowledge, in a neutral way. I am sure if DrParkes were allowed to defend himself, he would shoot his tomentors down in flames. Come on DrParkes, get on another computor. You are quickly reaching god-like status, as a symbol for the downtrodden underdogs on Wikipedia. Show the bullys that they can't get away with riding roughshod over the truth!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I was also blocked because of DrParkes vandalism. He changed the origin of BJJ without talking first. He is wrong because he does not know BJJ history, he is not even Brazilian and as such can't argue with me rationaly, so he uses stealthy means to force his opinions (POV). He would have to provide sources (reliable) to back up his claims. Judo is not ancient, it started in 1884, Jiu-Jitsu started hundreds of years ago. Maeda taught the gracies. He was a Judoka, just read his article to see. It is all provided with reliable sources backing it up. When Kimura fight Hélio the Brazilian journals called the him a jiu-jitsu world champion. At that time in Brazil and Europe Judo and Jiu-Jitsu weren't much apart, as Judo was a school of Jiu-Jitsu and even Kimura, Tomita, Yamashita (the older) called it Jiu-Jitsu at first to the uninitiated foreigners who were already aware of Jiu-Jitsu, but not Judo. That's why BJJ is called Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and not Brazilian Judo, olny after the 50s and 60s it started to change and Judo in Brazil went separate ways to BJJ. Gracie hype is a damn thing. For decades people called Hélio Gracie the founder of BJJ without giving credit to Carlos Gracie, who was the olny Gracie that learned directly from Maeda. It was Carlos Gracie, an exeptional BJJer that taught Hélio and his other brothers. Stay tuned to the BJJ article because it will be revamped with accurate, reliably sourced information. You will be proud of BJJ even more. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 19:28, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocking</span></h2>
<p>DrParkes appears to have been blocked because he kept undoing the vandalism to his articles. I notice that the other chap who was blocked was allowed back almost immediately to continue his unseemly attack on the good doctor's work. Why can't you guys all behave reasonably towards each other. Oh, and if LOUDENVIER is allowed back, why not let DrParkes also have his say. I see that LOUDENVIER is trying to say that a Brazilian would somehow (genetically?) know more about BJJ than someone else. For a start, how does anyone know where DrParkes is from? And I think that the amount of time and effort spent studying a subject bears a little more weight than where you were born. Of course Kano's Judo is not ancient. Jiu Jitsu is and that is what I was saying if you'd care to go back and read it. Please check THE GRACIE WAY and Royce Gracie's ULTIMATE FIGHTING TECHNIQUES on the origin of BJJ. I realise that by coming down on the side of DrParkes I risk being hounded from Wikipedia by the Judo Gang but I thought he should know he is not alone.</p>

<dd>I think that I, being a student of Rolker Gracie, may know a little more than you. I may be wrong... But in the end it doesn't matter. We need citations to back up our allegations, and that's what I always do and what you, DrParkes or Barry Ley always fail to do.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin of BJJ</span></h2>
<p>LOUDENVIER, I think that the reason Helio is credited more than Carlos is because he did more of the adapting. Carlos, according to the Gracies many publications, learned more by rote and copied exactly the Jiu Jitsu that Maeda taught him. Helio, being too small and weak for many of the techniques adapted them to suit smaller people. So it really was him that eventually developed a whole, genuinely new martial art. This art is battle tested time and time again in combat (Gracie Challange). That simply cannot be said for any other martial art. The closest I ever saw Judo come was when Leininger put up a good fight (and lost) to Shamrock. I believe Ben Spijkers had a try too, and got his head stamped on by Renzo Gracie. If Helio himself says that the art is adapted from Jiu Jitsu, even though you are yourself Brazilian, I don't think you can correct him. He, after all, is just as Brazilian as you. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 20:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maeda was 1m 64cm tall and weighted 64kg. He was far smaller then Helio. Why did Hélio had to invent anything? Simple, he didn't learn from Maeda himself. He learned by watching Carlos. Maeda fought many fights and lost only 2: against Satake and another jananese judoka. Do more homework, please. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 21:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Helio" id="Helio"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Helio</span></h2>
<p>Ah yes. But Carlos only learned what he was taught. He invented nothing. Helio was the one who adapted techniques to suit the smaller frame. And what has Maeda's height and weight got to do with anything? Helio adapted the techniques so he could use them with Carlos and the other students.</p>
<p>George Stvenson said, "A reasonable man adapts to the world around him. An unreasonable man adapts the world to himself. Therefore all progress is made by unreasonable men." Helio adapted the the system to his own needs. It is that very adaptabilty to the modern world that sets BJJ apart from the old, rigid, beautiful but outmoded martial arts. (See GEOFF THOMPSON) We are not training to fight a Samurai on horseback or who bows and attacks with fair warning from six feet away, but the drunken thug who assaults us when we are in the street at night, perhaps with our wives or children. Or the drugged up mugger with a knife to our guts.</p>
<p>And what makes you think that you do any more homework than me? You seem to base a lot of your argument on your nationailty and the fact that you are lucky enough to train with ROLKER.

<p>Nate. You and two other users have consistently vandelised articles by DrParkes. No matter what proof he offered, or what citations he gave you it was never enough. Barry Ley is widely reported in the media and a suitable subject for an article. I read earlier that one of you got him blocked so he is unable to defend himself from your assaults. Even the comment on the discussion page that brought attention to his unfair treatment was deleted.</p>
<p>Does this all really spring from DrParkes editing your precious article on Brazilian Jiu Jitsu? I for one believe that Gracie Jiu Jitsu was Carlos Gracie´s family´s adaptation of the Japanese style.</p>
<p>The books THE GRACIE WAY and Royce´s ULTIMATE FIGHTING TECHNIQUES say so. Why would they lie?</p>
<p>For heaven´s sakes, leave these informative and interesting articles alone. Maybe you could have a little look at your own stuff and provide endless citations for them instead. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 13:08, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reading the Wikipedia definition of vandelism it is clear that you are indeed regularly vandelising articles whose content does not agree with your own views on any given subject. Why not be a little bit more objective and consider what you are doing more carefully before vandelising the hard work of others? It is a shame to see the system, which after all is for the benefit of everyone - not just you, being abused in this way. Come on, why not thrust out your chin and admit that you´ve been rumbled? You will feel better and others will be able to enjoy these excellent articles. Then perhaps you can get on with doing something a little more constructive with your time.
