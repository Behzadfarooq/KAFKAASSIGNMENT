<dd>Baristarim, perhaps you can satisfy my curiosity, because this is making me crazy - you just responded to my post at <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyDancer_0d15.html" title="User talk:SandyDancer">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SandyDancer_ae04.html" title="Special:Contributions/SandyDancer">contribs</a>). I am not SandyDancer - how did you confuse me with him/her, and why are people thinking I'm that person? As I've read allegations of sock puppetry elsewhere on pages I follow, it is really bugging me, so I'm hoping your response will enlighten me as to how and why people are confusing us, when I've never crossed paths with him/her.

<dd>ah, ha - I've followed up more on SandyDancer, and see where you've crossed paths with him/her. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Mitsos_0ffc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Mitsos">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Mitsos</a>.

<p>Hi, Baristarim. When you make a new edit, could you please provide an edit summary. It is really helpful in order to follow the changes an editor makes, without having necessarily to check "history". Thanks!--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 21:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Barinstarim, You are right! It is my ommission (I'm still against merger by the way!). But I cannot treat everything in such a little time. I am writing this article all day (instead of checking <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Greco_8580.html" title="El Greco">El Greco</a> and starting the rewriting of <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regionalism.html" title="Regionalism">regionalism</a> as I planned to). Give me some credit and some time (if this article survives the current poll)! I cannot do anything in a half day. Happy new year! My best wishes! And goodnight (I think 15 hours writing is enough for one day!)!--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 21:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I added a paragraph on the Armenian deaths to the Ottoman history section. I hope that is acceptable to all involved. Regards, --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 19:14, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey Baris, yeah the paragraph is alright but as I said to Jayzel the issue is important to mention in the article because it has soured relations between Turkey and many countries, the latest to be France and Argentina. It may also be a roadblock between acceptance of Turkey in the EU as once proposed. It has certainly affected Turkish and Armenian relations as we all know. If you check my links, it may also damage US-Turkish relations and Turkey is doing all it can to stop an Armenian bill from being considered in Congress. It doesn't need to be in detail as that detail belongs to another article but a mention is necessary I find. What do you think? And I know what you mean about an edit war right now lol...disaster...Yeni yiliniz kutlu olsun&#160;:D (is that correct? lol) <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 19:40, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Baristarim, even I'm on vacation and I made a promise for not spending time on Wikipedia for a while, I felt like checking my messages today. Congratulations with the FA nomination and everything. You've really made an exemplary effort on that article and I believe it will get the FA status eventually. I can say I'm fairly good with imaging tools and I will be happy to help you with such stuff. Do you have anything in mind for the barnstar (which you will be the first to receive, it seems), or shall I also try to come up with a design? Also, is this urgent or can it wait until a few weeks later?

<dd>Please, do not legitimize fake discussions by taking part in them. You will see that, in time, they will drown in their own fuss, and maybe come back in the form of real articles at last, where I will have the opportunity to read stuff I won't like, but many others will have to go through the same experience, just to see if they will be able to put up with it. Take part only if the discussion is real!!! I think in terms of developing a few articles here, and nothing else. I, too, keep an eye on a number of articles, thank you, but not the eyes of a censurer, I don't own any article.

<p>Yes, I'll post specific comments when I get the time, some time this week. Yes, it's encouraging, but I mostly like to point out what people do right to make sure <i>they keep doing it right</i>, and so that others see what I think is done right--ultimately FAs are a value judgment of the editors who bother to read them. I'm very concerned about the low readability of some Wikipedia articles. I almost didn't bother reading the Turkey article, but decided to when someone commented about the stability in face of prior edit wars. I am also very pleased that, for once with a country article, a group of editors attempted to do the overall picture of the country with the article, rather than propagandize a sanitary picture of the country to the world. I'll get back to the Turkey page with specific comments as soon as I can, but I do want to see what comes of the comments about Armenia and the Kurds from others--I thought Cyprus was already covered okay within the confines of the article. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 18:52, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One of the problems is that people want to read the article about Turkey and have it be the current political situation of Turkey, that isn't its purpose. It simply has to cover the major conflicts as they relate to Turkey today, and in proportion to the entire history of the region that is now called Turkey. Still, you could consume <i>100KB</i> on just Iran and Turkey and leave the reader without a sense of what is going on. I think, with a few omissions that don't actually cloud the value of the article as a whole, as I stated before, that your group really put together a solid article, so just evaluate each criticism and use it as appropriate. It's a tough group of editors at FAC today--this will improve the overall quality of Wikipedia in the long run.

<p>Barış,</p>
<p>(did I get that right?)</p>
<p>I will leave my comments on the talk page alone for a bit, and see what sorts of other comments they get.</p>
<p>I do want to say, though, that I am not anti-Turk, nor will my editing be anti-Turk. I may be a bit more frank than you are comfortable with, but I believe I stay within bounds. For example, you saw that I asked for the references to genocide to be removed, and asked for timelines for each section, so that, for example, improvements (uneven, but improvements) in the right, for example, to use Kurdish, have improved.</p>
<p>(btw, Ozal never said he was partly Kurd, though it is usually assumed that he was)</p>
<p>Anyway, I have only been editing a short while. If you look through my <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jd2718_4103.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jd2718">contributions</a> I think you will find that I do not edit with an anti-Turk POV. If anything, I pay special attention to the POV of those too weak to speak for themselves (either because historically they no longer exist or inhabit that part of the world, or through technology/wealth they are poorly represented on Wikipedia.) So, when people are denied their own language, I do pay extra attention, whether that be in the southeast, or, as I found 18 months ago in Chania, Crete, when a store owner and his daughter spoke broken greek and english to me, then Turkish (!) to each other, and so I answered in Turkish. They were embarassed and ashamed and insisted we only speak English. That people are too afraid to speak their own language, or are banned from it, that is horrible, wherever it happens.</p>
<p>(I still don't know if they were Anatolian Christians or Turks who never left Crete. Most people just tell me I must have been mistaken. It's easier for them to pretend.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I've rambled on too long. I am glad to be editing with you. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 06:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was no "merging" of info as you falsely claim. The info mentioned in th FR section is exactly as it was earlier. You deleted an entire paragraph of specific info (including use of the word "genocide") that was a compromise to gain you additional votes in FAC. Removing this paragraph this late in time in the FAC is deceptive and not working in good faith. Perhaps I would think differently had you sent a notice to those of us involved in the discussion. However, you didn't. As I result, I no longer support this article. FA rules clearly state an article must be stable and not subject to edit wars. This article fails to meet that criteria.

<p>Hi, Baris (may I call you Baris?). I try hard to keep away from Wikipedia until I get rid of this <i>mountain</i> of home assignments I need to complete before mid-January (sorry that this coincided with the time you need help most, for fencing off these sockpuppets). But occasionally I find myself doing minor edits here and there. I have a concern which I think I should share with you before long: The language you are using when you get angry with vandal anons and the like (I mean the Turkish, including swear words, in your edit summaries), is very, very disturbing for me. It doesn't bother me at all to see such edit summaries in attacks of anons whose only purpose is without doubt to disturb things. But, to see these coming from an established editor makes me feel awfully disturbed. Today's happening was the second. Please keep cool and remember that it won't serve any purpose except making the party you're dealing with happy, or more fierce.

<dd>İlk defa size Türkçe yazıyorum. Öneri / uyarımı anlayışla karşıladığınıza çok sevindim. Bu kadar abuk insanla oldukça iyi başediyorsunuz ve sinirlenmeniz normal. Fark ettiyseniz ufak bir de harita sorunu ortaya çıktı. Anladığım kadarıyla Commons'daki Avrupa ülkelerinin konum haritalarını yapan kişi, Türkiye'yi Avrupa'ya referansla gösteren bir harita kullanıldığında bütün ülkenin Avrupa kıtasında olduğu iddia edilip yanlış bilgilendirme yapılıyormuş gibi hissediyormuş. Yeni hazırladığı haritalarda da lejandı sağ altta çok güzel ayarlanmış bir yere denk getirerek hem Kafkas ülkelerinin hem de Türkiye'nin transkontinental durumundan kurtulmaya çalıştığı bence çok açık. Avrupa ülkeleri için yeni yaptığı haritaların arkaplanını da kendisi hazırladığı ve boş durumda Commons'a yüklemediği için yeni güzel bir harita üretmekte güçlük çekiyorum. Bu kullandığı haritayı oturup eliyle çizmediği açık. Arayıp kaynağını bulup, Avrupa ülkeleri için kullanılanlarla görüntü olarak uyumlu ve Türkiye'nin üzeri kapatılmamış güzel bir harita yapmaya çalışıyorum. Her durumda şimdiki "Turkey in Africa" haritası gerçekten çok komik. Sanıyorum oylamadaki Afrika ilişkileri olayı burada da baş gösterdi. Burada İngilizce dışında yazışılmasını onaylamadığım halde ben bu kadar uzun Türkçe yazı neden yazdım açıkçası bilmiyorum.

<p>Hey, it was my pleasure to help out in the little way that I did with <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. As for changing standards and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_literature.html" title="Turkish literature">Turkish literature</a>, it seems to me that the article won't be affected insofar as the major thing being discussed is inline citations, which the article already has (22 of them, to be exact—if someone comes along and deems that number not sufficient for some reason, it would be no great chore to add more). But thanks for the heads-up; I'll keep my eye on it (actually, I watch that page like a hawk anyhow; now I guess I'll just watch it like a hungry hawk).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hagia Sophia and Sinan</span></h2>
<p>Hello Baris and happy new year:). About the issue we got involved in the article about Hagia Sophia. I think that it is quite important to mention that Sinan was born as Christian. Maybe his restoration works were made only cause the then Sultan asked him to, but the fact that he had been raised up as Christian could mean that he had emotional bond with that religion, without meaning that he was not a Muslim. Btw, some of the sultans whose mothers were Christians, were more friendly towards their Christian subjects than others. Sinan may not had been Greek (he may as well had been of Armenian descent), however, in his early years he was Greek Orthodox (according to most sources, including Britannica), and the issues of nationality and nation-state did not have the same evolution for all ethnic groups (the Byzantine Empire ended its history as a Greek nation-state, <i>almost by the modern meaning of the term</i> and in countries like Japan, Scotland or or Portugal, nationality had been already formed when Sinan was born). Perhaps it is cause of Sinan's past and special interest for Greek Orthodoxy that his only work on Greek soil, Osman Shah Mosque<a href="http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.tcl?site_id=4037" class="external autonumber" title="http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.tcl?site_id=4037" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, has remained standing, restored and in perfect condition (including its minaret), and has not been demolised like others.

<p>You must be the blind one. :) for the media files were not added in the article. As you exactly said, it was added under the subgroup of "media" (newly formed) like the other subsections you listed. Media is a recognized subsection and used as such in other articles like references, links etc. You may want to consider stopping your territorial reversals, if you can.

<p>The use of Media subsection is not inclusive or exclusive of country related articles. It can be part of any article. See John F Kennedy article where there was a preexisting media subsection with a video fragment of inaguration where others can add pertinent media files. Turkey article is no exception and video - music -speech files can be added as needed. <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDADASHIM_bc50.html" title="User:DADASHIM">DADASHIM</a> 07:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I need a written wikipedia reference indicating presence of media files precluding featured article status (in any article category) and or the use of media files is unprofessional. I am very curious. Also, you may be sadly mistaken and may be passing up on an improvement that would bring extra points in your article (unless you have convincing written wiki guidelines suggesting not to use media subsections) <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDADASHIM_bc50.html" title="User:DADASHIM">DADASHIM</a> 07:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Even if I was accepting you r argument (however 99% of turkish cypriots have cypriot citizenship and they are requesting for that even Denktas' grandsons) that they are just citizens of KKTC, they are considered Cypriots, since they are from the island of Cyprus.

<p>Well I didn't observed that I deleted it. Sorry. I just reverted it and I didn't observe that someone put the correct year of birth. This is no problem and we don't disagree. The problem and difference between us is that hte article must bot be under turkish x rather than turkish cypriots and cypriot x. If you want to create a category, called Turkish Cypriot X, no problem for me. <a href="../../../k/r/b/User%7EKRBN_3818.html" title="User:KRBN">KRBN</a> 23:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it's ok, I have no problem with "Cypriot X" category. :) I hear your reasoning and as long as you are only going to modify the categories, then it's fine with me.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Categorization of Turkish Cypriots</span></h2>
<p>Greetings Baristarim</p>
<p>I've not had the time to properly check what is going on here, but I do have some experience with the category system, so please allow me to stick very closely to that. In my experience, KRBN will be correct in saying that the category tree is based on nations, not ethnicity. To use my own nation as an example: <a href="../../../d/a/n/Category%7EDanish_people_0f1a.html" title="Category:Danish people">Cat:Danish people</a> is a child of <a href="../../../d/e/n/Category%7EDenmark_bfbf.html" title="Category:Denmark">Cat:Denmark</a>, it is not the other way around. The following is a bad example, but it is the best I can think of at such short notice: If I were to tag an article about a member of the Danish minority in Germany, say one of the ethnic Danish local politicians in Schleswig-Holstein, I would consider this person to be represented by <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_people_eb8c.html" title="Category:German people">Cat:German people</a> and - if we were talking about a politician - I would classify him under <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_politicians_c31b.html" title="Category:German politicians">Cat:German politicians</a>. If it was relevant that the person also had strong contacts with Denmark, I would use both a profession category based on the nation the person is a citizen of (<a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_politicians_c31b.html" title="Category:German politicians">Cat:German politicians</a>) plus an ethnic category, but only if this was very relevant. Since, in this case, a "Danish Germans" category does not exist, I would look for a category under <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchleswig-Holstein_a0f4.html" title="Category:Schleswig-Holstein">Cat:Schleswig-Holstein</a>. If we were talking about a Russian living (or born) in Latvia, I would use the relavant Latvian categories, but perhaps add the a "Russian-Latvian" category if such a category exists.</p>
<p>I know that Cyprus is a troubled island. The dispute does not only hurt everybody living there, but also both Greece and Turkey. I have not checked the Cypriot material lately, but last time I checked, the Cypriot-Greek material generally did not use the Greek category tree but the Cypriot tree, for the reason described above. You'll naturally already know the category called <a href="../../../t/u/r/Category%7ETurkish_Cypriots_8390.html" title="Category:Turkish Cypriots">Cat:Turkish Cypriots</a>. Would it be possible to tag e.g. an article about a Turkish Cypriot scientist as <a href="../../../c/y/p/Category%7ECypriot_scientists_81b0.html" title="Category:Cypriot scientists">Cat:Cypriot scientists</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Category%7ETurkish_Cypriots_8390.html" title="Category:Turkish Cypriots">Cat:Turkish Cypriots</a> at the same time, perhaps using something of the form "... is a <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Cypriot_d49d.html" title="Turkish Cypriot">Turkish Cypriot</a> scientist ..." in the introduction? Naturally, if either <a href="../../../g/r/e/Category%7EGreek_Cypriots_5b55.html" title="Category:Greek Cypriots">Cat:Greek Cypriots</a> or <a href="../../../t/u/r/Category%7ETurkish_Cypriots_8390.html" title="Category:Turkish Cypriots">Cat:Turkish Cypriots</a> is a child or parent of the any such category, the same should also apply for the other group. So far, Wikipedia practice has generally been to consider Cyprus one unit, but this argument seems to have been based on geography, not politics.</p>
<p>I am normally very strongly against ethnic categories in the first place, but if you and others find my first suggestion impossible, perhaps categories of the form Cat:Turkish Cypriot writers might be a workable solution. However, AFAIK, such a system has never been attempted in cases such as this, and I still prefer the first system since Wikipedia generally considers the island a unit. I would find it non-standard to simply group Turkish Cypriots into the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Category%7ETurkish_people_be32.html" title="Category:Turkish people">Cat:Turkish people</a> categories, and I would recommend some type of solution either in the form of a Cypriot category tree encompassing all Cypriots, or alternatively adding sub-branches to the Turkish Cypriot tree.</p>
<p>The argument about additional information being erased: Interwiki links, places of birth / death, alumini information etc. is all very relevant and must be included. I don't see a problem with an introduction saying that "Mr. ... is a Turkish Cypriot writer ...".</p>
<p>In my personal experience, I have found <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> both interested and fair when it comes to material such as this. The same with <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion">User:Nightstallion</a> who is also very interested in international material. I would recommend that both of you start by avoiding further edits to the categories tonight and post messages to both of them asking for further input or suggestions. Both will also be able to give good ideas on how to procede in case of gridlock. These are just my thoughts. Please see them in good faith since this is my intention.

<dd> :) I know what you are thinking, but that wasn't it.. See my latest post to his talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKRBN&amp;diff=98947152&amp;oldid=98944705" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKRBN&amp;diff=98947152&amp;oldid=98944705" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. It is a normal misunderstanding when it is one of those "darn Greek-Turkish things", I know :) But if you take a close look, you will see that my primary concern was his reverts that included even the deletion of the interwikis to Turkish Wikipedia as well as alumni categories, birthdates and birthplaces, living people cats etc. I know what you are saying about the cat system, no problems there. I was also confused since there were many different edits taking place while the professed issue was about the "Turkish X" cats. However, he explained to me that he was reverting to <i>much</i> earlier versions of those articles, and that's why they were being deleted.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">TRNC-stub</span></h2>
<p>Hi - your recent stub type creation - TRNC-stub, haas been speeedily deleted as a re-creation of previously deleted material. Cyprus-stub is used for all of the island off Cyprus, irrespective of whether it falls in the TRNC or the Greek-controlled area (or the British bases, for that matter). The <a href="../../../c/y/p/Category%7ECyprus_stubs_a1dc.html" title="Category:Cyprus stubs">Cat:Cyprus stubs</a> is not yet at a size when it would be suitable to split it, and even if it were, there is a long-standing precedent that only widely accepted international states and substates should get separate stub types. Also please note that all new stub types should be proposed at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a> several days prior to creation, in order for discussion to take place on their potential use and problems. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 22:50, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You wrote: <i>Ok, but there is no stub to regroup all TRNC related stubs together... I am sorry, but this is about the TRNC as a political entity, whether it is recognized or not. There is no political undertone. Cyprus stub utilizes the flag of its opposing state, so there is not much logic to use it for topics concerning TRNC like "politics of TRNC". The problem is, Cyprus-stub is not a geographical stub, it uses the Republic of Cyprus flag, which means that it is a political stub, right? If it used the geographical map of Cyprus, then there wouldn't be a problem. However, I didn't know about the proposing procedure. But there is still a problem with utilizing the Cyprus stub. So, what is the solution?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well firstly the stub is meant to use a map - someone vandalously edited the flag in (I've put the map back). And no, it is not a political stub, it is forr any general, non-geographic articles relatd to Cyprus geographical items get Cyprus-geo-stub). As to TRNC as a political entity, I understand your point, but, as I said, given the size of the Cyprus stubs category, it shouldn't be difficult to find stubs relating to the TRNC in there. And though I personally have no problems with the existence off the TRNC, the problem is with editors in general. Because they are used on large numbers of articles, edit was on templates can cause considerable problems for Wikipedia's servers. Stub templates aree pparticularly susceptible to this, and also often take a great deal of effort to fix if there are problems, due to their associated category links. Any region which is of only partially recoggnised status runs into problems with its stub type. So as to minimise these probleems, disputed territories and territories without wide international recognition don't get separate templates. The problem is not so much that of any individual territory, but more one of precedent. If TRNC gets a stub type, it will be only a few days before a Transnistria one is suggested. If that is approved, then Chechnya and Somaliland are suggested. And with each small step the likelihood off a tenmplate edit was becomes greater. I realise the cut-off point of "wide international recognition" is fairly arbitrary, but at least it sets a reasonable level above which there is little likelihood of problems occurring (even then, ther aree a few problems, but maainly very minor ones). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Baristarim, you have created many articles which I disagree with its content, Neurobio has created none such articles and is answered with such a harsh fashion by me, so it could certainly not be his position. The madhouse comment is just the point of the iceberg. Are we reading the same things? I think so, this guy after I announced leaving Wikipedia had left a message to Cool_Cat to come back, who was still on probation and adviced not to touch the article(he was even for a time forbidden to touch the article). This same guy has spammed with Thoth the talkpage over and over again. This same guy bringing back what has been addressed over and over again. This same guy has openly called this article trash and requested a "Jihad" on it. Those are just few examples. Not to say his personal association with the author of tallarmeniantale. I will always refuse to work with this guy, and past one administrator who defend him, it would not be long for any editors to see that he is not a well intentioned person. What hurts most in all this, is that the same administrator who gave me a barnsar for my contribution on this article is also the only one who is defending this guy. If you want to contribute to the article, I will appreciate that, but there is no question that I will respect a racist idiot who calls my douzens of hours of contributions trash, and who had build a personality specifically to attack my credibility here on Wikipedia. This guy own an apology for all the crap he did, and has yet to stop with his prejudicial comments. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:51, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Listen, you better stop treating others as if they were some vandals like you did here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C5%9Fak&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99423789" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U%C5%9Fak&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99423789" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. There is no source that says that the city's name comes from "lovers". Any unsourced information can be deleted. And there is no such thing as "alternative transliteration". I will fix that as well. "revert deliberate missorting" has absolutely no meaning, I <i>know</i> how sorting works. There was no reason for you to blindly revert like you did here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C4%B0smet_%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC&amp;diff=99407234&amp;oldid=99257180" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C4%B0smet_%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC&amp;diff=99407234&amp;oldid=99257180" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Had you taken a closer look, you would have noticed that I hadn't touched the first letter, which is the only important letter for sorting. I am very careful with my work, but as I said I also forget certain things. There is no reason to modify anything except the first letter. I reverted you at Inonu, and it still shows up correctly in its categories, take a look if you like. Please do not do any more such modifications.. It seems like I will have to revert some of your other blind reverts. Please take a look at your own work before you order others to fix I don't know what.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 23:13, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the first letter is most definitely <b>not</b> the only one important for sorting. All the letters—in fact, all characters, of whatever sort including spaces and apostrophes and hyphens and whatever—are sorted (we sometimes use that to get some articles to the top of the category listing). So go fix them. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 23:32, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the very fact that you posted a WP:3RR warning on my talkpage after a single reversion was uncivil. It's not an "ad hominim" attack. Accusing another user of vandalism when they revert incivility from their talkpage is at best a demonstration of unfamiliarity with Wikipedia's policies. The warning was not legitimate. I can remove any comment you post on my talkpage and I do not have to state why.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ethnicities</span></h2>
<p>Hi Baris, following this;</p>
<p>Nationality (In the normal case this will mean the country of which the person is a citizen or national, or was a citizen when the person became notable. Ethnicity should generally not be emphasized in the opening unless it is relevant to the subject's notability.)</p>
<p>the first part of this sequence of propositions proves you right BUT please take a closer look at this "unless it is relevant to the subject's notability". Now, Yilmaz Guney and people like him in Turkey have all got exceptions in this case for their ethnicity to be included boldly because relevant to the subject's notability; he's criticism of Turkey, the laws that have restricted him to make his films in Kurdish. I urge you to watch his documentary, From Adana to Paris, and see what he has to say about his ethnicity. These are important names for both Kurdish people and Turkey, it is the Kurdish culture contributing to modern Turkey. Same principle applies to other Kurd artists. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 02:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Respect: Ataturk NOT Atatürk</span></h2>
<p>Baris, thanks for your quick response but please do not change anything on Ataturk High School of Science. That is the link you have broken. Please do not do any changes related to that name or page. It is your own will to change others but you are quite mistaken about your statement below. Statement: 'Wikipedia is in English language and the Latin alphabet.' Argument: Wikipedia is in several languages and each language has its own alphabet and en.wikipedia.org is in English and uses the English alphabet not the Latin alphabet. Another example is tr.wikipedia.org is in Turkish and uses the Turkish alphabet not the Latin alphabet. You would be correct to say that it uses ideas and characters from the Latin alphabet but the latin alphabet is totally different. Like 'ü'. For an English reader this causes problem. An English reader wouldn't be able to read it. A German maybe could understand what you mean but an English reader wouldn't. See Tokyo. It isn't refered to with its Japanese alphabet. But the Japanese version is given with a paranthesis in the begining.</p>
