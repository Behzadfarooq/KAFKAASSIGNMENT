<p><small><i>Note about chronology of discussion</i>: The discussions on this page have been left generally in the order in which contributors chose to insert their comments; please note, however, that the earliest discussions may appear further down the page than responses to those early discussions. Also, many were initially unsigned and undated. I have made the effort today to use the "unsigned" template and the Talk page history to fix this confusion; also, in a few places where the chronology jumps around, I added an indentation to clarify the thread of discussion (i.e., who is responding to whom, when). I know some may see that as taking liberties, but I am trying simply to <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> in helping to clarify a confusing discussion.<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 21:47, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>7/4/06 This removal stuff is getting ridiculous and it smacks of censorship! Other celebrities have Wikipedia entries about somewhat sensitive things about their personal life, what makes Barry Manilow so sacrosanct that no one can talk about stuff that is mentioned right here on the discussion page? I was attempting to address the issue raised earlier on this page re: no information personal life. I put in a perfectly FAIR paragraph about the biographies and his personal life, everything I put in there was VERIFIABLE with legitimate sources...and it was removed by Wakeenah in its entirety! I would say that if enough people are discussing it here at this talk page AND throughout cyberspace...it is VERY relevant! I say that my paragraph should be re-instated (at least the part about the marriages) and this page then be put on a protected basis.<a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadycascadia_461e.html" title="User:Ladycascadia">Ladycascadia</a> 22:15, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are trying to push your own personal agenda of "outing" someone who has not stated publicly what his orientation is. I don't care if you have TEN books that say he's gay. Until HE HIMSELF says so, or until someone has published a verifiable photo of him making out with another man, it is <i>irrelevant</i>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:45, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wakheena, you do not not know me, so I feel it is out of line to accuse me of having any sort of "agenda" personal or otherwise. I really don't care one way or another. Despite what you might think, I have no "agenda" nor am I "outing" or "closeting" anyone here! I merely attempted to address the first issue addressed here at the talk page re: the lack of information on Mr. Manilow's personal life. Based on other Wikipedia pages about other celebrities and their relationships or lack thereof, I do not feel it is wrong to have that paragraph. The marriage and the cohabitational relationships are definitely verifiable. Manilow himself even wrote two songs about the relationships he was involved in. One was called <i>Some Good Things Never Last</i> which is available on the Barry Manilow album from 1989. The other is called <i>A Linda Song</i> which is on the Even Now album from 1977. That fact can be backed up by his OFFICIAL website, Barrynet. So perhaps you can tell us editors here how best to write about this topic without rejecting it out of hand or making any unfounded accusations. I happen to be a Manilow fan, and I do not mean any harm to him or his career. As for the stuff about Manilow's alleged orientation... like it or not, the speculation is there, and has been there for a long time. I didn't invent it. I also noticed that any references to his early career playing piano for Bette Midler at the Continental Baths has been excised from the page as well. Now this is a well known fact that any true Manilow fan knows, and has been for more than 30 years. So why can't that be discussed or placed on the page? <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadycascadia_461e.html" title="User:Ladycascadia">Ladycascadia</a> 02:24, 5 July 2006 (UTC) 02:21, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

Of course we cannot 'prove' whether Manilow is gay or not, just as you cannot 'prove' that he is not. What difference does it make if we have a photograph of it or not? Did we have any of Rock Hudson? No, but that didn't change the fact that he was gay. Manilow would have been crazy to make a public statement of his sexuality, as it would have severely hurt his record sales, and he is in business, after all. If Manilow doesn't want to talk about his private life, there is a good enough reason for it, and it's his decision, but the writing is clearly on the wall. Whoever removed the info regarding Barry's origins at the Continental is the one who has the "agenda", as stated elsewhere on this page. References to Manilow's sexuality do not belong on the main page, but the information about his professional origins does. Get over it! VertigoXpress 15:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It might be argued that it is YOU who has the "agenda" by completely removing the ENTIRE paragraph then making an attack such as you did in the history section accusing people of slander. This is NOT my intent. Fine, you win. I'm not going to participate in this section anymore. It's not worth all this aggravation. May I suggest, however, that you take a look at the wikipedia profile for say Jim Morrison of the Doors? There is a large section dealing with Morrison's personal life, some of which is unsubstantiated, but no one sees fit to go in there and expurge entire sections and then accuse others of having "bad" intentions. So what if Manilow is or is not gay? Does it make him a lesser musician? absolutely not! Johnny Mathis is gay and it hasn't hurt his fan base, nor has it hurt the fan bases of Elton John or Ellen Degeneres. Other stars are straight and it doesn't change a thing, either. I think that an emotionally mature fan or person is not afraid to discuss ALL aspects of a celebrity's life, but you needn't worry...I will not be coming back here since in your zeal to 'overprotect' you see fit to make unwarranted attacks on the characters of other Wikipedians as you did on Arniep and myself...and in doing, so you are indulging in a bit of a hypocrisy, don't you think?

Unless someone either says they are, or someone produces a photo of them making out with a same-sex partner, or if it is <i>proven</i> some way (and not just somebody's opinion, in a book or whatever), then it is nothing more than gossip and has no place here. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>10/7/06 Anybody ever bother to read his autobiography? He talks about his marriage and his relationships with women. He does not state that he is gay. I don't give a crap if he is. Unless HE says so, it's nobody's business. Does it make his music any worse or better?

<p>Barry Manilow's NOT gay! He's been living with his lady friend Linda Allen. I don't know for sure if they are still together I heard rumours that in 2000 they broke up:( But now I heard that he's with some new chick named Keely(Watson?). Jeez it just goes to show you he's got a big heart and accepts people of all kinds and that does NOT make him gay in any way. Don't get me wrong I've got nothing against gay people but I know Barry's NOT one of them!</p>

<dd>Comment: It is so amusing when one sees these clueless "fans," who worship a performer, and not his work. The key word is "worship," not "appreciate," or "understand." Mention that a peformer, composer, playwright, etc. might be gay, and these "fans" become apopleptic. That Mr. Manilow is gay is such common knowledge among urbanites and others in the music industry, that no one even raises an eyebrow. These "fans," wherever they live, with their heads (or whatever) in the sand, inhabit a time-warp all their own, oblivious even to their "idol." Ditto for his middle-aged hard-up female "admirers," for Liberace. Those women of a certain age, who repeatedly denied any hint of a suggestion of an innuendo that he might somewhow be *gasp* homosexual. Wake up; Manilow is gay. You can be a fan in spite of his serious moral failing, or whatever your sense of values decrees it to be. We can list these groups indefinitely: Elton John, Liberace, George Michael, Stephen Sondheim, etc. etc. Enjoy the music, and don't be overly concerned about what he does in his bedroom, or with whom. 66.108.4.183 13:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

First of all his private life is his private life and working in this business will not change what we know and don't know. The comparison with Liberace is not needed. First of all the public are a lot more understanding today and most people guessed liberace was a poofter before he died. Not so in Barry's case.

<p>Just to clarify, Barry Manilow is straight. Married once, then in long term relationships with women. I think this person who keeps writing here about it is the gay one. One thing that should be outed though is his plastic surgery - he can hardly move his face know, and Jonathan Ross, who interviewed him, stated that he has definitely had "work".</p>

<p>Ok.

<dd>But our old friend Barry has developed some new interests (and a new blond hair color) since his popularity peaked in the 1970s. Perhaps a better name for him these days is Broadway Barry.</dd>
<dd>[ ... ]</dd>
<dd>Adding to the show's Vegas-y feel was Manilow's audience interaction and his crotch-grabbing dance move during "Copacabana."</dd>

<dd>Yeah; *that's* what I would construe as a primary source. Thanks to the anonymous poster (I've trimmed the quote down to avoid copyvio), and my apologies to those I was arguing with. Baylink 18:07, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I attended Barry's Vegas Show "Music and Passion" July 5th 2006, and I can verifiy that I did see him grab his crotch during the lyrics "show em what you got" (or something to that effect) on the Copa Cabana finale up on a raised platform. My take was that it was a bit toung in cheek, but I was surprised by it.

<p>Please note whoever it is that keeps changing this from the correct version- Manilow's father was Harold Pincus who was son of Harry Pincus (who was Russian-Jewish) and Anna Sheehan (who was Irish). His grandparents separated and his grandmother remarried an Irish truckdriver named Kelliher- he was not Manilow's grandfather as some biographies have incorrectly stated.

<hr />
<p>Here's proof that Barry isn't an atheist he actually answered some of my questions and this is one of them: me-Are you really an atheist now? Barry Manilow-I'm not an atheist. As you know, the definition of atheist is: Somebody who does not believe in God or other deities. I believe that there is someone, we know not who, that is doing something, we know not what. I believe in a "force,” an "All That Is.” But I know that there is some beautiful energy that only wants good for us and that we can access this energy whenever we want it. And I believe that we are all here to become brave enough to allow that energy through us so that we can help others and forgive everyone and ourselves.</p>

<p>On several fronts, this article is good - it is accurate, broad in coverage, relatively NPOV (although there is a lot of puffy language - "Manilow got the century off to a good start" etc - not a lot, but glowing language is not the best.) However, I have two major bones of contention. While some of the images are good, the enormous collection of album covers at the bottom seems excessive, although I know other pages do this too. It just addes a tremendous amount of length. This is also true of the huge list of singles.</p>
<p>My biggest concern, however, is the sheer length of the prose. I feel that the article goes into excessive detail, mentioning every single he released, detailing every tour and special, and so on. Quoting Manilow in paragraph after paragraph, as though annotating the actual information in the article with Manilow's own comments, also tends to bloat it into overlength. The lead and table of contents are also too long. My suggestion would be for an editor or editors to cut this rather ruthlessly. You might also consider looking at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> to see how another long article with a prolific subject deals with trying to incorporate everything at once.

<p>It needs more in-line citations on a lot of paragraphs—GA reviewers look kindly on that sort of thing. Also: Try and condense/join together some sentences. It looks like a trivia article at times; if things happened in the same year, you can put them together. It makes the prose flow a little more. (I have learned this from past experiences, BTW...)

<dd>The article has improved quite a bit since I reviewed it 2 weeks ago, thanks for considering my suggestions. It still has a bit too much play-by-play for my taste (and then on May 1, 1989, he released this single. And then on May 30 1989 he recorded a duet with Cher. etc etc) but it isn't quite as sprawling as it had been. -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 05:01, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
