<p><b>Dr. Heinrich Zemo, 12th Baron Zemo</b> was one of the top <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">scientists</a> in the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Party_3bfc.html" title="Nazi Party">Nazi Party</a> who fought Captain America and his allies during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. He once held the title of "Most Hated Man in Europe". Zemo dressed in a red costume with a <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hood_%28headgear%29.html" title="Hood (headgear)">hooded</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask.html" title="Mask">mask</a> so that he would not be identified by an enemy of the Nazis.</p>
<p>Zemo created many weapons, including a <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_ray.html" title="Death ray">death ray</a>, a disintegration <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pistol.html" title="Pistol">pistol</a> that was a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniaturization.html" title="Miniaturization">miniaturized</a> version of his death ray, primitive <a href="../../../a/n/d/Android.html" title="Android">androids</a>, and the so-called "Adhesive X", an <a href="../../../a/d/h/Adhesive.html" title="Adhesive">adhesive</a> that could not be removed by any known process. (Only after the war, the adhesive-using villain called <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trapster.html" title="Trapster">Paste-Pot Pete</a> found a way to neutralize it.)</p>

<p>While in battle with <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a>, a vial of Adhesive X shattered onto his mask; the adhesive poured inside and permanently attached the mask to his face. Although Zemo could still see through the eyeholes and hear, speak and breathe through the mask's thin fabric, he could no longer use his mouth to eat and had to be fed intravenously. Zemo was driven insane by this disfigurement.</p>
<p>Apparently the Nazis never considered simply destroying the mask; it has been conjectured that the adhesive made the fabric preternaturally resilient, or that Zemo simply chose not to risk damaging his face further<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> .</p>
<p>No longer confined to science only, Zemo started to lead combat and espionage missions and was rivaled in these only by the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Skull_e882.html" title="Red Skull">Red Skull</a>; the two quickly became rivals.</p>
<p>When it became apparent that the Nazis would lose the war, the Skull sent Zemo to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to steal an experimental <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">airplane</a>. At this point the plane would do them no good, but the Skull made sure this knowledge was leaked to Captain America and his young sidekick <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucky.html" title="Bucky">Bucky</a>.</p>
<p>The Skull knew that no matter who won, one of his enemies would be out of his way, possibly even killed.</p>
<p>One of Zemo's androids knocked Bucky out, and Captain America was felled by Zemo's stun gun. They were tied to the plane, which was now booby-trapped to explode, and launched to their deaths. Captain America fell from the plane as it exploded, and Bucky was apparently killed. Captain America landed in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> and was frozen in <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice.html" title="Ice">ice</a> for decades until recovered by the recently-formed Avengers.</p>
<p>Zemo, now living in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, learned of his enemy's return and renewed the rivalry. He formed the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masters_of_Evil_3919.html" title="Masters of Evil">Masters of Evil</a> to serve as a villainous counterpart to the Avengers; the other founding members included the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Knight_%28comics%29_4623.html" title="Black Knight (comics)">Black Knight</a>, the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melter.html" title="Melter">Melter</a> and the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_Man_%28Marvel_Comics%29_ca45.html" title="Radioactive Man (Marvel Comics)">Radioactive Man</a>, and they were later joined by the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Enchantress_%28Marvel_Comics%29_2a8c.html" title="Enchantress (Marvel Comics)">Enchantress</a>, and the <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executioner.html" title="Executioner">Executioner</a>.</p>
<p>In his final battle with Captain America, the Captain's <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shield.html" title="Shield">shield</a> deflected a beam from Zemo's gun, which caused an avalanche that killed Zemo.</p>

<p>Zemo's legacy was revived by his son, <b>Helmut J. Zemo, 13th Baron Zemo</b> who was born in <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Germany. Helmut was originally an engineer until he became enraged when reading a report about the return of Captain America. Helmut would ultimately follow in his father's footsteps as a supervillain using his family's money and his own scientific know-how to recreate his fathers work.</p>
<p>He first surfaced under the codename of "The Phoenix" (not to be confused with any <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Force_%28comics%29_f0ff.html" title="Phoenix Force (comics)">other characters who have used this codename</a>, such as <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Grey_4319.html" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Summers_36cc.html" title="Rachel Summers">Rachel Summers</a>), and was presumed deceased when he fell into a vat of boiling, specially-treated Adhesive X. As he had not been wearing his mask when he fell into the vat, his face was hideously <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scar.html" title="Scar">scarred</a> by the boiling Adhesive X.</p>
<p>He resurfaced years later, first allied with <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnim_Zola_711d.html" title="Arnim Zola">Arnim Zola's</a> <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutate.html" title="Mutate">mutates</a> and later with the Red Skull and his allies. Most notably, he formed a new incarnation of the Masters of Evil, one which invaded the Avengers' Mansion and crippled <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules_%28comics%29.html#Marvel_Comics" title="Hercules (comics)">Hercules</a> and the Avengers' butler Edwin Jarvis. Zemo was again believed dead, though he eventually returned, now married to a woman named Heike who had once called herself <b>Baroness Zemo</b> and had claimed to be the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of Heinrich Zemo.</p>

<p>Zemo, having abandoned Heike to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a>, organized a new team of Masters of Evil when the Avengers and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantastic_Four_3810.html" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a> disappeared during the <a href="../../../o/n/s/Onslaught_%28comics%29.html" title="Onslaught (comics)">Onslaught</a> crisis and were presumed dead. These Masters of Evil took false identities and called themselves the <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunderbolts_%28comics%29.html" title="Thunderbolts (comics)">Thunderbolts</a>. Leading them under the alias <b><a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_V_094b.html" title="Citizen V">Citizen V</a></b> (a twist of irony, as Heinrich Zemo had killed the original Citizen V during World War II) Zemo planned to have the Thunderbolts gain the world's trust in order to conquer it. The public took a liking to the team much quicker than Zemo or any of the other Thunderbolts expected and soon most of the team began to like being heroes.</p>
<p>When the missing heroes returned, Zemo had their true identities leaked, forcing them to flee with him into deep space to assist his plan to conquer the world through mind control. However, most of the Thunderbolts rebelled and foiled Zemo's plan. Zemo went into hiding and plotted revenge on his former teammates (who were trying to win back the public's trust by being true heroes). After another of Zemo's plans was foiled by Captain America and a new Citizen V (Dallas Riordan), Helmut was killed by the new <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scourge_of_the_Underworld_896e.html" title="Scourge of the Underworld">Scourge of the Underworld</a>, though his mind was transferred via bio-modem technology into the body of a comatose John Watkins III, grandson of the original Citizen V. Now in possession of Watkins' body, Zemo again played the role of Citizen V, this time as a member of the V-Battalion until the Thunderbolts' final battle with Graviton, in which, his consciousness was removed from Watkins' body and transferred in <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">electronic</a> form, into his ally <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixer_%28comics%29.html" title="Fixer (comics)">Fixer's</a> mechanical "tech-pack".</p>
<p>On the artificial world Counter-Earth - the same world to which the Avengers and Fantastic Four had previously vanished - the Thunderbolts encountered Zemo's counterpart in that world, <b>Iron Cross</b>. Fixer transferred Zemo's mind into his double's unmutilated body. Zemo then took up leadership of the Thunderbolts who were on Counter-Earth; when this group was reunited with their teammates who had remained on the normal <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a> Earth, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkeye_%28comics%29.html" title="Hawkeye (comics)">Hawkeye</a> briefly resumed leadership but then left the team to return to the Avengers.</p>
<p>For a while Zemo remained the leader of the Thunderbolts. In 2004's "Avengers/Thunderbolts" limited series he attempted to take over the world again -- this time with the belief that he could save the world by taking it over. Zemo now seems to be motivated by a twisted altruism rather than his original selfish desires; he feels he has grown beyond his father in that regard. However, the Avengers foiled his scheme, his teammate <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonstone_%28comics%29.html" title="Moonstone (comics)">Moonstone</a> went berserk, Zemo's new body was blasted while he attempted to protect <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a>, and he left the team and went into hiding after obtaining Moonstone's twin alien gems, two artifacts of great power.</p>

<p>More recently, Zemo has been manipulating the United States government, the New Thunderbolts, the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_Man_2549.html" title="Purple Man">Purple Man</a>, the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron_Sinister_8c2a.html" title="Squadron Sinister">Squadron Sinister</a>, and a host of other relatively obscure Marvel characters. His goals are unknown, but he is clearly still motivated by a desire to save the world by taking it over, or at least manipulating it towards what he perceives as a beneficial future. Zemo has also, apparently through trial and error, learned how to use the power of the moonstones in various ways, from simply generating raw energy, to transporting himself and others through time, space, and dimensions, to viewing possible future events through dimensional rifts — and, apparently, to repair his damaged face (or, to at least to create the illusion that it was undamaged). He has also recruited members of both his original and subsequent incarnations of the Thunderbolts to his cause, as well as eventually bringing the current team of Thunderbolts around to joining him. The group currently resides in what Zemo calls his "Folding Castle", a structure that he has connected to various other places around the world by dimensional portals.</p>
<p>As a result of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_War_%28comics%29_a01c.html" title="Civil War (comics)">Civil War</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Man_58f4.html" title="Iron Man">Iron Man</a> asked Zemo to begin recruiting villains to his cause...which Zemo had begun doing some time before, unknown to Iron Man. However, he met up with Captain America and informed him that he really had reformed. He showed the Captain his face, once again scarred, to remind him of his earlier sacrifice, and gave him a key that would allow him to escape from the super-human prison being constructed if Captain America would allow his Thunderbolts to fight the Squadron Sinister. He also gave the Captain all his old mementos, destroyed by Zemo in 'Avengers Under Siege', which he had gone back in time and rescued with the help of the Moonstones. Finally, the Captain agreed.</p>
<p>Zemo, always told as a child that he was superior, now believes his father's Nazi ideals to be untrue, and that the only way to become superior is through righteousness. After helping Captain America, he remarked to his father's portait that the man would be displeased with today's good deeds. Zemo -- once again wearing his unscarred face -- then revealed to Songbird that she was going to betray him and he was going to sacrifice himself in their upcoming battle with the Squadron Sinister. He told her that he would not die, but that he would become superior through his sacrifice..."by living forever."</p>
<p>Zemo has now revealed his true nature in Thunderbolts #108, where he saved the Wellspring of Power from the Grandmaster, who planned to use it for his own ends. Believing that all of his visions were subject to the flow of time, and that nothing was set in stone, Zemo defeated the Grandmaster, and boasted to his teammates that the power was now all his--and theirs. He insisted that he would use it to help the world, despite the consequences for doing so. Songbird, who had temporarily lost her powers during the final battle, was told by Zemo "...now is when your betrayal would have come." But the vision of her betrayal turned out to be true after all. Using a simple opera note to crack the moonstones Songbird sent Zemo into a whirlwind of cosmic time/space. Just before he was completely sucked into the vacuum, he screamed out that he "would never have hurt a world he worked so hard to save".</p>

<p>The limited series <i>Thunderbolts Presents: Zemo - Born Better</i> (<a href="../../../f/e/b/February.html" title="February">February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>), written by <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabian_Nicieza_5adf.html" title="Fabian Nicieza">Fabian Nicieza</a> and drawn by Tom Grummet, explores the history of the <a href="../../../z/e/m/Zemo_barony_%28comics%29.html" title="Zemo barony (comics)">Zemo barony</a>. Baron Helmut Zemo, sucked into the vacuum, wakes into medieval Germany (1503), witnessing Harbin Zemo's death and his succession, while in the present an academic called Wendell Volker and <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_Richards_7654.html" title="Reed Richards">Reed Richards</a> deduce that Helmut has travelled in time. Captured and taken prisoner as a <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leper.html" title="Leper">leper</a>, Helmut Zemo manages to inspire Harbin's 12 year old grandson Heller Zemo, to kill his father Hademar Zemo and fullfill his destiny as the third (and most enlightned and progressive) Baron Zemo. When Heller goes into the hidden cell to free his "muse", he discovers that Helmut has somehow disappeared.. Helmut makes jumps to 1556 where he fights alongside Heller's son Herbert Zemo, later again to 1640 where he slays Herbert's son Helmuth Zemo, and later to 1710 where he narrowly escapes being killed by Helmuth's son Hackett Zemo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the present Volker reveals that the Zemo bloodline isn't just limited to Helmut's immediate family but in fact Harbin's descendants are spread out all over the world, and set off for Germany, where he finds Miss Klein, descendant of a bastard child of Hilliard Zemo, the eighth Baron Zemo and his jewish lover Elsbeth Kleinenshvitz. Hilliard becomes baron after the death of his father Hartwig Zemo.</p>
<p>In the past Helmut sees Hilliard and Elsbeth in love, realizing that the residual energy of the Moonstone is drawing him into the present, but forcing him to stop and live every key moment of Zemo's lineage. Zemo manages to save Elsbeth, sentenced to death by the Diet because of her Jewish ancestry and her wealthy family, but in the present Volker kills her distant descendant, convinced that his actions can pull Zemo in his proper place into the Timestream.</p>
