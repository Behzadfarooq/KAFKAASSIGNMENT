<p>wasn't Robin's deckname "Miss Bloody Sunday"?Or is this another "4 kids gonnaunnececairly edit out stuf so litle children wouldnt get scared,although the series is not made for small children, but for higher ages and adults,because there wouldnt be death and woundings and riping of body parts written in it if it was"&#160;? D</p>
<p>That was so difficult to read that it's not at all funny. From what I can tell, Robin's codename was Ms. Allsunday. 4Kids has no rights over the Japenese version. -- A WikiGuest</p>
<p>It was a personel manifestation of protest,rather then a joke.Anyway,in the German Version she IS adressed (by Baroque Works agents and even Sir Crocodile himself) as "Miss Bloody Sunday". You can ask on any German One Piece/Anime Forum. New Babylon.</p>

<dd>We are not suppose to concern oursleves with things from Non-English or Japanese dubs.. Get over it. Don't write it here. This is the ENGLISH dub and the ENGLISH wikipedia. You are not expect to look things up from other dubs and you should not expect others to do so likewise. Do not supply this kind of thing with the idea that telling us where to find it will mean it can stay. The last thing we need is 30+ refs t other languages (do you realise just how many languages One Piece has been translated into now?). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 07:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It states under Ms. Valentine that she killed Ms. Monday, yet it says under Mr. 5 that <i>he</i> did it. Following the English manga, I think it was Mr. 5. And, as there aren't any art edits, I do believe it would be correct.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/i/p/Cipher_Pol_ea22.html" title="Cipher Pol">Cipher Pol</a> page lists all of the members on a single page, and that seems to be working pretty well. Perhaps the Baroque Works article should do the same. After all, there isn't really that much information in many of the Baroque Works members pages. Some, like Crocodile and Mr. 2 should probably remain seperate, however. Anyone agree or disagree? <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 06:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to see some <i>sources</i> on Mr 1's supposed 51 million bounty, because I seem to recall that being nothing but a far to long lived rumor based upon Zoro's bounty.</p>
<p>I also removed the 42 million bounty listed on Mr 3, as the three translations I have access to regarding chapter 125 (Stephen's, the official Swedish and an unknown english translation) all agreed that he <i>defeated</i> a man with a 42 million bounty (which <i>isn't</i> the same thing as having that bounty himself). 81.227.98.242 19:34, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since no-one posted any sources I removed the note regarding Mr 1's supposed bounty. If you're going to add it again, please provide an actual source <i>before</i> doing so.81.227.106.71 17:41, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a thought. This has somehow been bugging me since the page has been set up.Are there 13 main agent groups or 14?</p>
<p>If we disregard the male members' code names (Mr. 0 - Mr. 13), consider Mr. 2's position is supposed to a group position, note the Unluckies as being a separate group from the Billions and Millions, and count them all, the number of main agent groups that don't consist of random grunts adds up to 14.</p>

<p>I noticed someone linked to his page recently. To correct this link, from what I gather, that page is a redundant page. Meaning the info was transferred here and the page was leave more or less to rot. It wasn't deleted. All the agents in the officer agents category had simulair pages, all of which are not in use, with the exception of Mr.2 for his major role in the Alabasta Arc. The real point though, is why when the pages for these guys were detached from this article, were they not put up for deletation? Now months after the orginal transferrment, we have someone stepping in and linking back to it.</p>
<p>Its time to sort out this issue. If the other pages exist still (I haven't checked as of writing this), we need to slap a deletation template on them before someone else does this same thing to the other agents. We also need to think on whether Mr.3's page link should go back to just being text on this page. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 22:50, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It says that through training he is always in his metal form. But since in the Devil Fruit section it is listed as a Paramecia, could he just be like Luffy and Buggy whose bodies are always using their power, such as Luffy always being rubber and Buggy being able to be cut? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.120.99.10_67eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.120.99.10">71.120.99.10</a> (talk) 01:48, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Why are we merging the characters into this page? It looks like that page had info that this page doesn't, and this page is pretty big and unwieldly as it is. Shouldn't we have small descriptions on this page and link to seperate pages for the member who can support a normal size page? - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 04:11, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We don't need more pages for One Piece, seriously, the amout needs to be kept to a minium as much as possible. Okay I'm for a short description or no external pages save Miss All-Sunday as she is a straw hat and croc is a major villian. Mr 2, 3 and others don't need pages. In fact we tried to get rid of them once but someone found the old page and linked back. I haven't looked on here for a while, save to remove references to non-english and Japanese refs. But yeah - no more One Piece pages. This is mentioned because of things to do with the "in Universe" thing Wikipedia has. It almost caused us to loose a past recently. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 07:18, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Guys, I have to state this - she is not a Devil Fruit User. It is stated in one SBS by <b>Oda</b> she uses symbols and colours as a form of hyponiting people. It is not speculated by fans, its a FACT. Can we stop added she may have eaten one, because she is confirmed she didn't. And I'm also shocked this info was removed from her profile, it was completely uness. to do so since it was confirmed. I'll add it back if I can find the SBS later. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 07:24, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
