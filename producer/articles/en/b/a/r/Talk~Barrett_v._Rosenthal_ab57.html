<p>Because this article documents a recent event, there are really no secondary sources available of high-quality to use as references. Hopefully in the coming months some will appear, probably in legal reviews, which we can use to strengthen the article. As it stands now, the article's reliance on <a href="../../../o/r/_/Wp%7Eor.html#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wp:or">primary sources</a> for a current event is not a problem, but that needs to change as time passes. The secondary sources will also allow the article to be expanded with notable evaluations of the case. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 16:09, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right. Although secondary sources would not be required here, they certainly would add to the discussion. I can't imagine there will not be more written about this case as time goes on, since it is the only case to date that interprets the meaning of "user" in the federal statute..

<dd>How about an Los Angeles Times article? Would that qualify? <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> 04:13, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but unless it includes some analysis from lawyers, it's not going to give us much to work with. Do you have the ref handy? --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 04:20, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Clarifying - what I'm looking forward to is some in-depth analysis from legal experts. Such reference will give us interpretations to include in the article. Newspaper's will never give such in-depth coverage, and they're more likely to publish a slightly modified press release or a superficial report instead. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 16:32, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suspect there will soon be quite a bit about this case, because it is the first to interpret Section 230 wrt a 'user'. Jance 09:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC) A s*load of blogs have picked it up, predictably.

<p>At issue was NOT an email sent by Bolen. At issue was a single legal point: Was Rosenthal exempt under Section 230 for liability for republication of potentially defamatory statements. To add any of the section I just deleted is POV and a terrible summary of the notability of this case. Jance 06:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The statements weren't "potentially defamatory", they were described by the court simply as "defamatory". The central question of the case was whether the defendants were liable for republication of those statements so the statments themselves are clearly the central issue. --<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Bledsoe_7efd.html" title="User:Curtis Bledsoe">Curtis Bledsoe</a> 18:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The way Curtis had written it read like all the statements were described by the court as defamatory. This is simply untrue, as a plain reading of the case will show. In fact, that is why I changed it. The one statement against Poloevy was different. This was stated in the article properly (by me). Curtis, I don't think you understand the meaning of defamation. It is not "nice" to call someone a Nazi, thug, etc etc In fact, it is downright vicious. It is not ordinarily defamation - it is hyperbole. It is an opinion. The courts went to some length to explaint this.Jance 18:56, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I have read the ruling. That's how I know that the court described the statements as defamatory but that the people who republished them weren't liable because they were not the original authors of the defamatory material. If you'll look at the bottom of "page 3" of the ruling, you'll see where the court describes Bolen's statements as "defamatory". I'm not how you can argue that calling someone a "Nazi" when they're not actually a Nazi isn't defamatory unless you want to try to argue that Bolen's work was some sort of humor or satire. Where's the humor in calling someone "professionally incompetent" or "emotionally disturbed", "thug" or "bully" when there's no evidence to support such a claim? Even in concurring with the court's decision, Justice Moreno criticized Rosenthal for falling "considerably short of the type of investigation a reasonable person would undertake before republishing potentially defamatory material". --<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Bledsoe_7efd.html" title="User:Curtis Bledsoe">Curtis Bledsoe</a> 19:55, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Peter, he still is incorrect. The court was repeating what the complaint said. This court said, and I quote, "Plaintiffs argue that Barrett, as well as Polevoy, was defamed in the Bolen article. We need not address this claim, given our conclusion that Rosenthal is immune from liability under section 230. " The state supreme court did <i>not</i> call any statement defamatory. The only statement that seemed to be questionable as to whether it was defamatory, based on lower court rulings, was the one about stalking. The court there "determined that the only actionable statement appeared in an article Rosenthal received via e-mail from her codefendant Tim Bolen. This article, subtitled “Opinion by Tim Bolen,” accused Dr. Polevoy of stalking a Canadian radio producer." And depending on whether Polevoy was deemed a (limiited)public or private figure, the standard would be either 'malice' (reckless disregard for the truth or knowledge of falisty) or negligence. This article does not state that sentence was not defamatory. The court would not call any statement defamatory (or not defamatory) if that question was not before the court. If it were dicta, it would be couched in an explanation. Here, the court was merely repeating from a complaint.Jance 18:56, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact remains that the court described the statements as defamatory and the concurring justice criticized Rosenthal for not taking reasonable precautions to validate the claims made by Bolen.

<dd>Curtis' POV is misleading. Here is the exact quote. "It also <b>may well be</b> true that Rosenthal’s investigation of Dr. Polevoy’s incident with McPhee fell considerably short of the type of investigation a reasonable person would undertake before republishing potentially defamatory material, <b>inasmuch as she did not contact the appropriate law enforcement authorities to corroborate McPhee’s story. But these facts are not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy to defame Dr. Polevoy, i.e., a preconceived plan and unity of design and purpose on the part of Rosenthal and Bolen to defame."</b></dd>
<dd>From the Opinion, (and I have been unable to get this to stay on this page), <b>"As the lower courts correctly concluded, however, none of the hostile comments against Dr. Barrett alleged in the complaint are defamatory."</b> (page 39, final words of the Opinion) <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S122953.PDF" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S122953.PDF" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Further, for the purposes of this case, it was regarding one statement <b>only</b> about Terry Polevoy and the 'stalking' comment was reposted.</dd>

<p>Unfortunately, Ilena Rosenthal continues to defame me personally on her own web sites, and she doesn't just repeat the defamatory statements of others. She claims that she earned a victory before the Supreme Court, but there is no victory when somebody continues to hide out in Costa Rica far away from any previous court judgments against her. Claims made in the original lawsuit that involved Hulda Clark and Tim Bolen may also add Ms. Rosenthal for initiating her own defamatory statements on her own web sites, and by continuing to post these remarks on Usenet over the last 6 years. We can prove that she actually did conspire to defame me personally and professionally. The original lawsuit against Tim Bolen and Hulda Clark and up to 100 other people is still before the courts and will be heard. --Drpolevoy 23:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Drpolevoy, that is not true here, in this discussion.

Again, if Rosenthal continues to post defamatory statements on her own blogs, web sites and Usenet, then she can be included in any future legal actions.

<ol>
<li>There is no source for the "Statements" section.</li>
<li>The section is now a lede which misrepresents the case. It is not correct, legally or factually. At issue is not an email Bolen sent. At issue was whether or not Section 230 provided immunity, for Rosenthal's republication of a statement made by Bolen, as against Polvenoy. This statement was an accusation that Polvenoy stalked a radio host. None of the other verbiage now in this section is correct.</li>
<li>All other statements were adjudicated by more than one court to be non-defamatory. I will add that this does not mean the statements were nice or non-inflammatory. It does mean that they were not legally defamatory. Hyperbole and opinion are never defamatory, which is evidently something not understood here.</li>
<li>The state supreme court did not address any statement as against Barrett. This case is <i>Barrett v. Rosenthal</i> and is the state supreme court case.</li>
<li>Even Barrett's attorney evidently did not evidently understand the meaning of "actual malice" in the context of defamation - although, I will point out that this is very basic to an understanding of defamation. Curtis does not understand the meaning of libel, or what was going on here. One does not have to condone inflammatory statements to understand that hyperbole is not libel. The court explained this at length. The court explained that the tone of the material is irrelevant to libel. Freedom of speech is a constitutional right for a reason.Jance 21:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I made a couple of changes to the more egregious errors. The court did not declare the statements defamatory. In fact, it was just the contrary. Most of the statements that Rosenthal republished were decleared by the court to be "hyperbole" and "opinion", therefore non-defamatory.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me the purpose of the section "Statements.."&#160;? The court's findings are stated in subsequent sections. The introductory section is the brief statement of the case.

<dd>That is the irony of free speech. If you allow one to speak freely, you must allow all the same freedom, even if you don't want to hear what they have to say. Barrett and Rosenthal are two opposite ends of the same spectrum. Either we have to hear both, or we hear neither. The world would certainly be a friendlier place with neither, but then someone else would likely just take their places. The question is, should an encyclopedia be a place where these grievances are aired.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 18:15, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel this is censorship. There are hundreds of references to Barrett being circulated throughout Wikipedia ... and I am censored from having any. I have a legal non profit corporation Humantics Foundation. (NCAHF is very probably not legal) yet they are used as 'reliable sources' and I am not allowed any links. I do not believe this is the Wiki way. I have been a reliable source for breast implant information for 11 years, recently quoted in Wired, MyDNA, WebMD, Glamour Magazine, etc. Yet here, I am outnumbered by Barrett and Polevoy's publicists. <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> 18:41, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No need for intervention. The link is gone and I have no further interest in it. If I am to face any censure, then Ilena should face even more, as she has constantly spammed Wikipedia with links to her own site, which are filled with hate speech, personal attacks, and untruths. We have deleted them and hope she will learn not to post more links to her own sites. They were vanity links -- a practice forbidden here -- and they are filled with hate speech, an unethical practice which has gotten her into trouble. All her troubles in the courts and on the internet could have been avoided if she didn't constantly attack others. If her sites were purely information about breast implant issues, then they might conceivably be useful as resources here, as long as she does't post them herself, but that is not the case. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 19:50, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that my links are anymore "vanity links" than quackwatch.com or the probably illegal operation of ncahf.org and any of millions of webpages linked to Wikipedia. I have been under attack by these losing plaintiffs for 6 years, and since the final Supreme Court of California ruling against them, their actions are een more egregious. The entire webring that Fyslee operates is filled with Barrett's attacks on scientists and physicians that they hate and try to destroy. Fyslee is profoundly inaccurate as to who I am and why I have devoted 11 years of my life to raising awareness to the dangers of breast implants and the dangers of the PR teams paid by the breast implant, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Fyslee may call it a 'smear' to be linked to Stephen Barrett, but it is a fact. For several years, he was the Assistant Listmaster for the Healthfraud List and his webring links all of Barrett's questionable sites together which promote each other. He was also a member of the now removed "Rag-tag Posse of Snake-oil Vigilantes" which provided Smear Campaigns via blogs and usenet of people Barrett and the other losing plaintiffs were suing. Fyslee and Barrett were on that list together for 6 years (up until last week.) Fyslee removed every link I have made on Wikipedia, filled my talk pages with the same nonsense he wrote above, and it feels exactly like stalking. He even interfered in my personal talk page. To Jance, I do definitely believe it was Terry Polevoy who posted under drpolevoy yesterday. He has repeated the same things on usenet and the healthfraud list and follows me wherever I post. <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> 21:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ilena, you are allowing yourself to be "triggered" by other editors with whom you have long grievances. Please leave linking your website/webpages to us, the other WP editors, to include here. You might occasionally nominate <i>a page</i> (or more) in Talk that you feel has merit, after giving it your best editorial cleanup. You do have a point about overuse of QW etc as a source at WP, they certainly are not neutral. Fyslee, the Talk page edit id corrections that you just now made were cool, fine; however the edit summary line seems overheated and not accurate. As you are an experienced editor, may I suggest that you keep trying to dampen the obvious antagonisms that exist between parties even when you hotly feel someone is backsliding. We are making progress, it is not easy.--<a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a> 01:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right ... I was hit by other members of Fyslee's team with the same attacks this morning on other medium. I know who Fyslee is and have been his target for 6 years. Here is something I am very perplexed about. I am now told that links to my legal non profit corporation are "vanity links" and not allowed, yet there are thousands of links posted by fyslee that are one click away from his whole webring and vanity sites. He is the Anti-Quackery Ring - Ringmaster and founder, all of Barrett's sites are posted there and lead back to his links and solicitations. Why is this allowed? Now I read Fyslee is deleting my posts claiming they are 'libelous.' There was no libel ... just a description of his relationship with Barrett and all over promoted sites. Anyone can look at this Wiki link and see he advertises each and every Barrett website, including the probably non legal entity NCAHF.org (since May 2003). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> (<a href="../../../i/l/e/User_talk%7EIlena_10cb.html" title="User talk:Ilena">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ilena_da18.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ilena">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

Three of your Rag-tag / Healthfraud teammates just lost their libel suits to me for making the same false claim. Your links with Barrett may rightfully shame you, but they are factual. You advertise Barrett's links throughout Wikipedia, the blog world, your webring (that attacks and labels fine doctors and scientists as quacks)They are one link away from your Vanity Links and solicitations here on Wikipedia. Everytime you post a QW site ... one click and it's a direct link to YOU. I have seen pages and pages filled with your QW links ... all linking to YOU and your attack sites.

<dd>They take turns, Shot. Both are highly opiniated and articulate. It would be a great combination, if they can breathe deeply, try to let go of the external tension and focus on writing a good article. They both have much to offer, from different perspectives. Ilena, you need to let this go, if you are going to be able to use that talent for something constructive - writing some great articles.. I am like you as I can take things personally. And with this, especially, you all have 'baggage'.
<dl>
<dd>One thing that might be helpful is to consider the wide variety of readers who will want to quickly grasp the important issue of this case, and why it merits an article. Therefore, the article does not and should not be rambling or long, or beset with extraneous facts. My 'take' on this is to first organize it is a basic (legal) 'breif' section which I did: Statement of the case, the facts (from the original complaint in the Barrett v. Clark section) and the decision below (trial and appeals court). Then the issue before the CA Supreme Court, a short summary of the opinion &amp; ruling. Then we could have a section on Controversy - probably not of the ruling itself, since it followed precedent and the plain language of the statute. Instead, the "Controversy" section should address policy &amp; Congressional intent (the case has fertile material for this). I could see two main paragraphs - each short and concise. This could be the most interesting section to a reader. IN writing this, we need to curb the inclination to soapbox and grandstand. Treat it as if you were trying to teach someone the policy issues that prompted this legislation. There really is very little, if any, here about that. And this is so debated - by explaining the ramifications of this policy and why or why not it is 'good' policy (Just no OR)- there is ample mateterial. I don't mean making things up, but using The court court case would be good reference, as well as secondary sources. We could do it without editorializing, but rather stating the statute's intent, and the policy criticism of it. In fact, this could be an ideal forum for the two people with widely divergent views to work on the content - Section 230 has important policy arguments. Briefly. Maybe Ilena could add what S230 means to individual computer users and freedom of speech - that is where your two sources could be helpful, Conversely, maybe Fyslee can raise the other viewpoint, with equally reliable sources. The Judge's discussion of 'disturbing implications' would be a good focal point.. There is a bit of this in the S 230 article, but it would be good to have something here if it is very short. That doesn't mean it will be easier to write. Condensing a policy argument (with sources and no WP:OR) will be a challenge. BUt this is where the secondary sources will come in handyJance 07:20, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both aritcles &amp; sources look ok to me - external inks, perhaps. This is a landmark case in interpreting Section 230 as to "users" ... While I don't think many legal scholars would disagree that the ruling is correct (based on the plain language of the statute), the policy enunciated by the statute is hotly debated.

<p>The section describing Mr. Bolen that just got reverted to is just more POV from Barrett's camp and Barrett's vanity webpages.

<dd>It is hard to find a publicist willing to do <i>pro bono</i> work these days... but seriously, is it necessary to quote at length from Bolen's email in the article? I realize the statements were held to be "non-defamatory opinion" for the most part, but why repeat them in all their detail, even if they're legally non-defamatory? Is it really encyclopedic, or just a chance to bash Barrett and Polevoy? Why not just say that Bolen sent an email containing a number of attacks on Barret/Polevoy, maybe specifying only the "stalking" thing since that was legally relevant? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 18:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree 100% (although I don't know whom these statements hurt). What you suggest is exactly what I did in the introduction. There is no reason to include these quotes, which are not even at issue before the supreme court, and therefore not relevant to this article, except as a case history. And I don't think that level of detail is necessary. I do not recall who added them, or why. However, Curtis argued for some time that these statements were described by the court as defamatory (which was factually incorrect.) The statements were also added at the beginning of this article on a CA Supreme Court case, which was inappropriate for obvious reasons. The only reason I did not delete them, is because I did not want Curtis again accusing me of 3RR or worse. Instead, I corrected the factually wrong edit, and moved the quotes where they better fit. I agree they should not be here. It is bad form - regardless of who looks bad as a result. Jance 19:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A bit of history might be appropriate here, IIRC (I'm tired right now, so please correct and forgive any errors!). The original Bolen statements were serious enough (and some of the false statements stated as absolute fact -- which he later admitted under deposition were just "euphemism"...) to unleash a small series of libel suits (five, with Rosenthal's case growing out of one of them) against just a few of the myiad people who republished his "opinion pieces", as he calls them. Rosenthal was just one of them, but likely because she added her own flavor (in the same conspiracy theory style as Bolen) to the matter (just as Mercola did), she was included in the Clark suit.</dd>

<dd>She got off the hook because Section 230 protects republishers of even the most vile and libelous material.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the story didn't end there. The Bolen/Clark team (the originators, not republishers) retaliated with a cross-complaint that contained a very long "laundry list" (precise language from the judgment) of very serious charges worthy of a Mafia boss, every one of them leveled against some 30 persons, websites(!), and even non-existent entities(!!!).

<dd>Initially Barrett &amp; company lost the case (and still lost it to Rosenthal), but it was appealed as regards the Bolen/Clark team. In 2005, an appeals court reversed the district court's decision, and the case was remanded for further procedings. "The scurrilous nature of the defendants' allegations of wrongdoing and their efforts to publicize them widely on the Internet, when coupled with their utter failure to offer any proof of their charges" provided sufficient reason for the case to proceed. <sup id="_ref-barrettVnegreteRemand_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-barrettVnegreteRemand" title="">[1]</a></sup> That case is now pending against the Bolen/Clark/Negrete team.</dd>

<dd>I wish I could, Fyslee. I can't tell from this decision what the motion to strike included - whether it was all the statements, or part of the statements. Unlike B v.

IMO, this is a better way to display this information. I've also noticed that part could be written more clearly:<br />
<i>"It is an appeal of Barrett v. Clark, a defamation claim brought by Stephen Barrett, Terry Polevoy, and attorney Christopher Grell against Ilena Rosenthal and several others..."</i><br />
So who are the others? I ask because later it says:<br />
<i>"The trial court dismissed the case (against Rosenthal only) under the California anti-SLAPP statute"</i><br />
Which makes you wonder, who were still defendants in <i>Clark</i> (besides presumably someone named Clark)? I think it would be helpful to list out some of the "et. al." in the first sentence and clarify the second a bit:<br />
<i>The trial court dismissed the case against Rosenthal only under the California anti-SLAPP statute, which is intended to stop lawsuits that are "brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for redress of grievances, though it allowed the case to continue against her co-defendants"</i><br />

<dd>Thank you Isotope23 for your interest in this case. I believe it is a very important one, especially for a website like Wikipedia which hosts the words of others. Previously, the threat or reality of being sued for what an editor posted, could seriously limit open discussions. Much of what is posted on the internet is the work of others. This threat being erased will invigorate discussions on controversial topics ... including breast implants and health freedom. I've been reading other articles on Wikipedia on cases covered here and both the defendants and the plaintiffs are usually given descriptions by their work. I believe Mr. Bolen should receive a first name and the name of his registered California company included. As "Rosenthal" ... I also believe my work should be identified. All traces of my websites and the fact that when I was SLAPP sued in this case, it was in relationship to my work have been expunged from the articles that mention this case. I am the head of the Humantics Foundation and a vocal breast implant awareness advocate. This was mentioned in many of the hundreds of articles on this case, but erased here.

<dd>Just to clarify my edit a little, here is my thinkning:</dd>
<dd>It's not the link to the court case that is the problem, it's the paragraph introducing the brief that is inflammatory;) It probably is not a good idea to have Ilena write her version at the top either. The sentence speaks for itself and doesn't really need a reference anyway, right.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have no problem with having Ilena's description with her name; I think it makes her sound more vulnerable actually. However, if we do that, we need to give the Barrett group a description and I didn't feel like "quackbusters" was a good one. The article is really about the precedent set forth by the case. It's really not important that it was Barrett or Rosenthal, it could have been Roe v. Wade (how many people care about what Roe did for a living?), the important part is the protection from prosecution for re-printing another person's slander. Nobody should care that it was quackwatch vs. breast implant. I am open if you think I'm missing something important.</dd>

<dd>I very respectfully disagree that this was a personal spat between Barrett and me personally. I believe the courts agreed with me too. The topic of my breast implant advocacy was fully discussed in earlier court papers. This was deemed the classic SLAPP suit which is industry vs activist. Here is my declaration under oath relevant to this question. Judge Richmond wrote a 27 page opinion granting the anti-SLAPP motion after reading this. I hope you read it too. <a href="http://humanticsfoundation.com/barrettvsrosenthal-suppdeclaration.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://humanticsfoundation.com/barrettvsrosenthal-suppdeclaration.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd>My apologies. This is the quote I was responding to, <i>Nobody should care that it was quackwatch vs. breast implant. I am open if you think I'm missing something important.</i> The fact is it was <i>quackwatch vs breast implant awareness advocate</i> By attempting to SLAPP my mouth shut with meritless lawsuits and a related smear campaign, industry would be silencing one of their very vocal critics. I was quoted in Chemical and Engineering News, Midland Times, Us Magazine, The Scientist, several TV interviews and many radio shows,(to name but a few) exposing industry influence in <i>science</i> and the unfairness of the Dow settlement. Shutting me up would have been an industry coup. Please read this article in Philantrophy about industry suing small foundation heads such as I am. This case is classic. The part that went to the Supreme Court was about one word ... the rest personified what SLAPP suits are all about ... chilling activists such as myself. <a href="http://philanthropy.com/free/articles/v12/i08/08000101.htm" class="external text" title="http://philanthropy.com/free/articles/v12/i08/08000101.htm" rel="nofollow">Legal Tactic Chills Debate, Activists Say Threat of costly court battles gives many charities goose bumps</a>.

<dd>Okay, and that is what I thought, too. In other words, this case is so important that it is about more than just quackwatch vs. breast implants. I think the implications are more in line with industry v. acivist (as you put it). It is bigger than both of you. The actual details of who you and Barrett are are certainly important, but not as important as the details that "industry can not intimidate vocal opponents by threatening them with lawsuits that would likely bankrupt and destroy them - whether they were right or wrong."</dd>
<dd>Having said that, I can see that the article could be more interesting with details about who you are, but if so, it needs to accurately state who Barrett is as well. Otherwise, it is not a balanced article. Keeping in mind that descriptions may not always be positive. Which way would you prefer it to go. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 00:19, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, Dematt. It would be interesting to have a brief description of the plaintiffs and the defendant.Jance 05:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This issue may be a little too hot right now and the we should probably keep it to verifiable and reliable facts from secondary and tertiary sources. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 14:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand. You were so right on when you made the Mediation Request that fyslee refused to participate in. It is about BvR ... and ro my experienced opinion, 9especially after reading unfactual comments made today again on the case) is that the plaintiff's are attempting to retry the case here. My comments on the Arbritration will reveal how this all fits together. Thank you and I hope your life gets better every day. <a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7EIlena_9a07.html" title="User:Ilena">Ilena</a> 14:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
