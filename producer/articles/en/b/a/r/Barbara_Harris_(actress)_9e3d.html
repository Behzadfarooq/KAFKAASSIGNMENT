<p>Harris received a nomination for the 1962 <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Award_ddaa.html" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a> for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in the original musical revue production <i>From the Second City</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>), which ran at the Royale Theater from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">September 26</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_9.html" title="December 9">December 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. The revue also featured the young <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Arkin_c6f0.html" title="Alan Arkin">Alan Arkin</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Sand_38bc.html" title="Paul Sand">Paul Sand</a>. Produced by the legendary Max Liebman (among others) and directed by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Sills_0a96.html" title="Paul Sills">Paul Sills</a>, the production presented Harris in such sketches as <i>Caesar's Wife</i>, <i>First Affair</i>, and <i>The Bergman Film" winning critical and audience acclaim.</i></p>
<p>In a rare 2002 interview in a Phoenix, Arizona newspaper, she recalled her ambivalence about even bringing the troupe to New York from Chicago. She said, "When I was at <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_City_2c36.html" title="Second City">Second City</a>, there was a vote about whether we should take our show to Broadway or not. Andrew Duncan and I voted no. I stayed in New York, but only because <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Rodgers_780c.html" title="Richard Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Jay_Lerner_30ba.html" title="Alan Jay Lerner">Alan Jay Lerner</a> came and said, "We want to write a musical for you!" Well, I wasn't big on musical theater. I had seen part of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Pacific_%28musical%29_42f1.html" title="South Pacific (musical)">South Pacific</a> in Chicago and I walked out. But it was Richard Rodgers calling!"</p>
<p>While Rodgers and Lerner were busy working on their original musical for her, she won the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre_World_Award_de48.html" title="Theatre World Award">Theatre World Award</a> for her role in playwright <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Kopit_f78e.html" title="Arthur Kopit">Arthur Kopit</a>'s dark comedic farce, <i>Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feeling So Sad</i>. Next, she received a nomination for the 1966 Tony for Best Actress in a Musical for <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_a_Clear_Day_You_Can_See_Forever_bffd.html" title="On a Clear Day You Can See Forever">On a Clear Day You Can See Forever</a></i> (1965), a Broadway musical created for her in the end by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Jay_Lerner_30ba.html" title="Alan Jay Lerner">Alan Jay Lerner</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burton_Lane_526d.html" title="Burton Lane">Burton Lane</a>, but not by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Rodgers_780c.html" title="Richard Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a>, who left the project. She starred as "Daisy Gamble", a New Yorker who seeks out the help of a psychiatrist to stop smoking. Under hypnosis, the apparently kooky, brash, and quirky character reveals unexpected hidden depths. In fact, during hypnotic trances, she becomes fascinating to the psychiatrist as she reveals herself as a woman who has lived many past lives, one of them quite tragic and melancholy. While critics were divided over the merits of the show, they praised Harris' performance. The show opened on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">October 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> at the Mark Hellinger Theater and ran for 280 performances, earning a total of three <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony.html" title="Tony">Tony</a> nominations. Harris performed numbers from the show with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cullum_7cfb.html" title="John Cullum">John Cullum</a> on <i>The Bell Telephone Hour - The Lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner</i>, broadcast on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">February 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>.</p>
<p>She next appeared on Broadway with <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Bancroft_50c9.html" title="Anne Bancroft">Anne Bancroft</a> in a 1963 production of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertolt_Brecht_1581.html" title="Bertolt Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>'s <i><a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Courage_6735.html" title="Mother Courage">Mother Courage</a></i>, staged by <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome_Robbins_0e66.html" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</a>, at the Martin Beck Theater; the production received five <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Award_ddaa.html" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a> nominations.</p>
<p>Harris gave another memorable performance in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apple_Tree_a102.html" title="The Apple Tree">The Apple Tree</a></i>, another Broadway musical created for her by composer <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Bock_bb4b.html" title="Jerry Bock">Jerry Bock</a> and lyricist <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheldon_Harnick_fe6d.html" title="Sheldon Harnick">Sheldon Harnick</a>, known best for <i><a href="../../../f/i/d/Fiddler_On_the_Roof_401a.html" title="Fiddler On the Roof">Fiddler On the Roof</a></i>. The play, in which Harris co-starred with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Alda_35e3.html" title="Alan Alda">Alan Alda</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Blyden_1933.html" title="Larry Blyden">Larry Blyden</a> was directed by Mike Nichols, opened at the <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shubert_Theater_565b.html" title="Shubert Theater">Shubert Theater</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> and closed on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">November 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. The show was based on three tales by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Twain_2795.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_R._Stockton_36ce.html" title="Frank R. Stockton">Frank R. Stockton</a>, and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Feiffer_0741.html" title="Jules Feiffer">Jules Feiffer</a> and Harris starred in all three, again receiving exceptional reviews, even if the show did not. Richard Watts Jr. of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Post_3183.html" title="New York Post">New York Post</a> wrote "[t]here are many high triumphs of the imagination in the vastly original musical comedy", he added "but it is Miss Harris who provides it with the extra touch of magic." <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Kerr_83fb.html" title="Walter Kerr">Walter Kerr</a> famously called her "the square root of noisy sex" and "sweetness carried well into infinity". Harris captured the 1967 <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony.html" title="Tony">Tony</a> for Best Actress in a Musical. Of her friend and colleague <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Nichols_323d.html" title="Mike Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>, she said in 2002, "Mike Nichols was a toughie. He could be very kind, but if you weren't first-rate, watch out. He'd let you know."</p>
<p>Just as Harris appeared poised to join the first ranks of Broadway stars, she stopped appearing on stage after <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apple_Tree_a102.html" title="The Apple Tree">The Apple Tree</a></i>. That her Broadway career was so legendary but so brief has long been considered by theater fans to be a major and baffling loss. Always a mercurial, private person, in a 2002 interview, Harris shed some light on why she stopped performing regularly on stage despite all the acclaim. She said, "Who wants to be up on the stage all the time? It isn't easy. You have to be awfully invested in the fame aspect, and I really never was. What I cared about was the discipline of acting, whether I did well or not."</p>

<p>From 1962 through 1964, she appeared as a guest star on such popular television series as <i><a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_City_%28TV_series%29_0f78.html" title="Naked City (TV series)">Naked City</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Channing.html" title="Channing">Channing</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Defenders_%28TV_series%29_559e.html" title="The Defenders (TV series)">The Defenders</a></i> and <i>The Nurses</i>.

She co-starred opposite <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Robards_984e.html" title="Jason Robards">Jason Robards</a>, who played the freewheeling, eternally optimistic guardian of his teenage nephew whom authorities feel should be taken away from him. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> critic wrote on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_9.html" title="December 9">December 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> that the movie "has the new and senational Barbara Harris playing the appropriately light-headed girl". Harris and Robards won <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Globe_486e.html" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> nominations and the film won four <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Awards_b109.html" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> nominations.</p>

Reviewing the latter film for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> on February 16, 1967, critic <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosley_Crowther_11fb.html" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> wrote, "Barbara Harris from the original play cast is as wacky as she was on the stage -- casual and direct and totally blase about the biosterous business of sex. Her tussle to accomplish her purpose, with the corpse falling out into the roam every time she is about to score a field goal, is still the funniest scene."</p>
<p>She earned an Oscar nomination for the 1971 film (which co-starred <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dustin_Hoffman_be7f.html" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>) <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Is_Harry_Kellerman_And_Why_Is_He_Saying_Those_Terrible_Things_About_Me__1c6c.html" title="Who Is Harry Kellerman And Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?">Who Is Harry Kellerman And Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?</a></i>, about a rich, successful, womanizing pop song writer suffering a debilitating but oddly liberating mental crisis.</p>

<p>In 1975, Harris appeared in one of her signature film roles in <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Altman_89d1.html" title="Robert Altman">Robert Altman</a>'s masterpiece <i><a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_%28film%29.html" title="Nashville (film)">Nashville</a></i>, playing "Albuquerque", a ditzy, scantily clad country singing hopeful who may be far more opportunistic and calculating than she would first appear. Accounts of the film's chaotic and inspired production, particularly in Jan Stuart's book <i>The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece</i>, indicate a clash between actress and director. Still, even among rich and inventive performances by <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lily_Tomlin_85ef.html" title="Lily Tomlin">Lily Tomlin</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Black_fe38.html" title="Karen Black">Karen Black</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Gibson_58e4.html" title="Henry Gibson">Henry Gibson</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/d/Ned_Beatty_40e3.html" title="Ned Beatty">Ned Beatty</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronee_Blakely_9772.html" title="Ronee Blakely">Ronee Blakely</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelley_Duvall_ac94.html" title="Shelley Duvall">Shelley Duvall</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenan_Wynn_9159.html" title="Keenan Wynn">Keenan Wynn</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Carradine_3ad6.html" title="Keith Carradine">Keith Carradine</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Baxley_a98d.html" title="Barbara Baxley">Barbara Baxley</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geraldine_Chaplin_3fde.html" title="Geraldine Chaplin">Geraldine Chaplin</a> and others, Harris' wildly eccentric performance and her singing of <i>It Don't Worry Me</i> in the devastating finale stands out. Harris earned a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Globe_486e.html" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> nomination (one of 11 for the film); as Oscar-nominated co-star <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lily_Tomlin_85ef.html" title="Lily Tomlin">Lily Tomlin</a> put it, "I was the hugest of Barbara Harris fans; I thought she was so stunning and original." Although the two were set to reunite with <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altman.html" title="Altman">Altman</a> in a sequel, that film was never made.</p>
<p>The following year, <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_0cee.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> cast her in <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Plot_43c7.html" title="Family Plot">Family Plot</a></i> as a bogus spiritualist hunting with her cab driver boyfriend for a missing heir and a family fortune. Among a cast that included <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Dern_c041.html" title="Bruce Dern">Bruce Dern</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Black_fe38.html" title="Karen Black">Karen Black</a> and WIlliam Devane, Hitchcock was particularly delighted by Harris' quirkiness, skill and intelligence. She received critical kudos for the film, which was based upon the novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rainbird_Pattern_b138.html" title="The Rainbird Pattern">The Rainbird Pattern</a></i> by <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Canning_1677.html" title="Victor Canning">Victor Canning</a> and which marked a reunion of Hitchcock with <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Lehman_97f9.html" title="Ernest Lehman">Ernest Lehman</a>, who created the original screenplay for <i><a href="../../../n/o/r/North_by_Northwest_7239.html" title="North by Northwest">North by Northwest</a></i>. In a rare interview published in a 2002 edition of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Times_090f.html" title="New Times">New Times</a> of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottsdale%2C_Arizona_bd9b.html" title="Scottsdale, Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>, she admitted, "I turned down <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_0cee.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> when he first asked me to be in one of his movies." But, finally agreeing to star in <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Plot_43c7.html" title="Family Plot">Family Plot</a>, she recalled, "Mr. Hitchcock was a wonderful man."</p>

<p>Harris continued to appear in films of the '70s and '80s including <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freaky_Friday_7271.html" title="Freaky Friday">Freaky Friday</a></i> with a young <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodie_Foster_9072.html" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a>, <i><a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie_Movie_0c03.html" title="Movie Movie">Movie Movie</a></i> for director <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Donen_7d58.html" title="Stanley Donen">Stanley Donen</a>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_North_Avenue_Irregulars_e207.html" title="The North Avenue Irregulars">The North Avenue Irregulars</a></i> with <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloris_Leachman_231d.html" title="Cloris Leachman">Cloris Leachman</a>. She co-starred in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Seduction_of_Joe_Tynan_6871.html" title="The Seduction of Joe Tynan">The Seduction of Joe Tynan</a></i> with one of her former Broadway leading men, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Alda_35e3.html" title="Alan Alda">Alan Alda</a>, in his self-directed tale of a liberal Washington Senator caught in an affair with a younger woman, played by <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meryl_Streep_159c.html" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a>. In 1981, she starred in <i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Second-Hand_Hearts_5ce4.html" title="Second-Hand Hearts">Second-Hand Hearts</a></i> for esteemed director <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Ashby_0a6e.html" title="Hal Ashby">Hal Ashby</a> as "Dinette Dusty", a recently widowed waitress and would-be singer who marries a boozy carwash worker named "Loyal", played by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Blake_8d10.html" title="Robert Blake">Robert Blake</a> to get back her children from their paternal grandparents. The film, based on a highly sought-after "road movie" screenplay by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Eastman_8d86.html" title="Charles Eastman">Charles Eastman</a>, was a disaster that tarnished the careers of all concerned. Critic <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Canby_2b13.html" title="Vincent Canby">Vincent Canby</a> in his negative <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> review on May 8, 1981 opined, "[t]he film's one bright spot is Barbara Harris, who plays Dinette as sincerely as possible under awful conditions. She looks great even when she's supposed to be tacky, and is genuinely funny as she tries to make sense out of Loyal's muddled philosophizing, which, of course, the screenplay requires her to match."</p>
<p>A combination of career frustrations, personal challenges and other issues kept Harris off the movie screen until 1986 when she played a supporting role as the mother of <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_Turner_0876.html" title="Kathleen Turner">Kathleen Turner</a> in <i><a href="../../../p/e/g/Peggy_Sue_Got_Married_a9d6.html" title="Peggy Sue Got Married">Peggy Sue Got Married</a></i> for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Ford_Coppola_16ad.html" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>. Her last films to date were the 1988 black comedy <i><a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Rotten_Scoundrels_e21a.html" title="Dirty Rotten Scoundrels">Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</a></i> starring Michael Caine and Steve Martin and <i>Grosse Point Blank</i>, in which she played <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cusack_773f.html" title="John Cusack">John Cusack</a>'s mother.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Many have tried to lure back Harris with other film, stage, and television projects, including <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bette_Midler_84ad.html" title="Bette Midler">Bette Midler</a> who called her "the greatest thing I've ever seen on stage", and tried unsuccessfully to cast her as one of the star strippers in the show-stopping <i>You Gotta Have a Gimmick</i> number in the 1993 TV version of the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Sondheim_2c11.html" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jule_Styne_fc75.html" title="Jule Styne">Jule Styne</a> musical <i><a href="../../../a/_/m/Gypsy%7E_A_Musical_Fable_25ff.html" title="Gypsy: A Musical Fable">Gypsy</a></i>.</p>
<p>Harris currently teaches and directs. Asked if she might one day be lured back to mainstream stage, film or television, Harris said in 2002, "Well, if someone handed me something fantastic for 10 million dollars, I'd work again. But I haven't worked in a long time as an actor. I don't miss it. I think the only thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And all I really wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having to go out and do a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night. It wasn't as interesting."</p>
<p>In 2005, she briefly resurfaced, guest starring as "The Queen" and "Spunky Brandburn" on the Radio Repertory Company of America audio drama, <i>Anne Manx on Amazonia</i>, which aired on <a href="../../../x/m/_/XM_Satellite_Radio_9ff5.html" title="XM Satellite Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a>.</p>
