<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnabe_Googe_83e5.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>He was born perhaps [in London] or Kent, the son of Robert Googe, recorder of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%2C_England_0b59.html" title="Lincoln, England">Lincoln</a>.</p>
<p>He studied at the strongly Reformist <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ%27s_College%2C_Cambridge_4812.html" title="Christ's College, Cambridge">Christ's College, Cambridge</a>, and was long thought to have also studied at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_College%2C_Oxford_e952.html" title="New College, Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, although this appears uncertain. He afterwards removed to Staple's Inn, where his cousin William Lovelace held the position of Reader. Around this time he started to write poetry, and found himself in an exciting creative coterie with other young writers, such as Jasper Heywood and George Turberville. Earlier authorities claim that he became a gentleman pensioner to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth</a>, in effect, a member of her bodyguard, but this has been disproved. Nonetheless, Googe did have close associations with the court, since he was related to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cecil%2C_1st_Baron_Burghley_28f6.html" title="William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley">William Cecil</a>. Googe exploited this important connection persistently in the years that followed, and Cecil extended considerable patronage towards his young protege. It may have been due to Cecil's encouragement that Googe accompanied the Elizabethan humanist scholar Sir Thomas Challoner on a diplomatic embassy to Spain in 1562. In his absence, Googe's juvenile poems were sent to the printer by a friend, Laurence Blundeston. On his return, Googe learned of Blundeston's actions and reluctantly gave his consent to their publication when he discovered that the printer had already paid for the paper for the print run and the composition was underway. The book appeared in 1563 as <i>Eglogs, Epytaphes, and Sonettes</i>. Googe's anxiety over the publication of the work was no gesture of false modesty: prior to the appearance of his book, no writer in England had ever published his own poetry under his own name. In this, Googe was an accidental pioneer.</p>
<p>There is extant a curious correspondence on the subject of his marriage with Mary Darrell, whose father, Thomas Darrell, refused Googe's suit on the ground that she was bound by a previous contract. More to the point, recent research has shown that Thomas Darrell was a recusant who harboured Jesuit priests in his manor house of Scotney, near Lamberhurst in Kent. The idea of his daughter marrying a young man without fortune, and one moreover intimately acquainted with leading English Protestants such as Cecil and Archbishop Parker, must have horrified him. When Googe found his suit discouraged by Thomas Darrell, he appealed to his powerful contacts and the marriage duly took place in 1564 or 1565. Some sense that familial harmony was restored can be gauged by the fact that Googe took his wife to live in Lamberhurst at the manor house of Chingley. In 1569 he dedicated a long allegorical poem with a moralistic marine topic, <i>The Shippe of Safegarde</i> to his sisters-in-law. By this time, Googe had served Cecil on a difficult military expedition to Ireland, where he had contracted dyssentry and nearly died. Further colonial service on Ireland awaited him in 1582 when Googe was appointed to the position of provost-marshal of the court of Connaught, and some twenty letters of his in this capacity are preserved in the Public Records Office. It is often said, on scant evidence, that Googe knew other poets in Irish service, notably Edmund Spenser.</p>
<p>Googe was an ardent <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>, and his poetry is coloured by his religious and political views. In the third "Eglog," for instance, he laments the decay of the old nobility and the rise of a new aristocracy of wealth, and he gives an indignant account of the sufferings of his co-religionists under <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary</a>. The other <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclogue.html" title="Eclogue">eclogues</a> deal with the sorrows of earthly love, leading up to a dialogue between Corydon and Cornix, in which the heavenly love is extolled. The volume includes epitaphs on <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Grimald_6d62.html" title="Nicholas Grimald">Nicholas Grimald</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bale_92cd.html" title="John Bale">John Bale</a> and on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Phaer_ff2a.html" title="Thomas Phaer">Thomas Phaer</a>, whose translation of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil.html" title="Virgil">Virgil</a> Googe is uncritical enough to prefer to the versions of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Howard%2C_Earl_of_Surrey_b902.html" title="Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey">Surrey</a> and of <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavin_Douglas_a1f9.html" title="Gavin Douglas">Gavin Douglas</a>.</p>
<p>A much more charming pastoral than any of those contained in this volume, "Phyllida was a fayer maid" (<i><a href="../../../t/o/t/Tottel%27s_Miscellany_407c.html" title="Tottel's Miscellany">Tottel's Miscellany</a></i>) has been erroneously ascribed to Barnabe Googe. He was one of the earliest English pastoral poets, and the first who was inspired by Spanish romance, being considerably indebted to the <i>Diana Enamorada</i> of <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorge_de_Montemayor_384c.html" title="Jorge de Montemayor">Montemayor</a>.</p>
<p>His other works include a translation from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcellus_Palingenius_dd14.html" title="Marcellus Palingenius">Marcellus Palingenius</a> (said to be an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anagram.html" title="Anagram">anagram</a> for <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pier_Angelo_Manzolli_b19e.html" title="Pier Angelo Manzolli">Pier Angelo Manzolli</a>) of a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satirical</a> <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> poem, <i>Zodiacus vitae</i> (Venice, 1531?), in twelve books, under the title of <i>The Zodyake of Life</i> (1560); <i>The Popish Kingdome, or reign of Antichrist</i> (1570), translated from Thomas Kirchmeyer or Naogeorgus; <i>The Spiritual Husbandrie</i> from the same author, printed with the last <i>Foure Bookes of Husbandrie</i> (1577), collected by Conradus Heresbuchius; <i>The Overthrow of the Gout</i> (1577), a translation from Christopher Ballista, [Christophe Arbaleste], and <i>The Proverbes of Lopes de Mendoza</i> (1579).</p>
<p>A persistent anecdote concerning Googe from the latter part of the twentieth century tells how a line of poetry, <i>I did but see her passing by, and yet I love her till I die</i>, was used in a speech by the Australian Prime Minister <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Menzies_62a5.html" title="Robert Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> on a tour of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1963. Whilst Menzies remained an ardent admirer of royalty, the country had become less so, and the reaction to its use is often cited by Australian republicans as marking the decline of Australian affections for the monarchy. In fact, the line is not by Googe.</p>
