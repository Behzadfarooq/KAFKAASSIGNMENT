<p>Please go color in the Azeri, Turkmen, Arab, and Qashqai areas on the Iranian languages map Persian, because I sure wont, and they all do also speak Persian. If you are not willing to do that, then remove the image showing Kurds and Gilani's as speaking a Turkic language. Here is the map: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Moderniranianlanguagesmap.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Moderniranianlanguagesmap.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 00:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is nothing to "look into" as Kurds and Gilani's do not speak Turkic langauges as their mother tongues. Either change the Iranian languages map your revert yourself on the Turkic languages page. Also, we never said that Persian architecture had the most influence on Ottoman architecture, that is something you made up in your head, we simplywanted Persian architecture to be recognized as an influence.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 01:03, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Talk sayfasını daha fazla işgal etmemek için buraya yazıyorum.</p>
<p>"Hepimiz Kürdüz" dense ne olacak? Seni, beni, Hepimiz Kürdüz demeye götürebilecek kadar can acıtıcı bir şey olması lazım bunun denmesi için. Millet kavramının oldukça yeni bir social construct olduğunu sen söylüyorsun. Sadece bu social construct yüzünden kolay kolay ülke bölünmesi olmaz, istisnası, birlikteki bireysel çıkar ve refahın, bölünmüşlükteki bireysel çıkar ve refahtan daha az olması halidir. Bugün, toplam pastadan aldıkları ve verdiklerinin bilançosu güneydoğuya güzelce anlatılıp ondan sonra (mümkün değil çünkü kimin Kürt olduğu belli değil, ama mümkün olduğunu farzedelim) referanduma gidilse kimse yerinden kıpırdamaz. İngiltere, İskoçya'nın bağımsızlık isteğine karşı tam da bunu yaptı.</p>
<p>İşin komik tarafı, ilgili nüfusların artış hızları göz önüne alınırsa, yeteri kadar beklenilir ise, Kürt nüfus bir gün çoğunluk olacak TR'de. İnşallah o zamana kadar belli bir miktar problem çözülmüş olur çünkü Kürt'lerin hoşgörü ve empati konusunda bizden çok daha geriden geldiklerini düşünüyorum. Daha az şehirli bir toplum.</p>
<p>Buradaki yazılarda, Mossad'dan CIA'ye kadar bu cinayetin sorumluları aranıyor bazen. Veya izole bir örgüt. Bizim problemimiz değil deme ihtiyacındayız. Anlaşılabilir bir tepki tabii, ama ah, empati eksikliğini de örneklemese o kadar berbat şekilde.</p>
<p>Yıllar yılı her Ermeni lafı geçtiğinde diken diken edelim ortalığı, Apo'ya hakaret olarak Ermeni dölü lafını uygun görelim, ne <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamparsum_Limonciyan_fb6e.html" title="Hamparsum Limonciyan">Baba Hamparsum</a>'dan bahsedelim, ne şarkıları halen bol bol TRT'de çalınan <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemani_Tatyos_Ekserciyan_517c.html" title="Kemani Tatyos Ekserciyan">Tatyos Efendi</a>'den, sonra da çocuğun neden Ermeni'yi vurmak ihtiyacı hissettiğini şaşırarak dinleyelim. Hep kötüyü anlatmak zorunda değildik. Ermeni=şeytan denklemini oluşturan bu toplum. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artin_Penik_6270.html" title="Artin Penik">Artin Penik</a> de başka bir sonucu idi bu denklemin. Oluşmuş denklemi kullananlar çıktı diye kızıyoruz.</p>
<p>Birileri Diyanet'in web sitesinde gayrımüslimlere rahmet dilenmeyeceğini, toprağı bol olsun denmesi gerektiğini bulmuş, Diyanet baş sayfadan tekzip yayınlıyor, biz bunu bu cinayetin akabinde yayınlamadık, eskiden beri vardı diye. Eh.. Ne deyim? Papa camide dua etti diye dünyalar bizim oldu, ama oradaki inceliği anlamadık. Müslümanları kitap ehli görmeyen bir ruhani liderin, doktrin gereği aslında yok farzetmesi gereken bir dinin mabedine girip, orayı mabed olarak gördüğünü göstererek oranın kutsalına doğru dua etmesi ince bir kabuldur. "Allah rahmet eylesin" Türkçe bir deyim. Tabii Allah'ın rahmeti müminlerin üzerine olsun kavramından kaynaklanır ve mümin olmayanlara söylenmez bu nedenle. Aş bunu, rahmet müminlerin üzerine olmasın diye de demiyor kitabın, yorumdan ibaret. Olmaz. Biz bunu şimdi demedik, bizi böyle lanse edenleri kınıyoruz. E, hiç demeseydin be kardeşim, madem demişsin, rahatsız edici olduğunun da farkındasın, bari şimdi rahmet dileyiver.</p>
<p>Toplum olarak bu kadar empati eksikliğimiz olduğunu bu olaya kadar farketmemiştim.</p>
<p>Bu, iç ve dış mihrak meselesi artık canımı sıkıyor. Niye dersen, aynaya bakma, kendi bilançonu çıkarma, kendi iç hesaplaşmanı yapma ve dolayısıyla bir şeyleri düzeltme yolunu tıkıyor. Bu, zor fakat aynı zamanda da iyileşme getirebilecek bir şey. Öbür türlüsü çok daha kolay. Irak ve İran'la komşu olmamızdan bahsediyorsun. Bölücülük virüsü mü koyuyorlar rüzgara? Barut fıçısını ben koydum, dış güçler de buna kurşun atıp patlamaya yol açtı, sorumlusu ben değilim. Koyma kardeşim barut fıçısını. Patlamaz o zaman... Başkalarının empati eksikliğini örneklemek de çözüm değil, özeleştiriden vazgeçme yolundan başka bir şey getirmiyor.</p>
<p>Lafım sana değil, "sen" hitaplarım kişisel değil. Biraz uzun oldu, kusura bakma. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a> 23:25, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Barış I thimk it's great that you have created an infobox for Turkish provinces.But it should not contain regions as they are not officially recognise.There are no official regions in Turkey.</p>
<p>I hope youget the other template wğrking soon Dear both - the regionsmay be popular with the users of google but the Turkish postal system has no recognition of them at all. Refer to them by all means but don't put them as a category above the province in a hierarchy.

<dd>If there is an etymology section and if there are more than one historic name, feel free to move them further down. People of a <i>nation founded</i> these cities, and this nation was the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a>; Ancient or Modern, its irrelevant, cause it is about the same nation.

<dd>I have no reason to disagree with u. If u want etymology sections, lets have them:). What made me say "Alors, c'est la guerre" (revert-, I mean:)...) was that u did not talk before making these changes, despite the lengthy discussions, persistent anons and permabanned users and revert-edit-wars that this issue has caused. As for <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thasos.html" title="Thasos">Thasos</a>, I moved the Turkish name in the history section. It may be close to Western Thrace, but it does not have any Turkish-speaking population; I do not know if it had in the past (many Aegean islands had remained Greek-speaking all along), but even if it did, they were not excluded from the population exchange, so... Anyway, I hope these articles will be expanded some day. Maybe the little revert-war that we got involved in, had a positive effect: pushing editors to be interested in them:). As for the Ottoman Turkish name, it must be provided, since this was the name used and written by the then rules and the then Turkish inhabitants. Also, if we are about to use the name in another language only when there exists population speaking that, then <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandroupoli.html" title="Alexandroupoli">Alexandroupoli</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/e/Orestiada.html" title="Orestiada">Orestiada</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/d/Didymoteicho.html" title="Didymoteicho">Didymoteicho</a> should not have the Turkish name; despite their proximity to Turkey, they do not have Muslim, Turkish or Turskish-speaking population.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">thanks</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your greeting message on my Ip and my account (I seldom use this account, I'm very active on the french WP). I want to make things clear with you. If I'm trying to push for the deletion of this article about this turkish writer, it's only because it looks like a huge autopromo (he has as many interwikis as <a href="../../../o/r/h/Orhan_Pamuk_7deb.html" title="Orhan Pamuk">Orhan Pamuk</a>, and all created in a few months using usernames "appropriated" for the country, like Ademusset in France, Gheorgehagi in Romanian...). He also added his name at the date of birth, the year of birth <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, not only on en and fr WP but on all the 31 WP. It's been for him a 2 month work, and if you check the turkish article it looks like his contibution under his own name was also disputed when he created the article on late october. If I'm doing that, it's only to prevent WP from becoming a free add campaign for people like him, that had possibly 20 google hits before and now end up with hundreds for some commercial reason (may be he's trying to find an editor abroad? I do not know and I do not care).</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have really nothing against Turkey in general (and by far). I've been 4 times and in many places of this wonderful country, really one of my favorite. And I've seen the here you've been doing massive contributions that I intend to read.</p>
<p>Hope now that you understand better my point. See you. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClem23_8347.html" title="User:Clem23">Clem23</a> 12:37, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I am a newbie (just started yesterday) so I need some time to get efficient.</p>

<p>Thank you for the friendly message, it is indeed appreciated. I have been quite busy in "real life" recently (moved and changed job), so I haven't been so active here as usual.

<p>On the WikiProject Countries talk page, you had either explictly declared a general interest in the project, or had participated at a discussion that appears related to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Countries_c1c1.html#Location_Maps_for_European_countries" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries">Location Maps for European countries</a>.<br />
New maps had been created by David Liuzzo, and are available for the countries of the <i>European continent</i>, and for countries of the <i>European Union</i> exist in two versions. From <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> till <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">January 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, a poll had tried to find a consensus for usage of 'old' or of which and where 'new' version maps. At its closing, 25 people had spoken in favor of either of the two presented usages of new versions but neither version had reached a consensus (12 and 13), and 18 had preferred old maps.<br />
As this outcome cannot justify reverting of new maps that had become used for some countries, seconds before <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> a survey started that will be closed at <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:59:59. It should establish whether the new style maps may be applied as soon as some might become available for countries outside the European continent (or such to depend on future discussions), and also which new version should be applied for which countries.<br />
Please note that since <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> all new maps became updated by David Liuzzo (including a world locator, enlarged cut-out for small countries) and as of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> the restricted licence that had jeopardized their availability on Wikimedia Commons, became more free. The subsections on the talk page that had shown David Liuzzo's original maps, now show his most recent design.<br />

So even if we went ahead and arbitration gave a decision against the current title Greek editors would continue to revert it. So no advance there. Elsewhere pov-title added to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Cypriot_reunification_referendum_f403.html" title="2004 Cypriot reunification referendum">2004 Cypriot reunification referendum</a> because Greek editors dont like the idea of GC's rejecting reunification, aristovolous making his usual pov edits across TRNC related articles, and massive "History of Iran" templates are being added across Turkic related articles e.g. <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seljuq_dynasty.html" title="Seljuq dynasty">Seljuq dynasty</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timurid_Dynasty_37f6.html" title="Timurid Dynasty">Timurid Dynasty</a>. I activated my email function a week or so ago btw. Thanks, --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 22:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Template</span></h2>
<p>I did not <i>attack</i> anyone. The user removed one template while leaving the other one, claiming taht it was against the "Turkishness of the article". This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>And I have explained it 4 or 5 times today: the current template is under contruction, and there is consensus among us to split the template:</p>
<ul>
<li>one single template about the pre-modern history of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Iran_9eef.html" title="Greater Iran">Greater Iran</a>, from pre-history up to the <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afsharid_dynasty.html" title="Afsharid dynasty">Afsharid dynasty</a> ... and</li>
<li>... for the modern history o fthe region seperated templates for the different nation-states that emerged on the soil of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Iran_9eef.html" title="Greater Iran">Greater Iran</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And as you can see on the talk oage, there is also a consensus to re-name the template to "History of the Iranian Cultural Continent" which is deffinitly a more neutral name.</p>
<p>So please stop removing the template until the issue is solved.</p>

<dd>Removed the non-sense and uneducated racist "comeback" line that was added 30mins later. It is not called a comeback line because you go and come back again you know&#160;:) You just can't help making those comments, can you? lol.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 01:55, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Depends on who I am talking to ... educated people will receive an educated answer ... others get the answer they deserve. BTW: I did not know that you are a lawyer.

<dd>BTW: it is NOT racist to post a link to an article published by <a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Spiegel_f0dc.html" title="Der Spiegel">SPIEGEL Online</a> (so watch <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>!)!

<dd>So, we are clear on what a comeback is? good&#160;:)) The problem is not the link: Speigel doesn't say "the Turkish problem continues, both in Wiki and other places" - that is a racist and uneducated comment (coming from the interpretation of the person that posted it and not from Spiegel, right?). If Speigel had said the same thing, I would still call it for what it is in any case.</dd>

<dd>I am confused however. It just came to my mind that maybe sometimes what you actually say and what you want to say doesn't correspond and as such you are either misunderstood or offend people. Try to weigh your words more carefully, you will find that it will be easier to communicate your thoughts to others. Of course if one's intention is to slug it out in the virtual world with random people just for kicks that's a different matter I suppose. I mean, what level of academic dialogue can there be at 4am anyways honestly? So that's why I didn't mind your post with the link. If you wanted to make a point however, the correct and civilized way of posting the link, even if one was trying to annoy someone, would have been "why don't you check this out then [ ]?". Or some dry British humor would have done the trick too&#160;:) Wit+sarcasm is more effective than just sarcasm. I am sorry that you feel that way about my contributions, but I don't think that you follow them closely so it's ok. So what is the primary reason that every single time I post a note to your talk page that I get a sarcastic remark somewhere in the reply? Puzzling... <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 03:50, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Baris, just a quick note, I'd suggest you should leave Tajik's talk page alone. It's generally not considerered good style to edit war over other people's talkpages, and especially since he's blocked - even if you're right about what you write there, it's just that impression we should avoid of "kicking them while they're down", you know.

<p>Hi! I need your help. There is an article named <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atat%C3%BCrk%27s_reforms.html" title="Atatürk's reforms">Atatürk's reforms</a>. I believe it is a good place to develop the significance of (ideological/political/achievements) these reforms. I begin to edit a little. When I first saw it looked like a list. The help that I want is this: Sometime in the history, <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atat%C3%BCrk.html" title="Atatürk">Atatürk</a> page developed a content that extends beyond his time (even a PKK link exists). Obviously content become to abstract and moved beyond anything that a <b>Biography</b> page should have. I believe If I move all these abstract discussions, somebody will come and revert. I have an intention of keeping the title Reforms, but giving a main page link and only explaining what he intented and what happened in his time. If you can help me explaining to the people, "The <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atat%C3%BCrk%27s_reforms.html" title="Atatürk's reforms">Atatürk's reforms</a> page should be the correct location for analysis", and only historical info related to Atatürk should be in the page. --<a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">OttomanReference</a> 23:44, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why are you supporting pan-turks and racists? you know better why i removed it, i will not subside with nationalists adding stuff, the article is well written until that anon came so are you a supporter of adils bunch also? or are you possibly a liberal turk?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disruption?</span></h2>
<p>How is that disruption? The talk on the talk page clearly had reached no consensus, and you have no basis to argue that the english name for this animal is 'van kedisi'. You know this is simply not true. I don't care for how long it has been a redirect, this was a simple move that needed to be done. Also, why can't you discuss on talk pages instead of systematically reverting? <a href="../../../s/o/a/User%7ESoapyyy_0ab1.html" title="User:Soapyyy">Soapyyy</a> 07:14, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Name_issue" id="Name_issue"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name issue</span></h2>
<p>I don't see why you would think it doesn't make sense, since this is a city whose population is Kurdish. As I said, both names are right to each other, aren't they? Anyways, I think efforts would be put to a better use than on something so little as this, but little things matter also, I am just curious as to what your reasoning is in saying that it doesn't make sense putting the Kurdish name first. This animal is a great pride for Kurds, just as I imagine it is one for Turks. <a href="../../../s/o/a/User%7ESoapyyy_0ab1.html" title="User:Soapyyy">Soapyyy</a> 07:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a side note, I definitely don't see what your rationale would be for putting the Kurdish name <i>after</i> the Armenian one. In any case, I will leave it on the talk page about the move. We will see in a few days' time. As for the name issue, I would really like it if we found a consensus that leaves everybody satisfied. <a href="../../../s/o/a/User%7ESoapyyy_0ab1.html" title="User:Soapyyy">Soapyyy</a> 07:30, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Van_cat" id="Van_cat"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Van cat</span></h2>
<p>The population of Wan before the Armenian genocide was 50% Kurdish and 50% Armenian. However, this is irrelevant because today, it is almost 100% Kurdish. I didn't say we shouldn't put the Armenian name, I just said the Kurdish name should logically fall before it. As for the fact that naming the page Van cat will create confusion - how? I mean an english-speaking person who looks for information on this cat here will probably never type 'Van kedisi', because they would have to know turkish to type this. So that creates even more confusion. And there is a disambiguation sentence at the top of the page.</p>
