<p>I am curious about this as I have read many books and articles that have documented (sometimes with legal papers) that she is abusive to her employees and that Peters (her husband) once assulted a Chef because Steisand's Birthday Cake had icing Barbara did not like.

<dd>Disagree, as it shows her enormous influence beyond into a deep imprint on popular culture, whether positive, negative, supportive, or jealous. Even other supposedly iconic stars or singers, even first-name megastars who have forayed into acting, don't have this kind of impact. Thus I'd recommend a <b>Pop Culture</b> section, but perhaps hold off on it to include both positive and negative, so that it doesn't come off like a token spiteful stab by unprofessional editors. Until that time, South Park is 11th on the "what links here" (for experienced users of WP)).<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 08:22, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about the Cawfee Tawk skits in <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a>, where the <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Myers_%28actor%29_b9a1.html" title="Mike Myers (actor)">Mike Myers</a>/Linda Richman character is also referencing her? (And in one skit, she actually showed up as a surprise SNL guest.) Also, the movie <a href="../../../w/a/i/Waiting_for_Guffman_4184.html" title="Waiting for Guffman">Waiting for Guffman</a> has a line where one of the characters, praising Corky, says "he can sing AND direct AND produce...and the only other person who can do all that...is Barbra Streisand." 64.132.218.10 22:25, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The SNL skit is noteworthy in that it involves a personal appearance, and it was a recurring skit. References to her in dialog of a movie seems less noteworthy but certainly can be referenced in a pop culture section. As to the South Park episode, it definitely should be mentioned, but no more than other pop culture references. Streisand is not loved universally and her criticisms should be noted. Also, aside from the Godzilla reference in South Park, they also used her face as "Spooky Vision" in one of their Halloween episodes, which emphasizes the Streisand/South Park connection. Now if Streisand were as big as the Catholic church, I could see it being less than noteworthy, but there are hundreds of articles on Catholocism, and I am sure one or more of them reference the South Park view on Catholics, but unless there is a separate article like Barbara Streisand and popular culture, this information should be here. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 17:58, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yentl wasn't nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (although Streisand wanted it to be). Prince of Tides was the movie where she was nominated for producing the best picture but was not nominated as director. 02:12, 22 July 2005 Syd Henderson</p>

<dd>For one thing, there's no mention of Streisand in popular culture. She is a frequent subject of parody, but this remains unmentioned in the article. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 20:48, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Don't think that has to do with neutrality, but with the fact that this is not part of her own work / biography. This page should be about the person who's name is on top of the page, not how others approach him/her. Also, the idiotic way in which this article has been vandalised recently with utter non-sense has probably caused the opposite radical clean-up effect within Streisand supporters... --<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadworks_dc2d.html" title="User:Nadworks">natz</a> 08:21, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. Talking about her being "snubbed" for Oscars is POV. You either are nominated or you aren't. Talk of "snubbing" is subjective.

<p>I am very livid that someone removed the additions I made to her music bio last night. I didn't make anything up, I fleshed it out a bit. I added in FACTS (not rumors) about parts of Streisand's 70's and 80's output, only to find it removed in the morning and not only that, get a nasty message calling me a vandal?</p>
<p>Why am I a vandal for recognizing "Putting It Together: The Making of The Broadway Album" a TV special, which it was?</p>
<p>Why am I a vandal for pointing out that she had top 10 dance hits with "Shake Me Wake Me" and "Night Of My Life"? If you don't believe me, check it out yourself.</p>
<p>Why am I a vandal for going into a little detail about a few of her albums, such as "Guilty", "Lazy Afternoon" and "Memories"?</p>
<p>Why am I a vandal for talking about her failed attempt at MTV pop stardom with "Emotion"?</p>
<p>I spent about an hour fleshing some of the stuff out last night only to rudely find everything I put down. I am very offended and ticked off because I didn't do a freaking thing wrong.</p>
<p>To me, the vandals are the people who deleted my work just to be jerks. I am a Streisand fan and it ticks me off that my work gets deleted (umm... you don't get the time back?) because I thought the "Music Bio" on her was lacking and wanted to add more.</p>
<p>Hello. I haven't seen your contributions, so I can't weigh in on either side. I'm just writing to comment on how poorly this article is written and organized. It is a shame to Wikipedia. I'm not a rabid Streisand fan, nor one of her equally rabid critics, but this article is terrible: 1. Skeletal in size and scope. Absurd that a singer and actress of this importance (whether you like her, hate her, or are just <i>interested in reading an encyclopedia article about her</i>) is treated so cursorily. Check <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ella_Fitzgerald_7216.html" title="Ella Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a>; the differences are appalling. That is to say: This article should have, at a minimum: (1) A detailed history of her career, films, TV appearances, and most importantly, recordings, with appropriate links; (2) a brief summary of her personal life; (3) a brief summary of her effect and place in contemporary culture, and (4) some comments on miscellaneous and anecdotal nature. Someone, please, re-do this article in an unbiased way, free from POV or outrageous statements either pro or con. If you don't, I will take my life in my hands and be compelled to try. 66.108.4.183 16:43, 13 July 2006 (UTC) Allen Roth</p>

<p>Barbra or Barbara? This article seems to switch back and forth with no consistency.

<p>I'm kind of new, but I saw what I think you call "weasel words" in a couple places. One is under Film Career, specifically the part "snubbed for Best Director".</p>
<p>"There was controversy when Yentl received five Academy Award nominations but none for the major categories of Best Picture, Actress, or Director [3]. There was more controversy when Prince of Tides received even more nominations, including Best Picture, but Streisand was snubbed for Best Director."</p>
<p>Another one under 2006: The Return, specifically the use of "unfortunately" seems not very neutral:</p>
<p>"In early October, after a skit that made fun of President George W. Bush, and a man yelling taunts at her, she said, "Shut the fuck up if you can't take a joke." Unfortunately some present heard it differently, and say the man was yelling words of support which Ms. Streisand misheard or misinterpreted as heckling."</p>
<p>And also under Personal Life, specifically the use of "temerity" seems not neutral:</p>
<p>"On October 10 2006, she swore at a fan who had the temerity to ask her to perform rathar than spout Bush hate speech."</p>

<p>Do we mention the religious background of everyone? When I saw the Biography of Henry Winkler, they mentioned he was Jewish about four or five times. Is there something extra special about being Jewish that makes it necessary? I saw many episodes of Biography that never mentioned the person’s religion. 205.147.247.50 22:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)205.147.247.50 22:06, 1 November 2006 (UTC)Keltik31 22:55, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't really care one way or the other too much, personally I'd put it back in. But I just want to put up for consideration the religious / ethnic haziness that exists with the special case of "Jewish." While one doesn't always mention someone's religion, we would be more likely to reference their ethnicity. The fact that Barbra Streisand is Jewish is well known, frequently noted, and reflected in her professional history. It's not like we are saying "John Smith, who by the way is a big JEW, ..." <b>If there was a list of "famous jewish performers" who would be at the top?</b> <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadena_682c.html" title="User:Sadena">Sadena</a> 23:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Her religion is Important as much as Guandi's religion was important. her religion influenced her life and actions for example: Barbra Streisand's first Broadway role was in the "Diary of Anne Frank" That was important.

<p>I agree totally with Jackaranga's comment, although some of the groups aren't little-known. As it stands, the section is totally unbalanced, with more time devoted to relatively trivial attacks than to Streisand's own views. I have tried to tone down the attack part frequently, but someone(s) keeps inserting them.
