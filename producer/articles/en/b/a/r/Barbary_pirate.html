<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbary_pirate.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Although piracy had existed in the region throughout the decline of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/g/Migration_Period_e626.html" title="Migration Period">barbarian invasions</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html" title="Caliphate">Muslim conquest</a> and the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, piracy became particularly flagrant in the 14th century when the local Berber dynasties were in decadence. The town of <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/j/B%C3%A9ja%C3%AFa.html" title="Béjaïa">Bougie</a> was then the most notorious pirate base.</p>
<p>The organized powers which became known as the Barbary pirates arose in the 16th century, became most powerful in the 17th, declined gradually throughout the 18th and were extinguished about 1830, when the French conquered Algiers.</p>
<p>Several events influenced the growth of the pirates. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Granada_3106.html" title="Battle of Granada">conquest</a> of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granada.html" title="Granada">Granada</a> by the Catholic sovereigns of Spain in 1492 drove many <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moors.html" title="Moors">Moors</a> into exile. They revenged themselves by piratical attacks on the Spanish coast. They had the help of Moslem adventurers from the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levant.html" title="Levant">Levant</a>, of whom the most successful were Hızır and Oruç, natives of <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitylene.html" title="Mitylene">Mitylene</a>. Spain in self-defense began to conquer the coast towns of Oran, Algiers and Tunis. Oruç having fallen in battle with the Spaniards in 1518, his brother Hızır appealed to <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selim.html" title="Selim">Selim</a>, the Sultan of Turkey, who sent his troops. He drove the Spaniards in 1529 from the rocky island in front of Algiers, where they had a fort, and was the founder of the Turkish power. From about 1518 till the death of Uluch Ali in 1587 Algiers was the main seat of government of the <a href="../../../b/e/y/Beylerbey.html" title="Beylerbey">beylerbeys</a> of northern Africa, who ruled over Tripoli, Tunisia and Algeria. From 1587 till 1659, they were ruled by Turkish pashas, sent from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> to govern for three years; but in the latter year a military revolt in Algiers reduced the pashas to nonentities. From 1659 onwards, these African cities, although nominally forming part of the Turkish empire, were in fact anarchical military republics which chose their own rulers and lived by plunder.</p>
<p>During the first period (1518-1587) the beylerbeys were admirals of the sultan, commanding great fleets and conducting serious operations of war for political ends. They were slave-hunters and their methods were ferocious, but their Christian enemies were neither more humane nor more chivalrous. After 1587, plunder became the sole object of their successors—plunder of the native tribes on land and of all who went upon the sea. The maritime side of this long-lived brigandage was conducted by the captains, or <i>reises</i>, who formed a class or even a corporation. Cruisers were fitted out by capitalists and commanded by the <i>reises</i>. Ten per cent of the value of the prizes was paid to the treasury of the pasha or his successors, who bore the titles of Agha or Dey or Bey.<sup id="_ref-EB1911_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1911" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Bougie was the chief shipbuilding port and the timber was mainly drawn from the country behind it. Until the 17th century the pirates used <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galley.html" title="Galley">galleys</a>, but a Dutch renegade of the name of Simon de Danser taught them the advantage of using sailing ships. In this century, indeed, the main strength of the pirates was supplied by renegades from all parts of Europe. An English gentleman of the distinguished Buckingamshire family of Verney was for a time among them at Algiers. This port was so much the more formidable that the name of Algerine came to be used as synonymous with Barbary pirate, but the same trade was carried on, though with less energy, from Tripoli and Tunis—as also from towns in the empire of Morocco, of which the most notorious was <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sal%C3%A9.html" title="Salé">Salé</a>. The introduction of sailing ships gave increased scope to the activity of the pirates. While the galleys, being unfit for the high seas, were confined to the Mediterranean and the coast, the sailing vessels ranged into the Atlantic as far as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canary_Islands_dc3b.html" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islands</a> or even to Iceland.<sup id="_ref-EB1911_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1911" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbary_pirate.html" title="Edit section: Era of the pirates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Era of the pirates</span></h2>
<p>The first half of the 17th century may be described as the flowering time of the Barbary pirates. More than 20,000 captives were said to be imprisoned in Algiers alone. The rich were allowed to redeem themselves, but the poor were condemned to slavery. Their masters would not in many cases allow them to secure freedom by professing Islam. A long list might be given of people of good social position, not only Italians or Spaniards, but German or English travellers in the south, who were captives for a time.<sup id="_ref-EB1911_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1911" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/2/1627.html" title="1627">1627</a> Flemish renegade <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murat_Reis_ec0d.html" title="Murat Reis">Murat Reis the Younger</a> (known as Morat Reis in the West) sailed from Algiers with a force of 15 Ottoman galleys and raided the Atlantic coasts of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, capturing the island of <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lundy.html" title="Lundy">Lundy</a> on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Channel_127c.html" title="Bristol Channel">Bristol Channel</a> and turning it into his base for operations in the area.

</div>
</div>
<p>In <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> Murat Reis is said to have taken 400 prisoners, later raided the nearby island of <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vestmannaeyjar.html" title="Vestmannaeyjar">Vestmannaeyjar</a>. Among those captured in Vestmannaeyjar was Oluf Eigilsson, who was released with a ransom the next year and, upon returning back to Iceland, wrote a detailed book in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1628.html" title="1628">1628</a> about his experience. In June <a href="../../../1/6/3/1631.html" title="1631">1631</a> Murat Reis, with pirates from <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algiers.html" title="Algiers">Algiers</a> and armed troops of the Turkish <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, stormed ashore at the little harbour village of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_County_Cork_efdd.html" title="Baltimore, County Cork">Baltimore, County Cork</a>. They captured almost all the villagers and bore them away to a life of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> in North Africa.<sup id="_ref-EB1911_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1911" title="">[1]</a></sup> The prisoners were destined for a variety of fates -- some would live out their days chained to the oars as galley slaves, while others would spend long years in the scented seclusion of the harem or within the walls of the Sultan's palace. The old city of <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algiers.html" title="Algiers">Algiers</a>, with its narrow streets, intense heat and lively trade, was a melting pot where the villagers would join slaves and freemen of many nationalities. Only two of them ever saw <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> again. A detailed account of the Sack of Baltimore, County Cork can be found in the book, The Stolen Village Baltimore and the Barbary Pirates by Des Ekin.</p>
<p>Although Barbary pirate attacks were more common in south and east <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balearic_Islands_424a.html" title="Balearic Islands">Balearic Islands</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sardinia.html" title="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corsica.html" title="Corsica">Corsica</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elba.html" title="Elba">Elba</a>, the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Peninsula_3cde.html" title="Italian Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a> (especially the coasts of <a href="../../../l/i/g/Liguria.html" title="Liguria">Liguria</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/s/Toscana.html" title="Toscana">Toscana</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazio.html" title="Lazio">Lazio</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campania.html" title="Campania">Campania</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calabria.html" title="Calabria">Calabria</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/g/Puglia.html" title="Puglia">Puglia</a>), <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a>, they also attacked the Atlantic northwest coast of the <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_Peninsula_03ea.html" title="Iberian Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>. In <a href="../../../1/6/1/1617.html" title="1617">1617</a>, the African corsairs launched their major attack in the region when they destroyed and sacked Bouzas, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cangas.html" title="Cangas">Cangas</a> and the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">churches</a> of <a href="../../../m/o/a/Moa%C3%B1a.html" title="Moaña">Moaña</a> and Darbo. Another attempt on <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigo.html" title="Vigo">Vigo</a> was defeated by the city's garrison.</p>
<p>The chief sufferers were the inhabitants of the coasts of Sicily, Naples and Spain. But all traders belonging to nations which did not pay blackmail in order to secure immunity were liable to be taken at sea. The payment of blackmail, disguised as presents or ransoms, did not always secure safety. The most powerful states in Europe condescended to make payments to them and to tolerate their insults. Religious orders—the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_of_the_Most_Holy_Redeemer_5e07.html" title="Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer">Redemptionists</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazarists.html" title="Lazarists">Lazarists</a> — were engaged in working for the redemption of captives and large legacies were left for that purpose in many countries. The continued existence of this African piracy was indeed a disgrace to Europe, for it was due to the jealousies of the powers themselves. France encouraged them during their rivalry with Spain; and when she had no further need of them they were supported against her by Great Britain and Holland. In the 18th century British public men were not ashamed to say that barbary piracy was a useful check on the competition of the weaker Mediterranean nations in the carrying trade. When <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Pellew%2C_1st_Viscount_Exmouth_a952.html" title="Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth">Lord Exmouth</a> sailed to coerce Algiers in 1816, he expressed doubts in a private letter whether the suppresion of piracy would be acceptable to the trading community. Every power was, indeed, desirous to secure immunity for itself and more or less ready to compel Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, Salli and the next to respect its trade and subjects. In 1655 the British admiral, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Blake_%28admiral%29_dc31.html" title="Robert Blake (admiral)">Robert Blake</a>, was sent to teach them a lesson, and he gave the Tunisians a severe beating. A long series of expeditions was undertaken by the British fleet during the reign of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a>, sometimes singled-handed, sometimes in combination with the Dutch. In 1682 and 1683, the French bombarded Algiers. On the second occasion the Algerines blew the French consul from a gun during the action. An extensive list of such punitive expeditions could be made out, down to the American operations of 1801-5 and 1815. But in no case was the attack pushed home, and it rarely happened that the aggrieved European state refused in the end to make a money payment in order to secure peace. The frequent wars among them gave the pirates numerous opportunities of breaking their engagements, of which they never failed to take advantage.<sup id="_ref-EB1911_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1911" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some of them were <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renegade.html" title="Renegade">renegades</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morisco.html" title="Morisco">Moriscos</a>. Their usual ship was the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galley.html" title="Galley">galley</a> with slaves or prisoners at the oars. Two examples of these renegades are Süleyman Reis "De Veenboer" who became admiral of the Algerian corsair fleet in 1617, and his quartermaster Murat Reis, born Jan Janszoon van Haarlem. Both worked for the notorious corsair Simon the Dancer, who owned a palace. These pirates were all originally <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>.

<p>In 1783 the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> made peace with and was recognized by Britain, and in 1784 the first American ship was captured by pirates from Morocco. The stars and stripes was a new flag to them. After six months of negotiation, a treaty was signed, $60,000 cash was paid, and trade began. Morocco was the first independent nation to recognize the USA back in 1778.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>But Algeria was different. In 1784 two ships (the Maria of Boston and the Dauphine of Philadelphia) were captured, everything sold and their crews enslaved to build port fortifications. Christian slaves were preferred and forced to do degrading work and treated harshly so letters would be written home to prompt the payment of a bigger ransom.</p>
<p>In 1786, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, then the ambassador to France, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Adams_7525.html" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>, then the ambassador to Britain, met in London with Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja, the ambassador to Britain from Tripoli. The Americans asked Adja why his government was hostile to American ships, even though there had been no provocation. The ambassador's response was reported to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Congress_9db6.html" title="Continental Congress">Continental Congress</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>That it was founded on the Laws of their Prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners, and that every Musselman [Muslim] who should be slain in Battle was sure to go to Paradise.</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>American ships sailing in the Mediterranean chose to travel close to larger convoys of other European powers who had bribed the pirates. In the early 1800s, President Thomas Jefferson proposed a league of smaller nations to patrol the area, but the USA could not contribute. For the prisoners, Algeria wanted 60,000 dollars, America offered $4,000. Jefferson said a million dollars would buy them off, but Congress would only appropriate $80,000. For eleven years Americans who lived in Algeria lived as slaves to Algerian Moors.</p>
<p>For a while, Portugal was patrolling the Straits of Gibraltar and preventing Barbary Pirates from entering the Atlantic. But they made a cash deal with the pirates, and they were again sailing into the Atlantic and engaging in piracy. By late 1793, a dozen American ships had been captured, goods stripped and everyone enslaved.</p>
<p>Portugal had offered some armed patrols, but American merchants needed an armed American presence to sail near Europe. After some serious debate, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> was born in March 1794. Six frigates were authorized, and so began the construction of the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_United_States_%281797%29_e1fe.html" title="USS United States (1797)"><i>United States</i></a>, the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Constellation_%281797%29_7547.html" title="USS Constellation (1797)"><i>Constellation</i></a>, the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Constitution_26ac.html" title="USS Constitution"><i>Constitution</i></a> and three other frigates.</p>
<p>This new military presence helped to stiffen American resolve to resist the continuation of tribute payments, leading to the two Barbary Wars along the North African coast, the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Barbary_War_4afb.html" title="First Barbary War">First Barbary War</a> from <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/0/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Barbary_War_a6db.html" title="Second Barbary War">Second Barbary War</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1815.html" title="1815">1815</a>. It was not until <a href="../../../1/8/1/1815.html" title="1815">1815</a> that naval victories ended tribute payments by the U.S., although some European nations continued annual payments until the <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830s.html" title="1830s">1830s</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marine_Corps_e7db.html" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> actions in these wars led to the line, "to the shores of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripoli.html" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>" in the opening of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Hymn_87ca.html" title="Marine Hymn">Marine Hymn</a>. Also, in order to reduce the likelihood of being beheaded while boarding enemy ships, Marines wore leather collars. This led to the nickname <i>Leatherneck</i> for U.S. Marines.</p>

<p>After the general pacification of 1815, the suppresion of African piracy was universally felt to be a necessity. The insolence of Tunisian squadron which sacked <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palma.html" title="Palma">Palma</a> in the island of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sardinia.html" title="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> and carried off 158 of its inhabitants, roused widespread indignation. Other influences were at work to bring about their extinction. The United Kingdom had acquired <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> and the <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionian_Islands_d3d4.html" title="Ionian Islands">Ionian Islands</a> and now had many Mediterranean subjects. She was also engaged in pressing the other European powers to join with her in the suppresion of the slave trade which the Barbary states practised on a large scale and at the expense of Europe. The suppression of the trade was one of the objects of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Vienna_2e3d.html" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>. The United Kingdom was called on to act for Europe, and in 1816 <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Pellew%2C_1st_Viscount_Exmouth_a952.html" title="Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth">Lord Exmouth</a> was sent to obtain treaties from Tunis and Algiers. His first visit produced diplomatic documents and promises and he sailed for England. While he was negotiating, a number of British subjects had been brutally ill-treated at <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annaba.html" title="Annaba">Bona</a>, without his knowledge. The British government sent him back to secure reparation, and on the 17th of August, in combination with a Dutch squadron under Admiral Van de Capellen, he administered a smashing <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombardment_of_Algiers_e188.html" title="Bombardment of Algiers">bombardment to Algiers</a>. The lesson terrified the pirates both of that city and of Tunis into giving up over 3,000 prisoners and making fresh promises. Within a short time, however, Algiers renewed its piracies and slave-taking, though on a smaller scale, and the measures to be taken with it were discussed at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Aix-la-Chapelle_%281818%29_1370.html" title="Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)">Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle</a> in 1818. In 1824 another British fleet under Admiral Sir Hally Neal had again to bombard Algiers. The great pirate city was not in fact thoroughly tamed till its conquest by France in 1830.<sup id="_ref-EB1911_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EB1911" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
