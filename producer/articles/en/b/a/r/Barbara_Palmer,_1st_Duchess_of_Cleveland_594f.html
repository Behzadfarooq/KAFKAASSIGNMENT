<p>She was born <b>Barbara Villiers</b>, the only child of William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison (making her a cousin of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Villiers%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Buckingham_e7e0.html" title="George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham">George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham</a>), and the heiress Mary Bayning.

<p>Villiers was considered at the time to be one of the most beautiful Royalist women, but her lack of fortune left her with reduced marriage prospects. Her first serious romance was with <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Stanhope%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Chesterfield_9d95.html" title="Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield">Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield</a>, but he was on the lookout for a rich wife. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_14.html" title="April 14">14 April</a> <a href="../../../1/6/5/1659.html" title="1659">1659</a> she married <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Palmer%2C_1st_Earl_of_Castlemaine_142c.html" title="Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine">Roger Palmer</a> against his family's wishes; his father predicted that she would make him one of the most miserable men in the world. The two separated, but did not divorce, in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1662.html" title="1662">1662</a>, following the birth of her first son. The two remained married for his lifetime, but it is believed that Palmer did not father any of his wife's children. <a href="http://www.arikah.com/encyclopedia/Barbara_Villiers%2C_Duchess_of_Cleveland" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arikah.com/encyclopedia/Barbara_Villiers%2C_Duchess_of_Cleveland" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>She became King Charles's mistress in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1660.html" title="1660">1660</a>, while still married to Palmer, and whilst Charles was still in exile. As a reward for her services, the King created her husband Baron Limerick and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Castlemaine_8672.html" title="Earl of Castlemaine">Earl of Castlemaine</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1661.html" title="1661">1661</a>. Of her six children, five were acknowledged by Charles as his:</p>

<p>She had a bitter enemy in <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hyde%2C_1st_Earl_of_Clarendon_4ab9.html" title="Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon">Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon</a>. Clarendon, one of the most powerful of the King's advisors, opposed her appointment as a Lady of the Bedchamber (as did, quite understandably, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Braganza_8783.html" title="Catherine of Braganza">Catherine of Braganza</a>, Charles's wife and Queen). By <a href="../../../1/6/6/1662.html" title="1662">1662</a> she had more influence in the court than did the Queen, and there were bitter feuds behind the scenes between the two women. This was followed by rumours of an estrangement between Barbara and Charles, as the result of his infatuation with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frances_Stuart_c727.html" title="Frances Stuart">Frances Stuart</a>. In December <a href="../../../1/6/6/1663.html" title="1663">1663</a> Barbara announced her conversion to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>; historians disagree as to the reasons why. Some believe it might have been an attempt to consolidate her position with the King, and some believe it was a way of strengthening her ties with her Catholic husband, in case Charles decided to abandon her.</p>
<p>Barbara was famously extravagant. She was notorious for helping herself to money from the Privy Purse, as well as taking bribes from the Spanish and French. She was <a href="../../../p/r/o/Promiscuous.html" title="Promiscuous">promiscuous</a>, and well known for using her influence on the king to her own benefit. Eventually this would lead to her downfall. Her influence over the King waxed and waned. In June <a href="../../../1/6/7/1670.html" title="1670">1670</a> Charles created her Baroness Nonsuch, Countess of Southampton and <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cleveland_f316.html" title="Duke of Cleveland">Duchess of Cleveland</a> in her own right. However, no-one in the court was sure whether this was an indication that she was being jettisoned by Charles, or whether this was a sign that she was even higher in his favours. The Dukedom was made with a special remainder which allowed it to be passed to her eldest son, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_FitzRoy%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Cleveland_6544.html" title="Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland">Charles FitzRoy</a>, even though he was illegitimate.</p>
<p>While the King had taken other mistresses, Barbara also took other lovers, including the acrobat Jacob Hall and her <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_cousin.html" title="Second cousin">second cousin</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough_221e.html" title="John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough">John Churchill</a>. Her lovers certainly benefited financially from the arrangement; Churchill purchased an annuity with £5,000 Barbara had given him. As the result of the <a href="../../../1/6/7/1673.html" title="1673">1673</a> <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_Act_a4fe.html" title="Test Act">Test Act</a>, which essentially banned all Catholics from holding office, Barbara lost her position as Lady of the Bedchamber, and the king cast her aside completely from her position as mistress, taking <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nell_Gwynne_4570.html" title="Nell Gwynne">Nell Gwynne</a> as his newest <i>favorite</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/7/1676.html" title="1676">1676</a> she travelled to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> with her four youngest children. In <a href="../../../1/7/0/1705.html" title="1705">1705</a> Roger Palmer died, and she married Major-General Robert Feilding whom she later had prosecuted for <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">bigamy</a>. She died in <a href="../../../1/7/0/1709.html" title="1709">1709</a> after suffering <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dropsy.html" title="Dropsy">dropsy</a>.</p>
