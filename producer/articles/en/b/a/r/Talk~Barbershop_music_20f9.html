<dd>There seems to be no reason given by whoever suggested the cleanup (which wasn't me) - but my view is that the page is now much too large and cumbersome. I'd like to see it broken down. Certainly the beautyshop bit could be split off - I believe very few currently practising barbershop people have heard of this term. I'd like to see the history split off and considerably revised/expanded to reflect Averill's work. The organisations should still be listed here (but not discussed), with the BHS highlighted as the most significant (but not the only) group. The list of notable artists continues to grow, but is subjective and doesn't seem to me to be useful on the main page. Just my thoughts. Rrex 17 April 2006</dd>

<p>It's now generally accepted, as a result of scholarship by Lynn Abbott and Jim Henry, that barbershop singing originated in African-American communities in the U.S. around the turn of the century. Barbershops were social gathering-places for African-Americans.</p>
<p>The first uses of the term were associated with African-Americans. Henry notes that "The Mills Brothers learned to harmonize in their father's barber shop in Piqua, Ohio, and several well known black gospel quartets were founded in neighborhood barber shops, among them the New Orleans Humming Four, the Southern Stars and the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartette."</p>
<p>I've been brooding about what the Wikipedia entry should say about this and what it should say.</p>
<p>SPEBSQSA was founded in 1939 as a white organization, and did not admit blacks until 1963. The Sweet Adelines split over the same issue (the splinter group becoming Harmony, Incorporated).</p>
<p>In other words, as with rock 'n roll, barbershop harmony is a black cultural form that was adopted by whites.</p>

<p>I've made one minor edit to the last paragraph, which had claimed that the number of people worldwide who enjoy the hobby of barbershop singing is in the millions. As a lifelong barbershopper myself, I wish this were true; the society's own website puts U.S. membership at only 32,000, and even with subsidiary groups and Sweet Adelines, plus non-member hobbyists, I think "millions" is a bit lofty and reduced the credibility of the article more than "thousands". Perhaps the number isn't even all that important to include, since it can only be used to accurately measure society membership, which does not ultimately define everything about barbershop.</p>
<p>While I'm spouting off, I thought I'd second a previous comment about how "notable artists" make the list. After all, if I were formulating it with an eye toward the artists' overall significance to the style, I'd surely include the Boston Common and Bluegrass Student Union, or Keepsake, if technical merit is the main criterion. Arguably, any of these would be more representative of the style, since to the best of my knowledge, more recent albums by Acoustix and the Vocal Majority (impressive as they are) have featured backing instrumentation, non-standard arranging, six- and eight-part voicings, as well as later-period (e.g. jazz) songs that many barbershoppers would not generally regard as representational of the style.</p>

<p>...although a real Society booster might say that "thousands" errs in the other direction.</p>
<p>At this point in time, I don't honestly believe that there is any large amount of barbershop singing activity going on outside the societies. The society was, in fact, founded <i>because</i> it was starting to die out as a independent, spontaneous phenomenon. In the fifties, when quartets were still a common feature e.g. in radio or televison commercials, the Mills Brothers were still cutting hit records, etc. the average person would have heard the style in "ordinary life" and one can imagine that at least some would have picked it up and started to sing it just from hearing it. The total number of people singing barbershop can't be very different from the total membership of SPEBSQSA + SAI + HI.</p>
<p>www.harmonize.com/region4/ MMNewsletter-September2003.PDF says:</p>
<p>In last month’s issue, we reported that from April 30, 2002 to April 30, 2003 Sweet Adelines International has seen a 2.5% decrease in total membership. Total members is currently 27,273. Within the last eight years, SAI membership peaked in 1997 to 30,092. It has declined steadily since.</p>

<p>Well, I found (and lost, darn it) a reference somewhere to a total membership of "about 80,000" for the combined three organizations, and since SPEBSQSA and SAI are about 30,000 each and HI is smaller than SAI, I think that will do.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that it was absolutely necessary to explain why SPEBSQSA has such a long initialism, which led to a brief explanation, which seemed to require noting the origins of SAI and HI as well, which seemed to require a plain statement (rather than the usual PR euphemism of saying that the SAI/HI split originated over "a by-law.")</p>

<p>I have noticed that one of the most volatile parts of this article seems to be the list of "Notable Artists", owing, I'm sure, to the fact that this is such a subjective designation. Indeed, I have started to wonder if the list ultimately adds any substance to the article, or whether it could just as easily be eliminated from it, or handled differently.</p>
<p>As long as it's preserved, however, these are my latest thoughts:</p>
<p>I agree that the doo-wop groups and others that have so far been removed are better categorized and written about under that category (or perhaps the more comprehensive "a cappella" section).</p>
<p>My opinion is that a limited, concise list of quartets and choruses is more valuable than everyone adding his or her favorite group(s) to the list, with the result being long, arbitrary, and ultimately not as useful for those not familiar with the style.</p>
<p>I would also point out that many of the quartets that might be included on the list are already accessible via other links in the article, such as the SPEBSQSA site, and for that reason are already well within reach of those wanting more information or conducting research, and therefore are unnecessary to include on this page. The Acoustix quartet is a good example of this, and one of my main reasons for taking them off the list when editing this article recently is because they appear on the websites of both the Vocal Majority chorus website and the SPEBSQSA website, both of which already appear as links in this article. The Vocal Majority themselves are a better candidate for the "Notable Artists" list, due to their unprecedented success and very high profile in the realm of barbershop *chorus* singing, although I note that the Louisville Thoroughbreds have won only one fewer SPQBSQSA chorus championship than they have. In other words, the list could go on and on...</p>
<p>As long as the "Notable Artists" list persists, though, the criteria I would suggest for barbershop singing groups being included (since the question has been raised several times) are that the artist be widely considered historically important (one measure of this might be if the group is otherwise documented in the Wikipedia), and that they be a good example of the barbershop style as defined in the article and as historically practiced (as opposed to certain more recent arrangements and repertoires that puch the barbershop envelope). This "Notable Artists" distinction is ultimately impossible to make objectively, so I expect (and hope) there to be much more lively debate regarding this section of the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's <i>not</i> get into the business of <i>excluding</i> things from the notable artists lists. Just as with stub articles, I suggest that the best way to write this section of the article collaboratively <i>is</i> for start by everyone adding his or her favorite group to the list—or, more properly, for everyone to add whatever groups they think should be added. I definitely think it helps if the entry gives both the name of the group <i>and</i> a sentence or two explaining <i>why</i> they're included. When the list gets to be more than a few scattered entries, then we can start to slice and dice it and organize it under subheads. As for whether they be "a good example of the barbershop style," the classification could deal with that. Why don't you get the ball rolling by <i>adding</i> the groups that <i>you</i> think ought to belong?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One NPOV way of doing this is to add groups that have won SPEBSQSA /SAI/HI championships, since by definition these groups are regarded as good example of the style by the organizations that define the style.</dd>

<dd>Might it be a good idea to contact the either the SPEBSQSA or some of the more high-profile modern quartets/choruses and request samples of their performances that could be used here instead of this old solo? I should think that they'd have at least something - one of the core Barbershop ballads, a piece of an Internationals performance, maybe? I'm a little new to Wikipedia to feel comfortable taking that initiative without asking first, or even leaving it up to someone else, but - what say you? <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmegalicious_3867.html" title="User:Smegalicious">Smegalicious</a></dd>

<dd>There are a number of public domain recordings of both original barbershop era professional quartets as well as more recent International caliber quartets available on the Barbershop Harmony Society's web page. Perhaps linking to some of those (or embedding them) would be a good idea. The basic problem, though, is that really old recordings don't represent the state of the musical hobby today and could damage the efforts of the Society to get more members and reverse the declining membership. Having both some historical examples as well as relatively recent, high quality, examples would be better. Zanzan42 17:58, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wrote <b>Each of the four parts is assigned to female voice parts: the lead/tenor/bass/baritone is assigned accorging to women's voice parts.</b> and this was edited out. First of all a barbershop is generally an all-male haircut establishment, whose etymology comes from <i>barba</i> which is comes from the indo-European root for <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard.html" title="Beard">beard</a>. So if barbershopping started out in barber shops, then it was likely an all male endeavor. Furthermore, in singing parts, women have higher <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocal_range.html" title="Vocal range">vocal range</a>, and so there are usually different names for the parts they sing versus what men sing. (example: <a href="../../../s/o/p/Soprano.html" title="Soprano">soprano</a> is a female and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopranist.html" title="Sopranist">Sopranist</a> is a male singer in the same range.) I doubt that women in beautyshop quartets sing a true <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basso.html" title="Basso">Basso</a>, so I think wikipedia should state what the <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocal_range.html" title="Vocal range">vocal ranges</a> typcally are for each part in a beautyshop quartet. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 17:06, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Female barbershop quartets use the same naming convention for the parts that the men do, but they sing in a higher range. The quick and dirty way to take a men's barbershop arrangement and revoice it for women is to raise it a fourth and swap the baritone and tenor parts. That puts the women's voices in the right range while still maintaining the close harmony arrangement. Zanzan42 17:50, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's also common to just raise the pitch without swapping those parts because swapping the Baritone and Tenor parts would result in the new Tenors frequently singing below the Leads and the new Baritones singing almost exclusively above the Leads. (And the side effects of the audience now actually hearing the Baris [gasp!]) Jon 20:09, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do the parts in a "beautyshop quartets" sing in different vocal ranges from the corresponding parts in a women's "barbershop" quartet? Is it a slightly different style with different arrangers? Do "beautyshop" quartets buy their music from SAI or HI and is it labelled "barbershop" or is this a sort of independent movement outside and apart from the traditional women's barbershopping?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm willing to be corrected on this, but I still think "beautyshop" quartet is just a new <i>name</i> for a women's barbershop quartet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Correct. But nobody that I know of in the hobby uses the phrase. Zanzan42 17:50, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article currently says nothing about vocal ranges; it probably should, and should probably say something about differences between mens' and women's quartets. It currently only that "Each of the four parts has its own role: the lead sings the melody, with the tenor harmonizing above the melody, the bass singing the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completing the chord." AFAIK this correctly describes the barbershop style as performed both by male and female quartets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The history of barbershop harmony is complex and somewhat disputed (as its black origins were forgotten/suppressed). I've only just begun to read a book called "Four Parts, No Waiting" which is a new history of barbershopping, I'll have to see what it says about mens' vs. women's barbershopping. This is what I think is true but don't take it is gospel. In their origins, barbershop quartets were male, but were not specifically associated with barbershops; the name was applied simply because barbershops were social gathering places in the black community. They were originally also called streetcorner quartets, etc. It was a slightly disparaging term for unschooled and musically "incorrect" chord structures and progressions, i.e. what you might hear in a barbershop as opposed to a concert hall.</dd>

<dd>Great book. Pretty much the authoritative treatise on the subject. It takes a slightly different tack from Jim Henry's doctoral thesis: Where Jim's argument was for a somewhat exclusive origin in the African-American musical culture, Averill's argument is for both white and black origins that fed off each other over the period of the 1830's to the early 20th century. Given the documentation in the book, I tend to agree with Averill more than I do with Jim. Zanzan42 17:50, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think what we currently know as women's barbershopping was a sort of synthetic creation, as the women whose husbands were in SPEBSQSA wanted their own signing organization, and was thus an offshoot of the originally-all-white SPEBSQSA... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:25, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are three issues here that we need to hammer out:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1 women don't sing basso, so the discusison of lead/tenor/bass/baritone needs to distinguish between part names (which may be labeled as such) and the ranges that female barbershop quartets sing in.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Men's</i> barbershop parts don't have much correspondence to their similarly-named counterparts in classical music. The so-called "tenor" is a harmony part above the lead, singing mostly in falsetto, which is not exactly what <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luciano_Pavarotti_8dfe.html" title="Luciano Pavarotti">Luciano Pavarotti</a> does. (Reputedly Pavarotti does not read music, though, which if true would give him at least something in common with many barbershoppers).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In that barbershop is a close harmony style, most chord voicings are within a single octave or up to an octave and a fifth. Generally, that means that the singers usable range doesn't have to be that large; it's pretty easy to form a quartet with people that fall into the classical definition of "baritone". True basses aren't really useful in barbershop because most arrangements won't be written to take advantage the low range that is used by, for instance, Russian choruses.

<p>The very fact it is called "beautyshop" indicates it was considered a counterpart to barbershop that would be symetrical in many ways. Call this article whatever you want, but I think the information about both barbershop and beautyshop would go in this article. Alternately, make an article for the general movement "barbershop movement?" and make barbershop music and beautyshop music the two principal sub-articles. —&#160;<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 04:58, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We need to be VERY careful about thinking of the Barbershop Harmony Society (or any other organization) as being synonymous with barbershop music. At the risk of oversimplifying, BHS/SAI/etc are just groups of people who enjoy the hobby (and therefore share sheet music, compete, attend coaching sessions, wear logo clothing, hold conventions, etc).</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong a barbershop quartet not being a member of BHS/SAI/etc.</p>
<p>Likewise, there's nothing wrong with someone who enjoys the music not being interested in BHS/SAI/etc or their activities.</p>
<p>That said, some of the content in this article needs to be separated. "Notable Artists" sounds like a nice section, but it's basically a list of BHS international champions. The section should be changed to "International Champions" and moved to the Barbershop_Harmony_Society article. This also removes the subjectivity of selecting who should and shouldn't be listed there. The Pop_music genre article has no notable artists; it's probably easist of Barbershop_music doesn't either.</p>
<p>Everything under "Organization" should also be moved to Barbershop_Harmony_Society. "Typical Barbershop Songs" has a place here, as long as there is no requirement that they be "officially" barbershop per any organization rules (i.e. BHS). <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrevier_ff77.html" title="User:Crevier">Scott Crevier</a> 20:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"... by consonant four-part chords for every melody note in a predominantly homophonic texture." Does Barbershop use a different definition of "consonant" than the rest of the Western music world? Dissonance and consonace are part and parcel of almost all tonal Western music, including Barbershop. The tension of a dissonance followed by the release of a consonace is an intergral characteristic of Western music. When a dominant seventh chord resolves to a tonic chord, a dissonance (the dominant seventh chord) resolves to a consonance. Barbershop music is full of dissonance, as well as consonance, which is one of the reasons that it sounds so nice. If it actually had a consonant four-part chord on every melody note, it would be very boring. The sentence should be revised to reflect the ubiquity of <i>dissonance</i> as well as consonance in Barbershop music.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand what you're getting at. Of course Barbershop harmony, like other Western music, covers the range from consonance to dissonance, by whatever definitions are used, but in comparison to other musical styles Barbershop harmony very definitely emphasizes the simpler and more consonant harmonies. Barbershop performances can and do include all sorts of material, but a barbershopper that went to a contest and sung Gershwin or Burt Bacharach music in an arrangement faithful to the composer's original harmonies would almost surely be downgraded for departure from the hallmarks of barbershop style.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Conversely, particularly in its early years, barbershop harmony was derided because. in order to favor ringing chords it used chord progressions which were "incorrect" according to music theory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "being very boring," a common (and legitimate) critique of the style is that it <i>is</i> harmonically boring. It is the price that is paid for those "ringing" chords which are musically very exciting—not for their harmony, but for their timbre. It is fair to characterize the barbershop style as "harmonically boring..." and it is fair to characterize a Gene Krupa drum solo as "melodically boring." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:08, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>P. S. It turns out that the definition is that of the Barbershop Harmony Society, verbatim. It ought to have been properly attributed and now is. The people who wrote the definition are musically sophisticated and I doubt that their description is grotesquely inaccurate according to standard musical terminology. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:20, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I don't understand what you're getting at." Here's the quote: "... consonant four-part chords for every melody note." Barbershop music makes frequent use of dominant seventh chord. Dominant seventh chords are not consonant; they contain the interval of the tritone. Barbershop music is full of sonorities that are not consonant. Simple as that. I said the description was no accurate, but I never said or implied "grotesquely," so that argument may be dismissed as a "red herring". Someone's estmation that the definition comes from the "musically sophisticated" and saying "I doubt" are hardly a sound basis for an encylopedia entry. The dominant seventh chords in Barbershop music resolve, typically to chords with roots a fifth lower than the seventh chords' roots. The fact that they resolve is clear eveidence of their dissonance. Perhaps, as I suggested, the term "consonant" has a special Barbershop-specific meaning, in which case that should be clearly stated. By the normal generic definition of "consonant" in Western tonal music, the defintion that heads this article, simply put, is not correct.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You say that Barbershop "covers the range from consonance to dissonance" which clearly indicates that not all notes have consonant harmonies.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In short: dominant seventh chords are not consonant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(Shrug) It's what the Barbershop Harmony Society says, and they're now identified as the source.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It <b>is</b> a correct <b>quotation</b> of the official definition of the style by the organization in the best situation to make that definition.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think your definition of consonant may be overly strict. It's hard for me to believe that a dominant seventh, all of whose notes are actually present as overtones within the tonic note, is considered _very_ dissonant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My dictionary says "1. Harsh and inharmonious in sound; discordant. 2. Being at variance; disagreeing. 3. Music Constituting or producing a dissonance." I suspect that to the modern Western lay ear, dominant sevenths are not "harsh and inharmonious" although they may require resolution and be dissonant by definition #3. I</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But in any case, if you think it's important, then I suggest you add a sentence saying that the official definition is not using these terms in the standard musicological way, with a source citation to some good source that says, in so many words, that major chords are "consonant" and dominant sevenths are "dissonant."</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point is, you're not going to find much in the way of ninths, diminished or augmented chords, tritones, and in fact darn few minor chords (don't be confused by an old tradition in which barbershoppers referred to the dominant seventh as "minor!") in barbershop arrangements.

<p>I think we need to stop adding names to the list of choruses and quartets. It seems more appropriate to be adding these names to the SPEBSQSA article, and leave this one to explain only what barbershop music is. Otherwise the names are going to be spread out all over the place, with duplication of links, etc. Let's just keep this article focused on the music aspect itself. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/u/l/User%7EDullfig_a732.html" title="User:Dullfig">Dullfig</a> (<a href="../../../d/u/l/User_talk%7EDullfig_17c8.html" title="User talk:Dullfig">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dullfig_72cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dullfig">contribs</a>) 17:22, 15 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Whenever I listen to the classic white male gospel quartets, like The Blackwood Brothers or The Statesmen Quartet, I can't help thinking "Barbershop!" Don't white or <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_gospel.html" title="Southern gospel">Southern gospel</a> quartets use the same voices and rules, like dominant sevenths, as Barbershop? Of course, they usually sing accompanied, though they often do a cappella, too. I was thinking of adding mention of them, maybe in a short section.

<li>Seems reasonable. Barbershop has tended to be self-defined by SPEBSQSA (now the Barbershop Harmony Society), which has tended to have a rather selective view of the musical style. <i>My</i> first thought was "Barbershop!" when I first heard Ladysmith Black Mombasa. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I didn't put the navigation box there, but I don't see why it is "extraneous" or "inappropriate" and I think it should remain. The black origins of the barbershop style are well established, and black quartets regularly competed in the barbershop singing contests popular in New York City just prior to the establishment of SPEBSQSA. SPEBSQSA's exclusion of blacks for the first decade or so of its history is an embarrassment to SPEBSQSA. SPEBSQSA did succeed in creating a association of barbershop with white quartets in the public mind, but that is not a reason for perpetuating this misconception in our article about the style.</p>
<p>Barbershop, like jazz, is not necessarily thought of as "African-American," but both historically had origins in black folk music. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Only people who don't know any better don't associate jazz or barbershop music with African Americans -- despite their obvious and incontrovertible origins. That, Dpbsmith, is <i>precisely</i> why I affixed the tag. In fact, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">Blues</a> <i>also</i> would have an African American template affixed to them -- but, IMO, it would clutter the page too much. People need to know barbershop music came from. The tag is wholly appropriate, and it should stay. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 17:29, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Of course, I do wonder if there might be some way to make the point without taking up quite as much space on the page. It seems to me that it would be better to have a much smaller navigation box that connects barbershop with other African-American musical styles. I'm not sure readers of the barbershop article necessarily want to read about <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_military_history_f449.html" title="African American military history">African American military history</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine_of_Father_Divine_98b5.html" title="Doctrine of Father Divine">Father Divine</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:38, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>They might if they're interested in African American-related topics, generally. The same might be said about other such boxes on the site. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 20:56, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbershop_music_20f9.html" title="Edit section: Barbershop seventh and tuning terms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Barbershop seventh and tuning terms</span></h2>
<p>Reading this article has left me a bit confused. It is clear that a distinguishing quality of barbershop music is the use of <a href="../../../j/u/s/Just_intonation.html" title="Just intonation">Just intonation</a>, the "barbershop seventh", and "ringing sound". But the page seems to contradict itself, or at least confuse, over what the terms barbershop seventh and ringing sound mean.</p>
<p>First, the barbershop seventh. There is a long quote from the Barbershop Harmony Society near the top of the page, which includes the statement: "justly tuned <a href="../../../o/t/o/Otonality_and_Utonality_1cbb.html" title="Otonality and Utonality">otonal tetrads</a>; where for example the voices are at frequencies in the proportion 4:5:6:7". I just browsed the Barbershop Harmony Society's website and saw this quote, but this specific statement wasn't there. In fact I couldn't find any technically precise definition of what a barbershop seventh actually is, other than being in just intonation. I suspect it is just what the Otonality page and the 4:5:6:7 statement indicates -- that it is the 7:4 interval, sometimes called the "harmonic seventh" or the "blue seventh". W.A. Mathieu, in the book "Harmonic Experience", points out a well-known use of it -- in the extra bit added onto the song "Happy Birthday to You" with the line "And many more!" The word "more" is, he writes, typically sung as a 7:4 ("harmonic") seventh.</p>
<p>Later in the article there are more comments about the barbershop seventh -- how 35-60 percent of the chords in barbershop music use it -- "Oh Lord play that Barber shop chord!" -- and how the dominant seventh barbershop chord is so important that "it is called the "barbershop seventh".</p>
<p>To confuse matters more, the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_musical_intervals.html" title="List of musical intervals">List of musical intervals</a> lists 7:4 (but called it 4:7, a mistake I think) and calls it the "septimal minor seventh, seventh harmonic". I think the name ought to be "harmonic seventh" instead of "seventh harmonic", but in any case it doesn't say anything about barbershop. It does say that "some assert" that 7:4 is a blue note used in jazz though. The page <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septimal_comma.html" title="Septimal comma">Septimal comma</a> also mentions 7:4, calling it the "harmonic seventh". Finally, the tuning software "Scala" calls 7:4 "harmonic seventh". <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/intervals.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/intervals.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>On this page the bit about Otonality and 4:5:6:7 chords seem to indicate that the barbershop seventh is the same as what is elsewhere called the harmonic seventh or blue seventh -- the just intonation interval of 7:4. But it is not very clear. Is it the same interval or not? If not, what is it? If it is the same, it doesn't seem to be "known as the barbershop seventh" outside of the world of barbershop.</p>
<p>Second, the "ringing sound". I'm confused by the seemingly contradictory statements about how the ringing sound is not the same as the acoustic physicist's overtone and more like <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterodyning.html" title="Heterodyning">heterodyning</a> -- having to do with some kind of non-linear response to sound within the human ear -- but also how the ringing sound depends on singing in just intonation "to maximize the overlap of common overtones". Then there is the stuff about the "fifth voice" effect. It's all very confusing.</p>
<p>If I understand it right, to create the ringing sound the singers need to sing in just intonation such that the overtones/partials/harmonics of their voices line up well and reinforce each other. See <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonic_series_%28music%29.html#Terminology" title="Harmonic series (music)">Harmonic series (music)#Terminology</a> for the meaning of overtone, partial, and harmonics in music theory (and note that page even mentions Barbershop music, but seems to (errorneously?) say it merely means "close harmony" in barbershop). This reinforcing of justly-tuned partials would be able to make a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combination_tone.html" title="Combination tone">combination tone</a>, but as that page says, combinations tones are "thought to sometimes" be made by the non-linear inner ear response. They are also, apparently, created through simple harmonic sums and differences. The <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterodyning.html" title="Heterodyning">heterodyning</a> page linked to is about the "beating" of slightly out of tune frequencies, which doesn't sound much like how the barbershop "ringing sound" is described here -- and certainly not about combination tones and "fifth voice" effects, unless we're talking about <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binaural_beats.html" title="Binaural beats">binaural beats</a> or the frequency of the beating of out of tune harmonies, which seems highly unlikely. Such things should make tones far lower, rather than "above the blended sound" as this page puts it.</p>
<p>Even if there is some strange non-linear effect inside the ear, the page says a few times that barbershop singers produce the ringing sound by singing in just intonation. If so, this overtone effect may not be strictly the same as the scientific meaning of overtone, but it seems to be the common meaning of overtone, partial, harmonic, etc, in music theory and the study of tunings and harmony. So this leaves me confused. Is the ringing sound about singing in just intonation with the resulting alignments of the harmonics/partials of the voices, or is it about singing slightly out of tune to create heterodyning beating frequencies? Could it be both? My guess is that it is the former -- just intonation -- and the stuff about non-linear heterodyning is either wrong or a minor factor. But I don't know. Can anyone enlighten me? I find the barbershop sound intriguing and would like to understand it better. Thanks!

<dd>I would say that the article as it stands focuses more than necessary on the use of just intonation, giving the false impression that just intonation is peculiar to barbershop in particular. This is nonsense: it's a perfectly natural tendency in almost all music (with the notable exceptions of much Western classical music in the 20th century, and any music influenced by equal-tempered keyboard instruments) to strive for just intervals, and the stuff about the fifth voice seems to me like a needlessly expansive, and occasionally incorrect, explanation of <i>why we like just intervals</i>. Considering especially the lack of sources I'm inclined to remove much of this stuff.
