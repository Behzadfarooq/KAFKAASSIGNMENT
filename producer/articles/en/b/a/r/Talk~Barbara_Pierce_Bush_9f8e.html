It was created mostly by removing facts about Jenna and rewording the remaining facts to fit one person.

<dd>Glad you did this. I thought of it myself a few months back -- I was quite uncomfortable having an encyclopedic article treat them as twins when they're 24. They're not Siamese! --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:31, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I feel that the articles should be put together into one single article again. Instead of having one decently-sized article, now there are two articles that are pretty much stubs. It doesn't matter if they're 24 years old or 2 years old, it should be treated the same way. --Kyle | Talk
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. A lack of information about someone doesn't warrant having them share an article with another person. At the ages of 24 each, they are now old enough to be considered individuals who just happened to be born twins! You don't create one article for George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush just because they're closely related. Anyways it is my opinion that they each deserve their own article. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt0401_4f87.html" title="User:Matt0401">Matt0401</a> 19:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody, for no great reason, changed the name form <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Pierce_Bush_%281981%29_83e1.html" title="Barbara Pierce Bush (1981)">Barbara Pierce Bush (1981)</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Pierce_Bush_%28twin%29_327d.html" title="Barbara Pierce Bush (twin)">Barbara Pierce Bush (twin)</a>. Given almost all backlinks were to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Pierce_Bush_%281981%29_83e1.html" title="Barbara Pierce Bush (1981)">Barbara Pierce Bush (1981)</a>, this move was unwarranted. If somebody wishes to keep the new name, please fix the backlinks, by bypassing the redirect. In a couple days if most articles are still linking to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Pierce_Bush_%281981%29_83e1.html" title="Barbara Pierce Bush (1981)">Barbara Pierce Bush (1981)</a>, then I'll move it back. I don't want to have a situation where the article is repeatedly moved, and various redirects left being used. I took the time to fix a number of articles to point directly to this article, before the name change, and dislike my effort being wasted.

<dd>Barbara Pierce Bush (1981) isn't a great name, because the other Barbara Pierce Bush article doesn't use a birth year in its title, so there's no parallelism. Using (twin) isn't great for the same reason. Since the other article uses (First Lady), her relationship to the Presidency, perhaps this one should be called Barbara Pierce Bush (Presidential daughter). Then again, I think the First Lady article should have stayed at Barbara Bush plain and simple, since she's far more known, important, and referenced than this Barbara. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 21:46, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>_ _ A good Dab'g suffix
<ol>
<li>requires no head-scratching in distinguishing the topic from the other topics that were candidates for the un-Dab'd title, and</li>
<li>is short.</li>
<li>Period.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Creating parallelism is not per se a virtue, and striving for it is a bad habit since it's just luck when it does a good job; if you have an American selectman, an American magistrate, and an Australian lawyer/MP, then the best set of dab'n suffixes (each its topics best available combination of brevity &amp; being widely understood) is instead probably two case-of ones -- <i>(politician)</i> and <i>(jurist)</i> -- and a context-of one -- <i>(Australia)</i>.</dd>
<dd>_ _ If you'd rather let it stand than choose between doing a batch of rdr-snappings or creating rdrs by changing it, that's your business. But my failure to snap them is irrelevant to whether your changing it is good for WP:
<ol>
<li>If my change was good, it's an improvement despite the rdrs, and the only problem is that there's still work waiting for someone to do it.</li>
<li>The rdrs getting snapped is good, but doing it by hand is usually a waste of effort, since bot-master editors do it so efficiently and diligently once they get around to them. (It's also a waste of willingness to edit, for the many editors who need to leave the keyboard prematurely after a batch of snaps.)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>_ _ I may be mistaken in thinking that most editors share my distaste for Dab'g suffixes that rely on vital stats. Here's where <i>my</i> distaste comes from: In <i>(1981)</i>, "19..." functions as the same kind of "mini-word" that "the" is; <i>8</i> and <i>1</i> are each like a whole, common, single-syllable word, so the burden on the reader is like a two- to three-word phrase. (<i>1873</i> is like at least three words. And a DoB/DoD range doesn't feel twice as long, but it's <i>nearly</i> twice. And note that "Presidential daughter" has 6 syllables!)</dd>
<dd>_ _ BTW, i didn't experience any inspiration about what to replace <i>(First Lady)</i> (which i find bad, but not as bad as <i>(1981)</i>.) WP will always be a work in progress, so i refused to leaving that alone freak me.<br />

<dd>I don't care enough about this to really pursue it, but I don't understand why disambiguating suffixes have to be short. No encyclopedia user ever types them in, only editors, so what difference does their length make? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 20:18, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>_ _ There's this illusion, that your eyes take in a phrase instantly and without effort, and that your reading speed is simply the number of words you can see at once, divided by the time it takes to shift your gaze to the next group of that size. Maybe you have to do experimental psych -- or read cognitive psychology, and see enough of its results line up with things you can confirm by introspection -- to get over that illusion. Every word you add to the Dab'g suffix slows down and tires the user. It also increases the likelihood of misunderstanding it, and of either having to reread it, or following the wrong link.</dd>
<dd>_ _ There's far more going on when you read than you realize, and benefits of brief, clear Dab'g suffixes accrue even to users who never look at the Dab page. A relevant experience is cited in <i>The Psychology of Computer Programming</i>: the author describes turning a page, and having a nagging sense that <i>something</i> was wrong with the page, but no idea of what or where. He had almost finished the page when he came to a typo. IIRC, his reaction was not "What a coincidence: there <i>is</i> an error", but <i>recognition</i> of the error as familiar, despite his not having <i>consciously</i> read it, or remembered where on the page it was. Don't imagine that the article title -- the biggest type on the page (other than, in my browser, the W and A in "Wikipedia") -- is there for the benefit of the guy who walks by and looks over your shoulder. It's there for <i>you</i>, even if you just came from the Dab page by clicking on it, and when it's that big, part of your brain rereads it -- over and over every now and then if you stay on the page long enough. It helps keep you focused, and comfortable in your gut that you didn't absentmindedly switch to the wrong page. And if it's too long, you experience the greater time that brain corner spends on it is a distraction. If it's hard to grasp, you probably also feel vaguely confused, as if by the part of the page that your attention is focused on.<br />

<dd>The way I see it, you might as well just lose the middle name and just have it re-named "Barbara Bush (twin)". Whoever changed it to its current title didn't take the standard of care of removing the middle name because with the "twin" description, her middle name being mentioned is redundant! <a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmchow78_2d84.html" title="User:Amchow78">Amchow78</a> 23:29, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am posting here due to a plea on the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_opinion_ae73.html" title="Wikipedia:Third opinion">Wikipedia:Third opinion</a> page. Here are my third opinions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The person removing the cited material about the alcohol possession charge cites consensus about deleting similar text in <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a>. However, after reading the talk page carefully, I see no such consensus, only vigorous debate between a small number of individuals. Therefore, the rationale for deleting cited, sourced material about a notable person is invalid.</li>
<li>The appropriateness of including such a fact depends on what makes the person notable. Normally, the children of a notable person (in this case the President) are not themselves notable. If the alcohol charge is what resulted in notoriety, then it should be included in the article. This is the case with <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a> - he is known for his troubles as much for being the son of Al Gore.
<ul>
<li>The same is true for <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Bush_0825.html" title="Jenna Bush">Jenna Bush</a>; the article otherwise says nothing notable about her.</li>
<li>On the other hand, this article about <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Pierce_Bush_bda3.html" title="Barbara Pierce Bush">Barbara Pierce Bush</a> is somewhat different, as the article does indicate other notable things about her. However, the incident is a part of her past that gained her notoriety, so the incident should be given <i>brief</i> mention. I emphasize <i>brief</i> so as not to violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A similar situation occurred a few months ago with the article on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Seagal_fd07.html" title="Steven Seagal">Steven Seagal</a>. The article was a hatchet job, describing only negative things about the man. Now it is more balanced, describing the good with the bad. The same sense of balance should be shown here.</li>
<li>I see no discussion on this issue here. Such dicussion should have occurred and reached an impasse before posting a third opinion plea.</li>

<dd>I concur with <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a>, a <i>brief</i>, sourced mention should be made here... and this should have been discussed here before a revert war was started.

<dd>No. It is very simple. If Al Gore III's article is going to devoid of any and all references to his driving record, alcohol and drug abuse problems, and his inability to drive the speed limit without, and his inability to drive a car without alcohol in his system then the Bush twins will not be subject to biased treatment. It will be equal or not at all. As far as I can tell including those items, but not including the long, long, long record of Al Gore III--at least five, may be six, incidents, starting when he was 13 until just recently--is unequal and POV treatment. Wikipedia is supposed to be nonparisan and maintain a Neutral Point of View. Referring to their two SMALL run ins and not referring to his HUGE lengthy and detailed brushes with the law is clearly a POV pushing, Bio of Living person violation. I will revert the information until there is a concensus at Al Gore III. Also, this is a Bio of a Living Person and we are NOT going to defame anyone.

<dd>I'm sorry that you disagree with what has happened at the Al Gore III article but your actions here are inappropriate. And including well-sourced information, even if it's of a negative or even criminal nature, is most definitely not defamation or a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.

<dd>This is my view also. Just because one article is written in some way doesn't mean all articles should be. I would say that in this case the Al Gore III article should have information included - so long as it is well sourced.</dd>
<dd>The information that is being included is well sourced and relevant, it falls well within the confines of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and should stay. Please note that unilateral removal of information contrary to consensus is liable to get you blocked.

<dd>Finally, you are claiming that it is not neutral to allow information on the Bush twins to be included as information is not being included on Al Gore's article - this simply shows that you are not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> and are yourself editing in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> manner.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 23:38, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Clearly I have never talked to you. Therefore, you need to assume "good faith." Based upon the above comments. I do not believe that you are. You never responded to the underlining issue involved. In the Al Gore III article, there are editors who have decided to keep out all references to Al Gore III's legal problems. Now, in the Bush twins articles there are editors that have decided to put this information in. It is blantantly POV. You never responded to that issue. You are only focusing on blocking me. That is NOT good faith. I would encourage you to follow the Wikipedia rules and discuss the underlining rule.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 16:42, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To paraphrase, what happens at <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a> stays at <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a>. There is pretty clearly consensus to keep brief mention of the incident in this article. If similar information is being removed from the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a> article than the appropriate place to discuss that would be at <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a> talk page, going through all the processes available to you there if your concern is that there is some sort of whitewashing going on (RfC, RfM, etc)... but whatever is decided there has no bearing whatsoever on this article. There is nothing POV about that (unless of course there is a specific editor who is adding the information here and removing it from <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a>, which doesn't seem to be the case); they are 2 separate articles.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Bush Twins committed a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misdemeanor.html" title="Misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a>. It is not a felony and it is not the end of the world and it should not define who they are. Now, I have been attempting to trim down the reference to the incident(s) which were almost six years ago. However, the incident keeps being moved to the top of the and given great emphasis. I can only believe that the reason for this is POV. It should not be the first thing mentioned about the twins. It should be a basically a footnote to the article. I have not attempted to remove the information entirely--as was the case in the Al Gore III article. I now agree that it should be in the article, but let's be real it has to be the first thing in the private life section?? No. That is pushing an agenda.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 17:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No one has said that they committed a felony, that it defines who they are, or that it is the end of the world. Please do not be a over dramatize the situation. It's a single sentence about a situation which received considerable and widespread press attention. It's already trimmed down. You are attempting to push it to the bottom, out of chronological order so that you might portray a rose colored image of the sisters thus pushing your own POV. The point is balance. Also, note that you are misrepresenting my edits as I did make sure the word misdemeanor remained in the article in which you complained about it being taken out. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 18:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. You are wrong. You are misrepresenting my position. You just stated, "be a overdramatize the situation (sic)." I am not overdramatizing (I guess that's a word) the situation. This argument of yours is not substantive, it is just an attempt to denigrate my argument without having to response with substance, to the underlining issue. There is no rule that states that the description of their lives has to be in strict chronological order. Yes, it is a question of balance. For Barbara Bush, the younger, it was ONE incident where she where she got a misdemeanor ticket for having a beer in her hand when she was underage. That's it. You want to push it to the top of the article. I don't know why you feel the need to push it to the top of the article. But I do know that it is not that important. Yes it should be mentioned. But as the first thing in the section?? I don't think so. Let's see. The incident probably took all but five minutes to get caught and receive the ticket. She is about 26 years old and the one thing that the article wants to emphasize is a five minutes--ok, thirty minute--incident that happened six years ago at a restaurant by a large college campus. Unbelievable. Now, I heard over and over again why we should not put in Wikipedia the incidents of Al Gore III's life (and yes they are comparable). One of the arguments is that those incidents do not make up his whole life. That two or three (in Al Gore III's case four or five) incidents should not be the things that we judge his whole life on. If the Bush Twins and Al Gore III keep up the pace of the last three years for next ten years then this debate will be mute because time will have made all of these incidents seem distance and unrepresentative. However, if Wikipedians are cutting Al Gore III a break then shouldn't we back off a bit on the Twins. The information needs to be presented, but it does not have to be the first thing. It should move down in the article.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 18:17, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are not a judge of what is and is not important nor is Wikipedia. Rather, notability of this incident is established by the press coverage and widespread attention which was given to it. Again, I'd like to point out that, unlike what you have attempted to charge me with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jenna_Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103597268" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jenna_Bush&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103597268" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, I did not attempt to remove the misdemeanor charge. I'm wholly rejecting your attempt to resurrect the Gore III argument since that article has nothing to do with this one. Putting it at the top of the section simply has to do with the fact that it is a bio and that it occurs earlier than any of the other events presented in the section. Your only argument for pushing it down is that you believe your judgment of an incident's importance supercedes that of anyone else. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 18:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Right now it's not high up in the text, the visit to Rome in 2004 is above it and thus out of order. Further, the current version only says that she was charged with the criminal act.
