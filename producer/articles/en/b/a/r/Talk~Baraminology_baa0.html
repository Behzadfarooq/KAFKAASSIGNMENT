<p>I notice that throughout the article, there is the comment <i>(in creationist view)</i>. I see no such comment in the page on <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, even though there are many problems with the conjecture of evolution.

<dd>That is a fair point, and I will explain: the reason I wrote it here is that I made a set of assertions which if left unqualified would have caused surprise and raised POV concerns. I did much the same with universal common descent and the theory of evolution, which was an attempt at balance.</dd>

<p>The article is mostly silent on baraminology's status (or lack thereof) in the science community. This article discusses baraminology as if it were an accepted science, which it most certainly isn't. Not mentioning the fact that the scientific community overwhelmingly rejects creationism (and, <i>a fortiori</i>, baraminology) is a very dishonest portrayal of the issue. It's not a violation of NPOV policy to point out the simple fact that an overwhelming majority of scientists do not see any legitimacy in any creationism-related theory. In fact, portraying it as if it's science when it is widely considered a pseudoscience is taking a non-neutral point of view by deliberately omitting relevant facts. Wje 00:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have added the scientific status of this theory. The major point is that, like all of Creation Science, Baraminology is psuedoscience as defined by the National Academy of Sciences. In addition, no peer reviewed research has been published supporiting this theory. All research has been published in religous journals that do not undergo peer review.--<a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERoland_Deschain_25ed.html" title="User:Roland Deschain">Roland Deschain</a> 00:06, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No part of the article seems to show any Baraminologist people claiming that it is science, the only thing I read coming close is this ReMine person saying that something could be a theory, but cannot be observed or classified, so that doesn't sound like he's saying that this is necessarily science. Then there's the book mentioned which had the word "Biology" in it, but there doesn't seem to be anything in the article saying the writer takes this biology he's advocating as a necessarily scientific biology. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 14:16, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point is that there was a recent debate on the subject of which Adam Cuerden was aware (he started it), and it came to a conclusion (according to the closing administrator) which he disagrees with. That should not stop him reopening the debate, but he should not take radical action where he does not have the support of a consensus before further discussion. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 14:20, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It came to a conclusion NOT TO DELETE. Don't put words in the administrator's mouth, please.

<dd>Creationists sometimes claim racism originated with the theory of evolution, and claim that the lobbying of some churches to abolish slavery imply that creationists were soley responsible for the emancipation of slaves. However, a dirty little secret is that many creationists, fundamentalists, biblical literalists etc use the bible to justify racism. And clearly, baraminology is crafted loosely enough to accommodate people with racist views.

<dd>Yes, especially since one of the more specious claims I've read is that "Evolutionists brought us Hitler." Since Hitler believe in the purity of races, I'm more inclined that he was a form of Creationist, but then again, I just think he was completely evil and it doesn't really matter.<a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemarlin_8532.html" title="User:Orangemarlin">Orangemarlin</a> 20:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have heard evolution produced Hitler. I have heard evolution is the same as communism. I have heard evolution created slavery. I have heard that evolutionists favor fascism. I have heard that evolution is responsible for genocide. I have heard evolution was responsible for lynching. I have heard that evolution was followed by the Romans who fed the Christians to the lions. I have heard that the Pharohs of Egypt followed the evil evolution religion. I have heard that Hinduism is the same as evolution, and this proves why Hindus are evil and inferior etc etc. Some creationists try to claim that it was evolutionists that ran the inquisition and imprisoned Galileo in his house. I have heard that Islam and the Islamic terrorists are evil because they are evolutionists, and Mohammed was a proponent of evolution. I have heard that Shintoists in Japan brought evolution to Japan, and used evolution to prove the Emperor was descended from the Sun God. I have heard that before evolution, there was no such thing as war or slavery. I have heard that all of science was created by creationists, and that evolution is a false science that is preventing real advances in science and medicine. Evolution is supposedly responsible for gun crimes and efforts to regulate guns in the US and teenage pregnancy and drug addiction and marital infidelity and prostitution and on and on and on. How can anyone pay any serious attention to these "characters" (I am biting my tongue here) is absolutely beyond me. But nevertheless, many many do. And the only way to deal with it effectively is to not hide any of their motivations or pronouncements, even of fringe elements. Lets lay it all out on the table, even the kooky extremists, with good solid references and documentation. Lets expose them I say. If they want to believe that stuff, ok fine, but lets not hide it or allow them to ignore some of the more reprehensible aspects of their "movement".

<dd>It's definitely a parody, and a very funny one at that. The "creation science" section of the website is sponsoring an expedition to Africa (the "dark continent" they term it) to bring back live Pterosaurs. They decided on this after eliminating a number of other candidates (velociraptors guarding the Arc of the Covenant were too dangerous, pleisiosaurs too large, trilobytes to deep in the ocean, etc.) Creationists just don't go that far out on a limb even when they do fall into their true-believer syndrome. --216.125.49.252 15:21, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah, well. It had been a pretty long-standing source in that article, and if you look at just that page, it's pretty believable as a real source, particularly as most of the bits that look like parody are just slight tweaks of the Wayne Friar cite (unambiguously real) that replaced it. Admittedly, the bit about defining terms ought to have given me pause, but I fear my view of humanity's intelligence in general has been shattered a bit too often for that to cause me any trouble. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 15:59, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Because without that, there's a lot of overlap. Also, we hit the problems that whole sections of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Created_kind.html" title="Created kind">Created kind</a> are scarcely documentable. (notably, the "hypothesised kinds" section, a list of any group anyone has ever said might be a kind, incomplete, unreferenced, and probably unmaintainable.) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 13:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Try this. A large number of biblical literalists or young earth creationists believe that God created different animals and plants as related in the first two chapters of <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible%2C_King_James%2C_Genesis" class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible%2C_King_James%2C_Genesis" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a> and with hints elsewhere in the Bible. These differences are "Created kinds" and should be discussed there (some believe that later evolution or breeding then produced new species, others not). A small subgroup aiming to provide something similar to <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phylogenetics.html" title="Phylogenetics">phylogenetics</a> developed a grouping system they called "Baraminology" and that should be discussed here.

<dd>I'm not sure. I always goot the impression that they both started from the same few books and people, just one is the popular movement and the other the attempt to sound sciency, with Baraminology, the sciency movement, being used to provide some sort of support for any Created kinds claims. It'd be hard to draw a line between them. Hmm. Well, perhaps the sensibble thing is to try and trim out the unmaintainable parts of Created kinds, reference it up, with expansions from any suitable references, and see if we end up with much left? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 23:39, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
