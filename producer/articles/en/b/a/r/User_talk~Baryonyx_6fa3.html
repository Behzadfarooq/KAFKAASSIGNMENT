<p>Hi Baryonyx!

<li>Thanks, Carrp.&#160;:) I was hesitating because I haven't really created any pages of consequence before, and this one strikes me as one that'll be potentially big down the road. But when so many agreed, I felt it was better to start as soon as possible.&#160;:) Hope to see you around the page, too!&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaryonyx_f960.html" title="User:Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a> 23:22, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I went ahead and archived the Lost talk page as you proposed. Now is perhaps the best time to do it anyway. I left the page move discussion though because it hasn't been closed yet.

<dd>I don't think so. I'd say just police the page and make sure it stays away from getting out of hand with Internet rumors, speculation and original research again. If anything you can point to the discussion we've already had on the matter as a consensus should a problem arise, although a better alternative is to just point out Wikipedia's policies and guidelines on this sort of "material". I'm planning to keep more of an eye on the page this time around.

<p>Hey, thanks for the compliments you gave me about my organizing of the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Shephard_34da.html" title="Jack Shephard">Jack Shephard</a> article.

<p>Hey, got the note on my talk page, but I can't quite narrow it down which comments your talking about. Are you talking about the norwegian newspaper thing? If so, as he states that they are "speculating", it still doesn't belong in Wikipedia. If you're referring to a different section, let me know on my talk page, and include a link to the exact section you're talking about. i.e. <a href="../../../e/p/i/Talk%7EEpisodes_of_Lost_%28Season_2%29_dd89.html#The_buildings_of_the_Hanso_foundation" title="Talk:Episodes of Lost (Season 2)">Talk:Episodes of Lost (Season 2)#The buildings of the Hanso foundation</a>. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 17:34, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In regard to your message:</p>
<p>"I'm again removing the speculation on character deaths, as per the standards applied by the page Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not, especially sections 1.3, 1.7. and 1.8, particulary 1.8.3. Your own edit summary on the page for Sawyer admits that it is speculation, and thus by those page standards, should be removed. That is not an NPoV stance, it is Wikipedia policy. I also would invite you to review the sections Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and, in light of your belief that its OK to attack people in edit summaries, WP:NPA, most notably the line "Abusive edit summaries are particularly ill-regarded." Thank you. Baryonyx 08:53, 10 November 2005 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Several things. My roomate was on my computer and didn't logout before she made the edits. Although I agree with your statement on the standards and speculation, I don't see where any attacks towards anyone, or abusive edit summaries, were made. I am a fan of the show aswell although I haven't had the time to do too many edits for it. On a side note, I also think Sawyer is gonna be the one to go and the Shannon thing is a distraction.</p>

<p>Howdy. We had a discussion a while back about spoiler tags on the Lost article. I took another look at that talk page today and saw that my last response to you apparently didn't take. The gist of it was: thanks for moving the spoiler tag to the top of the article, and while I don't agree with you on all points, I feel that the issue has been resolved. I also hope the discussion didn't get too heated. I was upset about having part of the show spoiled for me and probably pushed things a little too far.</p>
<p>At some point I'm going to try to develop a guideline for the use of spoiler warnings on Wikipedia. Let me know if you'd be interested in joining that discussion (if and when it ever occurs).</p>
<p>Also, I notice that a lot of speculation creeps into the article (and the talk page) and you're doing a good job keeping it out.

<p>Sun's page is currently located at <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun-Soo_Kwon_0ad3.html" title="Sun-Soo Kwon">Sun-Soo Kwon</a>. As a Korean, the name looked wrong, so I did some research and couldn't find any official sources to back up the name, and instead found an IMDB entry where her name was listed as <b>Sun-Hwa Kwon</b>. I've seen other sources where the character is listed as <b>Sun Paik</b>. So her full given name is definitely Sun-Hwa, Sun-Soo being probably a mistake due to analogy with Jin's full given name being Jin-Soo (which is like expanding "Ken" to "Kenjamin" by analogy with "Ben" and "Benjamin"). The issue though is which surname to use for the article. In Korea, women do not take their husbands' surnames, so unless Sun has legally changed her name, her correct legal surname is still Paik. But perhaps Kwon is acceptable as an anglicized version of the name to help viewers who might be confused that the couple have different surnames. If you have an opinion on whether the page should be moved to <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun-Hwa_Kwon_22df.html" title="Sun-Hwa Kwon">Sun-Hwa Kwon</a> or Sun-Hwa Paik, then please leave a message on the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Talk%7ESun-Soo_Kwon_9f54.html" title="Talk:Sun-Soo Kwon">Talk:Sun-Soo Kwon</a>.

<p>Hi, Baryonyx,</p>
<p>I've just put in a proposal for an addition to "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a>" connected to the excessive non-encyclopedic material we've been getting on the LOST articles.

<dd>Regarding the two articles you mentioned on my talk page, I would recommend them for AFD. I agree that battling the crystal ballers on the eps page is getting tiring, I really don't know what to do about it.

<p>Earlier this month, I had the formal text for a "not a fan site" proposal ready to go for a straw poll, which I'd worked on for a couple <i>hours</i>... frustratingly, just as I was ready to post, I had a Web browser freeze-up and lost the text. Should teach me to edit in Internet Explorer. I'll try to recreate the content and put it up in the next few days. The gist was that "Wikipedia is not to be used as a substitute for fan sites, forums, chats rooms or other such fan-initiated Internet resources. It is not the place to introduce predictions of plot twists or outcomes of sporting events. Postings on fan forums do not meet the qualifications for verifiability, and spoiler/rumor sites should not be used as the basis of content." There was more, but I've not yet had a chance to rework what I had written. Suggestions? —<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 18:41, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, B,</p>
<p>As promised a while back, I've cleaned up the proposal material, and put it up for pre-posting at: <a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_Not_a_Fansite_9ee8.html" title="User talk:Leflyman/Not a Fansite">User_talk:Leflyman/Not_a_Fansite</a>. Please take a look at the proposed wording; you may also want to review the comments when I first brought it up on the talk page for <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">What Wikipedia is not</a> in November, which I've copied to the bottom of my "sub-page". Let me know what you think! —<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 19:56, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for your extensive comments. I'm digesting them now. I'm wondering if I'm missing anything else in the proposal; such as a clearer explanation of why what's appropriate for fan sites, is not appropriate for Wikipedia. Some of what you've written touches on that. I'm not sure, however, how to restate the "decoding" concept within WP terms. —<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 21:19, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>After your note, I saw that Lessthankris was back to re-inserting the text, and when I noticed just how many times he'd done so, it screamed 3RR time. I hope the temporary block will make him think twice about slipping in his own theories.</p>
<p>I agree that the Fan Theories section is a potential fancruft magnet. The requirement for "sourcing" is pretty sturdy, however, and the notice that only discredited theories are acceptable is a good way to remove the excess of those like Lessthankris. Honestly, I've been more concerned about what has been allowed to take root in the Story Elements. There's no requisite for verifiability for most of it, so the section has become a bevy of unsourced Original Research. I'm not sure how to reign it in.</p>
<p>I think on the LOST articles, we are likely battling similar problems faced by other articles' editors. It would be nice to get buy-in for some of the ideas we have as to what should/shouldn't go into fan articles (in hand with my proposal re: "not fan site" above). With Wikipedia having a super-high rank on Google, what we include in the Lost articles is likely being read by untold thousands of people! —<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 19:00, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I totally agree that the second season episode "synopses" are turning into play-by-plays. I've avoided looking at them because the writing is so bad, and figured at some point the people who keep adding to the extraneously over-described summaries would dissipate and we could do something about them. The only other option I can think of is to divvy up the episodes into separate articles, as was suggested earlier. I just looked at <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desperate_Housewives_828f.html" title="Desperate Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a> which I thought used a short summary format like ours, but noticed that they are now using synopses connected to long, separate episode articles: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Desperate_Housewives_episodes_8924.html" title="List of Desperate Housewives episodes">List_of_Desperate_Housewives_episodes</a>. —<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 17:22, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A Lost Wikiproject sounds like an excellent idea. I've been letting the Not a Fansite proposal percolate, hoping for inspiration to break through the issue on how to describe the appropriate depth of detail, other than as "trivia". Although I previously hadn't advertised the work being done on it, some other editors had noticed it; so I've asked for additional comments at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Section.2Fcomment_about_.22sports_journalism.22.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">the talk page for WWIN</a>.—<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 17:41, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agreed, again; my main frustration with LOST articles has been dealing with anon IP and single-edit users who have no regard for (or understanding of) WP standards. To them, this <i>is</i> just a fan site. I think your suggestion of a LOST Wikiproject is what's needed to organize the burgeoning amount of content that gets generate by the fans of the show. I liked how you edited down that <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceanic_Flight_815_43fe.html" title="Oceanic Flight 815">Oceanic Flight 815</a> article; so I think you'd be ideal to get the Wikiproject off the ground. Josiah should be tapped for his knowledge of this, as he has helped out with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Doctor_Who_56b3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Doctor Who">Doctor Who WikiProject</a> since September last year.

<p>Hi, B, Just discovered your message; it got "lost" on my talk page. Yes, as you and I foresaw, the separate episode articles <b>did</b> get made, which I just started reading through. It looks like this major addition is being ignored at the moment by most Lost editors. There's a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Lost_episodes_b415.html" title="Talk:List of Lost episodes">discussion about integrating the new content</a> into main articles, among those who put together the individual pages, but this doesn't appear to include the main article editors. I suspect this will come to a head when someone decides to "fix" the Episodes of Lost season summaries by either replacing it with the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Lost_episodes_f69f.html" title="List of Lost episodes">List of Lost episodes</a> or by pointing the shortened summaries to the individual pages. I don't think the short summaries, which you worked so hard to kick-start, are going to survive. Folks will have to take the veritable bull by the horns and (grudgingly) admit that individual episode synopses are going to be part of the "Lost Project" -- even though no one has (yet) organized such as a formal Wikiproject. Willing to head up the charge for it again? If so, as Hurley might say, I've totally got your back, dude. Hope you return from Wiki-break soon, and in one piece! -<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 17:29, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi! I'm happy to hear that you've re-energized. I completely agree that editing can get draining, particularly when dealing with what appear to be neophyte Wikipedia users. As Dan has pointed out in his unique way above, a number of newly minted editors have swooped in on the <i>Lost</i> articles during your absence to make all sort of ahem...unusual additions. Nature abhors a vacuum, after all. I'm afraid I've come off a bit pedantic with some of them, and caused an uproar in <a href="../../../e/p/i/Talk%7EEpisodes_of_Lost_%28Season_2%29_dd89.html" title="Talk:Episodes of Lost (Season 2)">Talk:Episodes of Lost (Season 2)</a> regarding the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Talk%7EEpisodes_of_Lost_%28Season_2%29_dd89.html#Is_the_computer_an_Apple_II.3F" title="Talk:Episodes of Lost (Season 2)">verifiability of the "computer" as an Apple II</a>. But the greatest issue, of course, was as you foresaw: how to handle the sudden "duplicate" episode guides. I do think your views on the matter would be extremely helpful <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Lost_episodes_b415.html" title="Talk:List of Lost episodes">in the ongoing discussion</a>. I've written to one of the new editors, <a href="../../../b/l/d/User_talk%7EBldxyz_c7d3.html" title="User talk:Bldxyz">Bldxyz</a>, who had posted a long list of ways that I came off badly. I pointed out on that user's talk page about your proposed Wikiproject. I'm fully in support of it, but as noted on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiproject.html" title="Wikiproject">Wikiproject</a> page, there would need to be at least 5-10 people committed to make it happen. One thing we might consider is how much of what we have (or plan to have) duplicates the efforts of <a href="http://www.Lostpedia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.Lostpedia.com" rel="nofollow">Lostpedia</a>. On the flip side, our restrictions on speculation do make the <i>Lost</i> articles on WP well-linked around the Web. --<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 01:17, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
