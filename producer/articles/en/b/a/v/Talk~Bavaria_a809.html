<p>I concur this article is misleading and very bias in several ways. There is no clear explanation (culture and history) between Franconians and Bavarians or let alone the Bohemians, Swabians, and Upper Palatinate. Apparently the Bohemians were expelled and resettled into Bavaria? Multiculturalism and co-existence (they really think everyone is catholic) what about Protestants and god forbid Hindus, or Moslems; woe auslander! Big issue in Munich, the Moslems want to build a big mosque, woe auslander! What about separation of state and church? The state collects levy for the church (the pope) is this true and worthy to be mentioned? What about the Gay King Louise II? Is anyone going into more detail? Ludwig and his lover, King Ludwig and Richard Wagner. Who cares about the Socialist party (SPD) the Pope party (CSU), and the Eco Communists (Green) in the state senate what about Bavaria and what it means?</p>
<p>I have been to a lot of different places such as Lohr, Wurzburg, Aschaffenburg, Straubing, Weiden, Regensburg, Munchen, Spitzing, Augsburg and a few more. Very bad service about everywhere – I really think they don’t know what service is-ever gone to a baker and order a bread at 1755HRS (5:55PM) in Bavaria? Ever experienced what it means to be a roach or a rat? How terribly strange this culture wants to be – Free State –shouldn’t it be translated as confederate state? Religious holidays and state mandated blue laws at this time and age. And do not forget 20% sales tax!</p>
<p>Please someone write something about ‘Beamten’ very strange creatures (strangely Nosferatu comes to mind very unsettling) I think they have been trained to be disagreeable and inapt – go to Lohr and park in the “sectioned” parking lot near the hospital and try to locate the machine for paying a ‘parkschine’. Notice all these Verboten! Earn yourself a ticket and very strange forms to be presented to your bank for payment. Imagine Chase or Wachovia Bank with an ‘Uberwisung’ – ever heard of it? Have you ever paid a ticket in Bavaria; world class slapstick in the Rathouse – No Credit Card, Debit Card, or checks – Du mus zalen uberwisung!!! Wo sin wir den da! Why isn’t there a Tourist Section with Visiting Bavaria for Dummies?</p>
<p>Bavaria is very picturesque for a day, but someone please write about the backwardness, stupidity, and rudeness, plus the smoking in the restaurants – unbearable! Interestingly even the Italians complain about the foul stench in the “gastwirtschaften” and the Irish and the French called it disgusting. Anyone with a medical condition or traveling with children should be advised to avoid Bavaria or bring your own canned food and eat it in your vehicle. Ouch I have been too long in Bavaria I have started to complain which is the national pass time activity. Regards, Jay from Chicago/Sidney/Vancouver.</p>
<p>re: Jay yes, i know, it's (hopefully?) a troll, but... <i>Why isn’t there a Tourist Section with Visiting Bavaria for Dummies?</i> because this is an encyclopedia. simple as that. none of what you wrote about "culture" above isn't in any way particular to Bavaria, btw. It's also a nice joke to refer to the Greens as "eco-communists" since in Southern Germany they're rather conservative and centrist compared to other German states. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKato2k6_6e1b.html" title="User:Kato2k6">Kato2k6</a> 01:24, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

It's close to a wonder that this article does not mention "beer". Franconia is the area with the most breweries/km² and Bavarian "Biergärten" (beer gardens) are known and famous at least throughout the whole of Germany. Moreover, is there any other place where one usually drinks beer in 1 liter mugs?&#160;:)</p>
<p>Just wondering. --LostJedi 14:07, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>You better be careful with the BYO in beergardens. In the traditional ones it is ok, and there is also a judgment (maybe 10 years ago) wich says, that if the restaurant calls itself beergarden, there MUST be a place, where you can eat your own food, but usually this places are somewhere in the last corner and you have to get your beer by your own from the counter. Also in the big gardens of munic for exampel they dont like it much....</p>

<p>I heard somewhere that Bavaria is the only state in Germany with the legal right to secede from the Federal Republic if it wants. Is this true? Rhesusman 23:00, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No that is not true. Saxony (Sachsen) is a "Freistaat", too. And the definition of a "Freistaat" is to have the legal right to secede. But this right is of no significance. You cannot compare it to the legal right for Germany e.g. to secede from EU.</p>

<dd>According to <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freistaat" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freistaat" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freistaat</a>, the term "Freistaat" does not imply anything. It is just a traditional name for some of the Bundesländer (Sachsen, Bayern, Thüringen). The term "Freie Stadt" comes from a different, older tradition. Afaik, the German constitution does not handle any of the states in a special way when it comes to secession rights.141.30.217.10 20:16, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Free state" is not about secession but about being a democracy (up to 1918, Bavaria was a kingdom). In this respect, all Bundesländer are free states but most simply call themselves republics. The "Freistaat" article is wrong in assuming that these Free States have <i>any</i> particular relationship to the Federal Republic; such a thing is not allowed/allowable under the <i>Grundgesetz</i> which does not grant special rights to or impose special duties on any particular group of citizens unless these are regional by nature. E.g. schools are a matter of the Bundesländer, but each of them is equally independent, and the highest courts are a Federal matter, to which the citizens of all the Bundesländer are equally subject. -- Sanctacaris, 16.1.2006</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. "Freistaat" is just an obsolete synonyme for "Republic" ("obsolete" in the sense that even many Germans don't understand it correctly). A "Freistaat" is not a state that has more freedoms in the federation compared to other federal states, it's just a state that guarantees certain freedoms to its citizens, i.e. a Republic. The translation to "Free State" is problematic because it has a slightly different meaning or at least additional meanings in English, but Bavaria really doesn't have more autonomy than any other federal state.&#160;;) --62.180.188.21 23:25, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The expression "Freistaat" appeared for the first time after the abdication of the last bavarian king Ludwig III. in November 1918. It was used (and probably designed, too) by the first democratic head of state <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Eisner_554e.html" title="Kurt Eisner">Kurt Eisner</a> to describe the new political situation in the country (as already said before).

<dd>No German state has the right to secede from the Federal Republic, just as no one has the right to do away with the states as the basis of Germany's federal organisation. Free State, as others have said, simply means Republic and was very common a name between the wars. Since Bavaria is one of the few states that has suvived in its substance and most states nowadays simply call themselves "Land" - not "Republic", only Baden ever called itself Republic), the term does however connotate a higher awareness of one's own hisrorical continuity. This is why Saxony adopted the term in 1990. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 14:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article implies that Bavaria was forced into the German Empire in 1866. The article on Ludwig II implies that Bavaria was a charter member in Dec 1870. The article on the German Empire seems to support the Ludwig II version by talking about a North German Federation, and only later becoming the German Empire.</p>
<p>Who is right?</p>

<dd>You may work that out for yourself&#160;:-)&#160;: The German Empire was founded in 1871, after a hiatus of more than sixty years after the dissolution of the "Holy Roman Empire" where there was no Empire at all. -- Sanctacaris</dd>

<p>It needs beefing up. Has huge generalities: eg. Bavaria similar to "Latin" countries (presumably European Latin, not Latin American!) in dress and eating habits (as a Southern Italian, I don't see this, but to a Northern German this distinction is obvious and clear, help the rest of us out here with more specifics). Is it a "Latin" cultural attribute to hold good food and drink in high esteem? Hmmm. There are a lot of pretty rough "redneck" areas in S. Italy that have a pretty crude cuisine, perhaps not too different from the kinds of dishes alluded to as being characteristic of Northern Germany. Interested in knowing if the contributors to this article are "insiders" to the culture (was it written by Bavarians?).--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonobosarenicer_d99e.html" title="User:Bonobosarenicer">bobo</a> 14:56, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The whole ection is a cliché, that back in the 1950s might have been true, but nowadays is for sure obsolete. Of course there are more catholics than protestans in Bavaria due to historical reasons, but i can't see, that the majority is commitet to faith as the article indicates. Same thing with clothing. In fact, if you meet a traditionaly styled person at the oktoberfest, there's more than 1:1 chance, that it's not a bavarian. The food thing: well, historically it's ok to say, that catholic regions tend to enjoy life life and feats. But since faith not that big thing today, this trend has vanished, too. --<a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZinnmann_ece0.html" title="User:Zinnmann">Zinnmann</a> 16:50, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zinnman sums it up precisely: he suggests that the section reeks of cliché, confirming my suspicions. There is an obvious need for a complete reworking of the culture section.

<p><b>Answering the criticisms</b></p>
<p>As author of the section on culture, I wanted to address the issues raised here.</p>
<p>Certainly, in comparing Bavaria to Latin countries I had in mind France, Spain, Italy etc and not mixed cultures as in Latin America.</p>
<p>In my experience of daily life in Hessen (and elsewhere in much of Germany), it is typical for people of all social backgrounds and educational levels to dress very simply. When I previously lived in Bavaria I was concious that people gave a lot of attention to their appearance. Certainly it would be unusual to encounter a German woman outside of Bavaria who would devote the same attention as a native Bavarian to making herself appear sexy. It would be fair to point out that there remarks are subjective, but it is wrong to say that the remarks are based on outdated impressions (the 50s? in those days people were happy to have clothes on their backs..)</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to deal with the criticism of subjectivity. Perhaps if I worked in marketing for a cosmetics or clothing company, I would have statistics readily at hand. Frankly though, I'm surprised by the objection. Anyone who strolls down the Maximillianstrasse in Munich will notices that women (and men as well) dress very differently than, say, in downtown Braunschweig. The differing values attached to personal appearance remains valid even though (as I am told above) a person wearing <i>Trachten</i> at the Oktoberfest is as likely as not to be a disguised American&#160;;-).</p>
<p>About food - here the criticism seems to agree with me that Bavarians put more care into and get more satisfaction out of eating than other Germans. This time the complaint is that I have unjustifiably elevated the cuisine of the Mezzogiorno. That could be true, but it's beside the point. The point of the article was to compare Bavarians with other Germans and not to compare them with other Europeans! Perhaps I should make that clearer in the text though.</p>
<p>Finally, if someone thinks that religion has ceased to play a role in influencing social attitudes in Bavaria, I would invite them to try to find an all day school anywhere in the Free State. They don't exist! And why should they, when the prevalent (Bavarian Catholic supported) attitude is that women's horizons are properly limited to <i>Kinder, Kirche, Kuche</i>?</p>

<dd>Hi Philopedia, after reading your comments I'm not quite sure if we are talking about the same Bavaria. Actually i'm from Munich but i used to live in Stuttgart, Düsseldorf and Kassel too. On average there isn't that big differene in clothing and appearance. Since you mentioned Maximillianstraße (one of the most expensive and exclusive streets in Munich) I reckon that your your observations may be biased towards a specific clientel.</dd>
<dd>Regarding "Social behaviour" i don't think that the average Bavarian can be considered as overwhelming folksy. On the contrary: For non-locals it's quite hard to get into a talk in a pub. Totally different than e.g. in Cologne.</dd>
<dd>All day schools aren't the standard model throughout Germany. That's not a spefic Bavarian peculiarity. Since the <a href="../../../p/i/s/PISA_07b1.html" title="PISA">PISA</a>-debate of 2000 there have been numerous demands to establish more all day schools. An effort that is vigorously supported by most CSU politicians. Kinder, Kirche, Küche? =:-) Well, that IS the 50s. (Though - if i can trust my grandma - people used wear clothes back than. And if i can trust my grandpa, they then had a feeling of decency when it comes to your wardrobe.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZinnmann_ece0.html" title="User:Zinnmann">Zinnmann</a> 13:41, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Zinnmann</i>,</p>
<p>Thanks for your well formulated objections. I appreciate that your background and knowledge. I suspect our differing outlook is likely the result of differing approaches to engaging our environment. I am satisfied that we each had a fair chance to put our views forward and have them understood. Short of travelling together through Bavaria and exchanging observations I am think we have completed our due diligence and can in good conscience agree to disagree. The question remains: how to proceed with the article? You've been very considerate to defer changes up until now. Are there any specific changes you feel would do justice to both our views?</p>

<dd>Well, i would suggest to render the historical context more prominent. It's true that Bavaria is traditionally very catholic and conservative, though the religious aspects really are fading away. That would allow to link politics, religion, and food to a common source. On the other hand i recommend to remove the appearance-text. It just isn't correct. Maybe we can replace it with a short notion of "Trachten" and the widespread but nevertheless misleading cliché of every bavaria hanging around in Lederhosen or Dirndl. Is that ok for you? Best wishes &amp; happy new year! --<a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZinnmann_ece0.html" title="User:Zinnmann">Zinnmann</a> 09:38, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been living in different locations in Germany and while there are certainly small local peculiarities, I don't think one can make distinctions like clothing style or care for appearance. I'm all for including obvious things like traditional clothing or local food, but more in a "trivia" kind of way and not as prominent (= first paragraph) as it is now. It's also a bit confusing for people outside of Germany since there really is no point of reference for them. Another problem I'd like to address is that Bayern consists of many cultural backgrounds. Not just the differnece between big cities and smaller towns, but I'd say there is a quite a difference between the Franconia region around Nuremberg, the Swabian part around Augsburg/Neu-Ulm and the Allgäu region in the south. I commend you for your work Philopedia, but I think you should focus more on describing historical/cultural "oddities"&#160;;-) without the influence of personal experiences or stereotypes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Maybe some notes from Germany (i.e. Bavaria&#160;;) ) on this. As I read the part <i>Many people in the northern part of Bavaria see themselves as Franconians and do therefore not like to be called "Bavarians". They have a separate dialect and don't wear typical Bavarian clothing.</i> I started laughing. Oh, well, I live in Franconia for quite a while now, but pay numerous visits to the Bavarian capital of Munich. I also know some people in Passau whom I visit very often. First of all, it is true that a greater number Bavarian people is religious. Also true, most of them are considered conservative. Bavarians are also very fond of their country, and Franconians sometimes decline to be Bavarians, as well as Bavarians sometimes say Franconia is not Bavaria.&#160;;)</p>
<p>What I want to emphasize here is the "greater number" and "most of them". Many things are changing in Germany, and also Bavaria gets mixed up with other cultures and global thinking. Especially towns like Munich, which do certainly have a certain distinct style, tend to open up. Munich is a modern business city where lots of non-Bavarian or "normal" Bavarian people live.</p>
<p>The culture section must therefore make clear that not all inhabitants are a "stereotype" Bavarian being religiously fanatic and wearing leather pants...</p>
<p>Especially the clothing section I don't understand. I was born and raised in Hesse, and I found no considerable change in clothing style between Hesse and Bavaria. Ok, you can argue, I now live in Franconia, where people don't dress like the "usual" Bavarian - but how comes I never spotted a difference in Nuremberg, Munich, Passau, Regensburg, the Allgäu, Berchtesgaden, ....? So please leave that out unless you find a citeable document proving that.</p>
<p>And distinguish between "Trachten" and "clothing"&#160;:)</p>
<p>Greetings from Nuremburg, LJ, April 20, 2006</p>
<p>I am a rookie when it comes to Bavarian culture, so it would be appreciated if there were an article about "Bavarian Culture" that not only compares and contrasts Bavarian and non-Bavarian but also describes in further detail what defines Bavarian culture.</p>

<p>I take issue with the following recent text change in the Bavaria article:</p>
<p>Bavarians are typically very conservative Catholics, <i>contrasting markedly with the traditionally protestant and increasingly secular majority in in the rest of Germany.</i></p>
<p>1) At least one other German state has a make up similar to Bavaria. Baden-Wurtemburg (completely Catholic and quite conservative). There are also other states with a very significant Catholic make up.</p>
<p>In fact, many locations in Germany at one time were either purely Catholic or purely Protestant (the population having adopted the perspective of the local ruler). This situation changed with the very large number of refugees were resettled following the second world war.</p>
<p>2) The perspective, shared by many US Americans, that Europe (including Germany) is a secular society is misleading. Although it is true that few Germans are regular churchgoers, the presumption that Germans are against religion is unquestionable erroneous. In fact, the religious/secular antagonism that so characteristic of the American social climate is completely absent here. Consider:</p>
<p>In Germany, there is no strong separation between church and state: Church leaders sit on media boards deciding programming, children are taught about religion in school, and religion is popular. More than 75% of Germans make a major financial contribution to a church. Churches are maintained in good condition, and there is a very general sentiment of respect for church and it's role in history.</p>
<p>I am therefore reverting the text. Perhaps you will see things otherwise. If so, I will look forward to learning why you hold those views.</p>

<dd>Dear Philopedia, I am afraid that I have to correct your first point: The Rhineland is as ardently Catholic (with a capital C) as Bavaria, whereas Baden-Württemberg is mostly Protestant, in particular in the eastern part (Württemberg) but also in places such as Heidelberg, where I remember very clearly that in my class there were 3 catholics and 21 protestants! But certainly, Catholicism is a characteristic trait of Bavarian culture, even though its influence may be waning (which is difficult to ascertain or quantify anyway). -- Sanctacaris</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sanctacaris: actually, Baden-Wuerttemberg (and Heidelberg in particular) have almost equal-sized denominations with a slight Catholic majority. statistics for <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heidelberg.html" title="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> (see statistics link somewhere there) cite about 35% protestants vs about 40% catholics. the overall situation in Baden-Wuerttemberg is similar, something like 45:40 for Catholics in general. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKato2k6_6e1b.html" title="User:Kato2k6">Kato2k6</a> 21:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, there IS a Bavarian Citizenship Article (making e.g. everyone born in Bavaria a Bavarian citizen) under the Bavarian State Constitution (which is also legal under the federal constitution).

<p>Can anyone enlighten me about this? Does anyone know anything about Bavaria and its standing two centuries ago, three, four? The plight of the people of Bavaria before settlement? I'd really be interested. I'd also like to know more about Bavaria joining Germany and Austria not being a part of it. I have friends from Bavaria who still speak of Bavaria as a repressed state, with Austro-Bavarian, or the Bavarian language having no official status because of the influential Low German etc. There seems to be no page telling of Bavaria's developments since early Germanic settlement.

<p>The name "Bayern" was not given by the roman. This is the name of there living nation since the fall of the roman empire - sorry for my english. But today there live three nations in Bayern. The Bayern in the south-east, Schwaben( in culture an language to Baden-Würtenberg and Schweiz) the Franken in the north. They all have a own language and culture, but Bayern its not like Germany a Federation. The non bavarian parts of bavaria are take by war with other german nations.</p>
<p>"Austro-Bavarian"? tell an Austrian he's Bavarian, or a Bavarian he's Austrian, and he'll laugh you in the face. The Bavarian language is a dialect of High German, and has no official status like <i>all</i> other German dialects. Low German is a minority language (and not a dialect of High German, which is the official German language) spoken on the North Sea coast only, and only has a "protected" status as such itself. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKato2k6_6e1b.html" title="User:Kato2k6">Kato2k6</a> 22:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Under Miscellaneous, Albert Einstein is listed under the profession of "physician". I am not aware of his ever having been a practicing physician, so I can only suppose that the editor of that section was confused between physcian (someone practicing clinical medicine) and physicist (someone specializing in physics).

<p>Hi! I was wondering what everyone else thinks of the "Sights" section. Personally, while the pictures are lovely, I don't believe the section adds much encyclopedic value to the article.

I could be wrong and I know rather little about Bavaria, so I'm disinclined to make any ((more)) changes, especially without any input from others. I think perhaps some of these historic sites (which have their own articles) could be mentioned in the article and anyone with interest could see them by clicking on their wikilinks.
