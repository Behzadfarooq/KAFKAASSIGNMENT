<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldrick.html" title="Edit section: Character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character</span></h2>
<p>Intelligent or not, Baldrick is always one for inventing "cunning plans", which are generally ridiculed by Blackadder, who nevertheless ends up using them. Though Baldrick is now famed for his "cunning plans", the actual catchphrase was not regularly used until the third series, with Blackadder saying it once in the first series and Baldrick claiming to have "a plan" in a "cunning" voice on one occasion in the second series. In the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodbyeee....html" title="Goodbyeee...">final episode</a> of the last series, <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackadder.html#Series_4:_Blackadder_Goes_Forth" title="Blackadder">Blackadder Goes Forth</a></i>, Baldrick announces he has a cunning plan that might just save them from "<a href="../../../g/o/i/Going_over_the_top.html" title="Going over the top">going over the top</a>". His plan seems to revolve around Blackadder purposefully injuring himself on a large splinter on the trench ladder. The plan seems one of his saner ideas, but is dismissed by Blackadder, perhaps realising he cannot postpone going into battle (and certain death) indefinitely. Other traits shared by all Baldricks (except possibly the first one) are sheer disgustingness and an obsession with <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnip.html" title="Turnip">turnips</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediaeval.html" title="Mediaeval">mediaeval</a> Baldrick was probably the only Baldrick of the four who could really be described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had worked very hard to get - earlier jobs include milking <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig.html" title="Pig">pigs</a> and mucking out <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprosy.html" title="Leprosy">lepers</a>), first met <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Edmund_%28Blackadder%29_6e09.html" title="Prince Edmund (Blackadder)">Prince Edmund</a> at the feast before the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bosworth_Field_0ad8.html" title="Battle of Bosworth Field">Battle of Bosworth Field</a>. The two, along with <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Percy_Percy_c5df.html" title="Lord Percy Percy">Lord Percy</a>, toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' lives would be eternally entwined.</p>
<p>Although cleverer than the Prince, Baldrick, knowing his place in the mediaeval pecking-order, holds him in awe. He often leads cheers in the Prince's honour (along with Lord Percy, who tries hard to join in), fills his head with illusions of grandeur, and often ends up doing his dirty work. This included carrying the decapitated body of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_of_England_e98b.html" title="Richard III of England">Richard III</a> and sleeping with the Spanish Infanta, Edmund's <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianc%C3%A9e.html" title="Fiancée">fiancée</a>, so that Edmund didn't have to. The latter task resulted in several injuries, including a seriously blackened eye. When Baldrick is abandoned by Edmund in the final episode, a tear falls from his eye.</p>
<p>This Baldrick also has cunning plans that, contrary to most of the "cunning plans" of his descendants, mostly work, although they often initially seem ridiculous (and sometimes get messed up due to the actions of Lord Percy). For instance, when Edmund seeks to kill Dougal McAngus, Baldrick suggests that he gets an enormous great cannon, takes McAngus outside, makes him stick his head down the cannon and then blow it off. Edmund scoffs at this, and instead tries to kill McAngus using several different "cunning plans" of his own. After having failed miserably with all of these, he resorts to using Baldricks original plan, which works.</p>
<p>It was this Baldrick who suggested the title 'The Black Adder' for Prince Edmund (Edmund wanted to be called 'The Black Vegetable'), which his descendants later adopted as a surname.</p>
<p>The "clever" Baldrick character was ditched after the first series, becoming steadily more imbecilic with each incarnation.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> Baldrick is the servant and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Serfdom">bondsman</a>, rather than a friend, to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Blackadder_30d5.html" title="Lord Blackadder">Lord Blackadder</a>, who mistreats him, and, Baldrick claims, at first tried to kill him. He has a bedroom in Blackadder's house, but has also been forced to sleep in the gutter and on the roof. He has a tendency to eat dung. Baldrick has been in Lord Edmund's service longer than either of them care to remember. Yet although his master treats him with the sort of contempt reserved for lepers, he remains intensely loyal.</p>
<p>This Baldrick, whilst perhaps not as dim as his descendants, is far stupider than the original. A kindly soul, Baldrick's lack of formal education is compensated for by his basic streetwise cunning. While his 'cunning plans' do sometimes have a strange, twisted and often perverse logic and cunning to them (one suggestion was that Blackadder repay his debts by making money as a male <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitute</a>, another is to disguise a 'mad, wild, killer bull' as a rooster and enter it in a <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockfight.html" title="Cockfight">cockfight</a>), he does possess an entertaining level of stupidity. In one episode, Blackadder attempts to teach Baldrick how to add. Baldrick's conclusions, which include 'two beans plus two beans equals some beans', 'two beans plus two beans equals three beans... and that one' and 'two beans plus two beans makes a very small <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casserole.html" title="Casserole">casserole</a>', lead Blackadder to comment 'to you, Baldrick, the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> was just something that happened to <i>other people</i>, wasn't it?' He did, however, figure out the equation in the middle of a later conversation.</p>
<p>It was also in this series that the first signs of Baldrick's love of turnips was shown, in the episode 'Beer', where he and Percy famously discover a turnip shaped like a 'thingy'. Baldrick later describes the incident as 'triffic'. He is particularly delighted by the discovery, because it contrasts with his own 'thingy' which is shaped like a turnip. In the same episode Baldrick reveals his recipe for <b>Turnip Surprise</b> - "the surprise is&#160;: there's nothing in it except the turnip". He is amazed when Blackadder points out that the Turnip Surprise is in fact simply a turnip.</p>
<p>Baldrick once went on an 'all mouse diet' by hanging a piece of cheese off of the end of his nose and lying with his mouth open, hoping that mice would scurry in. He later tried the same thing, with a mouse on the end of his nose to catch a cat, for variety.</p>
<p>Baldrick was also <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridesmaid.html" title="Bridesmaid">bridesmaid</a> at Lord Blackadder's abortive wedding. "<a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_%28Blackadder_character%29_806b.html" title="Elizabeth I (Blackadder character)">Queenie</a>" kept him as a pet, calling him Lassie (Baldrick did not complain) and he stuck two pencils up his nose, so that he could attend a Royal <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fancy_dress_party.html" title="Fancy dress party">fancy dress party</a> as a pencil case.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the sole triumph of this Baldrick was noticing that the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mangroves.html" title="Mangroves">mangroves</a> and flowing <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lava.html" title="Lava">lava</a> probably meant that Captain Redbeard Rum hadn't, after all, berthed his ship in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton.html" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>; however, a counter-argument exists that he can also be acclaimed for actually being able to tell the difference between a head and a foot, unlike future Baldricks, such as the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_period_in_British_history_1dad.html" title="Georgian period in British history">Georgian</a> version.</p>

<p>The Baldrick of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Regency_358b.html" title="English Regency">Regency Britain</a> works as an <i>underscrogsman</i> (apprentice dogsbody) to <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._E._Blackadder_c026.html" title="Mr. E. Blackadder">Mr. E. Blackadder</a> esq., butler to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George_%28Blackadder_character%29_d99e.html" title="Prince George (Blackadder character)">Prince George</a>. He lives in a pipe in the upstairs water closet of the Palace.</p>
<p>The third Baldrick is much more noticeably stupid and disgusting than those previous to him. Like his <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_era.html" title="Elizabethan era">Elizabethan</a> ancestor, he is known to eat dung occasionally. He is also more childlike; when asked if he has any distinguishing features, referring to his nose he asserts, "I've got this huge growth in the middle of my face." There is not the slightest sign of 'cunning' in any of his plans, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>escaping the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillotine.html" title="Guillotine">guillotine</a> by waiting until your head has been cut off, then 'springing into action' and running 'around and around the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnyard.html" title="Barnyard">farmyard</a>, and out the farmyard gate', in the style of a chicken, and</li>
<li>replacing the burnt first copy of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Johnson_4852.html" title="Samuel Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>'s <a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language_68d7.html" title="A Dictionary of the English Language">dictionary</a> by taking the string, which has been salvaged, and putting in some new pages. Blackadder clarifies that Baldrick is suggesting that he re-write the entire dictionary in a single night. Blackadder attempts this anyway, before getting stuck at "<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aardvark.html" title="Aardvark">aardvark</a>".</li>
</ul>
<p>Blackadder also claims that Baldrick has never changed his trousers, and implores him never to do so, for they are, Blackadder claims, akin to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandora%27s_Box_be78.html" title="Pandora's Box">Pandora's Box</a>.</p>
<p>Although he is now on a closer social standing to Blackadder than before, he still receives the same level of abuse as his Elizabethan ancestor. Edmund punches him; kicks him; breaks a milk-jug over his head; smashes a huge turnip on his head; roasts him for a few minutes on a spit; grabs him by the shirt collar; threatens to cut him up into strips and tell the prince that he walked over a very sharp cattle grid in an extremely heavy hat; and promises five minutes of hellish <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">tortures</a> involving a small pencil equalling anything possible from <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Beelzebub</a>.</p>
<p>However, despite his noticeable disabilities, this Baldrick has more success than any of the others. In an election rigged by Blackadder, he is elected <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">MP</a> for Dunny-on-the-Wold, a <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotten_borough.html" title="Rotten borough">rotten borough</a>, although he was intended to be a puppet for Blackadder to manipulate. He is later made a <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord.html" title="Lord">Lord</a> by Prince George, and is, therefore, eligible to sit in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> (although whether or not he ever does so is another matter, and as he is never again referred to by his title after episode 1, it seems plausible that Blackadder persuaded the Prince to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attainder.html" title="Attainder">attaint</a> Baldrick of his peerage). He also succeeds where no Baldrick has succeeded before or since, in calling Blackadder a 'lazy, big nosed, rubber-faced bastard'.</p>
<p>Baldrick spends the £400,000 he received as a Lord on an enormous turnip ("<i>well, I had to haggle.</i>") Blackadder later destroys it by sticking it on Baldrick's head.</p>
<p>Baldrick isn't given any sort of first name until this third series, when he speculates that it might be "Sodoff", since in childhood when he said to the other guttersnipes, "Hello, my name's Baldrick," they would reply, "Yes, we know. Sod off, Baldrick!" A diplomatic Blackadder opts to record him as "S. Baldrick". The initial appears to have been adopted by his descendants.</p>
<p>This particular specimen of Baldrick can also be noted for his definition of <i>dog</i>: "Not a cat" and <i>sea</i>: "Big, blue wobbly thing that mermaids live in". His command with words is also demonstrated in his "<i>magnificent octopus</i>" (<a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnum_opus.html" title="Magnum opus">magnum opus</a>), a semi-autobiographical work that goes as so:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Once upon a time there was a lovely little <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sausage.html" title="Sausage">sausage</a> called Baldrick. And it lived happily ever after.</i>"</dd>

<p>His heroes are the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highwayman.html" title="Highwayman">highwayman</a> <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Hardwood_fd38.html" title="Amy Hardwood">'The Shadow'</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scarlet_Pimpernel_f9a9.html" title="The Scarlet Pimpernel">The Scarlet Pimpernel</a> (or "Scarlet Pimple" as Baldrick believes his name to be). The former was executed as a result of Blackadder's informing, and the latter was poisoned by him.</p>
<p>This Baldrick grew up in a "haunted hovel", in which a vile, disgusting apparition would slowly make its way into his parents' bed at night. Curiously, this phantom vanished the very day Baldrick left home. We are to assume that Baldrick killed his own mother. His cunning plan was to chop his mother's head off to solve the problem of her low ceiling.</p>

While still stupid, it seems that having to work for the exceedingly naïve Mr Blackadder has forced him to develop some of the savvy of his earlier ancestors. He remains the only person to be fooled by Tiny Tom Scratchit's alleged lameness, however. He is also possibly the only person to spell "<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>" without getting <i>any</i> of the letters right (he initially renders the word as "Kwelfnuve", but strikes it through, correcting it to "Kweznuz").</p>

<p>Private Baldrick is a soldier in a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> trench, serving under <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Blackadder_237c.html" title="Captain Blackadder">Captain Blackadder</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_The_Honourable_George_Colthurst_St._Bartleigh_5600.html" title="Lieutenant The Honourable George Colthurst St. Bartleigh">Lieutenant George</a>. His hero is <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Flashheart_7175.html" title="Lord Flashheart">Lord Flashheart</a>.</p>
<p>Equally as disgusting as the third Baldrick, Private Baldrick is, without a doubt, the stupidest of the Baldrick <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty.html" title="Dynasty">dynasty</a> to date. His 'cunning plans' verge on those of an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insane.html" title="Insane">insane</a> person. Examples include carving his name on a bullet, in relation to the old saying 'a bullet with your name on it', his explanation being that if he owns the bullet, it won't ever kill him as he won't ever shoot himself ('shame' comments Captain Blackadder), and the chances of there being two bullets with 'Baldrick' on them are 'very small indeed'.</p>
<p>In the first episode, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Cook_%28Blackadder%29_a7fb.html" title="Captain Cook (Blackadder)"><i>Captain Cook</i></a>, he claims to be the first Baldrick in the entire family tree to have a brilliant plan, giving a speech saying, 'Permission to write home immediately sir! This is the first good plan a Baldrick's ever had. For centuries we've tried, and they've always turned out total pig swill! My mum will be pleased as punch." This was after Blackadder said his plan to get out of the trenches through cookery was indeed a brilliant plan, but with the slight flaw that Baldrick was 'the worst cook in the entire world'.</p>
<p>Private Baldrick's hobbies include <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookery.html" title="Cookery">cookery</a>, his specialities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Rat au Van</i> (a rat that's been run over by a van),</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../f/i/l/Filet_mignon.html" title="Filet mignon">Filet mignon</a></i> in <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauce_Bearnaise_1127.html" title="Sauce Bearnaise">Sauce Bearnaise</a> (dog turds covered in glue),</li>
<li>Plum duff (a mole hill decorated in rabbit droppings),</li>
<li>Cream <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custard.html" title="Custard">custard</a> (cat's vomit), and</li>
<li>Coffee (hot mud), with milk (spit), sugar (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Dandruff.html" title="Dandruff">dandruff</a>) and rather dubious 'chocolate sprinkles'.</li>
<li>Apple crumble which contains fish</li>
<li>More rat; Sauté, which involves:
<ul>
<li>taking the freshly shaved rat and marinading it in a puddle until it is drowned</li>
<li>stretching it out under a hot lightbulb</li>
<li>getting within dashing distance of a latrine</li>
<li>wolfing it down!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rat fricassé, which is the same as above, but a slightly <i>bigger</i> rat.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Baldrick is also a poet. His greatest poem is, without a doubt, 'The German Guns'. The words are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Boom, Boom, Boom,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Boom, Boom, Boom</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Baldrick was particularly surprised when Captain Blackadder guessed the final line.</p>
<p>During his time in the trenches, Baldrick also wrote a second poem; the words are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hear the words I sing,</i></dd>
<dd><i>War's a horrid thing,</i></dd>
<dd><i>So I sing sing sing...</i></dd>
<dd><i>...ding-a-ling-a-ling.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Blackadder commented that "it started badly, it tailed off a little in the middle and the less said about the end the better-but apart from that it was excellent."</p>
<p>Baldrick also does a fantastic <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Chaplin_96fc.html" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> impression (although some believe it to be a <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slug.html" title="Slug">slug</a> balancing act).</p>
<p>The opening sequence to each episode of series 4 features a ceremonial parade in which the company led by Captain Blackadder marches past General Melchett on a reviewing stand. Baldrick appears as part of the regimental band, splendid in scarlet and blue full dress, but playing that most unmartial of instruments: a triangle.</p>
<p>Despite his stupidity, Private Baldrick (however inadvertently) delivers the most profound speech of the lot. In preparation for 'the final push', tension is high, and Baldrick demands, "Why can't we just stop sir? Why can't we just say 'no more killing, let's all go home'? Why would it be stupid just to pack it in, sir? Why?" Neither Captain Blackadder nor <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_%28Blackadder_character%29_06d1.html" title="George (Blackadder character)">Lieutenant George</a> are able to come up with a good answer. In the fourth series of Blackadder, the character of Baldrick does take on something of a deeper meaning, as an innocent victim of the terrible slaughter of the first world war.</p>
<p>Private Baldrick never got to tell the audience his final 'cunning plan' to escape the trenches, as he is sent over the top before he can reveal it to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Blackadder_237c.html" title="Captain Blackadder">Captain Blackadder</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_%28Blackadder_character%29_06d1.html" title="George (Blackadder character)">Lieutenant George</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Darling_c226.html" title="Kevin Darling">Captain Darling</a> (although it might have involved a rusty nail he noticed on a trench ladder). It is believed that Private S. Baldrick was killed going 'over the top' in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>.</p>

His first appearance is serving Blackadder's <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">millennium</a> dinner, which he does wearing nothing but an amusing apron, on a whim. His cooking is similar to Private Baldrick's; he prepared dinner by coughing over an avocado. His underpants may date from the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, or in any case smell as though they do, and turn out to be the cause of the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extinction.html" title="Extinction">extinction</a> of the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a>. Rather surprisingly he builds a working <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time machine</a>, making him "the greatest genius who ever lived." Or it would do, if he knew <i>how</i> it worked. Following his master's rewriting of history, he becomes <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a> - and possibly <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a>, as the television commentator observes that <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election.html" title="Election">elections</a> have been abolished (although how much power he has with Edmund as king is questionable).</p>
<p>Also, Legionary Baldricus is a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Army_923a.html" title="Roman Army">soldier</a> under Centurion Blacaddicus in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Britain_2a7f.html" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a> section of <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Blackadder%7E_Back_%26_Forth_846d.html" title="Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth">Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth</a></i>.
