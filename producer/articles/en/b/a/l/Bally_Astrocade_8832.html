	    <p>The <b>Astrocade</b> is an early video game console and simple computer system designed by a team at <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midway_Games_ce99.html" title="Midway Games">Midway</a>, the <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videogame.html" title="Videogame">videogame</a> division of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Bally.html" title="Bally">Bally</a>. It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market. The rights were later picked up by a third-party company, who re-released it and sold it until around 1983. The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities, which were rendered impossible to access by Bally engineers.</p>

<p>Originally referred to as the <b>Bally Home Library Computer</b>, it was released in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> but available only through mail order. Delays in the production meant none of the units actually shipped until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, and by this time the machine had been renamed the <b>Bally Professional Arcade</b>. In this form it sold mostly at computer stores and had little retail exposure (unlike the <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_2600.html" title="Atari 2600">Atari VCS</a>). In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> Bally grew less interested in the arcade market and decided to sell off their Consumer Products Division, including development and production of the game console.</p>
<p>At about the same time a 3rd party group had been unsuccessfully attempting to bring their own console design to market as the <b>Astrovision</b>. A corporate buyer from <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Ward_3457.html" title="Montgomery Ward">Montgomery Ward</a> who was in charge of the Bally system put the two groups in contact, and a deal was eventually arranged. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> they re-released the unit with the BASIC cartridge included for free, this time known as the <b>Bally Computer System</b>, and then changed the name again in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> to <b>Astrocade</b>. It sold under this name until the <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_crash_of_1983.html" title="Video game crash of 1983">video game crash of 1983</a>, and then disappeared around <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>
<p>Midway had long been planned to release an expansion system for the unit, known as the <b>ZGRASS-100</b>. The system was being developed by a group of computer artists at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign_5af2.html" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois</a> known as the <i>Circle Graphics Habitat</i>, along with programmers at Nutting. Midway felt that such a system, in an external box, would make the Astrocade more interesting to the market. However it was still not ready for release when Bally sold off the division. A small handful may have been produced as the <b>ZGRASS-32</b> after the machine was re-released by Astrovision.</p>
<p>The system, combined into a single box, would eventually be released as the <a href="../../../d/a/t/Datamax_UV-1_ddb1.html" title="Datamax UV-1">Datamax UV-1</a>. Aimed at the home computer market while being designed, the machine was now re-targeted as a system for outputting high-quality graphics to video tape. These were offered for sale some time between 1980 and 1982, but it is unknown how many were built.</p>
<p><a name="Description" id="Description"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Bally_Astrocade_8832.html" title="Edit section: Description">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Description</span></h2>
<p>In the late 1970s Midway contracted <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Nutting_Associates_fdc1.html" title="Dave Nutting Associates">Dave Nutting Associates</a> to design a video display chip that could be used in all of their videogame systems, from standup <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcade_game.html" title="Arcade game">arcade games</a>, to a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">home computer</a> system. The system Nutting delivered remains perhaps the most powerful graphics system of the 8-bit generation, and was used in most of Midway's classic arcade games of the era, including <b><a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorf.html" title="Gorf">Gorf</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_of_Wor_ba6d.html" title="Wizard of Wor">Wizard of Wor</a></b>.</p>
<p>The basic systems were powered by a <a href="../../../z/i/l/Zilog_Z80_0c2d.html" title="Zilog Z80">Zilog Z80</a> driving the display chip with a <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_Access_Memory_609b.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a> buffer in between the two. The display chip had two modes, a low-resolution mode at 160 x 102, and a high-resolution mode at 320 x 204, both with 2-bits per pixel for four colors. This sort of color/resolution was normally beyond the capabilities of RAM of the era, which could not read out the data fast enough to keep up with the TV display. The chip used a clever trick to work around this problem, technically "holding the RAS high", allowing them to read one "line" at a time at very high speed into a buffer inside the display chip. The line could then be read out to the screen at a more leisurely rate, while also interfering less with the CPU, which was also trying to use the same memory.</p>
<p>Sadly, on the Astrocade the pins needed to use this "trick" were not connected. Thus the Astrocade system was left with just the lower resolution 160 x 102 mode. In this mode the system used up 160 x 102 x 2bits = 4080 bytes of memory to hold the screen. Since the machine had only 4k of RAM, this left very little room left over for the program's use, which was used for things like holding the score, or game options. The rest of the program would have to be placed in <a href="../../../r/e/a/Read_only_memory.html" title="Read only memory">ROM</a>.</p>
<p>The Astrocade used color <a href="../../../p/r/o/Processor_register.html" title="Processor register">registers</a>, or <i>color indirection</i> as it was often referred to then, so the four colors could be picked from a palette of 256 colors. Color animation was possible by changing the values of the registers, and using a <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horizontal_blank_interrupt.html" title="Horizontal blank interrupt">horizontal blank interrupt</a> you could change them from line to line. An additional set of four color registers could be "swapped in" at any point along the line, allowing you to create two "halves" of the screen, split vertically. Originally intended to allow you to easily create a "score area" on the side of the screen, clever programmers used this feature to emulate 8 color modes.</p>
<p>Unlike the VCS, the Astrocade did not include hardware <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29.html" title="Sprite (computer graphics)">sprite</a> support. It did, however, include a <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitter.html" title="Blitter">blitter</a>-like system and software to drive it. Memory above 0x4000 was dedicated to the display, and memory below that to the ROM. If a program wrote to the ROM space (normally impossible, it's "read only" after all) the video chip would take the data, apply a function to it, and then copy the result into the corresponding location in the RAM. Which function to use was stored in a register in the display chip, and included common instructions like XOR and bit-shift. This allowed the Astrocade to support any number of "sprites" independent of hardware, with the downside that it was up to the software to re-draw them when they moved.</p>
<p>The Astrocade was one of the early cartridge-based systems, using cartridges known as <i>Videocades</i> that were designed to be as close in size and shape as possible to a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassette_tape.html" title="Cassette tape">cassette tape</a>. The unit also included two games built into the ROM, Gunfight and Checkmate, along with the simple but useful Calculator and a "doodle" program called Scribbling.</p>
<p>The Astrocade featured a relatively complex input device incorporating several types of control mechanisms: the controller was shaped as a pistol-style grip with trigger switch on the front; a small 4-switch/8-way <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joystick.html" title="Joystick">joystick</a> was placed on top of the grip, and the shaft of the joystick connected to a <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potentiometer.html" title="Potentiometer">potentiometer</a>, meaning that the stick could be rotated to double as a paddle controller. Used in combination this set of controls allowed for more complex interaction with the games than any other game controller of the era. By most reports the controllers were excellent, but had the downside of breaking frequently.</p>
<p>On the front of the unit was a 24-key "hex-pad" keyboard used for selecting games and options. Most cartridges included two games, and when they were inserted the machine would reset and display a menu starting with the programs on the cartridge and then listing the four built-in programs. On the back were a number of ports, including connectors for power, the controllers, and an expansion port. One oddity was that the top rear of the unit was empty, and could be opened to store up to 15 cartridges.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Bally_Astrocade_8832.html" title="Edit section: BASIC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BASIC</span></h2>
<p>The Astrocade also included a <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASIC_programming_language_9140.html" title="BASIC programming language">BASIC programming language</a> cartridge. Supporting BASIC on the system was very difficult, because the display alone used up almost all the available RAM. The solution to this problem was very complex, yet very clever.</p>
<p>BASIC programs were stored in the video RAM by interleaving every <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit.html" title="Bit">bit</a> of the program along with the display itself; BASIC used all the even-numbered bits, and the display got the odd-numbered bits. The <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpreter_%28computer_software%29.html" title="Interpreter (computer software)">interpreter</a> would read out two bytes, drop all the odd-numbered bits, and assemble the results into a single <a href="../../../b/y/t/Byte.html" title="Byte">byte</a> of code. This was rendered invisible by setting two of the colors to be the same as the other two, such that colors <code>01</code> and <code>11</code> would be the same (white), so the presence, or lack, of a bit for BASIC had no effect on the screen. Additional memory was scavenged by using less lines vertically, only 88 instead of the full 102. The end result of all this was to manage to squeeze out 1760 bytes of RAM for BASIC programs. The downside was that most of the graphics system's power was unavailable.</p>
<p>BASIC was programmed, laboriously, though this keyboard by assigning each of the keys a single command, number and several alpha characters. These were selected through a set of 4 colored shift keys. This way you simply typed "WORD"(gold) shift then the "+" key and got <code>GOTO</code>.</p>

<p>The ZGRASS unit sat under the Astrocade and turned it into a "real" computer, including a full keyboard, a math <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-processor.html" title="Co-processor">co-processor</a> (<a href="../../../f/l/o/Floating_point_unit.html" title="Floating point unit">FPU</a>), 32k of RAM, and a new 32k ROM containing the <a href="../../../g/r/a/GRASS_programming_language_dab0.html" title="GRASS programming language">GRASS programming language</a> (sometimes referred to as <b>GRAFIX</b> on this machine). The unit also added I/O ports for a cassette and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">floppy disk</a>, allowing it to be used with <a href="../../../c/p/2F/CP_M_29aa.html" title="CP/M">CP/M</a>.</p>
