<li>Packing. I'm in the process of getting ready to move to Houston on Wednesday... and haven't had time to look at much of anything... pretty much all I'm doing on WIKI right now is checking to make sure nobody has left me any messages and that nobody has vandalized an article I'm watching... I have been noticing the positive reviews of OWU on your page and the OWU page... I want to take a look at it, but I just haven't had a chance... I'll probably print your OWU article to read it on my trip<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 08:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I do, too. For the same reasons that you mentioned. Plus I tried to include red and black in it for the obvious reasons. The problem is when I asked the two editors from the copy editing league, the said that they preferred the older one. Maybe I should put it to vote and see what most people have to say. What do you think? <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaSaltarella_7b57.html" title="User:LaSaltarella">LaSaltarella</a> 07:09, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They may be slightly more "neutral" but if those who look at the cites like the newer one, I'd go with the newer version... the "copy editing league editors" don't have to live with it (EG they aren't paying any attention to it.)<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 07:23, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just had a quick look - what happened to the fabulous lead you had a few weeks ago? It's grown way too long, and it's overreferenced. Except for extraordinary claims, references should be in the body of the article, which should be summarized in the lead. Have a look at <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> - it was better before. It looks now like you're trying to prove something in the lead - the lead should be a stand-alone summary of the article, simple, compelling.</p>
<p>Also unclear what you're doing with the "unknown" references.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind; every single footnote doesn't have to be listed in the References section If you're only quoting a dictionary entry once, just put that directly into the footonte, and leave it out of References. References is for *main* references or sources that are used over and over - sources used only once or twice can just be listed directly in the Footnotes - the reader doesn't need to look two places to see a simple dictionary ref. Will check more later. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 02:02, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the feedback... I went back and found an older version of the intro and modified it... I didn't realize that you thought I had a fabulous lead...

<p>I'll try to make some more comments soon.</p>
<p>The class thing is difficult. No, you shouldn't use awkward or neologistic terms ("rankism") that aren't in the literature, but class and rank <i>do</i> need to be held seperate. Rank can be constructed as an explicitly <i>anti-</i>class structure: s/he is your superior officer regardless of family background, race, etc. In the British Empire, the enlisted/officer division was an outcome of class (commissions could be purchased, AFAIK, and the country was notoriously classist to begin with); in the American military, I'd suggest it's a shibboleth that class (in the typical sense) is supposed to have nothing to do with rank.</p>
<p>Anyhow, your changes address this. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 08:24, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Balloonman,</p>
<p>I noticed your comment on the page that I worked on yesterday. Do you have any suggestions for improvements? I tried to make it comprehensive in topics and time, so I don't think there should be POV concerns but your opinion can always be improve the article. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaSaltarella_7b57.html" title="User:LaSaltarella">LaSaltarella</a> 05:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll try to take a look at the article this weekend... the comment was made more as an FYI because I thought it might be something worth investigating... and you could probably get the details fairly easily.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 05:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hey BM,</p>
<p>I've been waiting for some free time to go over the Brat article again before I comment on the FAC. A couple of things hit me right in the opening section that I'm hoping you could explain for me. One thing, not every military brat has traveled the world (other than Viet Nam, my dad was stationed stateside his entire career--the USAF is great that way), but of course has at least traveled the U.S. So perhaps clarify that most or almost all are world travelers, etc. Also, this phrase confused me: "Military brats are typically highly educated, outgoing, and patriotic. They are raised in a culture that emphasizes loyalty, honesty, discipline, and responsibility. Sometimes these values are so strong in an individual that they cease to be virtues and become weaknesses." How can patriotism, education, honesty, etc. become weaknesses? By definition they are positive virtues, are they not? That whole thing doesn't make sense to me. It next states that they feel like outsiders, but those virtues you listed should not be the cause. If you're speaking about different qualities than those I mentioned, then some sentences need to be moved around to make that more clear. Also, you end by saying, "This subculture cuts across other cultural identities." OK? That kinda just drops off the cliff there with no further explanation and apparently no reason for even being there in the first place. It seems completely random, tacked-on; it makes it almost sound like what you'd find in a dictionary rather than an encyclopedic entry. I would rewrite some of these for you instead of complaining, but I'm not really sure where you want to go with these so I'm asking first. --<a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScreaminEagle_669a.html" title="User:ScreaminEagle">ScreaminEagle</a> 21:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Patriotism is a positive for most people---especially those raised in the military community. But absolute patriotism, wherein the government can do no wrong can be a weakness. Education, can become such an overriding factor that people cease to relate. Honesty, ever hear of too much honesty? Yes, I highly treasure my patriotism/honesty/education, but they can be embraced so strongly that they cease to be virtues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for travelling the world, the studies I've seen show that between 80-95% of brats have lived overseas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for feeling like outsiders, you are a military brat, how important is patriotism to you? How important is it to those around you? What about honesty? The virtues mentioned are not indicative of feeling like part of the group.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 04:20, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that's my point. The fact that you had to explain exactly what you meant perhaps suggests that a better explanation be provided than simply stating that these values can sometimes become weaknesses. The values-turned-weaknesses you're speaking of aren't readily obvious to readers who have not done the same research you have and that needs to be dealt with. (I realize you're getting it from all angles while the article is under scrutiny right now, but I am trying point out areas where the article can be improved and more easily read by non-brats.) Not everyone would think that brats, above all others, go to absolute extremes with these values (not just "strong values," which to most, are still considered a positive); you've only stated that sometimes the values turn to weaknesses, but not really how. I didn't find anything later in the article to suggest the answer to that either, so it should be answered better than it is now, preferrably where it was first mentioned. Strong values still suggests a positive--you need to put a negative word in there if you're suggesting a negative result. It would clear up some confusion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, I know the majority of brats have lived overseas, but not all of them--the sentence in the opening suggests all of them have. I was suggesting the sentence be changed to reflect the fact that most of them have lived overseas, not all of them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My other concern was not about feeling like an outsider--I think that point has been well established and I was not questioning it. What I was asking was exactly how their values make them feel like outsiders (personally, I went to schools where most of my friends were highly educated, honest, disciplined people). Now, extreme values...that's something different.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I still have a concern about that last sentence, about it cutting across other cultural identities. Could there be another sentence added to make that not seem like such an orphaned statement? It seems as if it was added out of obligation, not as part of the actual article. It doesn't seem to fit, especially given the information it's being thrown in with. It seems very out-of-text. --<a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScreaminEagle_669a.html" title="User:ScreaminEagle">ScreaminEagle</a> 20:41, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Balloonman,</p>
<p>Just for the record, I wanted to say that your last edit was gender-insensitive and I am not sure how to interpret it. That a school has only white males appointed as presidents is worth-noting. The media seems to find it newsworthy when a strong female U.S. presidential candidate runs and when a woman becomes the president of Harvard University. Somehow, in a society still full with a lot of gender disparity, people find it relevant. I am not sure what to say after having seen such a comment. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaSaltarella_7b57.html" title="User:LaSaltarella">LaSaltarella</a> 07:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And I disagree it is not notable. The reality of the situation is that virtually all presidents of four year colleges/universities are going to be white males. Is it a shame that is the case? Yes, but is it worth going out of the way to mention? No. Do other schools, such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oklahoma_0676.html" title="University of Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a> which has only had white males as its president make a point of it? Does Ohio University's page mention that it has only had males as it's president? Did it highlight the fact that it's current president was the first black president? No. Does OSU's main page mention that Karen Holbrook is their first female president and that they have never had a non-white president? No. Here's a challenge for you, find me another wikipage for a college or university that goes out of it's way to say "we've never had a non-white male" as our president. Inclusion here is POV; is it a shame that there aren't more minority presidents out there? Yes. Is it newsworthy in an individual institutions article? No.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 08:00, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>RE your edits since I wrote my response, the media does find it noteworthy when a person becomes president of Harvard (one of the most prestigious schools in the country) or a woman runs for president. But that doesn't mean that every school that hasn't had a person of color or a woman as president should mention it. Most schools haven't---again, I challenge you to find another school's page that mentions that fact.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 08:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've given this some thought. I REALLY don't like the way things are. So here are the ideas that I had. First, you could make it into two columns, this would consolodate the area---but I don't like this idea. The solution that I think I like the best would be to reduce the section to a short statement about how the Law, Oath, Motto, Outdoor Code, are pillars for scouting. Then, rather than listing the items back to back to back, use them similar to the way pictures aer used to break up the article as a whole.
