<p>I am very interested to know about his last name... it's clearly British in origin, but I missed any mention in the article about his background.</p>
<p>Any info would be appreciated!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mr. Thackeray is a member of the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu (CKP) community. Thackeray is a family name in this community. No connection to William Thakeray. Rishab60 July 17, 2006</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have heard that his last name was originally spelled "Thakre" but then, for some reason, he changed the spelling to "Thackeray." (I don't know why. It seems counterintuitive, since it's a clearly British spelling and Bal "Thakre" despises the British.) Let's see if we can find a source on this information. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 13:40, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Possibly, William's father and grandfather were important members of the Indian civil service and his father, Richmond, had a child by an Indian woman before marrying William's mother.

<p>This article seems a bit biased against Thackeray. I say "a bit" because I am truly a neutral observer who knows approximately zero about Indian politics or Mr. Thackeray, but I know enough to know that language like "He is one of india's worst religious fundamentalists and fanatics ever seen." isn't neutral. (I have removed this sentence.)</p>
<p>There were several anonymous edits between the last registered user reversion to remove POV language and the present, some of which are obviously neutral (and thus not the subject of this discussion) and some of which are possibly POV.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Add my own 2 paisas. Thackeray is a bold visionary who has the courage and the werewithal to call a spade a spade, and expose and denounce grevious atrocities committed against Hindus by Christian Missionaries and Muslim terrorists that are largely unreported by the leftist Indian media. This biased article is just one of many racialist smear-campaigns by Hindu-haters and self-hating negationist Hindus as part of a deliberate attempt to delegitimize the Hindu way of life and anesthesize the world to massive ethnic cleansing against Hindus. People of goodwill who see the truth must tackle this problem now.<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_Bose_5de5.html" title="User:Subhash Bose">User:Subhash Bose</a></dd>

<dd>First, let me say that I'm no fan of Bal Thackeray. I think that he is a fascist right-wing nutjob who brings a bad name to Hindus and Indians around the world. Nobody who calls himself the "Hitler of Mumbai" can be any good.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>That being said, I have to agree that this article is pretty biased against him, particularly the "Controversy" section.

<p>Listen, <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_Bose_5de5.html" title="User:Subhash Bose">User:Subhash Bose</a>, I understand your point of view and all, but could you please act in the spirit of cooperation? Your remarks and name-calling ("sock puppets", "self-hating Hindus", etc.) are demeaning and not helpful. In fact, they border on out-and-out racism.</p>
<p>This article about Bal Thackeray needs to be neutral, but that does not mean that it needs to legitimize his actions. All it has to do is not take a position on his actions. Your most recent edit ("reclaiming Ramjanmanbhoomi") is a POV edit. You inserted your point of view into the article, which is just as unacceptable as calling Thackeray's supporters "right-wing cadres" (which I removed from the article).</p>
<p>Please work cooperatively on this. It is okay to maintain the point of view that you have. It is not okay to engage in name-calling and other such behavior. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 16:18, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First off, the psychological basis of self-hatred is a reality, not "out-and-out" racism. Look at the Wikipedia article on it if you must (article mainly pertains to Jewish people, but there are far more self-hating Hindus in the world). Secondly, notice that I called the incident both the "reclamation of the Ramjanmabhoomi" as well as the "Babri Masjid incident", providing both the Hindu POV as well as that of the terrorist jehadis making it NPOV by cancellation. You are just another delusional liberal who wants to supress all POV's but your own. It's certainly okay to maintain the point of view that YOU have. It is NOT okay to suppress the right to free speech of Hindus.Sorry, but I'm reverting. I will, however, add that the "Ranjanmabhoomi reclamation" is a Hindu point of view.[[[User:Subhash bose|Netaji]] 03:49, 11 June 2006 (UTC)]</dd>
</dl>
<p>See, the edit you made right now was different from the edit you made before. This one is an important edit because, like you said, it shows the Hindu POV. However, it does not TAKE A POSITION on it. I agree that the article was incomplete without the Hindu rationale for demolishing the Babri Masjid. Before, though, you had written that the "<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babri_Mosque_64f0.html" title="Babri Mosque">Babri Masjid</a> was demolished and the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramjanmabhoomi.html" title="Ramjanmabhoomi">Ramjanmabhoomi</a> 'reclaimed'." Even though you had quotes around "reclaimed," it still pushed a point of view, which is why I reverted it, not because I wanted to "suppress free speech" in any way. Right now, that section is more balanced.</p>
<p>You keep saying that the article is unbalanced. Fair enough. How about you keep on editing it to make it more balanced in your opinion, and I'll make additional changes, and that way, bit-by-bit, we'll come to a consensus? You and I represent different points of view on this matter, but I think we can work together to make this article more neutral. Please don't just keep complaining that it's a biased article. Do something about it.</p>
<p>One other thing. Please stop the name-calling. I don't appreciate it. You accuse me of suppressing any POV but my own, even though I have worked tirelessly to incorporate all points of view into the article. (I think my comments above speak for themselves.) You, on the other hand, have repeatedly accused those who disagree with you of being "self-hating Hindus," "terrorist jehadis," or "delusional liberals."</p>
<p>I disagree with you and think Bal Thackeray gives Hinduism a bad name. I don't think Lord Ram would ever have approved of his actions. I don't think that makes me a "self-hating Hindu." I'm a very proud Hindu, in fact. I'm proud of the universality of our faith and how it preaches tolerance and understanding. I'm proud of how our doctrine of karma explains why there is suffering in the world. I'm proud of how Lord Ram eventually forgave those who had wronged him. He killed Ravan, but in the end he did forgive him. He forgave Kaikeyi and he forgave Manthra, the hunchback that caused his exile in the first place.</p>
<p>How about you stop all the angry, hate-filled editing and commenting and instead work based on the spirit of cooperation? --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 13:37, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fine, dandy. Don't get your underwear in knots. I'm all for representing every point of view, even the liberalist ones that I personally find repugnant and abhorrent. I'll cooperate with you in cleaning up this mess of an article if I must. The reason why I'm being so aggressive is that some Hindus should be more aggressive. It's important for people (including other Hindus) to realize that we will no longer remain soft targets for the enjoyment of the Abrahamics. Our way of life needs to be defended by force, even violent force, (verbal or physical) if necessary. Just like the Khatriyas, Rajputs and Maratha warriors like the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja did once (remember those guys?), or the Hindu race (and yes, Hindus are more than just a religion, WE ARE A RACE) will be completely eradicated in massive pogroms as the muslims plan and connive in their little hate-spewing madrassas and qutbas even as we speak. Thackeray realises this. He embodies the spirit of Maratha gallantry and patriotism for his nation and our race and culture and you hate him for it.

<dd>I have issues with the entire article. As such, it's tone is biased, derogatory, and completely unreasonable. All I want is to have the Hindu POV represented with the same respect as that of other religions. I mean, muslims blow up buildings with airplanes and decapitate journalists on television, and the wikipedia articles on Islam are full of fawning praise and subservient rubbish put there by Islamics. The wikipedia project on Judaism treats Israeli politicians with far more balance and objectivity than articles on a Hindu politicians (with similar POV's and responses to Islamic terrorism) written by HINDUS!!! What are we, blind, deaf and stupid like the Koran says about 'infidels'? What I ask that you (plural) read wikipedia articles on Ariel Sharon and George Bush and see how to write about politicians objectively, and reflect the same quality in the Thackeray article.[[[User:Subhash bose|Netaji]] 23:39, 11 June 2006 (UTC)]</dd>

<p>I've added a specific citation of his quotes about supporting Hitler. It's quite clear that either he does or that Asia Week is lying.

<dd>To use a few isolated incidents quoted out of context in order to defame and denigrate a party with a (basically) sound foundational ideology is being terribly biased in my opinion.Plus, what's the deal with emphasizing his alleged admiration for Hitler? What's with this Godwin's law crap? Hitlerian! Last time I checked, there were no concentration camps in Maharashtra. so he said that he admires Hitler. So does Arnold Schwartzenegger, governor of California and of Austrian birth. What's your point anyway? Don't make hyperbolic statements.

<dd>Several problems. First, as written, that sentence seems to just appear out of nowhere. It's natural to wonder what it's doing there. If we choose to keep the sentence, then it needs to be reworded so that it better explains itself. (Also, that sentence is an almost exact copy of the source, so it must be reworded to avoid copyvio.) More than that, though, the source simply represents one person's opinion. Just because one person said it doesn't make it true. Furthermore, that source is from 1987, long before Thackeray made any of his comments in admiration of Hitler. Do Indian Jews still support Thackeray in spite of this? We need several recent sources to confirm this. As written, this sentence makes a broad generalization about a large group of people. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 15:03, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>That's my point. I question the reliability of the source in this context. The source is outdated (it's from 1987, long before any of Thackeray's comments in admiration of Hitler were made) and is the analysis of just two scholars. Just because they say that Jews in India see a possible supporter of Zionism in Thackery does not make it so. I'm not saying that they're lying; what they say is simply their opinion. Their opinion is not necessarily "fact". Now, if several prominent scholars have said that, then it makes it something more concrete. However, we can't just take the opinions expressed in one article and automatically treat them as fact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Still, we don't need to remove the sentence entirely.

<dd>I think the sentence should be deleted. The content is original research in the sense that the sentence is implying that Jews somehow see past Thackeray's admiration of Hitler, and feel he still serves their cause. This is not the argument that the source used ever made, so using it to this end is dishonest. Since the case that Baal hates Jews was never made to begin with, this retort is also unwarranted. The sentence reads as strange to the reader because its altogether irrelevant to the section, which is not about antisemitism at all, but Thackeray's admiration of a brutal dictator. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinaretDk_1e87.html" title="User:MinaretDk">MinaretDk</a> 18:57, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
