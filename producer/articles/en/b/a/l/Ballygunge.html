<p>The term <i>bâli</i> meaning sand and <i>gônj</i> or village signifies that there used to be a huge deposit of sand here earlier. In fact, it is considered that while the British were digging the <i>Mahratta Ditch</i> as a precautionary measure to fortify the city against invading <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> warriors, the sand and mud that was dug up used to be piled up in the area currently known as Ballygunge.</p>
<p>The locality started developing with the expansion of Kolkata city beyond the <i>Mahratta Ditch</i> (later the Upper and Lower Circular Roads and now the A.P.C.Road and A.J.C.Bose Road respectively), in the early and mid-<a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Soon this locality became one of the addresses to have in town, with beautifully laid out areas like Ballygunge Park, Queen's Park, Sunny Park, Merlin Park,<a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballygunge_Circular_Road_25f9.html" title="Ballygunge Circular Road">Ballygunge Circular Road</a>, Old Ballygunge Road (Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue), Iron side Road, Mayfair Road, Mandeville Gardens (areas known today as 'Old Ballygunge". Stately bungalows came up on both sides of the tree-lined avenues.</p>
<p>The Tagore Estate used to have large holdings in the area. The <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharajah.html" title="Maharajah">Maharajahs</a> of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripura.html" title="Tripura">Tripura</a> built their Calcutta town house on Ballygunge Circular Road. Zamindars like the Maharajahs of <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadia_district.html" title="Nadia district">Nadia</a>, leading barristers, judges and I.C.S. officers built houses in Old Ballygunge. A cantonment area grew on Ballygunge Circular Road, along with several noted colleges and schools. The areas around the lakes - between <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashbehari_Avenue_ed27.html" title="Rashbehari Avenue">Rashbehari Avenue</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Avenue_5192.html" title="Southern Avenue">Southern Avenue</a> - began to be developed in the inter-war years and came to be known as the Rai Sahib-Rai Bahadur's colony because of the number of senior civil servants (bearing those titles) who retired and settled there. At the same time, other areas like the serpentine lanes of Fern Road, Kankulia Road (stretches later came to be gentrified as Ballygunge Gardens/Terrace), Garcha (parts later gentrified as Dover Terrace), Motilal Nehru Road, Ballygunge Place East became crowded with lesser mortals.</p>
<p>Although the area reflects the city's problems of over-crowding and pollution, Ballygunge remains a sought after residential area.</p>
<p>Business families like the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birla.html" title="Birla">Birlas</a> and the Thapars have built their home here. The official residence of the Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court is in Ballygunge and the area has provided state Chief Ministers and Union Cabinet Ministers for the last three decades. The traditional burra <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahib.html" title="Sahib">sahibs</a> - the senior company executives and bureaucrats - continue to be housed in the locality. The Consulates of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="../../../b/h/u/Bhutan.html" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burkina_Faso_dfc4.html" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> are located in Ballygunge.</p>
<p>As a result, Ballygunge is today the one of the most exclusive locales of Calcutta, with land prices among the highest in the country. Since the 1970's <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_colonial.html" title="British colonial">colonial</a> bungalows and detached houses have been giving place to multi-storied flats. In the seventies and eighties these were largely "co-operative" initiatives for the Bengali <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_class.html" title="Middle class">middle class</a> ("Saptaparni", "Paarijaat", "Ananda", "Meghamallar"); during the '90s, the developments became increasingly more swank as marble clad high rises were targeted at Calcutta's business communities; and finally the new millennium has seen condomiums with swimming pools and other facilities for the seriously affluent. Recent road development undertaken at the Old Ballygunge side, Rashbehari-Deshapriya park and Gariahat have improved the infrastructure in the Ballygunge area, although traffic snars are still quite common along major arteries like <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rash_Behari_Avenue_ee30.html" title="Rash Behari Avenue">Rash Behari Avenue</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gariahat_Road_56fe.html" title="Gariahat Road">Gariahat Road</a> and Syed Amir Ali Avenue during peak hours.</p>
<p>The southern part of the locality consists of the Gariahat area, renowned for clothes, jewellery, and a fresh food market. Some of the renowned shops which really has set the trends of South Calcutta exclusively independent. Some of the best fashion shops are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Gucci Fashion Valley</b> - <a href="http://www.theguccifashionvalley.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theguccifashionvalley.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>DCM</li>
<li>Stanrose</li>
<li><b>Traders Assembly</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of established retail brands have opened shop in this area and shopping malls are opening up rapidly. The Gariahat area is also a veritable gourmet's delight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bengali confectionery (Banchharam, Girish, Mouchak)</li>
<li>North Indian confectionery (Ganguram, Sharma's, Junior Brothers)</li>
<li>Snack Bars (Campari, Baked N Fried, Purbani)</li>
<li>Patisseries (Upper Crust, Kathleen's, Mongini's)</li>
<li>"Pice" Hotel (New Karco)</li>
<li>Bengali (Bhajahari Manna, 13 Paarbon)</li>
<li>Mughlai (Southern Aminia, Bedwin)</li>
<li>North Indian (Amber, Mirch Masala, Kwality)</li>
<li>South Indian (South Indian Club, Sonali)</li>
<li>Chinese (Krystal Chop Stick, Chinese Pavilion,Hatari,China Town,Green Chilli,Grub Club)</li>
<li>Punjabi (Ballygunge Phaari Dhaba)</li>
<li>"Junk" - "Phuchka" outside DCM Showroom (Gariahat Road) and assorted "Jhaal Muri" stalls</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most beloved local institutions has been hardest hit by the passage of time - the area between Gariahat and Gol Park used to have several used-book stores lining the footpaths. At their best, these were more than equal to the more-renowned College Street booksellers and much better than the relatively overpriced shops on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_School_Street_c400.html" title="Free School Street">Free School Street</a>. From disposable chart-topping thrillers to arcane magazines, these were sure to stock a large variety of titles. However, this market never quite recovered from one of the periodic fits of 'hawker evictions' carried out in the early 90s. While the rest of the stalls in and around Gariahat came back bigger and more crowded than ever, for some reason the used-book sellers have not quite recovered their niche.</p>
<p>Further South is the lake area, open green spaces and water bodies which act as lungs to the city. The Lake Stadium is here, and swimming and rowing institutions are dotted around the area. Of note are the Indian Life Saving Society (founded 1922 but known to one and all as Anderson Club); the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta_Rowing_Club_bb42.html" title="Calcutta Rowing Club">Calcutta Rowing Club</a> (established in 1858); and the Bengal Rowing Club (founded 1929 as the Marwari Rowing Club).</p>
<p>Ballygunge is also noted for several established <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durga_Puja_198d.html" title="Durga Puja">Durga Puja</a> pandals, including Ekdalia Park (on Ekdalia Road), Singhi Park (on Dover lane), Adi Ballygunge Sarbojonin Deshapriya Park, etc. (during the Puja season in September/October).</p>
<p>Ballygunge is also home to the <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover_Lane_music_festival_9231.html" title="Dover Lane music festival">Dover Lane music festival</a>, being held annually,which is noted for its participants who hail from the best of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_India_a936.html" title="Music of India">Indian classical music</a>. Noted dancer and choreographer, Uday Shankar (elder brother of Ravi Shankar) used to live in the area. His wife Amala Shankar, their son: Ananda Shankar, and their daughter: Mamata Shankar continued reside and run teaching establishments in Ballygunge. Rabindrasangeet is taught at a number of institutions in the locality, of which, Dakshini is perhaps the most celebrated.</p>
<p>Ballygunge Railway Station is an important junction on the <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata_suburban_railway.html#Sealdah_South_Section" title="Kolkata suburban railway">Sealdah south-section</a> of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Railway_%28India%29_93fc.html" title="Eastern Railway (India)">Eastern Railways</a> suburban service. It is here that the lines to <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jadavpur.html" title="Jadavpur">Jadavpur</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budge_Budge_daea.html" title="Budge Budge">Budge Budge</a> fork out. The <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta_Tramways_Company_f2dd.html" title="Calcutta Tramways Company">Calcutta Tramways Company</a> has two depots in the locality - one adjacent to Ballygunge Station; the government bus services also maintain a depot next to the station, providing "integrated" transport services. The underground Metro railway skirts Ballygunge, the closest station being "Kalighat".</p>
