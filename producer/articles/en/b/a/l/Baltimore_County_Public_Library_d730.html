<p>The Foundation for Baltimore County Public Library is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing financial contributions to enhance the traditional tax-based funding for library resources, services and programming. The Foundation recognizes that the strength of the library stems from well-trained staff, ample high-quality materials, the latest technology and well-equipped buildings. A strong library system enriches the community by expanding minds and enriching lives; the efforts of the Foundation seek to support this goal.</p>
<p>In 1999, based on the vision of library Director Jim Fish, the Foundation for Baltimore County Public Library was established to provide additional financial and volunteer support that were much needed. Decreased funding had occured as a result of the economic recession of the early 1990s. Soon after, tax-exempt status was obtained, a board of directors was recruited, a president was named and raising funds began.</p>
<p><b>Foundation for BCPL Mission</b></p>
<p>The Foundation for Baltimore County Public Library mobilizes resources to support the Library's commitment to a superior public library system where opportunities for literacy, reading enrichment, and lifelong learning are available to all.</p>
<p><b>Foundation Objectives</b></p>
<ul>
<li>To provide funding for projects that encourage children and young adults to cultivate a life-long enthusiasm for reading and learning.</li>
<li>To act as advocates for the library to ensure that library services continue on into the future.</li>
<li>To raise funds for specific programs or projects that enhance system-wide Baltimore County Library goals and objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What the Foundation Has Accomplished</b></p>
<p>Between 1999 and 2007, the Foundation for Baltimore County Public Library has provided funding for a large number of projects appealing to the library users and library staff. Some of the largest fund-raising projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated, more comfortable furniture for all library branches.</li>
<li>The Read Rover Plus bookmobile – a “library on wheels” used for visits to day-care and at-risk communities.</li>
<li>Updating computer technology in branches throughout Baltimore County.</li>
<li>My First Library Card Campaign which helped almost 7,000 kindergartners and preschoolers across the county sign up for their first library card and provided a book and a backpack to each child.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Current 2007 Foundation Initiative</b></p>
<p>Storyville at BCPL is the new project to be funded by the Foundation for BCPL. This interactive early learning center, to be located at the Rosedale Branch of BCPL, will host seven interactive play stations where infants and preschoolers can explore and grow while engaging in developmentally appropriate activities. Books and activities at each site will promote cognitive, motor, language and social skills, depending on the age group.</p>
<p>This free, museum-like service will encourage children and caregivers in the greater Baltimore area to explore the interactive exhibits featured in a unique townscape. The townscape will feature a variety of innovative activity areas such as: a baby garden consisting of manipulative toys, mobiles, and board books, a fully stocked childrens’ library, a theatre, complete with changeable marquee, costumes, and props, and other unique play and learning areas. Appropriate reading materials will be placed at each learning area for children at different reading levels.</p>
<p>This over $500,000 project is being funded through a combination of financial pledges from corporate, individual, and non-profit organizations. In addition, legislation has been introduced in the Maryland General Assembly which, if passed, will grant $250,000 to the Board of Directors of the Foundation for Baltimore County Public Library, Inc. for the construction of the Storyville Children’s Learning Center at the Rosedale Public Library. Funds from this bond bill will be added to money that has been raised by the Foundation for the Baltimore County Public Library from private sources and individuals to cover the construction costs.</p>
<p><br />
