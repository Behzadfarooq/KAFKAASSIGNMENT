<p>On the afternoon of the <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_January_666e.html" title="12 January">12th</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Fiji_899f.html" title="List of Prime Ministers of Fiji">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laisenia_Qarase_c2f7.html" title="Laisenia Qarase">Laisenia Qarase</a> called an emergency meeting of the National Security Council, following reports of a "serious situation" at the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_Barracks_ca54.html" title="Queen Elizabeth Barracks">Queen Elizabeth Barracks</a> earlier in the day. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioner_of_Police_%28Fiji%29_c947.html" title="Commissioner of Police (Fiji)">Police Commissioner</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Hughes_%28police%29_eaec.html" title="Andrew Hughes (police)">Andrew Hughes</a> was summoned to the meeting, after which the Prime Minister, accompanied by more than the usual number of body guards, told reporters that the security situation was "under control", and appealed for calm.</p>
<p>The situation at the barracks was said to involve a group of Army officers, led by <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jone_Baledrokadroka_d78b.html" title="Jone Baledrokadroka">Jone Baledrokadroka</a>, Bainimarama's second in command, confronting the Commander about his antigovernment statements. This was rumoured to have been followed by a meeting between Bainimarama and other officers, in which he was said to have solicited their support. The <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Live_a254.html" title="Fiji Live">Fiji Live</a> news service reported that senior officer <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/l/Meli_Saubulinayau_f900.html" title="Meli Saubulinayau">Meli Saubulinayau</a> was subsequently called in to mediate between the two factions, and was said to have diffused the tension. Military spokesman <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neumi_Leweni_d124.html" title="Neumi Leweni">Neumi Leweni</a> denied the rumours, claiming that no unscheduled meetings had taken place. However, the gates to the camp were closed and guarded by armed military police, an unusual move.</p>
<p>Captain Leweni denied reports that Commodore Bainimarama had been arrested, and said that he remained in charge of the Military. This was confirmed by Bainimarama himself when he appeared in public at a <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby</a> training session at Albert Park that evening. There was no instability in the barracks, he insisted. <i>"All the rumours that are going around regarding the meeting and my arrest are all false. None of it is true,"</i> <i><a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Live_a254.html" title="Fiji Live">Fiji Live</a></i> quoted him as saying. He insisted that the meetings held that day had been "normal procedure", asking rhetorically, <i>"Would I be here if there was instability between my senior officers and me?"</i> He denied rumours that two senior officers alleged to have confronted him had been detained in a cell at the <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabua.html" title="Nabua">Nabua</a> barracks on his orders. There was nothing sinister about the closing of the barracks gates, he said. He had been at dinner at the time and had ordered the gates to be closed because he had not wanted to be bothered talking the media, who were outside, he claimed.</p>

<p>Unusual naval movements were also reported. In what the Navy described as an exercise to test the ability of its fleet to react to emergencies, three vessels were sent out into Suva Harbour and kept watch over Government House. The naval headquarters was also placed under guard. Naval spokesman <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Commander_7c33.html" title="Lieutenant Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> Bradley Bower later claimed that the navy had only been conducting "normal routine exercises."</p>
<p>By nightfall, police roadblocks were going up around Suva, ostensibly to maintain law and order. The Police Tactical Response Unit, established to respond quickly to emergencies, was also put on special alert, the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Times_30c8.html" title="Fiji Times">Fiji Times</a> reported the next day. Police spokesmen Lemeki Ravai and <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahir_Khan_69c1.html" title="Jahir Khan">Jahir Khan</a> denied that the roadblocks were connected with the crisis, however. They were part of Operation Sasamaki, they claimed - a crackdown on road offenders and petty criminals.</p>
<p>There were also reports of increased security at <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadi.html" title="Nadi">Nadi</a> International Airport.</p>
<p>It was announced that Home Affairs Minister <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josefa_Vosanibola_db62.html" title="Josefa Vosanibola">Josefa Vosanibola</a> would meet <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Vice-Presidents_of_Fiji_ed71.html" title="List of Vice-Presidents of Fiji">Acting President</a> <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratu.html" title="Ratu">Ratu</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/Joni_Madraiwiwi_73ad.html" title="Joni Madraiwiwi">Joni Madraiwiwi</a> the next morning to discuss the outcome of Madraiwiwi's talks with the Commander earlier in the week. The meeting would decide what disciplinary action, if any, would be taken against the Commander for his frequent outbursts against government policies, it was said. Various news outlets produced conflicting quotes from Commodore Bainimarama, on whether he had, or had not, met with Madraiwiwi on the <a href="../../../1/1/_/11_January_7171.html" title="11 January">11th</a>. On the afternoon of the <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_January_666e.html" title="12 January">12th</a>, however, he told the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Village_db5d.html" title="Fiji Village">Fiji Village</a> news service that the meeting had in fact taken place, but declined to reveal any details about what had been discussed.</p>

<p><a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Live_a254.html" title="Fiji Live">Fiji Live</a> reported that Commodore Bainimarama had dismissed Baleidrokadroka from his position of Land Force Commander, in the wake of the previous day's altercation.

Bainimarama himself had taken over the command in person, it was reported. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">15 January</a>, he told a press conference that two new <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_staff_%28military%29.html" title="Chief of staff (military)">Chiefs of Staff</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pita_Driti_a6c3.html" title="Pita Driti">Pita Driti</a> as Chief of Staff Land Force, based at <a href="../../../s/u/v/Suva.html" title="Suva">Suva</a>'s <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_Barracks_%28Suva%29_b07d.html" title="Queen Elizabeth Barracks (Suva)">Queen Elizabeth Barracks</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> <a href="../../../e/s/a/Esala_Teleni_a8c0.html" title="Esala Teleni">Esala Teleni</a> as Chief of Staff Strategic Headquarters in central Suva.</p>

<p>Baledrokadroka told the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Times_30c8.html" title="Fiji Times">Fiji Times</a> on the <a href="../../../1/4/_/14_January_78aa.html" title="14 January">14th</a> that he had resigned rather than obey a "treasonous" order of Bainimarama's. <i>"I asked the commander for his resignation on the grounds that it was perfectly clear that he was going to commit treason,"</i> he told the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Times_30c8.html" title="Fiji Times">Fiji Times</a>. In a further statement the next day, he clarified that at a meeting of senior officers on the <a href="../../../9/_/j/9_January_b528.html" title="9 January">9th</a>, Bainimarama had hinted that he might be arrested and instructed them to come and free him in such an event. He denied claims by unnamed army sources that he had tried to stage a <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutiny.html" title="Mutiny">mutiny</a>. <i>"I am a professional soldier and I would not dream of such a thing,"</i> he said emphatically.</p>
<p>He told <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Live_a254.html" title="Fiji Live">Fiji Live</a> the next day that the crisis for him had begun when he had told a colleagues at a meeting of Commissioned Senior Officers that he was opposed to the Commander's recent antigovernment pronouncements. His motive for opposing the Commander was professional, not political, he claimed, and emphasized that he would not change his stand.</p>
<p>Speaking to the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Sun_e39c.html" title="Fiji Sun">Fiji Sun</a> on the <a href="../../../1/4/_/14_January_78aa.html" title="14 January">14th</a>, Baleidrokadroka condemned the Commander for accusing him of threatening to shoot him. <i>"He has lied and he knows that he is lying,"</i> Baledrokadroka declared. <i>"... I absolutely deny that I threatened violence against the Commander and Iâm deeply shocked at the allegations."</i></p>
<p>On the <a href="../../../1/6/_/16_January_d0d0.html" title="16 January">16th</a>, Baledrokadroka denied claims made by the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Labour_Party_fae9.html" title="Fiji Labour Party">Fiji Labour Party</a> and by Commodore Bainimarama himself that he had colluded with Prime Minister Qarase in an attempt to depose the Commander. <i>"They (the FLP) are still sort of hanging on to that, the victim thesis that they have been the victim of coups in the past and its only fair in their eyes that the Commander do something, whatever it is. At the moment it looks to be extra constitutional,"</i> he told <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Television_146e.html" title="Fiji Television">Fiji Television</a>. He further claimed that Bainimarama had attempted to trick him into executing a coup. The second paragraph of an order handed to him on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">8 January</a> seemed "sinister", he said, and claimed "legal experts" (whom he did not name) concurred with his opinion that it was tantamount to a coup plot.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baledrokadroka_incident.html" title="Edit section: Bainimarama's version">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bainimarama's version</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Village_db5d.html" title="Fiji Village">Fiji Village</a> reported on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_14.html" title="January 14">14 January</a> that at a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Press_conference.html" title="Press conference">press conference</a> held that afternoon, Commodore Bainimarama said that Baleidrokadroka had been dismissed for insubordination and for failing the loyalty test of the Military. The command which Baleidrokadroka had refused to obey had only been a test, which he had failed miserably, the Commander claimed. He had been willing to give Baleidrokadroka another chance, he said, but Baleidrokadroka had made matters worse by talking to the media. Baleidrokadroka's dismissal would be a lesson to other potential insubordinates, he said. The message was clear that any acts of insubordination would be dealt with quickly and decisively. <i>"Now soldiers know what will happen if they support JB,"</i> <i><a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Live_a254.html" title="Fiji Live">Fiji Live</a></i> reported him as saying. <i>"Obedience is paramount in the army."</i></p>
<p>Bainimarama was joined by Military spokesman <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neumi_Leweni_d124.html" title="Neumi Leweni">Neumi Leweni</a>, who revealed that <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Police_af4b.html" title="Military Police">Military Police</a> were now investigating the circumstances surrounding the barracks crisis that led to Baleidrokadroka's resignation, and a Board of Inquiry had been set up. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_16.html" title="January 16">16 January</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Etueni Caucau, Bainimarama's legal adviser, told <i>Fiji Live</i> that an inquiry was necessary to prevent a repeat of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutinies_of_Fiji_coup_of_2000_fe95.html" title="Mutinies of Fiji coup of 2000">mutiny</a>. A number of "borderline officers" had been identified whose loyalty would be investigated, Caucau said.</p>
<p>Caucau had earlier told <i>Fiji Live</i> on the <a href="../../../1/4/_/14_January_78aa.html" title="14 January">14th</a> that Baleidrokadroka had "threatened" the Commander and had been confined to his office by other senior officers to prevent him from carrying out his threat. Baleidrokadroka's claim to have outside support, and his alleged attempts to elicit support from soldiers, was what had prompted the closing and guarding of the barracks' gates, Caucau added.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Times_30c8.html" title="Fiji Times">Fiji Times</a> quoted Bainimarama on the <a href="../../../1/6/_/16_January_d0d0.html" title="16 January">16th</a> as saying that Baleidrokadroka had threatened shoot him not once but twice. <i>"First was on Thursday when I called him on the mobile. He said he was going to shoot me and then again on Friday when I met him face-to-face,"</i> he told the <i>Times</i>. <i>"I have a witness to that account."</i> He said he was going to present his "evidence" that Baleidrokadroka had wconspired with senior government officials to plot against him.</p>
<p>Acting President Madraiwiwi held separate meetings with Bainimarama and Prime Minister Qarase. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola was present at the latter meeting, at which it was agreed that the Acting President, Prime Minister, and Military Commander would meet on the morning of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_16.html" title="January 16">16 January</a> (Monday). Increased security around Government House, the President's official residence, was evident. Appealing for calm, the Prime Minister reiterated earlier assurances that there was no threat to stability.</p>

<p>Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes announced that police officers were resuming "normal duties," following a personal assurance from Commodore Bainimarama that there was no threat to national security. The national security alert had been unnecessary and the rumours sweeping the nation had been "media generated," he considered. He also denied rumours that weapons recently purchased by the police were to counter the Military should the need arise. <i>"They are not in any sense part of a program initiated by government by me or by anybody else to equip the police to somehow ... counter any military threat,"</i> he insisted. <i>"There is no way the police are gearing up to take on that role."</i></p>

<p><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neumi_Leweni_d124.html" title="Neumi Leweni">Neumi Leweni</a>, a spokesman for the Fijian Military, announced on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20.html" title="January 20">20 January</a> that four senior army officers had been appointed <a href="../../../1/9/_/19_January_b7be.html" title="19 January">the day before</a> to investigate the alleged mutiny plot. The four officers would not be named until they had completed their work, Leweni said.</p>
<p>The Board of Inquiry met for the first time on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">25 January</a> at Queen Elizabeth Barracks. Leweni said that meetings would continue throughout the week, but could not set out a time frame for the investigations. Commodore Bainimarama confirmed that he had been summoned to appear before the board on the <a href="../../../2/7/_/27_January_5895.html" title="27 January">27th</a>, but Baledrokadroka had not been summoned, according to his lawyer, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devanesh_Sharma_adfc.html" title="Devanesh Sharma">Devanesh Sharma</a>.</p>
<p>Leweni said that several senior officers had been implicated in the plot.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Television_146e.html" title="Fiji Television">Fiji Television</a> revealed on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">30 January</a> that Baledrokadroka had been summoned, but that Leweni said that a letter had been received from Baledrokadroka's lawyers seeking clarification on the membership and proceedings of the Board of Inquiry.</p>
<p>Home Affairs Chief Executive Officer <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesi_Korovavala_efd1.html" title="Lesi Korovavala">Lesi Korovavala</a> was also summoned, but refused, citing his workload. The Military was displeased by his refusal, Leweni said.</p>
<p>Lawyer Sharma said on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> that Baledrokadroka was willing to testify, but only if certain issues were clarified. Sharma cited the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Fiji_b115.html" title="Constitution of Fiji">constitutional</a> rights of defendants not to testify against themselves. Baledrokadroka finally did appear before the board on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">2 February</a>, after his constitutional rights had been clarified by lawyers. He handed over a written statement; neither he nor the Military made any comments outside as to what it contained.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Samuela Saumatua was revealed as the Chairman of the Board of Inquiry on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">3 February</a>. The same day, it was revealed that the inquiry would continue, despite the noncooperation of a number of government officials.</p>

More than 60 witnesses with military connections had been called, Tuinaosara said. He denied that Baledrokadroka himself was the primary focus of the investigation; the object of it was to determine what actually happened on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">12 January</a>, he said.</p>
<p>Leweni told <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Live_a254.html" title="Fiji Live">Fiji Live</a> on <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_February_a554.html" title="10 February">10</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_11.html" title="February 11">11 February</a> that Korovavala's testimony would no longer been needed, even though he had recently changed his earlier refusal to give evidence. Over 60 witnesses had been called. A source reported to be close to Baledrokadroka quoted him as threatening to open "a can of worms" on the Military if forced to testify. Meanwhile, lawyer Devanesh Sharma questioned the validity of the Board of Inquiry, saying that its being chaired by <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Samuela Saumatua, a subordinate of Baledrokadroka's, was out of order.

<p><a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_New_Zealand_8875.html" title="Radio New Zealand">Radio New Zealand</a> announced on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">6 February</a> that Fiji's Public Service Commission (PSC) had appointed an independent team to investigate the allegations that Lesi Korovavala had been involved in the alleged insubordination. <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Village_db5d.html" title="Fiji Village">Fiji Village</a> quoted PSC Chief Executive <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anare_Jale_7351.html" title="Anare Jale">Anare Jale</a> on the <a href="../../../8/_/f/8_February_7e9e.html" title="8 February">8th</a> as disclosing that the team comprised two members. This was later expanded to three members.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_16.html" title="February 16">16 February</a>, the PSC named Vasantika Patel, a <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadi.html" title="Nadi">Nadi</a> lawyer, to lead the investigation against Korovavala. Businessman Tony Philipps and PSC officer Mereani Vuinakodu were also stated to be members of the team.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">27 February</a>, Military spokesman <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neumi_Leweni_d124.html" title="Neumi Leweni">Neumi Leweni</a> publicly asked whey Korovavala had not been suspended from his office, in view of the seriousness of the allegations against him. According to the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Sun_e39c.html" title="Fiji Sun">Fiji Sun</a>, he pointed out that a conviction for a similar offence had resulted in a life sentence for the <a href="../../../q/a/r/Qaranivalu_of_Naitasiri_b0ef.html" title="Qaranivalu of Naitasiri">Qaranivalu of Naitasiri</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratu.html" title="Ratu">Ratu</a> <a href="../../../i/n/o/Inoke_Takiveikata_2d78.html" title="Inoke Takiveikata">Inoke Takiveikata</a>, and that an allegation of a much lesser offence had resulted in the forced transferal of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Poseci_Bune_c3b6.html" title="Poseci Bune">Poseci Bune</a> from his secretaryship of the PSC to the Foreign Ministry and subsequently to the diplomatic service. (Bune was later found innocent). PSC Chairman Stuart Hugget responded that no action could be taken against Korovavala while investigations were in progress.</p>
