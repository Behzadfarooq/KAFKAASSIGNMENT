<p>TRADE THEOREMS ((Balton))</p>
<pre>
Trade expands to meet the velocity and volume of money in circulation. Nations that discard false money attitudes make far greater use of money. 
</pre>
<p>Unless inflation is too high there is no need to curtail or inhibit the freedom of money to fulfill it's fuller potential.</p>
<p>Levels of material wealth are set by and can only originate from levels of trading. Without trading there is no economy.</p>
<p>Labor cannot be stored for future usage. Labor can only have money circulation and wealth generating value while laboring.</p>
<p>Whereas knowledge can be stored for possible future use. The application of knowledge produces goods and services to trade.</p>
<p>Trade is sustained and created by continuous wasting of products and services. Wasting is defined as using-up the value in products and services. Most man made goods have a limited life span. Auto fuels and groceries have a short life span, whereas a house has a longer lifespan. Most man made goods eventually go to waste. A service like plumbing has no life span.</p>
<p>The circulation of taxation money makes it possible for individuals and business to earn a large proportioin of their wealth and enjoy high living standards.</p>
<p>Velocity (turn over rate) and volume of money in circulation in any given era are the keys of economics. The velocity rate and volume of money being circulated allows citizens to set the level of consumerism.</p>
<p>Firstly, neither wheat nor autos will sell unless an adequate fiscal system is operationally in place.</p>
<p>Taxation forces citizens to circulate money among themselves. Optimum taxation boosts economies.Taxation is not economically punitive, because taxation circulates money just as every other transaction circulates money.</p>
<pre>
 Fiscally there is no economic difference between circulating money through taxation, autos, clothing and every other purchase. Taxation is the method citizens use to purchase the products and services they want delivered by their governments.
  
</pre>
<p>Canadian money has no value outside of Canada. Likewise Russian rubles cannot be used in Canada by Canadians. When Canada loans a billion Canadian dollars to a foreign nation or corporation, the money must be returned to Canada either directly or indirectly through other nations to realize the value of the Canadian billion dollars. International money can be used in other nations, such as USA or Euro money.</p>
<p><br />
MONEY BLOCK PRINCIPLES Balton</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that most citizens, economists and politicians believe a number of false fiscal and monetary ideologies. False beliefs that needlessly cramp and stall modifying economic thinking.</p>
<pre>
 Citizens who vote for tax cuts, are also voting for smaller government budgets which in turn equals smaller economies. When it comes to expanding the GNP through more private enterprise activities, citizens agree; when it comes to expanding GNP through government activities most citizens strongly disagree. A sorry hang-up indeed.
</pre>
<p>On behalf of citizens a very large block of money belongs in the hands of governments to continuously re-circulate. We fail to acknowledge that considerable money was and is put in circulation by governments. From lack of understanding we wrongly assume that our governments have no rightful claim to a significant portion of all the money that flows to individuals and corporations.</p>
<pre>
 Secondly because a greater proportion of government money flows to high earners, governments need to collect a higher proportion from high earners. Thus we use a graduated taxation system  collect taxation proportionately. In fact much of a high earners income is directlly tied to the amount of high earner taxation re-circulated, in this manner they again can garner more wealth from this economic feature. 
  Fortunately taxation in modern nations has enabled their citizens to make fuller use of their abilities and enabled more just societal objectives to materialize. Since Canada's economy has been performing well in recent years; along with the many other contributing factors, Canada's taxation must be at an optimum level.
  We expect grocery stores to act as agents between product suppliers and us, likewise  governments are our agents charged with delivering chosen products and services. By having governments deliver certain products, governments enables the whole national economy to expand.   
 An expanding national economy provides private enterprise with the opportunity to also expand. Government participation in the economy is not an attack on capitalism features or a deterrent of private enterprise growth.
  There is no sound fiscal reason to forego the benefits taxation offers us. Advocates of less taxation are wrong. Less taxation curtails money circulation, puts people out of work and depresses economies.
  To keep economic philosophy in step with all manner of worldly changes attitudes must change, we must allow fresh fiscal ideologies to come on stream.
