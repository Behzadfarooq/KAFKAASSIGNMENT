<hr />
<p>I have replaced this page with a copyright violation notice. It is difficult for me to judge the origin of this page, but it was originally posted in July 2004 by <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlien_life_form_d03f.html" title="User:Alien life form">User:Alien life form</a>, who was only active for a few days in that month. The "history" section is verbatim the same as content on at least four other websites:</p>

</ul>
<p>I verified that the first one has been up since 2002 (via archive.org), so these predate the Wikipedia entry. It looks suspiciously like this is a commercial description, perhaps from some balsamic vinegar trade association, which is used by various vendors of balsamic vinegar. In any event it looks like it was swiped illegally, so the whole article as contributed by this user should probably be rewritten from scratch. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 07:52, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>I luv being accused of illegal behavior, so I will point you to the following everyhting2 writeup</p>
<p><a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1097267" class="external free" title="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1097267" rel="nofollow">http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1097267</a></p>
<p>(which, as you will note, was authored by me in July 2001). In said article, the history section was adapted from www.balsamicvinegar.com, whose content I and my colleagues created on behalf of a customer a year before (roughly). No copyright was contemplated - quite obviously - on such a trivial account of the recorded history of the stuff. The domain then changed hands, its content was rewritten, etc. so I actually thought that the stuff I wrote was mine to use but, hey, we do mistakes. If traceable at all, <b>that</b> must be the original source of the material that I shamelessly "swiped".</p>
<p>That writeup and some other material I had from then - a part from my personal experience - have been the basis for the article of the wikipedia. To which I return to find out it was really a swipe. Oh, well - I have written compositions in high school for which I care more deeply than that article, and it looks that wikipedia will be balsamic-vinegar-less after all (I'm not going to invest any time in rewriting the thing, next please).</p>
<p>I do find utterly ridiculous, though, the way in which copyright perception and policing (way way before legislation) are getting in the way of sharing rather flat and flavorless factual accounts.</p>
<p>But that ridiculous is only a pale reflection of that which emanates from accounts of such trivia that are peppered with words like "illegal, suspicious, swipe, was active just a few days".</p>
<p>One would think we're killing the Romanoffs, here, rather than engaging in highly onanistic and irrelevant intellectual self play. Of which I had enough.</p>

<dd>Hello. Since you seem to be coming in to Wikipedia from everything2—which has mostly had a lax policy on this sort of thing, perhaps you're not familiar with how things are done here. If you are posting content that appears elsewhere or that was not created especially for wikipedia, you should cite it in the article or at least post a note about it in the talk page, stating that you are the copyright-holder or showing evidence that it is public-domain or otherwise GFDL-compatible. (Note that your sarcastic copyright notice is not applicable, since by submitting new content to Wikipedia you are agreeing to GFDL-license your content.) I followed standard Wikipedia procedure in researching the copyright status of your article. In any case it seems like I was right after all, in that intentionally or not this article belongs to the client whom you created this article. There's no need to be so touchy, all you needed to do was post an explanation here. I would like to welcome your future contributions to Wikipedia but suggest that you be more carefully about sourcing and citing your contributions and otherwise following accepted practices, since unlike everything2, articles in Wikipedia are not individual pieces, but collaboratively edited parts of a larger work. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 07:25, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the external links was:</p>

</ul>
<p>This links directly to an online shopping site. It's not very informative, except to demonstrate that balsamic vinegar is indeed quite expensive. Looks like it's to draw traffic to this particular product selection. I can't say I have a good replacement link, but I removed this one pending any disagreement, if any. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarkcol_11a9.html" title="User:Clarkcol">Clarkcol</a> 03:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The text that accompanied the link was terrible, but the link itself is helpful in showing a variety of products and their high prices.

<dd>Whatever you believe, please don't present it as a command. What you meant to say, I think, was "<i>I think</i> we should leave it out."

<p>I believe the sources cited in this article are incorrect. They currently suggest that the red, silver and gold label certification processes are related to age. The process used to create the vinegars doesn't lend itself to giving a specific age, as the barrells of vinegars are never fully emptied, but blended with each other as the aging process takes place. The colors indicate quality, with red being acceptable, silver being better and gold being the best possible quality. I cannot find a source for this online, however it is listed in a book that comes with the graded vinegars from the consortium in Reggio Emilia. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteeltoe_c8b0.html" title="User:Steeltoe">Steeltoe</a> 18:39, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
