<dd>Hi, I noticed you're uploading some maps for the districts of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schleswig-Holstein_b206.html" title="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>. I've been doing similar for some US states (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_California_counties_c825.html" title="List of California counties">California</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nevada_counties_a24a.html" title="List of Nevada counties">Nevada</a>...). Just a couple suggestions: the <a href="../../../j/p/e/JPEG_907e.html" title="JPEG">JPEG</a> compression makes the hard edges a little funky-looking; you'll get a cleaner image if you save the files as <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a>, which is better optimized for line-art drawings. Also, the 400-pixel width is perhaps a bit big for users running at low resolutions or with browser windows smaller than their whole screen. I'd recommend shrinking them down to the 200-250 range, maybe 300 at the most; or else un-floating them so the text doesn't have to wrap around the giant picture. In any case, thanks for your work -- a map is worth a thousand words in making articles about geographical locations useful and appealing! --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 21:27 Oct 2, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About zero-length uploads... I don't think I've encountered this in particular, but I do know the upload system is a little more fragile than it should be, and tends to tell you "Success!" without really checking. It's possible that your connection got broken somehow, and the whole file didn't get written; just upload it again and it should be okay... --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 18:33 Oct 4, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Cordyph, I've seen that you uploaded some coats of arms of German cities. Where have you got them? It would be nice if you could mail them to me (elian (at) gmx.li) as a zip or tar-file, so we can use them in the German wikipedia, too. --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElian_23dc.html" title="User:Elian">Elian</a></p>

You correctly pointed out that my advice wasn't to put the charge of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> into the <i>first sentence</i> of the article although I did suggest that it should be covered in it (somewhere). --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>

<p>Hi, Cordyph. Just a minute ago I was busy changing names and redirecting the Anderlecht articles.

<p>Hi, Mirko! (Is this a popular German name? Sounds very Slavonic, Czech, Serbian or maybe Lusatian). I did my best in convincing Taw. When I was talking about Frankfurt, of course I didn't mean the one in Hessen but the other one, You know, on the that river with two names.<br />
From Rhine to Ural? From Dniestr to Laba (Elbe) would be more like it. And please understand the Polish point of view: the German irredentists - Heimatvertriebene, Jung Landsmannschafte Ostpreussen and other "Teutonic Knights" want to claim from 50 to 80% of current Polish lands. If Poles just stick to reasonable historical arguments and desperately try to convince the world about their rights to the Recovered Lands, then between the lines they acknowledge that the issue is a subject to discussion. It's not! That's why current Polish strategy is to come up with equally absurd and ridiculous claims from their part. "You want Silesia - well, we want Lusatia (Lautzen/Luzice) with the old Polish cities of Misnia (Meissen), Budziszyn (Bautzen) and Chociebuz (Cottbus)! You want Pomerania - well, we want Pomorze Zaodrzanskie (Vorpommern) with the old Polish cities of Wologoszcz (Wolgast) and Strzalowo (Strelitz). You write about Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg - well it's Kaliningrad/Krolewiec for You, You pickelhaube wearing, kulturkampf Preussener, You!" Me, I don't take any part in it actively. But I see that change as something better than the previuos way of reasoning. I can send You some funny posters and bumper stickers, and we can both laugh about them.<br />
Take care, Mirko!<br />

<p>Hi Cordyph,</p>
<p>the border did not border the flag only but extended to the right until the edge of the screen:</p>
<pre>
+-------------------------+
| flag                    |
+-------------------------+
</pre>
<p>which did not look very nice. I see your point at the moment in the factsheet on <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesse.html" title="Hesse">Hesse</a>, the table is wider than the flag is. I added a small black border to the image itself, I think this looks better than before. BTW, the flags you upload, do you have them available as PNG or GIF? JPEG looks a little bit ugly when used for flags or maps. -- <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeLuF_9769.html" title="User:JeLuF">JeLuF</a></p>
<p>What platform are you working on? There are simple PNG-aware programs available for free on most platforms. -- <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeLuF_9769.html" title="User:JeLuF">JeLuF</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your notice about <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trakai.html" title="Trakai">Trakai</a>. Actually I have got a written permission by email from the Trakai Town Hall officials and they grant free use of all their textual information on their site.

<p>Hi Cordyph - when you move a page to a new location, could you use the "Move this page" link rather than cutting and pasting? That way, all old version of the page are moved as well, so they're all kept in one place. Cheers --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a> (by the way, I moved <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurburgring.html" title="Nurburgring">Nurburgring</a> to <a href="../../../n/%C3%BC/r/N%C3%BCrburgring.html" title="Nürburgring">Nürburgring</a> rather than <a href="../../../n/u/e/Nuerburgring.html" title="Nuerburgring">Nuerburgring</a> - it's much more familiar that way, I think)</p>
<hr />
<p>I noticed you're a bit slow with adding the maps to the districts you work on. If you don't mind I can create the maps for you, I usually finish them in a minute thanks to your templates. And I think the ones I created look a little bit better with the more smooth scaling. So if you don't mind you can focus on the text, while I do the maps for you - and if you continue alphabetically I can even prepare them so you can add them in your first edit already. Of course I will continue to write district texts myself as well. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 13:20 Mar 10, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I just seen on the german wikipedia the map of <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhineland-Palatinate_0b91.html" title="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a> with the district numbers is wrong - there is no district "Primasens", that is identical with <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suedwestpfalz.html" title="Suedwestpfalz">Suedwestpfalz</a>, thus all numbers above 19 are off by one. But as the map seems already scaled down from a higher resolution one I think it's best if you redo it. Also note that you forgot to add the number for <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germersheim_%28district%29.html" title="Germersheim (district)">Germersheim (district)</a>. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 14:42 May 3, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for suggesting me to sysop status. I hesitated so far to apply for it, as it will one make my status as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipediholic.html" title="Wikipediholic">Wikipediholic</a> more severe - but also because I prefer to spend the time on writing articles then to read administrative stuff on the mailing list.

<p>Hi Cordyph, just asking why my "pronunciation guide" to Bremen was removed. You live in Germany so you know that BRE rhymes with clay but remember that most of the English Wikipedia's readers are not aware of German pronunciation. Perhaps it could have been improved but I don't think it should have been removed. Your comments?<br />
PS I put those four pics of Bremen on, I went there when I was working for British Aerospace<br />

<p>Nice Motmot picture. As it happens, I'd just done a species list for motmots (what are the chances of that?), so I've added that, and I might be able to put a little more text later.

<p>Hmmmm ... Good queston. My wonderful big mammal book has a bit of an each-way bet - they clasify it as <i>Felis (Puma) concolor</i>! But, on the whole, they seem to think that many of the cats will soon be reclassified into a total of 8 genera, and that the Puma group (<a href="../../../p/u/m/Puma.html" title="Puma">Puma</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jaguarundi.html" title="Jaguarundi">Jaguarundi</a>) will be one of them: i.e., that <i>Puma</i> will become the standard. It's quite recent (2001) and edited by a bit of a who's who of mammologists, so I tend to trust it. Toss a coin, and take away the number you first thought of, I guess.

<p>I see you are back doing cats again tonight. Great! I've just spent a few hours trying to impose some uniformity and decent layout on some of the existing articles, and adding a new one, <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clouded_Leopard_81a9.html" title="Clouded Leopard">Clouded Leopard</a> which (I discovered part-way through) had already got a stub last year but under the scientific name so that no-one knew it was there. I figure I've got time for one more new one before I hit the sack. Are there any missing species accounts that you think ought to be first priority? Or will I just pick one at random? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> (BTW, if by any chance you would rather I cleared out and left you to do the cats your own way, just say the word - I have a million interests and could just as happily do another bird entry or more rodents.)</p>

<p>I noticed that a lot of articles on German cities and districts are or were located under the Umlaut-free versions of their names (e.g. <a href="../../../m/%C3%B6/l/M%C3%B6lln.html" title="Mölln">Mölln</a> at <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moelln.html" title="Moelln">Moelln</a>, <a href="../../../l/%C3%BC/c/L%C3%BCchow-Dannenberg_010a.html" title="Lüchow-Dannenberg">Lüchow-Dannenberg</a> at <a href="../../../l/u/e/Luechow-Dannenberg_35e3.html" title="Luechow-Dannenberg">Luechow-Dannenberg</a>).

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I can. When I began editing Wikipedia in 2002, the software was not able to retrieve article titles with umlauts. This changed sometime in late 2002 or early 2003, and so I asked on the mailing list, if it should be okay to create titles containg umlauts now. (See <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-June/004158.html" class="external free" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-June/004158.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-June/004158.html</a> for the thread). There was no definite answer, and we have still no convention on this, but now I think, that it is a good idea to change these articles to titles containing umlauts. I will do so in the future as well. Just a request: If you should create further articles with umlauts, please consider creating a redirect without as well. For example, if you should be interested in creating an article about the <i>Rhön</i>, create a redirect <i>Rhoen</i> pointing there as well. So we can avoid the parallel emerging of both articles (which already had happened for <i>Ruegen</i>, <i>Rügen</i>, before it was corrected). -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 20:56, 21 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Cordyph violated his neutrality and took sides in an edit war on <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silesia.html" title="Silesia">Silesia</a> by protecting the page (reverting to the other side's version) as soon as I changed it; he didn't do anything to prevent the other side from editing it before.

By the way: If you seriously claim, that I am protecting Nico, you must be blinded. I have no sympathy at all for his ideology.

<li>I invite anyone to look at the history of the article. Ruhrjung, I and even caius2 and szopen are trying to find a compromise. We have all modified our positions a lot, I think. However, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">User:Wik</a> is only reverting and reverting, and is not willing to discuss the case.

<ul>
<li>No, I am not. I was really enraged. You will see, that I made my edit on Ruhrjung's talk page just a few minutes after Wik's call for my de-adminship. So I apologise for my words, but I don't apologise for the page protection. It was, what several users had called for, and the version of Ruhrjung was apparently a version, that was accepted as a basis for discussion. I will now completely keep out of the Silesia article. My mediation is apparently not wanted. The discussion at this place is a proof, that Wik and Nico are not interested in achieving a compromise, so I give up. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 19:31, 24 Oct 2003 (UTC)

<li>All right. I believe you acted in good faith, you just didn't check out the issue properly. I never protested the protection, just your revertion to Ruhrjung's version, which I never accepted as a basis for discussion. But meanwhile Ed has reverted to a neutral version, so that matter is settled. I withdraw my request for de-adminship. If there are no further comments, the Cordyph section on this page can be deleted. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 20:07, Oct 24, 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is not correct. You may find a link to my first version of October 9 at Talk:Silesia/Archive1, and you will see that I have modified my position a lot, and that I have invited Wik to discuss his edits, and that I am highly interested in a compromise. But User:Wik has declared that he not will make a compromise, and he has not modified his position <i>überhaupt</i>. He is reverting every edit both I and Ruhrjung is making, and even caius2 has been reverted without discussion by him. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENico_e6d8.html" title="User:Nico">Nico</a> 19:58, 24 Oct 2003 (UTC)</li>

<p>Cordyph, your <i>backing off</i>-reaction is understandable — I have the same urge myself. But I wonder if that is good for wikipedia.</p>
<p>One could have expected a more cooperative attitude from <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">User:Wik</a>, who is a rather experienced wikipedian, having contributed to articles within a pretty wide field.</p>

<dd>Thanks, Ruhrjung. Now in the light of a new morning I wonder myself if it was good to surrender so fast. It was wrong from me to accuse Wik of "completely hopping mad". It has always been my strategy not to reply to insults with other insults, but in this case I apparently could not resist. So I repeat my apology for that. Nonetheless, I am extremely disappointed about Wik's reaction to my page protection. He never made an attempt to discuss the issue before, but as soon as the page was protected, he moved heaven and earth in order to call my neutrality into question, in a way, that I still regard as extremely unfair. When this de-admin request page became another battlefield for Nico and Wik, my first reaction was: Okay, let them rip out each other's throat, but without me. I don't need all this. If I would search a place for flames and insults, I know other places in usenet, but that is not the reason for me to help on Wikipedia. I will think about, if I should come back to that article, but not now. Good luck. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 09:43, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Space, nice to hear from you again. I am not sure if he is - but it is possible. That would mean, that he fooled me, since for a short period of time I thought, that he was on a way towards NPOV. Therefore I left some encouraging words on his talk page some days ago. His recent behaviour apparently shows, that I was wrong. His unpolite words towards Khym Chanur, you and many others show, that he did not learn his lesson.</dd>
<dd>The current state of edit wars is worse than it was ever before. I hope that this situation will come to an end soon, but I doubt that this will work without banning someone. (And you may know that I regard Wik just as problematic as Nico.)</dd>

<p>Hi, the last communication I had from <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a>, he was about to set off to northern Australia, hoping to get some good wildlife photos, but that was ages ago, and I've heard nothing since. I agree that it would be a pity if he really has left, and a loss to this project <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jim</a></p>
<p>I just want to agree with Jim. ;)</p>
<p>Err ... No. I want to say thanks for the welcome back, Baldhur, and I'm looking forward to filling in some missing areas with photos. Not just birds: I spent a day at the Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo (New South Wales) taking pictures of the mammals there for the 'pedia: antelope and wild dogs and so on. Trouble is, I forget what most of them are already! Sorry to hear you had problems here, but glad that you are back, even if only (like me) on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>Best -- Tony (<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 08:26, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Great! I don't have many carnivores. A nice Cheetah, but we already have PD ones just as good. I'll see what I can dig out in the dog department ... Oh dear - nothing much at all. (My day at Dubbo was almost two months ago, and my memory isn't what it ought to be.) No matter. I'll get onto the herbivores in due course, and trust that you'll be able to help me work out what they were.

<dd>Go right ahead. I'll upload some more in the morning. Perhaps I'll make a temp page with a few different things on it and you can pick out anything you like and can ID. (Most of them I'll be OK on, but I really only remember the birds properly - all my bird shots are in the wild, and when you spend all that time finding them, you tend to remember.) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 10:39, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most of the conventions are, I think, uncontentious. The main dispute was the use of capitals for individual species names, where the Americans preferred lower case. Capitals are accepted for birds, with a lower case redirect, and are <i>de facto</i> standard for <a href="../../../c/e/t/Cetacean.html" title="Cetacean">cetaceans</a>, where non-Americans have written most of the articles. Conversely, the fish are mainly written by Stan Stebs, and are lower case. I'll have a look. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jim</a></p>

<p>Yeah, I don't know. I've never been huge on the procedures on Wikipedia. Should we nominate him for de-adminship? Also, I tend towards the conclusion that Caius2ga ought to be banned, seeing as he's vandalized other people's user pages, and is completely unwilling to listen to what anybody else has to say, but I'm not sure how to do that. At any rate, Silesia is a complete mess. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 18:27, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, I've called a vote on some of the issues at <a href="../../../s/i/l/Talk%7ESilesia_107f.html" title="Talk:Silesia">Talk:Silesia</a> in an attempt to work out some kind of consensus. I'd appreciate your input. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 22:05, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have now invited users kpjas and Space Cadet, as you suggested. I had previously invited Szopen, who has participated in the debate. I'm sorry I (probably) deleted your vote...I was busy reverting caius2ga's attempt to hide the vote...I think you're right, though, that this is probably useless so long as caius2ga and wik refuse to vote. Wik's refusal to engage in almost any discussion at all is particularly irritating, since I imagine he might, unlike caius2ga, have actual useful things to say, if he would deign to explain himself to the rest of us... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 23:11, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was definitely going to keep an eye on it. I just don't want to get too involved...I won't withdraw entirely, I just want to sit back and cool off. As far as inviting Caius2ga, I suspect it won't do much good - and he surely knows that stuff is going on, so he's probably just sulking and preparing for another long burst of text... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 08:35, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Baldhur. I just posted the following over on the German 'pedia. (In English, so perhaps you would be good enough to translate it for me.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please forgive my writing in English (I have no German at all). At first I thought this was not an Emu at all, but maybe a Rhea. But on closer examination, I see that it <i>is</i> an Emu chick, about 3/4 grown - maybe 9 or 12 months old and almost ready to become an adult.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, it doesn't <i>look</i> very much like an Emu, so perhaps a different picture would be better. I'll have a look through my collection and see what I can find. (I'll upload them to the English Wikipedia as I have a username there and don't know how to upload them here.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It sure didn't look like an Emu, but it is. Compare with this (poor) photo of an emu chick:</p>
<p>[Image removed so it can be deleted from the Wikipedia server]</p>
<p>Here is a better (but still not very good) one. You may like to use it on the German 'pedia. I haven't loaded it up here as I don't really think it's good enough, and I like my pictures to be taken in the wild, especially with easy birds like Emus. This one is semi-tame (the top one is wild - and he had succeeded in raising 7 chicks in a bad drought year in southern <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> - not a bad effort!</p>

<p>All 3 Emus are adults, Baldhur. Only in the first picture is there a young one, which is part-obscured by the parent.

<p>Thanks, Baldhur...I'm trying to be more moderate because I still have hope that Taw and Caius (especially Taw, who as a sysop is obviously a respected cmmunity member) will be willing to compromise, and that Nico will as well. Obviously we have to get everyone to meet in the middle somehow:perhaps reference to both names? I don't know--maybe there is no good answer. I do hope, though, that you won't leave WP...even when I'm most frustrated, I realize that 95% of the work done here is productive and constructive....it's just too easy to be caught up in the drama of the 5% that isn't. What little of your editing I've encountered has impressed me, and I am heartened every day to know there are productive users like you around this place. I would be sad to see you leave: I suggest (if I may) that frustration is easiest handled by making new articles. It always calms me down, and gets me out of the conflicts that will never fully leave this place (we're human). Keep up the good work, and I hope we can work together on something productive in the future. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 22:51, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your kind words. Probably one should not take my words too serious. Actually I did already leave the English Wikipedia due to these events, but I returned just a week later. Now after becoming involved into this dispute anew frustration is growing again. It is just that I think, that it must be possible to talk to people and effect anything with quiet and polite words. But apparently some people around here are not interested in cooperation, but just in spreading their propaganda, and that makes me angry. I will go asleep now, maybe tomorrow I'll be in better temper. -- <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaldhur_abd2.html" title="User:Baldhur">Baldhur</a> 22:59, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that the discussion of Silesia seems to be continuing now, and that is of course very good. Just a warning: When an agreement was found with szopen and other contributors, caius2ga neither didn't participate in the discussion. First when the new version was finally accepted by all participants in the discussion he started to revert.</p>
<p>According to me, I will just let you know that I'm trusting in that John and the others will find an acceptable version, and wouldn't even think about starting reverting them. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENico_e6d8.html" title="User:Nico">Nico</a> 07:35, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know this game, Nico. Apparently Caius2ga left Wikipedia, and I consider it good news, not because of his bias, but because of his behaviour. But I know that there are others who would behave like him. And I do not know the golden way out of the dilemma. All I can do is hoping that a great number of Wikipedians involved in writing a neutral article will prevent partisans from reverting. -- <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaldhur_abd2.html" title="User:Baldhur">Baldhur</a> 10:22, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

I dont know if you can import images across wikis, but if not, i'll be happy to translate to german and upload the family trees you wish in the German wiki.

Leave a message in my talk page with the family trees you want in the German wiki and i promise i do what i can. By the way, i'm constructing the Norway, Sweden and Denmark royal trees.
