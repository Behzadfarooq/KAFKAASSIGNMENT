<dd>You said: "I read and re-read the FUC, but couldnt find a clause that would prevent a promotional material from being used for a living person's article. By your reasoning, there wont be any actor page with a photo and this is not what Wikipedian users want. I browsed through dozens of actor images in Wikipedia and they are all promotional images (for eg: Nagesh pic from Server Sundaram). I dont see how these promotional images constitute a violation of Wikipedia's principles, as the picture's original purpose is for extensive spread among the public. By your actions, the only thing that was done was to make the pages totally dull and unattractive."</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for your note on my talk page.</p>
<p>I was unhappy with your edit to <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rani_Mukerjee_185a.html" title="Rani Mukerjee">Rani Mukerjee</a> for various reasons, each to do with style rather than content. I would normally fix such minor errors myself, but I was (and am) very busy, and I rather hoped that somebody else (perhaps you yourself) would copyedit and resubmit the edit if the information was considered worthy of inclusion. As it stood, with so many minor errors in so short an edit, I felt that it was questionable whether the edit really improved the article, or detracted from it.</p>
<p>Please consider the following:</p>
<p>1) while her another movie <a href="../../../p/a/h/Paheli.html" title="Paheli">Paheli</a><br /></p>
<p>Punctuation, slang, style (film titles should be in italics), and particularly grammar.... compare with....</p>
<p>while another film of hers, <i><a href="../../../p/a/h/Paheli.html" title="Paheli">Paheli</a></i></p>
<p>2) edging over black<br /></p>
<p>I do understand this, yet I think that the meaning is somewhat unclear - please revise "edging over", and capitalise and italicise the film title, ie <i>Black</i></p>
<p>3) Your remark was placed immediately before a reference to an article titled "Black steals the show", which clearly relates to the comment <i>before</i> your remark, and does not actually mention <i>Paheli</i> at all. Please consider placing your comment after the reference (moving the period to the new end of the sentence) so that it this is clear.</p>
<p>Also, please remember to sign your comments on talk pages using four tildes (~~~~).</p>
<p>I hope that I not caused offense, and that you find this helpful.</p>

<p>I am guessing you are referring to latitude and longitude on bot-created articles. The bot did use Fallingrain as it's reference whereever it could find a match for the town name. If it did not find a exact match with the census name, it will not be able to pull the geo-coords in. That's what happened in many towns and cities.

<p>It would be great if you can provide info about <i>Theemidhi</i>, <i>Chatti</i> and other rituals, but I think it would be more appropirate to include these things in the article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariamman.html" title="Mariamman">Mariamman</a> itself in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariamman.html#Amman_temples" title="Mariamman">Amman temples</a> section.

<dd>The article looks much better now. But there still were a few minor style issues, typos, errors, etc., which I have corrected. With reference to 'project under construction', there is absolutely no urgency... you can take your own time. You can even add inline citations later, but everytime you hit that 'Save page' button after editing an article, you got to make sure the content is free from copyright issues, however small or crude it may be. As User:Mattisse notes below, wikipedia is indexed by search engines and mirrors frequently and it's not good to have copyrighted content here for even a single day. You may argue that there are many other pages in wikipedia that are copy/pasted from external websites, I agree, that's why wherever I find such a thing, I try to clean it up then and there.

<p>Articles are supposed to be created by editors, not by one person all at once. That defeats the whole purpose of Wikipedia -- it's supposed to be a collaborative effort, not as you say one person working "for the last one week, I've sat day and night". It is much harder to reference an article correctly when it is written as you say it was, by one person. That is called Original Research and it is against Wikipedia policies. See <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</p>
<p>But however the article is created, its has to have references for its sources. It is Wikipedia policy that any editor can remove information from an article if that information is not sourced.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">User:TomTheHand</a> who is an Administrator and expert on referencing always suggest that people lool at this article: <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a> to get an idea of what is meant by the non negotiable policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> with a how-to in <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> is another example that I like better because it is not a conflict article. I just wrote a really simple article, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teardrops_from_My_Eyes_823b.html" title="Teardrops from My Eyes">Teardrops from My Eyes</a>, with references.</p>
<p>Anyway if you don't understand all this, let me know and I will try to help you out. What is you source material? You need to have links to online sources and page numbers and ISBN number for books. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 04:27, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did look at the online links. The first link was mostly had "page not found" links or didn't have the information to verify your article. Your article must be verifiable. I didn't check out TempleNet completely because you have already been told that you cannot cut and paste from it. Also, I know what is on TempleNet and a lot of what you have in the article is not from there. Plus, you have to tell people more specifically where the information came from, not just a link to the front page. I will go through your article and put "citation missing" tags on it. That will notifiy people that the article has problems and encourage them to help you find the sources. I'm also willing to help you more, but I can't if I don't know where the information came from. Let me know what I can do for you. (Don't worry -- Wikipedia is supposed to be a process with everyone working on an article -- it's not expected that it be perfect right away.) <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 04:55, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>O.K. but the part under Mythology was a word-for-word copy from Templenet, so I had to remove it. Wikipedia can be sued for copyright violations so they are very strict about that. Where in the first link is there any useful information? I can't find it.

<p>Wikipedia articles get mirrored thousands of times through Google etc. If you have an article up for even one day, in the next day or two it will be all over the internet. Then Templenet will notice -- I'm sure they keep their eye on Wikipedia anyway as it is very commom for people to just lift their stuff. Just write the article one sentence at a time. I wrote most of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennakesava_Temple_a2aa.html" title="Chennakesava Temple">Chennakesava Temple</a> and if you look in the History you can see how long it took me before other people helped.

Here's another I wrote <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chidambaram_Temple_7cab.html" title="Chidambaram Temple">Chidambaram Temple</a> -- which you can see needs more work and a good picture. Here's another <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badami_Cave_temple_9588.html" title="Badami Cave temple">Badami Cave temple</a> that looks better because of the pictures!

He know a great deal about temple architecture and also comes up with some wonderful pictures too. He is also organizing the temple project and coming up with consensus rules. He feels, except for a few temples, most temples should be merged with the town they are in and maybe he is right. He says its because the life of a town centers around the temples, plus there are too many temples with the same name. And too many different ways the names are spelled. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattisse_db4b.html" title="User talk:Mattisse">(talk)</a> 05:39, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm confused with what is happening with the Hindu temple issue. <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennakesava_Temple_a2aa.html" title="Chennakesava Temple">Chennakesava Temple</a> is an example of what <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">User:Dineshkannambadi</a> is doing. He is working on a coordinated effort regarding Hindu temple architecture. See <a href="../../../h/o/y/Hoysala_architecture.html" title="Hoysala architecture">Hoysala architecture</a> for another example, as well as <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somanathapura.html" title="Somanathapura">Somanathapura</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/d/Doddagaddavalli.html" title="Doddagaddavalli">Doddagaddavalli</a>. What is the focus of your articles, that is, is the aim just to generate an article on every temple? From what I understand from <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">User:Dineshkannambadi</a>, that is pretty much impossible as there are so many temples and the same temple can have many different names. Plus the same name is often used for many different temples. I believe some thought must be put in to developing some organizing facter.

<dd>The citations are from University papers(books); University papers are valid primary sources to be cited as per wikipedia guidelines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the Christian missionary reports are valid in Ayyavazhi matters. Because, they are of anti-Ayyavazhi view. They call Ayyavazhi and Vaikundar as satanic agents in series of LMS Reports. So view points on one thing, from opposite side is valid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The book "Religion and Subalter Agency" is a reserch book from University of Madras based on study on Ayyavazhi from 33 top known theologians from Ayyavazhi. So it may not be considered as a questionable book.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then Ayyavazhi is not a sect of Hinduism.

<dd>Ayyavazhi is seen within the hinduism so far. Any thing highlightable in Ayyavazhi is seen as that of hindu. But the basic structure is not Hindu. This religion has seperate Holy places, scriptures, theology etc.. Apart from Some University papers there are no external sources.

<p>You going on moving rudely against Ayyavazhi articles. Please understand friend. I've cite dwith Newspaper report. The govet have dsclared the festival day as a holiday. This itself is an indirect proof for the existence of the religion. More over the reserch books from proffessors are used as citation in the ayyavazhi article. Many books are from external sources. <a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a> reports, which call <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaikundar.html" title="Vaikundar">Vaikundar</a> and <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">Ayyavazhi</a> as satanic agents are used as citation for the spread of the religion.</p>

<p>Friend, Again why you are in complete speed towards deleting Ayyavazhi? I've cited that Ayyavazhi is a religion by the University release, Religion and Subaltern Agency. Why you are not considering the offline notabilities? Generelly this is the problem with India related works. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ayyavazhi#No_reference" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ayyavazhi#No_reference" rel="nofollow">Please see this</a>(scroll down for the discussion of <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChancemill_4449.html" title="User:Chancemill">User:Chancemill</a>) Also offline sources are again important to inda related articles. Please see the discussion of <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">User:Doctorbruno</a> I cited earlier. Commonly, even reserch Books from Universities lack <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBN_9609.html" title="ISBN">ISBN</a> status in India.</p>
<p>Please stop the effort of deleting. Again Try to Understand the situation,</p>
<p>Right from the biggining I started editing, I am trying to make understand the users. I had to make use of a lot of time and effort to make them understand. After some days another user use to come with the same issue. Then I've to repeat all these to them. So,</p>
<p>Friend, understand Please - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj">Paul</a> 16:44, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The statement about the lack of solid historical evidence is valid as it is in the article as there has been very few found so far. The megalithic finds are not valid as evidence for 'Tamil history'. They are simply evidence of human habitation in the region.

<p>I saw your talk with GourangaUK and I agree with you. I seriously doubt that more than 500 million Hindus (which is supposed to be the number of Vaishnavites) have never worshipped Shiva, Ganesha and others devas/devis. There are probably some exclusive worshippers, but I doubt that they are the majority. These "sects" that that the Western scholars has put are used to divide Hindus. But Hinduism is much more diverse and united than four sects. Some villagers worship their own gods along with the main ones. There are some who even worship Ravana and others who say even Jesus Christ and Allah areultimately the same thing as Bhagawan. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 07:44, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Mattisse on this one - the info box looks out of place.

<dd>Boxes look good on plant articles, but not on all Hindu related subjects. It makes them look like '<a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Trumps_e87a.html" title="Top Trumps">Top Trumps</a>' cards, rather than an enclopedia entry. That's IMHO anyway.

<p>Hi - I see you have created two new stub types. As it clearly explains at <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">WP:STUB</a>, and at the top of most stub categories, all new stub types should be proposed prior to creation at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a>, so that they can be checked for viability, and to make sure they don't go against either the stub category hierarchy or stub naming conventions. In the case of your new stub type, it was not proposed, and it is possible that it will not reach the standard threshol;d of 60 current stubs for it to be considered viable. The stub types have been listed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_Discoveries_017f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Discoveries">Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Discoveries</a> - please make any comments as to the reasons for and possible population of this new stub type. Be warned that they may be nominated for deletion via <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a> if deemed not to conform to normal stub type criteria. Please, in future, if you wish to create a new stub type, propose it first! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 04:30, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>I was creating a couple of literature articles didnt find any stub category to fit them. So, created them. I'm not aware of the stub creation process, so if there is one kindly fit these in.

</dl>
<p>Stubwise, literature is split mainly by genre, not by language or place of origin - poetry uses poetry-stub, romance novels use romance-novel-stub, children's books use child-book-stub, and so on. Writers are split by nationality, though (and there is an India-writer-stub). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 09:39, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>[User:Dipendra2007] Hi, I notice that you have used an atypical version of the Kali image <a href="../../../k/a/l/Image%7EKali2.JPG_f246.html" title="Image:Kali2.JPG">Image:Kali2.JPG</a>. We think that it gives out an incorrect interpretation of the Goddess, could you alter it to more mainstream one?</p>
<p>The Goddess Kali is a complex deity. In villages of North Sri Lanka and in Nepal she is often viewed in an un-iconic form without the elaborate iconography that the picture you posted depicts. She is seen as pure power that shatters all limitations that confront the devotee - be they mundane or spiritual. Interesting, the bandit queen - Phulan Devi who belonged to a scheduled caste herself always sought the blessings of the Goddess. So did the robber tribe called the thuggees in the ravines of Chambal.</p>
<p>The picture you have uploaded incidentally is grotesque, hideous and would be seen as demonic by a casual non-Hindu who reads the article. It does not do justice to the complex strands that define concept under consideration. Why not use a more mainstream picture or just the face. The Bengal school of iconography i.e. the two eyes with the tilak on the forehead stands out. Or the south-Indian Bhadrakali i.e. of Kali emerging from the fire. Thank you and may all blessings be upon you one month ahead of the lunar new year - i.e. Ugadi. --- <i>This unsigned comment was left by <a href="../../../d/i/p/User_talk%7EDipendra2007_8fed.html" title="User talk:Dipendra2007">Dipendra2007</a></i></p>

<dd>There is no "We" in this discussion. It is him and only him. Please do not think that more than one person is upset by the picture. So far there are only three people involved in the discussion (including myself, Dipendra2007, and another editor). Dipendra2007 is the only person who objects to it.

<p>The picture <a href="../../../k/a/l/Image%7EKali2.JPG_f246.html" title="Image:Kali2.JPG">Image:Kali2.JPG</a> that you uploaded has become part of a debate on the Kali talk page (<a href="../../../k/a/l/Talk%7EKali_d0be.html#Please_respond" title="Talk:Kali">See here</a>).

<p>Earlier you expressed concerns about POV in Ayyavazhi portal articles. I modified lead of Ayyavazhi article to reflect the opinion that it is primarily sect of Hinduism than separate religion.
