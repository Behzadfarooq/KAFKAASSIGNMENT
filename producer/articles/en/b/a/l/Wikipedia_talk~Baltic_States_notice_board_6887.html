I will mention this board here and there, for instance at <a href="http://www.latviansonline.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.latviansonline.com/" rel="nofollow">Latvians Online</a>. I append a link to my user page in the signature to my e-mails lately (and will link this board at my user page, too) ...but I haven't had much luck with getting people I think would make valuable contributors and good editors involved (as I'm sure everybody contributing has noticed, articles can take an awful lot of time, and participation can be intimidating). A hearty <i>ačiū</i> to <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> for coming up with this idea for Baltic co-operation and acting upon it so quickly! --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteris_Cedrins_3875.html" title="User:Peteris Cedrins">Pēteris Cedriņš</a> 13:21, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had posted invitements to join Wikipedia in Lithuanian history forums once, but as well did not get much luck it seems. Anyways, it is easier to help people who are already in Wikipedia to stay/contribute more than to attract completely new people I guess. So, once we decide that thing sare done with this board, we could write informative messages to tell Baltic contributors of Wikipedia about this board, using the talk pages (taht informative messages could be written in Lithuanian, Latvian and English - it seems we have no Estonians here still to write the Estonian version. As well, we could write welcome messages in Baltic langauges, which we would send (via talk page) to every new presumable Baltic member; we would encourage them to stay here, explain some things, tell to ask us in case they'd have some questions, and tell about this board too. In order not to get too much into details (if we will wait until this board will be perfect before advertising we will never start), how about setting a date for "official opening", it could be for example next Monday (13th of February). And no need to thank me, I was thinking about such board for long, but did not seen enough active contributors, as I think Renata and me would be not enough to start such a board (especially as I don't plan to spend much time on wikipedia), while 3 people might be good for start, and 4 (if <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVecrumba_0507.html" title="User:Vecrumba">User:Vecrumba</a> will take part) will be even better. It will take some time for it to start up I believe so that many people would come, but a few enthusiasts can already make the board alive for enough time. So, the best what we can do now is to use it by reporting things and such, if other users will join and report - check the articles they report so that the board would seem useful to them. For now we are setting it up, and when it starts we will see - if we will use it, it should come up eventually. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 14:48, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People know abot wikipedia, but they are not craving to edit.

<p>I think we would benefit from such thing - there defenetely are things that deserve article, some things are already covered in other articles or there already is article named diferently so they don`t need article and proper naming in english is important, so I think that maybe this board should have section for that (or something) -- <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXil_3879.html" title="User:Xil">Xil</a>/<a href="../../../x/i/l/User_talk%7EXil_b170.html" title="User talk:Xil">talk</a> 19:11, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

But it seems somewhat similar to the Baltic Way (human chain hugging the Baltic Sea, all three states participating), so if is was before it... I could easily draw parallels.

<dd>I have no Idea about this event, but it reminded me another thing - there is an event called "prayer to sea" in Latvia so I googled a bit and found out that it dates back to september 3. 1988. as that webpage I found said "live chain of people encircled largest part of Latvian coastline. Interesting that exposition at museum of popular front begins with similar large scale photograpgy". As far I know This event is still held once in a while. And in fact Latvian ecology movement in the eighties was pretty much political. <a href="http://www.ltn.lv/~vak/lugsanaj.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.ltn.lv/~vak/lugsanaj.jpg" rel="nofollow">Image depicting event(s)</a> -- <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXil_3879.html" title="User:Xil">Xil</a>/<a href="../../../x/i/l/User_talk%7EXil_b170.html" title="User talk:Xil">talk</a> 02:20, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"don't use them in advertising" means no commercial use. And such images are not allowed on wiki. If they said something like "use it, but just cite the source/author" - it could be used.

<p>I have attempted to keep the names of Lithuanian cities first English, and then Lithuanian, in the English Wikipedia. The need of some Polish editors to maintain "mental" possesion of these cities seems to be part of some relentless campaign to revert my efforts. As a compromise, I have left Polish names of towns and cities during the "occupation" of the Vilnius Region alone. My position is that the names of geographical locations in Lithuania do not have to have their "Polish" names included in the leads of articles (especially when there is a link to a Polish article). To see if there was a <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quid_Pro_Quo_5b55.html" title="Quid Pro Quo">Quid Pro Quo</a> attitude, I put a few Lithuanian names into Polish articles (Liublinas and Gnieznas), and the response was predictably to remove them. So what was good for the Gander was not good for the Goose. What is the consensus? <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 02:01, 7 May 2006 (UTC) p.s. I have made the same edits to German and Russian names as well.</p>
<p>OK, <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a>. But it's better to write up all our arguments here or, even better, in a separate page before doing that. I understand, that all arguments are already known and it's no fun to repeat them once more elsewhere, but , i'm afraid, we need a general discussion instead of many local discussions. Having that, we'll be able just to redirect all escalations of discussions on many different pages to that page after we'll have revised Lithuania-related articles as you suggest.</p>
<p>The main problem is that, looking formally at single cases, inserting of Slavic variants for Lithuanian names isn't bias itself. But many users have already warned about possible political context of this action, especially when it becomes frequent. We shouldn't ignore this admonition, even if it isn't real but impressive only. I always remember some our Lithuanian users that were so affected by that impression, that couldn't contribute profitably, focusing their minds at that and ignoring many other aspects of writing in Lithuania-related articles. So, this impression of some planned political bias is real, despite it was or not a planned bias in reality.</p>
<p>The next problem is, that the present style to put the Slavic variants in the head section of an article is misleading. When we present any object (a city, a town, a river etc in our case) it's obviously held in the mind that we write about the current state of the object (if it has a current state at all). But all these Slavic forms are from the historical usage, that is also very hypothetic in many cases (meaning, obviously using in English. I believe, that English-speaking people really used Slavic forms for <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius.html" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> re it was the capital, but I doubt if Slavic forms for some small villages could be found in English sources other but maps that merely repeated the official usage of their time). But using in the header section makes them to seem as if they are of the current usage. So, I think, the information about names in the past should be transferred to history sections everywhere, if such information is necessary at all. It should have an acceptable and not biased form too, i think. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinasLit_ca0d.html" title="User:LinasLit">Linas Lituanus</a> 07:51, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. Let's think about the moving the discussion to a separate page. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinasLit_ca0d.html" title="User:LinasLit">Linas</a> 07:51, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'd also like to say few words about the issues you did write in some different pages or articles. For example, You wander, how young Lithuanians lost their ability to communicate in Russian <a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">User talk:Lysy</a>). But it's very simple thing. Russian had never been a native language for the majority of Lithuanians. We were taught at school to speak Russian. Since 1990 Russian language is taught in Lithuanian schools as an elective discipline and, consequently, many young people do not know Russian at all. Number of Russian lessons was also reduced after 1990 to a standard level for foreign language. It also affects quality of learning. But nothing wandering in it. I say this, because I see, how you face all these absurds about Lithuania's past, that are disseminated especially by some Poles. Spread of Lithuanian language has been well-documented at least since the 16 th century, Lithuanian language had its written grammars since the 17 th century, but one Polish user says, that common people in Lithuania (In <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taurage.html" title="Taurage">Tauragė</a>) spoke Belarusian. And he can write about a 16 th century lexicographer of Lithuanian language after it! It seems very strange, looking objectively. On the other hand, to strive against totalitarian nationalism isn't the objective of Wikipedia. I try not to pay much attention to what some people think about Lithuania, even if they suppose that no Lithuania exists at all. Fair attitude towards World reality is, perhaps, a personal choice of everybody. I'm Lithuanian, i know Lithuanians, many of the are quite big nationalists. But Lithuanians aren't totalitarian nationalists in any case. Nationalism almost never subdues their mental possibility to judge about something. And even this difference shows that Lithuanians are sui generis nation that is different from its neighbor nations. That's why i don't afraid the 'mental possession' as You name it. Polish thinking is sunk in the history too much. There is no much difference for our being what language did we speak or even do we speak presently. Irish people mostly communicate in English, and what from it? Every nation has more essential attributes than linguistic forms or historic legends.</p>
<p>But what i say doesn't mean that we shouldn't oppose bias, wherever it becomes evident in Wikipedia. So i say thanks for your sincere and courageous (isn't this word old-fashioned?) position. Thank You also for Your analyzing of this strange picture of Lithuania, made by the users i 've told above. But the reality is much essential than any pictures, despite how much they differ from their original. Number of Lithuanian users was never big, but they have put many useful information about Lithuania here. Wikipedia readers now can know at least anything about Lithuania. Let's work for increasing this amount of information. SĖKMĖS! <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinasLit_ca0d.html" title="User:LinasLit">Linas Lituanus</a> 09:50, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would somebody beso kind as to give English title for the quoted Lituanian sources?

The other patterns on the same line are suppose to inhibit the rule. E.g. for the Russian board /florida/ inhibits /petersburg/ rule as the article is most probably about the American city. If you are reasonably familiar with the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_expression.html" title="Regular expression">regular expressions</a> and know what you are doing, you can edit the rules straight away, but better ask me. In the Russian board I had to remove some rules: e.g. there are a lot of non-Russians named Vladimir and Chita, so I had to remove the names of the cities or have to much false positive. If you are interested why an article went to the list there is log on the <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexNewArtBot_BalticLog_6039.html" title="User:AlexNewArtBot/BalticLog">User:AlexNewArtBot/BalticLog</a> explaining the rule that sent an article to the searchresults (if the log is cleared try to look into the history of the log).</p>
