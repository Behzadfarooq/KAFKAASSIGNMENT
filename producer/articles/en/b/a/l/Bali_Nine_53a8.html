The remaining three, Norman, Chen and Nguyen were all sentenced to life imprisonment on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>.

<p>Police are unclear how the two groups from Sydney and Brisbane are linked, however established movements of members of the group before their departure for Indonesia. Several of the Bali Nine were employed with Eurest Australia, a multinational catering company of over 9,000 employees. Matthew Norman, Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens, and Andrew Chan, a supervisor with the company, all worked for Eurest who provided hospitality services to the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Cricket_Ground_b665.html" title="Sydney Cricket Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> where the group were employed.</p>
<p>Rush and Czugaj claim they were recruited by fellow defendant and suspected <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financier.html" title="Financier">financier</a> of the smuggling plan, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tan_Duc_Thanh_Nguyen_6903.html" title="Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen">Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen</a> while socialising at a <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaoke.html" title="Karaoke">karaoke</a> bar in Brisbane. Rush had met Nguyen six months earlier whilst fishing. Rush travelled to Sydney with Nugyen to attend a 21st birthday party where he was introduced to Sukumaran, who called himself "Mark". Several days later Rush returned to Sydney with friend Michael Czugaj where plans for the pairs travel to Indonesia was organised. Rush and Czugaj had never travelled abroad.</p>
<p>Lawrence had travelled to Bali on three occasions, first arriving on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_16.html" title="October 16">October 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, then on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and again on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.

<p>Lawrence and Stephens arrived in Indonesia on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a>, followed by close school friends from Brisbane, Rush and Czugaj, arriving two days later on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_8.html" title="April 8">April 8</a>. The group were introduced at the Hard Rock Hotel where Chan and Sukumaran were staying, having earlier arrived in Bali. During their stay police noted the group would spend a large amount of time indoors in their hotel rooms. The group met again on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">April 16</a> for what police allege was a final briefing, before meeting for their final time at the airport before their <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_17.html" title="April 17">April 17</a> arrest.</p>
<p>After receiving information from the Australian Federal Police about the group, including the names, passport numbers and information relating to their links to possible illegal drug trade, Indonesian police placed the group under constant surveillance for a week before their arrest. Indonesian police believe heroin was supplied to Chan by a Thai woman, Cherry Likit Bannakorn, 22 <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Cherry"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_Cherry" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_Cherry" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span>. Likit was believed to have left Bali on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, one day after the arrests of the nine Australians, and was briefly detained at the Thai-Malaysian border (until Indonesian police arrived), however, was released when paperwork was not in order for her to be extradited back to Indonesia <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_dead"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_dead" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_dead" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Head of the surveillance team, I Nyoman Gatra, later testified in court during trials for the accused that police were initially unaware Sukumaran was part of the group as original information obtained from the AFP did not mention him by name. Indonesian police assumed Sukumaran was Chan's bodyguard as he was seen to accompany Chan throughout Bali. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_re-enact"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_re-enact" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_re-enact" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span></p>

All were carrying quantities of heroin in plastic bags strapped to their bodies. Between them they were carrying more than 8.3 kilograms of heroin.</p>
<p>On the same evening, Chan, the organiser of the plan, was removed from a commercial flight about to depart Ngurah Rai Airport for Australia. Chan had several mobile phones in his possession, but was carrying no drugs when arrested. He was believed to be the person responsible for collecting the heroin from the couriers upon their arrival in Australia <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_profiles"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_profiles" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_profiles" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span>.</p>

<p>Indonesian law does not require that arrested people be immediately charged with an offense, and by <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> no charges had been laid. Police indicated that the five arrested at the airport would be charged with drug trafficking, which carries the death penalty, while those arrested in the hotel would be charged with the lesser offence of drug possession, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_26.html" title="April 26">April 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, media speculation suggested that Sukumaran, not Chan, was the main organiser of the drug courier operation. Andrew Chan recruited the other eight to act as <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_mules.html" title="Drug mules">drug mules</a> - couriers who would not arouse suspicion while carrying heroin to Australia - and offered them AUD$10,000 to AUD$15,000 each to carry out this task.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_27.html" title="April 27">April 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Colonel Bambang Sugiarto, head of the Bali police drug squad, said police would seek to have all nine charged with offenses which carry the death penalty. He revealed that several of the nine had previously visited Bali using false passports, suggesting that they had acted as drug couriers before. Indonesian police released video evidence showing heroin being removed from the bodies of the four arrested at the airport.</p>
<p>Indonesian police initially maintained that Chan was the "mastermind" of the importation plan. "They were following Chan's instructions and if they didn't follow the instructions their families would be killed", Sugiarto said.</p>
<p>Australian police said that they believed that an Australian drug syndicate was behind the plan. Mike Phelan, International Operations Chief of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Federal_Police_32ae.html" title="Australian Federal Police">Australian Federal Police</a> (AFP), said, "This is obviously some sort of sophisticated syndicate. In excess of 10 kg of heroin is a large amount and by definition it requires a distribution network here in Australia."</p>
<p>Lawyers in Indonesia engaged by the families of those arrested appeared in media interviews to concede that the four arrested at the airport were acting as drug couriers. Anggia Browne was quoted as saying, "They are only couriers - they did it just for money." She said they were from low-income families, and did not know that drug trafficking in Indonesia carries the death penalty.</p>

<p>Parents of defendants Scott Rush and Renae Lawrence criticised the Australian Federal Police for allowing the Indonesian police to arrest the nine, rather than allowing them to fly to Australia and arresting them in Sydney upon their return.</p>
<p>Terry O'Gorman, president of the Australian Council of Civil Liberties said that Australian police had unnecessarily exposed the nine to the possibility of the death penalty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is despite the fact that the AFP was the primary investigator and that the end point for the alleged crime was Australia," <i>he said.</i> "It is unexplained why the AFP agreed to hand the case over to the Indonesians with such potentially grave consequences for those arrested."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The policy is that we will not give evidence that will, or information that will, directly cause or result in somebody receiving the death penalty, but the reality is in this case, it would appear, on the allegation, that these people have been caught red-handed with heroin in Indonesia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, and excuse the expression, he (<i>AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty)</i> is an arsehole. These kids were forced into this … they should have been either arrested at the airport here or followed to get the big guys.

<p>Rush's father, Lee Rush was quoted as saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was informed at 1.30 in the morning that Scott would be spoken to and asked not to board the flight to Bali. It wasn't until about mid-morning that I received a call from Bob (Rush's lawyer) and a distressed tone in his voice he said "Mate, we could not stop him, they have let him go through and he's on his way to Bali'. Under no circumstances do I condone the trafficking of drugs - I particularly dislike drugs of any nature, always have. When I received a call from the Australian Government authorities that Scott had been detained in Indonesia for attempting to export heroin, I was speechless, sickened to the gut.<sup id="_ref-auststory_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-auststory" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rush's mother, Christine Rush, also spoke of her disappointment with the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel very let down by our Australian Federal Police - we tried to lawfully stop our son leaving the country, it wasn't done.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_stop"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_stop" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_stop" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span>". "The Federal Police can do, go wherever they want, do anything, anytime without supervision from the Australian Attorney-General or from the Justice Minister," she said.

Mike Phelan of the AFP also agreed to appear on the program to respond to the Rush family's criticisms. Phelan said during the program</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Even with the aid of hindsight, should the same set of circumstances present themselves again with another syndicate or other people, we would do exactly the same thing" <i>and that</i> "there have also been a large number of young lives on the other side of the ledger that have been saved as a result of the AFP's operations over many years."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_auststory"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_auststory" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/l/Bali_Nine_53a8.html#endnote_auststory" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keelty later said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If someone went back to Lee Rush and assured him that Scott would not be able to travel then that is their call," he said. "We would never have given any assurance, because there was no lawful reason to prevent him from travelling. My sympathy is with Lee Rush because somebody has misled him."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever gave Lee Rush the assurance that his son would be prevented from travelling acted dishonourably. There is no way anyone in the AFP would have provided that assurance because there was simply no power to detain him. He was not wanted on warrants, there were no conditions of his bail that prevented him from travelling overseas.</p>

<p>Rush further accused Chan of strapping the heroin to his body whilst wearing rubber gloves. Chan protested his innocence and defending his silence during his final plea, reading from a two page statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn't say anything in court because if I did, I'd be lying. The truth is, I know nothing. A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be.
