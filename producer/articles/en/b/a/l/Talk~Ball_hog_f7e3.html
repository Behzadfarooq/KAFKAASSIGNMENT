<p>Wildnox, I see you DO have a "TRUE" opinion on this article. Otherwise, you won't bother to change it everyday. If you really like to name people as ballhog, why don't you put all of their names in this article. It will be a gallery of displays, a ballhog hall of fame.

<dd>That tells me that this article has been wrong for so long that people consider changing the article to a more neutral point of view a vandalism. I don't make compromises? Tell that to people who have been reverting this article to the old one. Why aren't they adding anything else? Consensus is not an objective point of view.

<p>What's strange is I have no true opinion on this article, as I only got here through recent changes and don't follow basketball. What I would like to see is a comprimise. My Idea would be to keep the sentence that keeps being debated, but to add counterpoint(something about the fact that the label is subjective, instead of based on a solid criteria). Additional examples of players who have, wether desevered or not, been labeled by some as ball hogs, preferably from more than just the recent years, would make the part in question appear less like picking on two players. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildnox_f5f1.html" title="User:Wildnox">Wildnox</a> 01:33, 17 August 2006 (UTC) (sorry about the last sentence being kind of a mess)</p>

<dd>The subjectivity of the term is already noted in the article. I really see no benefit to applying such a loaded term to anyone playing professionally in this article - leave that for the commentators. So my vote goes for having the contentious paragraph go the way of the pics that used to be here - vandalism magnets both. - <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenozoicEra_e9b8.html" title="User:CenozoicEra">CenozoicEra</a> 00:22, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

An opinion is a belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or proof. It is subjective. Wikipedia is not a place for opinionated criticism. Wikipedia is a place where people can get an unbiased information that maintain a neutral POV. Furthermore, this page is about ballhog. It is not a page about NBA players.

<p>The use of pictures to illustrate the article is not POV. Kobe is mentioned as a ball hog in the article (cited as well) so it is entirely appropriate to use an image here. It would perhaps be POV if there was a picture of Kobe but he wasn't mentioned in the article. For the same reason, the image of Iverson was appropriate, but was removed due to copyright (it's not fair use). <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 02:33, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I concur. Bryant has been labelled as a ball hog by the media for much of his career. Jordan was too and Iverson often still is. There is nothing inappropriate with the image. On a somewhat related note, contrary to what our friend Hganesan says above, I was not the person added the Bryant image to the article. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 03:02, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having a pic here is probably not the best thing in light of the apparently irresistable urge of everyone to change it to their own personal least favs. It also doesn't really shed any light on the nature of ball-hogging. So I have removed it, and hope that the article will stay pic-free.

<p>If a picture is available for an article it should be used. Kobe bryant is mentioned in the article as often being singled out for being a ball-hogg therefore it makes sense to include his picture since one is available. Wikipedia generally has a large prefference of including pictures in articles if they are available. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrodey_83f7.html" title="User:Brodey">Brodey</a> 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. The article for "democracy" doesn't have a (single) picture - should it contain one of the US or USSR? It's also not really possible for a single picture to show ball hogging. And vandalism is a constant problem whenever there is a pic on this page. Just check the record - you even had to revert one recently yourself. I think the pic is a bad idea. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenozoicEra_e9b8.html" title="User:CenozoicEra">CenozoicEra</a> 00:03, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This material is generally self-evident. If someone really wanted to, I suppose one could demand a citation for each and every sentence. I don't think that this tag is appropriate for this article. Please use the FACT tag if and where you think it is needed. Of course, bear in mind that there are no official statistics for ball-hogging (and it's too subjective a term to even be nailed down), so any facts offered in support would almost certainly constitute <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. - <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenozoicEra_e9b8.html" title="User:CenozoicEra">CenozoicEra</a> 00:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The thing is the article lacks any type of citation at all. Any kind of source indicating any of the material in the article should be added. As for <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>: as of right now, the entire article is technically OR. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildnox_f5f1.html" title="User:Wildnox">Wildnox</a> 00:32, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, I would suggest that the current article has no original research at all, but is <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_knowledge.html" title="Common knowledge">common knowledge</a>. I don't think that anyone who grew up playing basketball in the U.S. would be surprised at any of the article's content. Second, not all articles necessarily need citations (<a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_%28basketball%29.html" title="Center (basketball)">Center (basketball)</a> has none at all), nor do all facts need a citation (<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s birth date is uncited). Citations are really only necessary when there is some element of uncertainty involved. - <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenozoicEra_e9b8.html" title="User:CenozoicEra">CenozoicEra</a> 01:54, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I do see your point. I'm very surprised that <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_%28basketball%29.html" title="Center (basketball)">Center (basketball)</a> has no citations at all. Feel free to remove the tag, though I still think citations would be nice as I support the use of the them as much as possible. I thought citations were required in all situations where it wasn't common knowledge, and not just for things that are uncertain, but I can't find nothing that indicates such. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildnox_f5f1.html" title="User:Wildnox">Wildnox</a> 02:13, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
