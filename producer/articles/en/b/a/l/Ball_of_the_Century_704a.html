<p>The 1993 Ashes series - the traditional series contested between England and Australia every two years - was the first to be played since the return to full strength of the English side, following Test cricket bans for several players who had defied the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cricket_Council_b676.html" title="International Cricket Council">International Cricket Council</a> to tour <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> during the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> era. Australia had won the Ashes from England in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, and had easily defended the urn in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>/<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">91</a> against the depleted English team. With the return of the experienced Mike Gatting and several other senior players in 1993, the stage was set for a closely matched confrontation.</p>
<p>With the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch_%28cricket%29.html" title="Pitch (cricket)">pitch</a> at Old Trafford cricket ground traditionally assisting <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_bowling.html" title="Spin bowling">spin bowling</a>, England went into the game with two spin bowlers: <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Tufnell_fd4c.html" title="Phil Tufnell">Phil Tufnell</a> and the debutant <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Such_7317.html" title="Peter Such">Peter Such</a>. In contrast, Australia fielded a three-pronged <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_bowling.html" title="Fast bowling">fast bowling</a> attack with the young Warne as the lone spinner.</p>
<p>English captain <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Gooch_e341.html" title="Graham Gooch">Graham Gooch</a> won the <a href="../../../t/o/s/Toss_%28cricket%29.html" title="Toss (cricket)">coin toss</a> and elected to bowl first, hoping to make use of early moisture in the pitch to make <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_%28cricket%29.html" title="Batting (cricket)">batting</a> difficult for the Australians. Despite Australia's <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Taylor_%28cricketer%29_5f4c.html" title="Mark Taylor (cricketer)">Mark Taylor</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Slater_1255.html" title="Michael Slater">Michael Slater</a> scoring over 100 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28cricket%29.html" title="Run (cricket)">runs</a> before getting out, the tactic worked reasonably well, with Australia being dismissed for a moderate first <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innings.html" title="Innings">innings</a> total of 289 runs.</p>
<p>England also began well, reaching 71 runs before <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Atherton_e78d.html" title="Mike Atherton">Mike Atherton</a> was dismissed by <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merv_Hughes_aef8.html" title="Merv Hughes">Merv Hughes</a>. Mike Gatting joined his captain in the middle and set about adding runs to hopefully give England a first innings lead. At this point, Australian captain <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Border_d988.html" title="Allan Border">Allan Border</a> turned to his leg spinner, Warne.</p>
<p>Warne had played 11 matches in his career up to that point, having taken 31 wickets at a moderate <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_average.html" title="Bowling average">bowling average</a> of 30.80 runs per wicket. Although showing some promise, Warne's early career had so far been less than spectactular and his style of bowling - leg spin - was seen by many cricket followers as an antiquated art with little value in the modern game dominated by pace bowling since the heyday of the fierce <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indian_cricket_team_6ec3.html" title="West Indian cricket team">West Indian</a> attack of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. Furthermore, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Gatting_111e.html" title="Mike Gatting">Mike Gatting</a> was renowned as a world-class player of spin bowling, and was fully expected to give the inexperienced Warne a tough time.</p>
<p>It was in this context, and in the face of seasoned English <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsman.html" title="Batsman">batsmen</a> who seemed likely to give England a big lead in the first innings of the first Test, that Warne strode to the crease to bowl his first ball against Australia's "Old Enemy".</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Animation of a leg break.</div>

<p>After his slow run-up of just a few paces, Warne rolled his right arm over and delivered a <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_break.html" title="Leg break">leg break</a> to the right-handed Gatting. The ball initially travelled straight down the pitch towards the batsman, but about a third of the way along, as the ball picked up vertical speed, the rapidly spinning <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_ball.html" title="Cricket ball">cricket ball</a> started drifting prodigiously through the air down Gatting's <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_side.html" title="Leg side">leg side</a>. The ball then bounced on the pitch well outside Gatting's leg <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stump_%28cricket%29.html" title="Stump (cricket)">stump</a>.</p>
<p>Gatting responded by thrusting his left leg forward and to the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_side.html" title="Leg side">leg side</a>, and pushing his <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_bat.html" title="Cricket bat">bat</a> next to his pad to cover the spin of the ball and defend it away. Like most experienced batsmen, he would have expected this tactic to be perfectly safe - the ball pitching outside leg would rule out any possible <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_before_wicket.html" title="Leg before wicket">leg before wicket</a> decision, and if the ball spun more than expected his bat would be there to defend it.</p>
<p>On bouncing, however, the ball bit into the pitch and spun far more sharply away from Gatting (towards the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Off_side.html" title="Off side">off side</a>) than normally seen in England, deviating from its pre-bounce trajectory by an astonishing amount (it has been estimated that the ball turned from its original path by an angle of 80 degrees). It passed the outside edge of Gatting's bat and, rising, clipped the top of his off stump to clean bowl him. As Warne and his team mates jumped up in celebration, Gatting stood nonplussed for a few seconds, unsure what all of the fuss was about, until he finally realised that the ball had somehow hit his wicket. In a memorable image, Gatting simply stared at the pitch in unbelieving amazement for several seconds, before accepting his fate and walking off the field.</p>
<p>Television images showed Gatting as he walked off the field, shaking his head repeatedly with an expression of sheer disbelief on his face.</p>
<p>The dismissal was captured in a famous photograph by Steve Lindsell, in which Gatting's mouth is formed into a perfect "O" of surprise, while wicketkeeper <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Healy_ba38.html" title="Ian Healy">Ian Healy</a> raises his arms in celebration behind and Gatting's off bail spins somewhere above his head.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball_of_the_Century_704a.html" title="Edit section: The aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The aftermath</span></h2>
<p>The fall of Gatting's wicket left England on 80 runs for 2 wickets, a position from which they never recovered, as Warne added the wicket of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Smith_%28cricketer%29_14c2.html" title="Robin Smith (cricketer)">Robin Smith</a> a mere four runs later. Warne also accounted for Gooch and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Caddick_4976.html" title="Andy Caddick">Andy Caddick</a> in the innings, helping to reduce England to a first innings total of just 210. Encouraged by their bowling, Australia declared their second innings at 432 for 5 wickets. Warne then contributed four more wickets as Australia won the match by 179 runs, winning the man of the match award for his efforts.</p>
<p>This result of this match set the tone for the remainder of the series, and Australia cruised to a comfortable 4-1 victory, with Warne taking a total of 34 wickets at an average of 25.79 and sharing the man of the series award with Gooch.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball_of_the_Century_704a.html" title="Edit section: Legacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
<p>This series marked the beginning of a long domination of world cricket by Australia, coinciding with the incredibly successful career of Warne. Warne's bowling also provided an eye-opening insight into the subtleties and power of leg spin bowling for modern cricket audiences, who had become used to the spectacle of pace attacks, and marked a worldwide resurgence of popularity in the art of spin bowling in general, and leg spin in particular.</p>
<p>Soon after the event, media began calling Warne's delivery to Gatting the <i>Ball of the Century</i>. Since then, Warne has come to be acknowledged as one of the best bowlers in history. During the penultimate Test match of his career on Boxing Day 2006, in the fourth Ashes test against England, Warne took his 700th Test wicket, bowling Andrew Strauss to become the first cricketer ever to reach this milestone. Many of those wickets have been the result of amazing deliveries, some perhaps technically as good as the ball to Gatting. However, the significance of the ball in so many contexts, as well as the sheer amazement generated in people who view video of its remarkable trajectory, have made the appellation stick.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most memorable and amusing quote which emerged as a result of Warne's now famous delivery came from England captain <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Gooch_e341.html" title="Graham Gooch">Graham Gooch</a>, on the reaction of Gatting: <i>"He looked as though someone had just nicked his lunch."</i>, particularly comical as Gatting is much-mocked for his rotundness, which was also alluded to by journalist Martin Johnson who said "How anyone can spin a ball the width of Gatting boggles the mind".</p>
