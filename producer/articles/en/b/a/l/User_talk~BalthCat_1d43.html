<p>Hello, thank you for the welcoming message. I appreciate it very much. You are right, I haven't found the article yet (I actually haven't had a chance to look), but I deleted the comments because it was in response to the (many) previous responses, and so was pointless being there seeing as the rest of the discussion was not presant. I don't mind if you put it back up if you would like. And thank you again for the welcoming message. (Also sorry if I did something wrong, I am fairly inexperienced with wikipedia.)</p>

<p>G'day, BalthCat...in response to your question on my talkpage, I suppose you could go either way with the redlink issue. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_links" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_links" rel="nofollow">wiki page that discusses it</a> says both "Links to non-existing pages are common. They are typically created in preparation for creating the page, and/or to encourage other people to do so" and "However, it may be better to wait with creating links until after creating the new page, especially if the new link replaces one to an existing page."</p>
<p>My intent in removing the "redlinks" was to indicate that no page existed for these topics. However, if you agree with the other interpretation, go ahead and restore them.

<p>I see that you just placed db-bio tags on the two articles refered to above. If I were you, I would watch the articles closely, as their author likes to simply remove the tags---I've placed two on each article in the last 15 minutes and he removed them all. In addition, at least one of the articles is a recreation of an article that had already been deleted. In addition, when I placed warnings on his talk page, he deleted those as well. I have reported his actions to an administrator. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 05:55, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I had a look at that article. So here's my question. What did you read that led you to consider I might gain some wisdom by reading it? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 03:49, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't recall the specific article discussion pages right now. All I recall was the very first comment was you suggesting that some one would wear the Nazi armband well. You lost the argument before it even began! - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 03:50, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>It has no bearing, so why ask? ---- I took a brief look through your list of recent edits, in the hope that by looking for "visited links" in the list I could see which talk page you had christened by invoking <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a>, however your extensive editing of Scientology talk pages has rendered this a task which I do not have the motivation to complete. I'm sorry I cannot point out WHICH article discussion page you called some one a Nazi in. I should have been more careful. Either way, it remains true that it's more effective to present reasonable arguments instead of relying on the lazy method of attacking opponents by comparing them to mass murderers. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 05:56, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for a civil reply. I recall mentioning "nazi armband" once, some while ago. I intended to point to group think in a disparging way. I didn't intend to point toward individual action. I see what you're saying. The articles are not all well cited, as you know. One of the recent problems I've had is requesting a citation. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> spells out details of how to, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> includes that any editor can simply remove information that isn't cited. It would stabilize articles if articles were better cited. The other difficulty has been editors insisting that personal website opinion should be included as a secondary source of information within articles. Those persons who have chatted for years on alt.religion.scientology (newsgroup) have, oddly enough, some tendency to A) think alike and B) control the Scientology articles and C) commonly edit toward an inaccuarate presentation of the information which comprises Scientology and D) present any controversy they can dig up. I used the "nazi armband" statement within that context. Later <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 13:21, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thinking about it, the actual comment may have been months old, I do recall it being a little dated, but I'd seen similarly severe responses from you in other Scientology articles so I still felt that addressing it was relevent. (One could keep the 'spirit' which leads to the events described by Godwin's Law but not actually trigger it specifically.) Also, your explanation still leaves what you said within the context of Godwin's Law. Without an adequately severe example of intolerance and hate to compare it to, bringing up the Nazis or Hitler is over the top.</dd>
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I admit that the part of me which feels that one day anti-Scientology dogma will some day be seen by the majority in the same light as anti-Semitism or other religious or racial prejudices, however I am dubious that Scientology will ever be a religion of great history and legacy. As an agnostic, it's hard enough for me to believe the words of men 2000 years dead, let alone one less than a century dead who wrote mediocre science fiction and even went so far as to state that (if I recall correctly) the best moneymaking venture would be to found a religion. So yes, I view Scientology with skepticism at best, though I do maintain the possibility that some of the accusations are not true. Again, when it's hard to believe the words of men thousands of years dead (and thousands of years maintained and revised) it is nigh impossible to believe the far-fetched ideas associated with Scientology (though I admit to having never read Dianetics, but that's in part because of how terrible Battlefield Earth was...) such as Xenu, Thetans, and the *way* in which Scientology opposes certain medical theories and practices. (Not to mention an anecdote from a friend, who told me that while in Edmonton, Alberta, he took a questionnaire at a Scientology site and was told that according to the results he was on drugs. He wasn't, he told the auditor so, and the auditor denied what he said. He said that even a drug test would be pointless because the questionnaire showed he was on drugs.) There's also the constant stream of Hubbard fiction being published posthumously (beating a dead horse that wasn't too lively to begin with) and the rumours that Scientology adherents run out and buy multiple copies of pro-Scientology or Scientology-associated materials.</dd>
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 'religion' (which I have read is viewed more as a philosophy in some nations) has what I consider to be toxic behaviour throughout. Reclusive, anti-'social' behaviour abounds. Scientology's knowledge is not free, which is to me, ultimately repulsive. (The same goes for healing methods. I believe it was Reiki which is not to be taught or performed without charging a fee.) A real religion does not sue to protect its secrets; a real religion has none. A real religion does not sue to silence its critics; a real religion seeks to counsel and convince, there are no irredeemables. A real religion does not redirect critical websites to its own. What is odd, is that I believe fairly strongly that Scientology would not be in the situation it is now (generally mocked by the public and reviled by the internet) if it were not so anti-social. (Which is an odd thing, considering Scientology's take on Antisocial people.) That's not even including concepts such as "Fair Game", which is as repugnant a concept as I have ever seen and despite its repeal deserves mention because it came from the mind of the religion's author. It demonstrates character and might *never* become irrelevant in Scientology discussions. One can easily be worried that it is similar to polygamy... that despite the public condemnation it remains morally correct. Secret ostracism and persecution are more dangerous and insidious, not less... I never hear Scientology deny Xenu, only say that it's IP. I never hear Scientology debate, only respond or attack. I see it only absorb or destroy competition...</dd>
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps if Scientology came as healers, as mentors and as family, not as lawyers, dictators (of truth) and fanatics (single-mindedness), one could see it integrating into the real mainstream. I could settle on saying "Xenu isn't really that much crazier than a guy coming back from the dead." However it didn't, and it doesn't, and the longer it doesn't, the longer it will take for that stain to lift... if it ever *can* come clean. Fair Game is almost blood-stain calibre... a terrible terrible mistake.</dd>
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I'm going to end now so as not to ramble more... I'm not sure whether any of this will impress anything upon you. I'm not sure if you can respond to anything to my satisfaction. Many of the concepts associated with Scientology are so scary... dead agenting, dirt and smear tactics, suppressive persons and fair game, litigation and organisational cannibalism... all ideas and behaviours that seem so hateful at their core... that -perhaps- nothing short of a real apparent revelation and attempt at societal reconciliation could sway me away from my unease. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 03:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your ramble told of your education in areas that the common adherent of alt.net.scientology would be educated in. Nothing in any of what you say addresses what Scientology is, or is doing.

<dd>However I have never read alt.net.scientology (that I recall). Despite a respectable history on the internet, I never really got into usenet. You not only ignored MY personal anecdote, but you, like Scientology, did nothing to deny its litigious nature, it's claim to "ownership" over spiritual truths or the fact that "Fair game" ever existed. You appear unwilling to do true missionary work. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 00:40, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not intend to do either missionary work nor do I intend to do true missionary work. So perhaps there would be a problem, since you were, apparently seeking a true, missionary - like reply. Alas, about that I can be of no assistance to you. I understand what you have said, you have not been active in alt.net.scientology. Thankyou for saying so. It was my impression that your ramble was based on what you perceived to be addressed by Godwin's Law. Was there a personal anecdote which I didn't address? I'm like, hey, I'm perfectly willing to address any issue you raise (I think), but I'm not sure what issue you are raising. I replied about my use of "nazi armband" as I remember it. I'm not representing the Church of Scientology, I don't have their edorcement or even their permission. So what issue are you raising, there's too many there to reply to, I think. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 05:51, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No doubt that <i>most often</i> is now used... more often. But 50 years ago it would be regarded as sloppy. Webster's 3rd and AHD still hold on to <i>oftener</i> and <i>oftenest</i>, and so did the Oxford English Dictionary, as of 1989 (but the 2004 revision points out how "more/most often" are now more common). Anyway, the original editor (namely, thine truly) chose <i>oftenest</i>, so...

<p>Everyone in UK, from the primary school teachers to the Parliament, any universities, BBC and another other institution considers the oxford english dictionary as the de facto authority of spelling and pronouncing english. as far as i knew the same applied through out the commonwealth (australia, new zealand, <b>canada</b> and the plethora of african and caribbean countries). so maybe its not the fact.</p>
<p>eitherway my personal position is that if one is going to speak english one better adhere to british english, where english comes from. although i appreciate that people from other countries have other ideas i still try my best to convenience them not to speak american english, which is rather crude. and whenever possible i <i>correct</i> american english. for example if the article is to do with any UK geographical location and it has a "trasportation" section header i always correct it to "transport", same goes for colour etc. although i never change american spellings on america related articles. as i am originaly russian (and somehow i feel that i represent all russians&#160;;-) ) i also change any russia related article to british english.</p>
<p>i know some wikipedians will say that this makes wikipedia incoherent, i feel that upholding something so important as the proper english language is far more important then few annoyed yanks.</p>
<p>and forgive me for any spelling mistakes, i am quite the retard when it comes to those.</p>

<dd>I agree with the points you made about modern languages changing with new words being passed around and grammatical rules being changed for art's sake. and i understand that there are local dilects and sounds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>you should know that OED does actually change over the years, certain words are put in (i think that 24/7 is considered a word now by OED) and certain others are dropped or the spelling changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>still, i try my best to speak and write in british english. and i dont think saying that there are more non british english speakers is a good justification for deprecating british english. culturaly UK is very important. i think per person UK out produces north america in terms of music, theater, literary work (although not films), at least in terms of the significant works. when english is taught the prefered version is usually british english.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>at the end of the day this argument is pedantic. i strongly support british english, other dont. the basis of this is just personal opinion (no matter what anyone says about english being born and raised in uk or usa being the cultural leader in modern times and so on). i try to use british english wherever i can but i think that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English" rel="nofollow">wikipedia rules</a> are right when they say that ther first person to write the article gets to choose the english version they use, unless the article is about something that directly refers to a specific country. just for you reference check out this:</dd>

<p>Hello, i saw that you changed the article "the berber people" after my edit titled "minor edit", and your argument was "this is Not a minor edit". Well, the big "Not" might be true denpeding on your defenition for the minor edits. My previous edit was changin "most sources" to "most unscientific sources" and "European Languages" to "modern European Languages". I did that because it is more accurate, since there is a difference between the modern and the ancient languages. As far as the sources are concerned, i think i corrected it to be more honest. the scientific sources didn't claim that the berbes were known as barbarians or barbarois. It is the daily sources that claim that. I agree that neither "daily sources" nor "unscientific sources" are good descreptions. What is the best descreption according to you?

<dd>You said it was a minor edit, changing something from a "source" with no qualification to "unscientific source" with a definite negative qualification is NOT a minor edit, even if it is "small" in "size".

<dd>Firstly, don't use big letters because they're considered as shouting which is not peaceful in such a discussion. Secondly it was me who wrote "contrary to the most sources" and then i noticed it is not correct, because i didn't read it in any serious source, and therefore, i changed it to "contrary the most unscientific sources". It is logical that i won't write something self and thereafter, i will provide sources that is not correct. Please, try to understand it, and then explain me your objection. You asked for a citation. Which citation can I provide as long as i say it doesn't exist?!! Should i give an accurate source emphasizing that the berbers were known as Barbarians to the romans and greeks to proove they were not known as barbarians to them? <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERead3r_bd68.html" title="User:Read3r">Read3r</a> 12:07, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand that you want to be helpful, and accurate (as you see it) but I am finding that your your skill in English leaves your responses confusing. I read over your talk page and some of your additions to articles and they are just not quite right. Perhaps it would be better, when editing the the English Wikipedia, to get the assistance of some one who is proficient in English to refine your entries. To address what I think you are asking... you say that the sources are inaccurate, unscientific, etc. To say that is unnecessary, and it looks like you are being defensive, not factual. I attribute this to your English, which is ok, but leads to confusion. And yes, you DO have to cite what you say, for example, if MOST sources say something, why are they wrong? Also, in my opinion, CAPS text, used once in a sentence, provides emphasis like italics would, but is shorter to type. To use them in a whole sentence would be shouting, I agree. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 17:21, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for correcting it. It is true that i cannot express my opinions in advanced English. I can give sources that the berbers were known as "Numidians", "libyans" and "Maures". But it is difficult to proove that the berbers were not known as Barbarians to them with a source. But i can give many historical sources were they are named "Libyans", Numidians "moors"....; I read also some sources calling the Berbers as Barbarians, but this was not a general name for the berbers, because it was used to describe the non-romans in all the world including the Europeans and Indians. I think it was Strabo who said that word "Barbarian" is uncorrect since many people called "barbarians" are civilized like as the Indians. By the way, I'm Berber and sometimes i can be subjective, or defensive, so please, help me to be objective, although i'm not very active in Wikipedi, atleast in this period.

<dd>Regardless of <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETrivia_e90c.html" title="WP:Trivia">WP:Trivia</a>, you have to admit a large number of articles have trivia. In fact at least seven of those listed as interests on your user page have trivia sections. I would argue that as WP is set up now, trivia is best kept in check, rather than culled mercilessly, especially in the case of a new, incomplete or stublike article. There may never be a Jericho (fictional Kansan town), and until such a time as there is more information about the show for the snippet about Jericho to be worked in, it is a valuable addition as a trivia item. My concern is primarily with losing information. If the talk page was a reliable location to store trivia or "in progress" items of not-yet-established notability, or if Wikipedia had a <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Jericho (TV series)/Sandbox</a> option for you to store information for later inclusion, I would agree completely. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 08:57, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The information will never be lost (it is stored in historys) if you look at all the trivia sections of articles im interested in theyve become unmanagable and full of unneeded stuff.

<dd>How far back in the history will you read when it comes time to expand the article? I can't imagine the exercise in abject tedium that would be. Losing something into the history is the same as deleting it, if it's far back enough. (And with Vandalism and Tweaks it will be.) And while some trivia is bad, I disagree that all is bad just because it doesn't deserve inclusion, or deserve its own article. Stubs exist on Wikipedia too, even if they aren't the idea. And you HAVE to be familiar with TV show fans from watching those articles to know that more and more trivia is going to be shoved in no matter HOW good a job you do at the beginning. (God, I watch a Final Fantasy game article, it's terrible.) It's more about keeping it relevent. And I flat out believe that that information about Jericho belongs in the article, and as such is not Unneeded. You don't think a first question is going to be whether Jericho is real or not? - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 09:26, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to <a href="../../../i/s/b/Wikipedia%7EISBN_7825.html" title="Wikipedia:ISBN">Wikipedia:ISBN</a>, dashes shouldn't cause problems, and are in fact "stylistically preferred". From what I've seen so far, the ISBNs flagged with {{<a href="../../../p/l/e/Template%7EPlease_check_ISBN_60fd.html" title="Template:Please check ISBN">Please check ISBN</a>}} are failing to pass an ISBN length and checksum test (i.e., they are not 10 digits long, or their 10th digit is not the correct checksum of the other 9), regardless of whether or not they include dashes. (There was <i>one</i> so far that I've looked at that had 2 consecutive dashes, which is an easily corrected typo.) If you know of a specific set of edits being done by someone, bot or not, that is incorrectly inserting dashes, let me know.

<dd>I'm trying to maintain dashes where I can deduce their "correct" usage, especially now that I see that dashes are supposedly preferred. But I am unaware of any formal structure, so I can't add them where they are missing. If you can point out who is adding them, I'd appreciate it, as I'd like to ask them how they decide where to place dashes.

<dd>I left the welcome as a welcome, not to chase you off. If we disagree about what is appropriate for the article, then we can discuss it on the talk page (ie: the discussion tab) at the top. In case you got some sort of "this is my turf" vibe from me, it's an illusion, I'm not a prolific editor. I mostly revert vandalism and try to keep a hold on some of the chaos you see from time to time. If you'd added the list in again, I would have taken the discussion to the talk page. I also just felt that the list was a overly morbid for so early in the story. (And I won't be accused of being overly sensitive:] ) Have a good night. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 06:15, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, as well as the first eyewitness interviewed on CBC Newsworld on Wednesday. I also heard a CBC reporter relay that the g-word (goth) had been dropped by some witnesses. I wasn't implying they made the title up out of his hairstyle, it was labelling him the sensational title of 'punk killer'. A mohawk does not a punk make. And it's jumping to conclusions about the person based on a hairstyle, and doing so to be sensational. (C'mon, you can feel it can't you?) I find it disrespectful to the tragedy and damaging to those punks (I'm not one, FTR) who don't go around shooting up schools. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 06:08, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, you said that almost verbatim. I addressed that, saying it wasn't the students saying it, it was how the newspaper put it.

<p>BalthCat, I have dealt with punk and goth kids before in my high school days. Since most of my friends dress like this, I know that they wouldn't shoot up schools. In fact, some punk and goth kids can be friendly at times, as I have found out around fall <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-spring <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. When I had my first year of college, I had problems with them, and when I started using MySpace, I got an e-mail from a friend to not get impressions of them wrong. But here's the problem: When this comes to mind about a recent shooting or murder, the names <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Hardy_135b.html" title="Jeff Hardy">Jeff Hardy</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bam_Margera_8e1c.html" title="Bam Margera">Bam Margera</a> come to mind, as BOTH of these guys dress in punk and gothic fashions (<a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Hardy_135b.html" title="Jeff Hardy">Jeff Hardy</a> is a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWE</a> superstar, <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bam_Margera_8e1c.html" title="Bam Margera">Bam Margera</a> is a professional skateboarder).</p>
<p>After what happened with <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimveer_Gill_7c51.html" title="Kimveer Gill">Kimveer Gill</a>, I can say that I don't think <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jun_Kazama_74f9.html" title="Jun Kazama">Jun Kazama</a> from <i><a href="../../../t/e/k/Tekken_2.html" title="Tekken 2">Tekken 2</a></i> would like this <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawson_College_shooting_5d71.html" title="Dawson College shooting">Dawson</a> article very much. If she got her hands on him, she'd K.O. him with one of her 10-hit combos in the arcade game. This is probably why I prefer to stay the heck AWAY from <a href="../../../v/a/m/VampireFreaks.com_46d1.html" title="VampireFreaks.com">VampireFreaks.com</a>. So my best advice for encountering punk and goth teens is to not get your impressions of them wrong. You could make friends with one of them, which could be a life-changing experience. --<a href="../../../w/t/g/User%7EWTGDMan1986_196a.html" title="User:WTGDMan1986">D.F.

<dd>Uh, I never once said anything negative about punks or goth. In fact a significantly large portion of my music is goth and related genres (industrial, etc.). What I said was that the article was assuming he was a punk (just because he looked "punk" to some witnesses) and sensationally calling him a "PUNK KILLER" because it's a clever attention-grabbing headline. And like I said above, it's disrespectful to be sensationalist during a tragedy, and it's damaging to real punks for being lumped in. It turns out he was more of a goth (he didn't look punk at all). I'm not entirely sure why I got your reply. Sounds more like you should direct it to the Sydney Herald than me. (The only reason I'm not likely to make friends with a goth teen is that they're teens, though I might go to the same show some time...

<p>The problem is if we list its comedy then we would also have to list everything else which would then that means an overly long list of genres, I my self would have no objections to listing it as a comedy-drama if it could be agreed we are not going to list lots of genres in the lead in. Regarding Jericho: I expected that its trivia would start growing.. and i expect it would get excedingly long (<a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_O.C._temp_2537.html" title="Talk:The O.C./temp">Talk:The O.C./temp</a> is an example of one long trivia section) - I suggest we purge all unrelated information that has nothing to do with the episodes.

<dd>See, picking the primary genre for Firefly is ultimately subjective. I personally find that, comedy is as important, if not more, to the nature of the show. The setting may be western, but the show's best moments are definitely the comedy. (In my opinion.) IMDB, amusingly enough, doesn't list western OR comedy. Well, perhaps I'll bring it up on the article talk page. I think the article should have a strong intro which explains the core of the show, which to me is a comedic space-western.&#160;:) - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 07:38, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was quite some time ago, and I explained myself on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFredericton_0e18.html" title="Talk:Fredericton">Talk:Fredericton</a>. Primarily I found both to be non-notable as far as educational institutions go. We don't need to bloat the Fredericton article up with every multi-city, mostly-online university that pops up. Lansbridge isn't even a university by the opening definition of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">University</a> article, and I suspect neither is the CFAAT, which isn't even notable enough to have its own article. Even if they could be argued to be universities, they are not notable enough to be included in the opening lines of the city's article. I mean, Lansbridge has no campus, so it isn't here... What kind of enrollment do they both have? (And from reading <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lansbridge_University_6da1.html" title="Lansbridge University">Lansbridge University</a>, I am left dubious of its credibility.) - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 21:01, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
