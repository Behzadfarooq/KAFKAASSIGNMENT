<dl>
<dd>It incorporates alignment, flexibility, exercises, and center work in a disciplined curriculum. Typical ballet classes consist of a barre and center work; more advanced classes include adagio, petit allegro, and grande allegro sections.</dd>

<p>Reasons: (a) a piece was put by an anonim into an arbitrary place, out of logic flow of the article.

<p>I know its been a long while since <a href="../../../l/y/e/User%7ELyellin_3af6.html" title="User:Lyellin">user:Lyellin</a> put up this post, but from 1790 until circa 1917 the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet was known as the <i><b>Imperial Ballet</b></i>.</p>
<p>QUOTE - <i><b>"The Ballet company has alway been a part of the part of the Theatre (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariinsky_Theatre_5f1b.html" title="Mariinsky Theatre">Mariinsky Theatre</a>..."</b></i> - this is not correct either.

This building was declared unsafe in 1886, and so the companies relocated to the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Mariinsky_Theatre_1c30.html" title="Imperial Mariinsky Theatre">Imperial Mariinsky Theatre</a> (the theatre's title at that time).</p>

<p>Classical ballet focuses more on the technical aspects of dance that have been used for years, especially by Russian companies. Contemporary ballet tends to focus more on emotion and movement than technique.</p>

<p>Someone should address the contemporary controversy around Ballet--the common tie to eating disorders, the gendering and caricaturing of women, the problems with the implicit gender/power dynamics, and so on. Unfortunatly I know only about the subject, not much of it. -<a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmortimer_a52c.html" title="User:Bmortimer">bmortimer</a> 8 November 2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm intrigued by the phrase "gendering and caricaturing of women." Classical ballet certainly includes female characters that aren't ideals for today's women, but these are historic pieces, much like the plays of Shakespeare. Are you objecting to a current practice in the world of dance, or the performance of more traditional ballets? -pmerz 8 August 2006
<dl>
<dd>Something definately needs to mentioned about eating disorders and the obsession with thinness and the "right body" within the modern ballet community. Gender (the fact that male dancers are seen as "gay" by many people outside the ballet world, ect.) should also be discussed. This article has really improved since I first read it, although I still think alot could be added to make it even better. <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerealBabyMilk_55a0.html" title="User:CerealBabyMilk">CerealBabyMilk</a> 07:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are other gender points not discussed. For instance, I read in an encyclopedia that ballet in France was danced by men for the first 100 years. Also, nowadays there are a few transvestite ballerinas walking around. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages24.211.249.43 05:07, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>Why do some of the snowflakes have 5-fold symmetry?</small></p>
<p><small>Actually, I think the photo for this page needs to be replaced - none of the dancers are actually in technically-correct positions, and (looking at it from a dancer's viewpoint), that hurts this page's credibility. Not entirely sure where to find a usable non-copyrighted photo though.</small></p>
<p><small>—I agree.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>There must be someone who would be willing to donate a picture to this page of more technically accurate dancing. Also, the caption refers to the composer's name, instead of the choreographer's or dance company who is performing. I think Tchaikovsky is swell, but certainly he didn't stage this particular production?</small></dd>

<dd><small>I've looked around, but I can't find any. I uploaded two pictures I took (they're on my page) but they were with a crappy camera and no flash; and one was from about thirty feet away, backstage, between costume changes. In my opinion the ballet picture being used now needs rapid replacement, but I'm not sure a fuzzy picture would be any better... I'm going to try to contact the gentleman in charge of the Ballerina Gallery and ask if he has any copyright-free pictures or protected ones he's willing to donate. --<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditor_at_Large_0787.html" title="User:Editor at Large">Editor at Large</a> 14:14, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>The new photo of Paloma Herrera as Sylvia is a great image, but I'm a little uneasy about its provenance. The caption says Photo credit: Gene Schiavone, but the photo's page says Photo by Marty Sohl. It also says "This image was obtained from Kelly Ryan, the Director of Press and Public Relations at ABT. In contact with Rmrfstar through email." But it's not clear to me whether the copyright owner (Schiavone? Sohl? Ryan? ABT?) has really offered it under the GFDL license, as claimed on the wikimedia commons page at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Sylherrera.jpg" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Sylherrera.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Sylherrera.jpg</a> , or whether this is just fair use, as stated on the WP page. I'm also not at all convinced that the fair use rationale is valid --- the photo is higher resolution than necessary, and replaced a GFDL-licensed one. I'll drop a message to Rmrfstar and ask for clarification.--<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.52.254.62.html" title="User:24.52.254.62">24.52.254.62</a> 04:55, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p><small>User Rmrfstar has taken the Paloma Herrera photo out, since he agrees with me that it's not an appropriate case of fair use. I've replaced it with a cropped and retouched version of the older GFDL'd photo of a Nutcracker performance, with a caption referring to the fact that she's on pointe. This version cuts out the dancers in the background. Were the technical problems people were complaining about just problems with the dancers in the background, or is the dancer doing the arabesque also doing something wrong? If so, then another image that could be used instead is <a href="../../../v/i/o/Image%7EVioletta_Elvin.jpg_94fc.html" title="Image:Violetta Elvin.jpg">Image:Violetta_Elvin.jpg</a>.--<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.52.254.62.html" title="User:24.52.254.62">24.52.254.62</a> 16:34, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>No, her arabesque is incorrect as well; her alignment, arm positions, and legs are all off -- as well as the fact that her supporting foot is photoshopped in. The Violetta Elvin image is actually being used already on the <a href="../../../e/n/_/En_pointe.html" title="En pointe">En pointe</a> page (I used it to replace a TERRIBLE image, which basically showed how <i>not</i> to stand en pointe). I sent an e-mail to the owner of <a href="http://www.ballerinagallery.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ballerinagallery.com" rel="nofollow">The Ballerina Gallery</a> asking if he had any copyright-free images, but have not as yet recieved a response. It's been over a month, so I don't know if I will. At any rate, I'm going to start bringing my camera to rehersals and start snapping pictures. Maybe I'll end up with a good one, if I can use the flash this time... — <font color="#336600" face="papyrus">E</font><a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditor_at_Large_0787.html" title="User:Editor at Large"><font color="darkred" face="papyrus">ditor <font color="black">at</font> <font color="darkgoldenrod">L</font>arge</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/User_talk%7EEditor_at_Large_35c5.html" title="User talk:Editor at Large"><sup><font color="darkgoldenrod" face="papyrus">(<font color="black">speak</font>)</font></sup></a> 17:45, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

There are thousands of old Soviet-era photos on WP and wikimedia commons, all of which were posted with copyright templates claiming that they were public domain; however, it seems pretty clear now that that interpretation of the law was just wrong: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:PD-Soviet" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:PD-Soviet" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:PD-Soviet</a> , and the images are going to be deleted.

<p>In my opinion, physics and perceptual illusion are essential to ballet. Its true you could enjoy, teach or perform w/o formal physics, based only on physical intuition and an artistic sense. But you couldn't explain or really understand it. Part of the art of ballet is to appear to defy gravity while working within its constraints. The spins and turns likewise depend on the laws of physics. Some readers may view view explanations as a kind of spoiler but they are free to skip the section. The article I cited is oriented to ballet more than other forms of dance.</p>
<p>Some of the posts convince me that confusion continues to exist. One editor wrote that the dancer stays up as long as possible. In reality a prima ballerina has no better chance than a hippopotamus of staying suspended in air! What is really happening? Curious readers willwant to know.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Knowledge of physics is not necessary at all to understand, teach, learn, or perform any dance form, though perhaps it can be beneficial. I have never seen a technical manual of dance which employs physics to illustrate a point, and I have read numerous manuals on the Cecchetti, Vaganova, Legat, Lifar, R.A.D, and Danish--and more--schools. While physics can describe the movements you see, explanations of dance movement that rely on physics generally reveal that the author has little or no knowledge of how the dancer achieves and maintains those positions in the first place, and the science of biomechanics never seems to be a consideration.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's true, a prima ballerina is not "suspended" in air; she will fall 32 feet per second per second like anything else--<i>after</i> she "maxes out" her elevation. The quality of her jumps depends on how elastic her muscles are, not just how strong they are. This so-called suspension, what dancers call "ballon", is achieved by making a strong preparatory spring from a solid, "elastic" plie (knee bend), combined with the support and strength of the feet and legs, followed by stretching the arms and legs almost imperceptibly at the very "top" of the jump; it should look as if the whole body is taking a breath.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article cited is probably more oriented to ballet because "ballon" is a quality specific to ballet. Modern dance, in contrast, is more earthbound, but having good "ballon" is an asset even to a modern dancer.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you are looking to physicists to explain how dance movements are possible, or how they are executed, you are looking in the wrong place. You will find better answers from dancers &amp; dance instructors, even from physical therapists (if you must have a "hard" scientific explanation). In the world of dance, the most brilliant physicist is a layperson and an amateur, who has some very interesting and perhaps helpful observations on the art.Roseblink 12:03, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is true that most ballet manuals do not delve into physics. At least is was true until Kenneth Laws wrote Physics and the Art of Dance ISBN-10: 0195144821 ISBN-13: 978-0195144826 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Art-Dance-Understanding-Movement/dp/0195144821" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Art-Dance-Understanding-Movement/dp/0195144821" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Kenneth Laws is a physicist who discovered ballet too late in life to become a performer. He is instead a dance teacher who integrates science into his classes. People vary in their cognitive styles. Some prefer intuitive imagery whereas others want hard explanations.</p>
<p>Remember ballet is an evolving art form with continual innovation. De arte saltandi et choreus ducendi would not have much about pointe work. Part of the richness of ballet is that is can be viewed from many perspectives. Historical, musical, visual and scientific. However impressive your credentials may be, they cannot be exhaustive, simply because ballet cannot be exhausted. Because ballet “got by” without science does not mean science has nothing to bring to the table. Many items in our lives were used way before they were correctly explained.

<p>Ballet dancers use their abdominal muscles to carry their weight in their midsections. This takes the pressure off the feet.</p>
<p>Its not possible to support your entire weight on your abdomon except in the bow asana. The abdomon may be distributing the weight better and more efficiently but the feet must still support your full weight. Your scale weight doesn't change with what you do with your abdomon.

</dl>
<p>I've done this because the book I'm looking at now (Bland 1976) lists at least one other ballet as having been put on before this one (although it mentions this one at great length, spelled as <i>Balet Comique de la Royne Louise</i>). I think the operative word in this sentence is "produced", but I am unsure how this is quantified or where I could find a source to back this up. This book lists "the first French entertainment of this kind [<i>ballet de cour</i>] of which we have details" as being the <i>Balet des Polonais</i> (1573). Therefore, I think this bit of history merits clarification and I'd be much obliged if someone could clarify.&#160;:] --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 09:52, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You will find <i>Ballet Comique de la Reine Louise</i> spelled different ways, depending on the sources you consult. It is also important to define what you mean by "the first ballet"; because the <i>ballet comique</i> was a quite different entertainment than what we are accustomed to seeing when we go to the ballet these days. Generally speaking, it is correct to assert that this 1581 production was the first ballet; it is widely accepted as such by many sources, usually with some reason the author chooses <i>Ballet Comique de la Reine Louise</i> over another ballet. If you consult Lincoln Kirstein's "Four Centuries of Ballet", Kirstein says <i>Balet des Polonais</i> is "loosely termed a 'ballet'" (pg. 54, Dover publication, 1984).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Kirstein will always steer you in the right direction. In addition to <i>Four Centuries</i>, consult his <i>A Short History of Classic Theatrical Dancing</i>. If you consult <i>Balanchine's New Complete Stories of the Great Ballets</i>, you'll see Balanchine calls it <i>Ballet Comique de la Reine</i> (no Louise). It is best perhaps not to try to say definitively which ballet was the first ballet, but to describe <i>why</i> it is considered a ballet, and why it is considered to be the first ballet; any good history of ballet approaches it in this manner. The <i>International Dictionary of Dance</i>, edited by Selma Jean Cohen, who heads the UCR PhD in dance history program, will certainly have some fantastic information written by someone who is an expert. You might also consider looking at the Grove Dictionaries of Music &amp; Opera; they are such excellent resources, and often have entries for dance productions.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Concerning the phrase "produced and shown", according to Kirstein, <i>Le Ballet des Polonais</i> (again, a minor spelling variation), "impressed an inflential yet limited audience of courtiers and diplomats". In comparison, he says the libretto for <i>Ballet-Comique de la Royne Louise</i> was published (and, one presumes, distributed) and the production was "widely imitated", thus reaching a larger audience than the earlier ballet. The fact that <i>Ballet-Comique de la Royne Louise</i> was a larger-scale work than <i>Ballet des Polonais</i>, and was better known, probably accounts for the fact that so often histories of dance begin with <i>Ballet Comique de la Royne</i>.Roseblink 13:40, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm really really sorry. I've been doing it chronologically. There is more on Lully because he was before the rest. What was there before was worse, I guarantee you, but I am nowhere near finishing it. I also despise how it currently claims ballet ended in 1850. Also, the illusion of flight in ballet section is one I hope to get rid of completely eventually...</dd>
<dd>What I've been doing is citing what is there, and planning on expanding later, which is why it is so crap. Your help would be greatly, greatly appreciated since I am very new in ballet history.

<p>iIf any one person is responsible for the bulk of the text than I apologize - my ranting and raving was by no means directed at one person, just for everyone to take note and bust out the old books on ballet history.</p>
<p>Most encyclopedias give poor accounts of the history of ballet - I know that it is very hard to find good sources for the history of so complex and obscure of an artform as ballet (its a funny thing - everyone knows what ballet is but knows VERY little about it). To get a hold of really good sources (I mean books) on ballet, one must raid thier local library or request intra-library loans. Ivor Forbes Guest has written some of the best historys, though unfortunately they are nearly all out of print. The other is Roland John Wiley, whos work is also out of print.</p>
<p>I love to work on articles, but I can only do it in my spare time. I will try to help out with this article. Ive also got a ton of historical photos that would be nice for this article, particulalry to show the evolution of the pointe shoe and the tutu, etc.</p>

<dd>I have raided the library and have about five books, listed at the bottom of the page. The only section which I've added was the beginning summary at the top (before origins), and then I added a bit about Lully because what was there was <i>completely</i> unworkable. I haven't got past that paragraph, and was intending to touch upon Pierre Beauchamp next before delving into the next period. My prior studies (before reading these books I've got) mostly consisted of recent ballet history, within the last hundred years or so (which this article says did not happen). However, the content after the Lully paragraph is just whatever was there; I've only tried to add relevant pictures to the text. Not as a gallery of good ballet photos, but as pictures which go with the text they are placed with (therefore, ballets from 1901 aren't very relevant to ballets from 1660s). --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 17:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
