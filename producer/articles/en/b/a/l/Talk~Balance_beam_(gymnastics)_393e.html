	    <p>The balance beam is awsome!!! It is so fun and yet so dangerous! Cool!!</p>
<p>not for guys... ouch.... it would hurt their balls...</p>
<p><br />
I deleted a sentence that said men don't perform on balance beam because they have external genitals. Perhaps that is <i>one</i> reason, but it probably has more to do with history of the sport. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> 22:26, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Well it would appear that this statement has since been added back into the article—and was done so in a way that is very nontechnical (perhaps by someone that is not a native speaker of English, or simply as an intentional joke). It uses the term "balls", and includes a link to the disambiguation page for the word (not solely regarding testicles). The sentence reads, "It is not used by the male gymnasts because they have balls, which are very sensitive parts of the male body." I have changed it to read, "It is not used by male gymnasts because of a significant risk of injury to the testicles." This version, however, should be regarded as a temporary fix, as the article is in significant need of further improvement.</p>
<p>I think it should also be verified whether there is more of a historical reason (as was mentioned above) for males not participating in the event, rather than simply one due to the risk of injury. That being said, surely there are some cultures, regions, or organizations ('professional' or not) that <i>do</i> have male balance beam participation and/or events.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is stated that "The maximum exercise time is 1 minute 30 seconds." Where is this time taken from? A modern Olympics standards body? These kinds of things need to be referenced if statements are going to be made about them.</p>
<p>On a more general note, shouldn't this article have a disambiguation page (or at least clarification) that discusses balance beams as something other than merely a gymnastic apparatus? Either way, this entire article is very poorly written, both in terms of content and formatting. I would recommend this be addressed by someone who is knowledgeable about the subject. <a href="../../../p/o/g/User%7EPoga_c4b7.html" title="User:Poga">— Poga —</a> 05:39, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've tried to punch this up a little. All of the rules given, such as the time limit, are clearly spelled out in the <i>Code of Points,</i> which has already been linked from the article, so I don't think there's an additional citation needed for that.</dd>

<dd>As for the issue of "possible testicular injury", that's complete nonsense. For starters, the way gymnasts usually fall off the beam wouldn't really risk any injury to that area of the body (usually, gymnasts fall to the side or head). Second, male gymnasts do plenty of skills on other events--such as pommel horse and parallel bars--where they're straddling the apparatus and are in much greater danger of falling and hurting those bits.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The real reason men don't do balance beam probably is based in old-time sexism, to be honest. Way back when, beam routines were basically dance exercises--if you ever see footage from the 1950s, the gymnasts basically walk and pose. It probably would not have been considered a masculine event, and thus was left to the ladies.</dd>

<dd>For the disambig page, I'm not sure if I've ever heard of balance beams used in any other context besides artistic gymnastics, but if you know of one, feel free to add. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielEng_df2b.html" title="User:DanielEng">DanielEng</a> 02:35, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is definitly also an issue of "possible testicular injury". Men will not be able to straddle hard on the beam like women are able to do.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, this is not true. For one thing, the beam wasn't developed as a gymnastics event until way after the men's progam was formed. For another, male gymnasts DO perform on beam on some American high school teams. Thirdly, events such as p-bars and pommel horse pose much greater risk of injury to the genitals. Also, female gymnasts don't 'straddle hard' on the beam. When they do skills that require them to land in straddles, they actually take the impact on their stomachs, not lower. When they sit, they're on their tailbones, and men could do that without hurting themselves.</dd>

<dd>It's a silly, unfounded rumor and has no place here. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielEng_df2b.html" title="User:DanielEng">DanielEng</a> 05:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh...and to add more support to my argument, here's a video of a high school gymnast (male) competing at Western Mass on the balance beam (about halfway through the clip). Notice that a) he's allowed to compete (they wouldn't allow him to do so, if there was a serious threat of injury); b) he DOES straddle the beam, and lives! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aU4tWQ2fm8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aU4tWQ2fm8" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielEng_df2b.html" title="User:DanielEng">DanielEng</a> 07:07, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
