<p>these should be added to "theories of ball lightening"</p>

Lightning passing through that area has enough energy to convert the air from a gas to a plasma (<i>isn't lightning already passing through this area? the air is already ionized if it is conducting, right?</i>). Under the right conditions the plasma is trapped within the magnetic field shaped like a vortex (<i>what is causing a "vortex" shaped field? why would it attract plasma into a ball shape?</i>). The "ball" exists until the plasma cools (Singer, 1971).</dd>

<p>Reverting the reversion of my changes: Let take this one step at a time.</p>
<p>"(depending on the amount of impurities traces)": If there is no accepted theory of ball lightning, there can no accepted theory of the color of it. In any case, air is pretty uniform, so impurities are very unlikely to be the right explanation.</p>
<p>"Structure is described as a translucent envelope and glowing plasma inside, the whole mass showing signs of internal forces and a burning appearance (Barry, 1980).": What does "translucent envelope" mean in this context. I've never heard ball lightning described that way. It glows, but whether it is a plasma is discussed further down. What sort of internal forces are those supposed to be and how are they made evident? "Burning" adds no information over "glowing".</p>
<p>"Some report claims of the discharge that moves on its own volition.": Whether that is in some reports or not, how can observation of motion alone allow one to conclude whether an object has it own will?</p>
<p>"Although accounts can vary significantly, a generally accepted model can be synthesized.": I dispute this statement.</p>
<p>"These effects may, though, be highly ionized <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_%28physics%29.html" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> contained by magnetic fields of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiant_energy.html" title="Radiant energy">radiant energy</a> (a popular explanation)." and following: There are sound scientific arguments against a plasma explanation. (I suppose I should take the time to expound upon them.) "magnetic fields of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiant_energy.html" title="Radiant energy">radiant energy</a>" is gobbledygook anyway.</p>

<dd>Let take this one step at a time? ok ....</dd>
<dd><i>impurities are very unlikely to be the right explanation</i>? very unlikely? what? This _could be_ a likely and valid reason (though others probably exist and could be as valid).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What evidence is there that impurities play a role? Why should impurities determine the color more strongly than the 79% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% argon present in air?</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>What does "translucent envelope" mean in this context</i>? I would suppose it means an outer surface that is not transparent, but clear enough to allow light to pass through ...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When looking at a glowing object, how can you tell whether the envelope is translucent or is itself glowing? Are you referring to a specific report?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Pending the situation, I would summize that it would be dependent on the light around the object (eg., a light buld behing the ball). I'll see if i can dig up a specific report.</dd>

<dd><i>plasma is discussed further down</i>? That was removed by you [can't refered to something you removed] ...</dd>

<dd><i>What sort of internal forces are those supposed to be</i>? Electromagnetic, mabey ...</dd>
<dd><i>how are they made evident</i>? From the observational reports ..</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is important to distinguish between observations and an interpretation of those observations. What exactly did someone see, that they chose to interpret as evidence of internal forces?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Observation is important, but shouldn't be relied on for thier various interpertations exclusive (interpertations can vary widely). From the various scientific research on the balls, they see evidence of internal forces [see references/ext. links]. I'll see if I can get any other links for that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Whether that is in some reports or not, how can observation of motion alone allow one to conclude whether an object has it own will</i>? Observation of motion alone can allow some to conclude whether an object has it own will ... though other explianations are possible (e.g., this may or may not be the case) ...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If an observer speculates that the ball lightning he observed has volition, then that would not belong under observations but under interpretations (if anywhere). Who made this report and what was it about the motion that led him to make this speculation?</dd>

<dd>Magnetic fields are a well-defined entity and are not made up of "radiant energy" or anything else. Magnetic fields can contribute to the radiation of energy if they are time-varying and associated with electric fields. This is called electromagnetic radiation, or better, depending on the frequency, radio waves, microwaves, light, X-rays, or gamma rays.</dd>

<p>I wish I were as lucky in winning the lottery as I was (if not unlucky, but at least in that million-to-one situation) of having experienced ball lightning:</p>
<p>I was staying with relatives at an isolated farmhouse (and watermill) where the foothills of the <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thuringian_Forest_d1f4.html" title="Thuringian Forest">Thuringian Forest</a> (Germany) run out into a plain. The house was surrounded by alders and elms but other than that was in the flat open countryside. There was a severe thunderstorm, when suddenly lightning struck. (We subsequently found that it had split the chimney above the farmhouse.) It entered the damaged chimney and went on through the ceiling-high old-fashioned tiled stove (Kachelofen) into the living-room, smashing several tiles in the process. By then it had metamorphosed into ball-lightning, and all the time the noise was ear-shattering.</p>
<p>The next thing that happened was that this ball-shaped bright sulphur-coloured object started to hover up and down like a balloon above horizontal surfaces all the while making this most awful noise. The “ball” was about ten inches in diameter and it lasted for about eight to ten seconds. It was then that one of us in the room had the presence of mind to open the door to the corridor and with a sudden “whoosh” it swept out through the half-open house-door. While it was active inside the house, it seemed to be quite self-contained, in other words if it touched anything it certainly didn’t damage anything or impart any of its no doubt immense power to anything in its way. The noise was such that it killed two pigs that died of heart-attacks in the sty along the farmyard. Other than the chimney in the middle of the house-ridge and the tiles of the stove, nothing was damaged. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 00:13, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My family's microwave was hit by a lightning surge once (yes, unplugging things is a good idea), and after the shower of sparks, a 1' diameter yellow orb floated out, made some unpleasant noises, and disappeared after a few seconds. It floated very slowly. Strangely enough the microwave works much better after - this happened in 1986 and the damn thing still works great. Not that this proves it's existence to anyone else, but come on, the reason science ignores this is because they haven't been able to make one. Interesting they've done research into microwave drills, I assumed the surge we witnessed bypassed the microwave tube, and the ball lightening was caused by the metal housing of the appliance, something like that. Maybe the tube did have a part in it. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainman420_d39e.html" title="User:Rainman420">Rainman420</a> 18:38, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article treats the topic as if it were <i>well accepted scientific fact.</i> Regardless of individual belief or opinion on the truth of this phenomenon, more emphasis on the disputed nature of ball lightning should certainly be added to the article.

<dd>I'm really not sure if I just saw ball lightning. I saw basically this: a flashbulb type brightness about 1 foot in diameter in the dead center of the window to my right, after I saw it right on my left. I definately felt it, or at least felt immense fear upon seeing it. I at first thought a car had passed by, but that's actually impossible because it would be at an angle, there's no physical possible way for it to go directly through the house like a shotgun as it just was. We have really big windows, and I went and asked if my sister saw it. She said it was just lightning and described it similar, but didn't see two flashes. I'm thinking she may have saw it while it was to my left (where her window is) and missed the other flash, to the right. It may have been an odd occurrance, or ball lightning (it did have a direct shot if it was so it wouldnt have touched anything). All it did was shock me as it was so unexpected. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Inedible_Bulk_4ec0.html" title="User:The Inedible Bulk">TIB</a> [[User_talk:The_Inedible_Bulk|(talk)]] 06:37, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If there had been cameras in 1500 perhaps we would have a photograph by now.

<p>Around 1954 in a small town in Western Massachusetts, myself and 2 other people witnessed what I now believe to be ball lightning. It was after a thunderstorm, although the rain had completely stopped and the air was calm and one sensed what I now know to be ionized air that can follow a thunderstorm. There is a railroad track that runs through the center of town and we were about to cross it when we saw 3-4 yellow-orange balls about mid-way between a softball and basketball in size, floating and drifting slowly in unison about 6 feet above one of the track rails about 4-5 feet apart from each other. We were at a distance of about 15 feet from them at first sight. There was no noise and they seemed to be aligned directly above the rail, all at the same height and distance apart. While the balls were quite round, the outer circumference was not smoothly delineated like a basketball outer covering, but was slightly irregular or less well defined. This phenonmeon lasted for 15-30 seconds and then as they got another 20 feet or so further away from us they seemed to sort of dissipate.</p>

<p>I observed ball lightning in the early morning hour of 2:15 a.m. June 27, 2006 during a windy rain storm while driving on NY State Rte. 23A in Greene County near Lexington. This is a very remote region in the Catskill Mountains. It was a ball of intensly bright white light in the sky just above the trees and lasted for approximately 6 seconds. It hovered in one spot and snuffed out similar to how the moon, over a period of days, slowly turns into a finger nail shape and then fades to black. It was very bright and made no sound that I heard (I was in a car). I was bone sober because I was going to work at a reservoir dam during the storm event. There was no other traffic or distractions. There was no "regular" lightning at the time. the ball was about the size of a basketball. 161.185.1.100 19:34, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

My friend though that the antenna was hit, as there was a lightning strike very close by at the next second the ball exploded. Is Ball lightning still rare?

<dd>First of all, I do not think your tone is helpful. Lets have some less aggressive language to people just trying to help here. Second of all, is there a Wikipedia policy that states that because something is in the references section (and thus supporting a specific part of the article) means that it should not have an entry in the external links section? I didn't see the NS ref because I was looking at external links. Also, the reference to the online article is lame - it should use the appropriate citation as per my prior edit. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinWick_e7b0.html" title="User:JustinWick">JustinWick</a> 19:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It sounds like a plausible hypothesis that some of the reports of ball lightning in the laboratory (and in nature as well?) result from weld spatter. But if it is your own idea, however good, then it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and cannot be included in Wikipedia.

<p>I removed the following paragraph - not sure how much of it was actually valid...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ball lightning really occurs due to the electric discharge of the positively charged sky and the negatively charged earth. The formation of Ball is due to the friction between the atmospheric molecules of air. The lightning when Starts coming down to earth, it takes few milli seconds of time to form a ball of semi solid that is a collidal state of Air molecules,heat,fire,light. The ball may be of different sizes. This is based on the effect that was created by the Earth's terrestrial magnetic field.. Source: Discovery Channel.

<p>On the main page of Wikipedia Ball lightning, reference 9. There is an article (newscientist) detailing an experiment that produced ball lightning in the lab, and it says the phenomena emitted jets. Many witnesses to these objects have reported such things as beams, rays - "jets!" Perhaps this should be mentioned on the main page. (User:Nosut, 19:30, 5 April 2007)</p>
