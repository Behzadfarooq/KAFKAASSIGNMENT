<dd>The military is more than a lifestyle, it's a culture with its own norms and values, said Wertsch, executive director of Missourians Against Handgun Violence. She calls it a 'fortress,' with a capital "F," which suggests a togetherness within and a separation from civilian America.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The author calls the "all-powerful military mission" the "unseen member of the family."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The military works on the principle of authority because that's the way things need to be, she said.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The biggest thing overall is that the commonalities of our rearing are so powerful," Wertsch said. "It's an identity that supersedes almost all others. It cuts across lines of gender, race and class. It shapes us our entire lives through. You don't stop being a military brat when your parents retire from service life. Retirement is also part of the story."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Military values are the things that separate us most from the civilian world," she said. "Idealism -- military brats tend to be very idealistic people. We've been raised in an environment where you do things for principle, to support an ideal."</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Be Truthful. Children are very perceptive! As soon as the servicemember starts planning and preparing for a drill or deployment, the child will catch on that something is up. Do not lie to your child in an attempt to shield him or her from the truth or they may assume something worse. Talk to your child openly and honestly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Several psychological studies show that despite the distress during separation significant developmental gains are made by many children. Some positive aspects of separation include:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fosters maturity. Military children encounter more situations and have broader and more varied experiences than children from non-military families. Induces growth. Military children learn more about the world and how to function within a community at an earlier age. Taking on additional responsibilities in a parent's absence provides a chance to develop new skills and develop hidden interests and abilities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Encourages independence. Military children tend to be more resourceful and self-starters. Prepares for separations. In a life-style filled with greetings and farewells from deployments and relocations, helps for future farewells and building new friendships.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Strengthens family bonds. Military families make emotional adjustments during a separation which often lead them to discover new sources of strength and support among themselves. A major function of family readiness is assuring that the family is aware of all support services available to them and how to access these services. It is imperative that the Reserve family realize that they are not alone and, chances are, whatever problem or situation they encounter has been addressed before.</dd>

<p>p 350: We are the children of warriors. And although it was initially a role not of our own choosing, it is a role perpetuated by many of us with pride. Our minds, our hearts return us time and again to the warrior path. It is an attitude, a way of being. Our souls were hammered out on the forge of discipline and dedication, of mission and service to others, of loss and sacrifice in the name of something larger than ourselves. pp. 394-396: Strengths (and weaknesses) of military brats -</p>
<p>Responsibleness: Military brats take the notion of duty very seriously. They routinely give their best effort, and they do everything in their power to keep their word. (But as the daughter of an alcoholic Navy chief put it, "I just have to make sure it's not superresponsibleness." There is a danger of perfectionism, which sets one up for perceived failure, then guilt and self-condemnation. Military brats also tend to take on too much responsibility and then wear themselves out trying to do everything single-handedly.)</p>
<p>Excellent social skills: Military brats can get along with almost anybody except authoritarian types, and sometimes even with them. They tend to be very well suited to work involving a great deal of people contact, or where knowing how to quickly fit in socially is an asset. (But military brats protect themselves against loss of friendship, which they tend to consider inevitable, by keeping relationships shallow and short-term. And they assume anyone in authority is an authoritarian, thus creating problems for themselves in the workplace, for instance.)</p>
<p>Resilience (or "adaptability," "flexibility," etc.): Military brats seem to be able to cope with almost anything -- probably a combination of having moved so many times and of being, in many cases, children of alcoholics. (But military brats are so good at adapting that they can become ambivalent and lose sight of their values. It becomes unclear what they really care about, where they draw the line and take a stand.)</p>
<p>Loyalty: It would be hard for anyone to outshine a military brat when it comes to this virtue. (But military brats can be unbelievable suckers.)</p>
<p>Willingness to take risks: Military brats rarely balk at anything new or strange, and are generally able to summon whatever it takes to leap into a new and challenging situation. There is an instinctive understanding that the worst that can happen is that the effort will fail, which in itself is a gain educationally. Military brats have taken massive losses so often that they've learned they can survive them and keep on going. (But it becomes easier to leap into new situations or relationships than to stay with old ones and work through the problems. Military brats might instinctively see to it that they have plenty of change and excitement in life, but they sometimes fall short on actual accomplishment.)</p>
<p>Discipline: Those military brats who have internalized a sense of discipline to the point they enjoy controlling and focusing their energies can be extremely productive and efficient. (But too often, military brat discipline is dependent on external authority -- which also triggers the will to rebel -- rather than being genuine self-discipline. They may give the impression of being very self-disciplined, but in fact are quite inconsistent, and may even go haywire for a time once external authority is removed.)</p>
<p>Tolerance: Having had to adapt to many situations and, in some cases, cultures, military brats often learn to appreciate different points of view and the inherent value of diversity. (But military brats can become so tolerant they lose sight of their own values.)</p>
<p>Idealism: Military brats can be extremely dedicated to matters of principle and will go to extraordinary lengths to promote or defend them. This can give purpose and a depth of meaning to their lives. (But military brats can be self-righteous, and sometimes make others around them feel guilty and resentful. Also, it's not unheard of for a military brat to sacrifice way too much for the sake of principle -- "take that plane right into the ground." Military brats have been known to sacrifice every sort of personal happiness -- marriage, family, career, financial security -- for the sake of making a point.)</p>
<p>Handling crisis well: Military brats often handle emergencies with calm and competence. Others they know sense this and frequently turn to them for help. The daughter of a Marine Corps sergeant, asked to name some of the good things we learned inside the Fortress, said, "I'm very good in a crisis. The more extreme the circumstances, the more calm I get. I'm able to pull everything together at once; I know exactly the kinds of things that should be handled, and in what order. That is something I know I got from my father." (But although there isn't much of a dark side to this, it would help if military brats could learn to be better at heading off crisis in the first place. Some military brats, however, seem to thrive on crisis -- another trait common to adult children of alcoholics.)</p>
<p>pp. 425-426: on roots and "home" - The home that one makes in the spirit and the mind. That is the home I was looking for when I began this book. And that is the home I have found, the home I share with other military brats. Our home is not a place, but the shared experience of the Fortress and its many legacies. Our home is hardship and what we learned from it. Our home is a rich fund of values and ideals. Our home is a special quality of freedom that one can obtain only, ironically enough, inside the ironclad Fortress.</p>
<p>"Home" for a rooted civilian is a place to return to so that love and values and memories and a sense of continuity can be replenished. What I found is that we military brats have a home like that too, a home that we all share, that lives in each of us, that we can visit in one another.</p>
<p>I could not have found it without the help of the many military brats who shared their stories with me. The sharing of stories, I learned, is what roots are all about. Subtract the sharing, and what do you have? Only a bit of dry knowledge fit to be filed in a dusty folder somewhere. Real roots are about connection -- the bonding with others who share a similar lived experience -- and the recognition that who we are individually is due in large part to that lived experience.</p>
<p>After devoting almost five years to intensive study of military brat stories, I (Wertsch) have come to two definite conclusions:</p>
<pre>
   * First, beyond any doubt, our lived experience inside the Fortress shapes and influences us to such a degree that we bear a distinct identity as military brats and always will.
   * Second, I like who we are. Military brats are brave, capable, idealistic. We are seasoned by tribulation, honed by our sense of commitment.
</pre>
<p>I (Wertsch) am proud to be a military brat, and despite the high price exacted by the Fortress, I would have it no other way.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While the brat struggles to adapt to the civilian community, the civilian community may respond negatively to the brat. Some bases are embraced by the local communities, but military families are usually seen as outsiders to the local civilian community. The local community has a personality, a life, and a history that the military family doesn't fit into or know. Since the brat is a transient who will leave in a few years, he may be treated with hostility and mistrust rather than being welcomed by the locals.<sup id="_ref-Wertsch_316_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wertsch_316" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Knowledge of the death of a service member is typically followed by a pervasive sense of fear, until confirmation is received that the service member is not a particular child’s parent."377</p>

<p>"Research has consistently documented relationships between quality of life factors and retention and operational readiness." p 473</p>
<p>"These trends include the larger proportion of married military members, which has produced increasing dispersion of military families in civilian communities around bases; the growing diversity of the military in demographic characteristics, as well as in values and lifestyles; privatization and outsourcing, which have created a growing civilian presence on military installations; and the likelihood of consolidating forces in large megabases that juxtapose different service branches (and cultures)." 473</p>

<p>"Still, children make maturational gains and often become more independent during a parent’s deployment," 1541</p>
<p>"About 10% to 15% of children experience depression in the first year after a parent’s death, she said. Some develop childhood traumatic grief, which hinders their expressing sadness and even recalling happy memories of the deceased parent. They may report somatic symptoms or engage in risky behavior. These children require specialized intervention." 1542</p>

<p>"Physical abuse and neglect are the most common forms of substantiated child maltreatment in military families, followed by sexual abuse and emotional abuse." 94</p>
<p>"Studies comparing military and nonmilitary families in terms of child maltreatment or spouse abuse show mixed results, with some reporting higher rates in the military and others finding lower rates in the military." 94 ---One of the reasons may be is the question of deployment and its affects on the statistics. "On the other hand, there are a number of protective factors unique to the military lifestyle that could reduce the amount of family violence... The military family has health care, housing provided or funded by the government, and access to many family support programs, which likely mediate against many variables associated with poverty and drug abuse in the civilian population." 95</p>

<p>"Psychological profile of the military adolescent is very similar ot that of the nonmilitary adolescent." 106</p>
<p>"The frequency of moves and other military experiences do not seem to deter the military adolescent from developing a healthy self-image. Considering the opportunities and experiences, as well as the supportive network in the military, the adolescents seem to be able to gain something."106</p>
<p>"First, in the area of impulse control, the military adolescent group exceeded their nonmilitary counterparts. This is considered to reflect the attitude toward discipline in the military." 106 "Second, the military adolescents scored well on the vocational and educational goals scale. This may be a reflection of the value placed on education by their parents, since advancements, duty classifications, and assignments in the military are highly dependent on one's level of training and education." 106 "It must also be recognized that the military is a select community whose members have been screened intellectually and emotionally." 106</p>
