<dd>Those are <a href="../../../p/a/v/PAVE_PAWS_6b6f.html" title="PAVE PAWS">PAVE PAWS</a> sites. <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/bmews.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/bmews.htm" rel="nofollow">Global security BMEWS</a> and <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/sspars.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/sspars.htm" rel="nofollow">Global security SSPARS</a> might help explain things. I think that the list of only 3 sites refers to the original BMEWS sites that consisted of the older AN/FPS-50 detection radar and AN/FPS–92 tracking radar. The 3 original sites have all been converted to Phased Array systems. If I have read things correctly, after the phased array systems were installed, the sites were no longer technically BMEWS sites and today there are no <s>active BMEWS</s> sites with original BMEWS radar equipment. <a href="http://www.peterson.af.mil/pavepaws/Clear/clear_afb.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peterson.af.mil/pavepaws/Clear/clear_afb.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 15:38, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the Clear AFB website <a href="https://www.clear.af.mil/mission.htm" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.clear.af.mil/mission.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, accessed today, "Clear is Site II of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). Site I is at Thule AB, Greenland, and Site III is at RAF Fylingdales-Moor in United Kingdom. Along with the PAVE PAWS radar sites at Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Beale AFB, California and the PARCS radar at Cavalier AFS, North Dakota, the BMEWS sites provide continual ground-based missile warning to defend the United States and Canada against intrusion by ICBMs and SLBMs."--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 18:17, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose that BMEWS is a function, more than anything else. That function is to detect Ballistic Missiles coming over the pole. The function was originally performed by AN/FPS-50 detection radar and AN/FPS–92 tracking radar at 3 locations, Thule, Clear and Fylingdales. Since then the sites have dumped the older radars and all have phased array radars, Thule a two-faced AN/FPS-120, Clear a two-faced AN/FPS-123, and Fylingdales a three-faced AN/FPS-126. The PAVE PAWS were originally two-faced AN/FPS-115 but are now AN/FPS-123. They were installed to cover the other directions as a backup for satellite detection and defense against FOBS and SLBMs. So, I gather that even though BMEWS uses PAVE PAWS-like radars (In fact Clear is a former PAVE PAWS radar) they will probably always be called BMEWS because thats what they were when they were built. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 19:09, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the original BMEWS sites are still in use and their primary mission hasn't changed, but the military is fond of renaming things. Presumably all the sites mentioned above are working as a unified system these days. PAVE PAWS was originally built as a supplement to BMEWS to address the SLBM threat, and the other two BMEWS sites are using different radars, so PAVE PAWS would not appear to be an appropriate name for the combined system, either.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 20:26, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I'm probably confusing the issue with radars and functions, etc. I agree that they are all part of the US space warning system. BMEWS, <a href="../../../p/a/v/PAVE_PAWS_6b6f.html" title="PAVE PAWS">PAVE PAWS</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra_Dane_e259.html" title="Cobra Dane">Cobra Dane</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safeguard_Program_72d3.html" title="Safeguard Program">PARCS</a> all provide space warning and tracking. The image of coverage is interesting as well, except that only <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Fylingdales_e6d6.html" title="RAF Fylingdales">RAF Fylingdales</a> has 360° coverage. The rest of the PAVE PAWS types only have two faces which cover, I would guess, less than 240°. PARCS and Cobra Dane (not depicted) have only one array and probably cover only 120°. That is why <a href="http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/fdales/intro.htm" class="external text" title="http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/fdales/intro.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> has broken lines behind the 2 faced sites. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 21:38, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Thule website<a href="http://www.thule.af.mil/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thule.af.mil/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> seems to be saying they are still calling themselves part of BMEWS. Clear in Alaska was apparently BMEWS and then switched to PAVE PAWS. I uploaded that map today but I made the mistake of assuming they were all 360 degrees like Fylingdales. I'll try to correct that tomorrow! <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreveX_ae5c.html" title="User:TreveX">TreveX</a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreveX_97ec.html" title="User talk:TreveX">talk</a></sup> 22:26, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BMEWS and PAVE PAWS now all use very similar radars and have similar functions. However, I believe the original BMEWS sites will always be called BMEWS no matter what radar they are using. It confused me at first because the radar is identified as a PAVE PAWS radar in this article. It was a PAVE PAWS radar, (AN/FPS-123), that is now part of BMEWS. I would call Clear a BMEWS site despite the radar type it is using. Maybe somebody who works for the USAF Space command could clarify this. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 23:25, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay I've updated that map (see article). Has anyone any idea which direction the respective radars are pointing in?

<dd>I found the lat/long of the radars using USA Photomaps, which uses Terraserver USGS aerial photos. I posted the positions on the PAVE PAWS page. The photos were taken before the completion of the Clear site, so it might be hard to calculate. However, the Cape Cod and Beale should be easy to get a direction on. Thule has no detailed images, so I can't help with that one. After looking at Beale, it looks like one array points directly south or close, I'd say 180-185 degrees true. The other appears to be 295-300 degrees true. That gives a coverage of about 120-360 degrees true. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 23:50, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Based on the aerial photo, I'd say Cape cod has one array facing 45 deg the other about 170. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 23:52, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So my estimate was fairly accurate. They go quite in depth with coverage because of the local community and a cancer cluster that locals were trying to blame on the radar. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 00:05, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay I've updated the three on US territory on my copy of the map using those PDFs. I now need to know about Thule, Cobra Dane and PARCS in North Dakota. How many arrays do they have and where they are pointing? Maps are probably better than degrees, as it's easier to gauge relatively as the map projection distorts directions anyway. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreveX_ae5c.html" title="User:TreveX">TreveX</a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreveX_97ec.html" title="User talk:TreveX">talk</a></sup> 10:59, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing more that I can find right now on Thule. Looking at the aerial photo of the PARCS its a single faced array pointing about 8 degrees true. Maybe you can find more <a href="http://srmsc.org/par2000.html" class="external text" title="http://srmsc.org/par2000.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Cobra Dane has a single face and I would guess it points mostly west based on the description on the <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra_Dane_e259.html" title="Cobra Dane">Cobra Dane</a> page. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 11:32, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, the map is still wrong. Clear is very much a BMEWS site and not part of the PAVE PAWS system. Correct Clear was upgraded with a dual faced SSPAR which was an old PAVE PAWS RADAR but that did not make it a PAVE PAWS site. Additionally Clear is a dual faced RADAR covering 297-177 degrees and not 360 degrees as shown. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.109.66.148_9111.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.109.66.148">82.109.66.148</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.109.66.148.html" title="User talk:82.109.66.148">talk</a>) 09:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>The similar system was developed in the USSR around the same time, where is a mention of it?

<dd>I'm sure that a story about the Soviet system would be very interesting, though I can't read russian. It would deserve its own article here since this article is about the US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), not ballistic missile warning systems in general. Unfortunately for us the Soviets were not all that free with information about their systems. I guess even the US didn't give much out about their own systems, but it's hard to hide a big radar in the UK like Fylingdales. It wasn't that hard to hide a radar in the northern part of the Soviet Union during that time period. If you want a place to start, try <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/facility-radar.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/facility-radar.htm" rel="nofollow">global security's</a> article on Russian radars. There are also US DOD estimates, drawings etc at <a href="http://www.dodmedia.osd.mil/" class="external text" title="http://www.dodmedia.osd.mil/" rel="nofollow">DOD media</a>, try the keywords Soviet radar. At the bottom of the first page there are coverage cones and types of radars as well as artist conceptions of those radars. Maybe there is an article on Wikipedia, but it's just not called by the name we are thinking of. If you make one, or find one feel free to add it to the see also section. Thanks. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 23:05, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it's about US system, OK. But then, I think, this should be mentioned in the lead, because the article sounds like such system is unique. I don't intend to do any work on other systems. Just to say, that it would be interesting to have a description of such systems in general in some Wiki article. Even if some "nuclear" countries don't develop such systems, this fact about them would be quite interesting to know, I think. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmapm_ac09.html" title="User:Cmapm">Cmapm</a> 23:21, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was not involved with this article's creation, but based on the current intro and body, it appears to be discussing a specific system with radars located in Clear, Alaska, Thule, Greenland and the UK. The name of the system was BMEWS or Ballistic Missile Early Warning system. I don't know any Russian, but babelfish translates the ru article as "Warning system about the rocket attack". Does that article discuss a specific Russian / Soviet-era system or does it discuss general early warning systems targeted at ballistic missile detection? As far as I can tell the sole purpose of this article is to describe a specific single system called BMEWS. Using Google search terms Ballistic Missile Early Warning system yields links related to the specific US system with the same name, so it seems plausible that this article would have a similar focus. <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_warning_radar.html" title="Early warning radar">Early warning radar</a> seems to have a broader focus. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 23:47, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, as I said, that RU article is only about the Soviet/Russian system and its development since the 1950s. It has no mention neither of the US system, nor of any other existing/non-existent ones. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmapm_ac09.html" title="User:Cmapm">Cmapm</a> 00:01, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on the pictures, and the excellent introduction, I was quite surprised to scroll down and find nearly nothing more. Surely, this can be expanded?
