I was also wondering if Saragosa shouldn't be Zaragoza (that's the name of the Spain city, I think). Also, about the <i>gilipollas</i> word, can't it be omitted at all? after all, that remark isn't a very esential one.

<dd>Fixed last two items, so I think we're done now, but I'll leave it to someone in charge to remove the Pages Needing Translation template. Maybe the stub template should be removed as well. That being said, I think this article needs a good edit and the plot of the book should be moved to a separate article.

I've removed the template.

<p>This author is almost universally referred to as Gracián, not Gracián y Morales, and the page title should reflect that, as it does on the Spanish Wikipedia's article: <a href="../../../../es/b/a/l/Baltasar_Graci%C3%A1n_e784.html" class="extiw" title="es:Baltasar_Gracián">es:Baltasar Gracián</a>.
