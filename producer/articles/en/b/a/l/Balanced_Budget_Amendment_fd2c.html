The Congress may amend such statement provided revised outlays are not greater than revised receipts. Whenever three-fifths of the whole number of both Houses shall deem it necessary, Congress in such statement may provide for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a vote directly to that subject. The Congress and the President shall ensure that actual outlays do not exceed the outlays set forth in such statement.</dd>
<dd><i>Section 2.</i> Total receipts for any fiscal year set forth in the statement adopted pursuant to this article shall not increase by a rate greater than the rate of increase in national income in the last calendar year ending before such fiscal year, unless a majority of the whole number of both Houses of Congress shall have passed a bill directed solely to approving specific additional receipts and such bill has become law.</dd>
<dd><i>Section 3.</i> The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect.</dd>

<dd><i>Section 5.</i> The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect.

<p>At the time that the Constitution came into effect, the United States had a significant debt, primarily associated with the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">Revolutionary War</a>. There were differences within and between the major political coalitions over the possible liquidation or increase of this debt. As early as 1798, Thomas Jefferson wrote</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government; I mean an additional article taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing. I now deny their power of making paper money or anything else a legal tender. I know that to pay all proper expenses within the year would, in case of war, be hard on us. But not so hard as ten wars instead of one. For wars could be reduced in that proportion; besides that the State governments would be free to lend their credit in borrowing quotas.<sup id="_ref-JeffToTaylor_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JeffToTaylor" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Unlike the constitutions of most <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._state_5a68.html" title="U.S. state">states</a>, the United States Constitution does not actually require the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_United_States_f5e4.html" title="Congress of the United States">United States Congress</a> to pass a "balanced" budget, one in which the projected income to the government through <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">taxes</a>, fees, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fine.html" title="Fine">fines</a>, and other revenues equals the amount proposed to be spent. This has led to "<a href="../../../d/e/f/Deficit_spending.html" title="Deficit spending">deficit spending</a>" and the creation of a <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_debt.html" title="Government debt">national debt</a>. Except for a short period during the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">presidency</a> of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jackson_463e.html" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, since its inception the United States Government has always been in debt. At one time, President <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> mananged to create a balanced budget for the national government.</p>

<p>The practice of deficit spending has many critics. Their argument against this practice is usually twofold – the first point being that debt requires large portions of governmental revenues going not to any program or need but merely to pay <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interest.html" title="Interest">interest</a> to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investor.html" title="Investor">investors</a>, and the second being that the U.S. Government's ability to incur essentially limitless debt leads invariably to the expansion of government into areas which they believe the Founders never intended it to enter, such as the realm of social policy. They also note that many taxpayers themselves live off of what their income is, or even considerably less, and that government should do likewise.</p>
<p>Even those taxpayers who incur debt, the critics note, are limited by considerations of creditworthiness and repayment, which hardly affect the U.S. Government because the results of its going into default are essentially regarded to be unthinkable, and it is therefore considered an event that will not happen, because it would be <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politically</a> impossible to permit it.</p>
<p><a name="Keynesians_and_deficit_spending" id="Keynesians_and_deficit_spending"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanced_Budget_Amendment_fd2c.html" title="Edit section: Keynesians and deficit spending">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Keynesians and deficit spending</span></h3>
<p>Supporters of the current system state that the federal government, unlike state governments, needs the ability to control the size of the money supply. (Followers of <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keynesian_economics.html" title="Keynesian economics">Keynesian economics</a> believe that the government could deliberately engage in deficit spending during times of <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recession.html" title="Recession">recession</a> as a method of economic stimulation.) They also state that the federal government, unlike the states, has the sole power and authority to wage war, and must defend the country even if this means going further into debt, and perhaps under circumstances which could not be contemplated by any supermajority bypass provisions which are in most “BBA” proposals.</p>
<p>Many also state that as a percentage of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_domestic_product.html" title="Gross domestic product">gross domestic product</a> both the current levels of deficit spending and overall <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_debt.html" title="National debt">national debt</a> are acceptable, and even could be considered low in historic terms. At one time, those largely unworried by deficits also said that the deficit was largely irrelevant because it was “the debt we owe ourselves”, meaning that it was largely owed to U.S.-based investors. Recent studies have shown that this is increasingly not the case; many holders of U.S. <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bond_%28finance%29.html" title="Bond (finance)">bonds</a> are <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a>, and even <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a>.</p>

<p>As a political issue, the deficit, national debt, and the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment have ebbed and flowed in levels of discussion and the proposed amendment has varied greatly in level of support. The modern discussion of the issue seems to have been started by the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> in response to the "guns and butter" policies of President <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_B._Johnson_d5db.html" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B.

<p>Deficit spending resumed under <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, who had become president by the time that the 1969 surplus was known. Nixon's advisors chose to fight <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">inflation</a> rather than to maintain a balanced budget. Nixon was famously quoted as saying, "We are all Keynesians now," with regard to the budget deficit that his administration began to accumulate during years of mild recession. (He also imposed the first peacetime <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incomes_policy.html" title="Incomes policy">wage and price controls</a>, mandatory <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum.html" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> allotments, and many other features of a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>).</p>
<p>With the distractions of the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate_scandal.html" title="Watergate scandal">Watergate scandal</a> and the budget deficit relatively small, however, most criticisms were sidelined until the administration of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. During Carter's presidency, the term "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagflation.html" title="Stagflation">stagflation</a>" enjoyed widespread use as the economy stagnated even among increased inflation rates. This economic situation had been previously unheard of in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> where increasing prices and wages had generally been seen during times of economic growth. Republicans began to make much mention of "<a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> deficits" and proposed the Balanced Budget Amendment as a cure. This was politically costless for them as long as they controlled neither house of Congress nor the Presidency, as they knew that it would not be enacted.</p>
<p>During this time period, even many liberal Democrats began to call for a Balanced Budget Amendment, including Governor <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Brown_fc91.html" title="Jerry Brown">Jerry Brown</a> of <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, who ran for president against Carter in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, and then-Congressman <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Simon_%28politician%29_149b.html" title="Paul Simon (politician)">Paul Simon</a>, who, upon his election to the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_of_the_United_States_9c00.html" title="Senate of the United States">U.S. Senate</a>, would write the version of the amendment that came closest to passing.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanced_Budget_Amendment_fd2c.html" title="Edit section: Reagan versus Congress">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reagan versus Congress</span></h3>
<p>However, when the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1980_c07b.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1980">1980 U.S. Presidential election</a> gave Republicans both a new President in the person of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and control of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a>, passage of the amendment started to seem more possible (even though passage of a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress). Deficit spending soared in the 1980s. A program agreed to by Administration and Congressional leaders which was supposed to entail two dollars of spending cuts for every dollar of tax increases was an abysmal failure, and deficits soared further. It became apparent that Congress had no intention of passing the Balanced Budget Amendment.</p>
<p>The amendment's backers, far from despairing, said that it was needed more than ever. They began a plan to make an "end run" around Congress, for the U.S. Constitution also allows two-thirds of state <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislature.html" title="Legislature">legislatures</a> to petition for a new constitutional convention to be called for the purpose of writing proposed amendments to the Constitution, a procedure which has never happened at the federal level since the original constitutional convention of <a href="../../../1/7/8/1787.html" title="1787">1787</a>. Many people were appalled at the concept; some constitutional scholars suggested that such a body could not be limited to its obstensible purpose and could largely rewrite the Constitution, perhaps removing or reducing the Bill of Rights, a fear that backers described as being totally groundless, since any proposed changes would still have to be approved by three quarters of the states, which would presumably doom any attempt to end basic constitutional freedoms.</p>
<p>Detractors also noted that there was no mechanism in place by which to select delegates to any such convention, meaning that the states might chose to select them in a way which tended to subvert democracy. Backers also produced their own constitutional scholars stating that limiting such a convention was perfectly constitutional, that it could be limited to whatever purpose the states had called it for, and that states would be free to select the delegates to represent them, as was the case in 1787.</p>

<p>Perhaps motivated by the number of state legislatures calling for such a convention approaching the required two-thirds, and recognizing its inability to make sufficient cuts on its own initiative to balance the budget, Congress responded in 1985 with the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramm-Rudman-Hollings_Act_d4cb.html" title="Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act">Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act</a>, named for its Senate sponsors, which called for automatic cuts in discretionary spending when certain deficit-reduction targets were not met. This act soon became a convenient target for opponents of all stripes, who blamed it for government failing to meet perceived needs, for not abolishing the defecit, and anything else that might be wrong with government. When it began to affect popular programs, and was partially overturned in the courts, it was first amended to postpone the strength of its effects until later years, and then repealed in its entirety.</p>

<p>President George H. W. Bush, in part to help ensure Congressional support for the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a>, agreed to turn back on a campaign promise ("<a href="../../../n/o/_/Read_my_lips%7E_no_new_taxes.html" title="Read my lips: no new taxes">Read my lips: no new taxes</a>!") and agree to a tax increase, again in return for a promise of spending cuts which proved to be phantom, possibly in part because he saw disaffection from his conservative base due to the looming deficit to be more damaging than violation of his tax promise. If so, this proved to be a miscalculation.</p>
<p>Deficit spending continued, but was no longer much of an issue until the maverick presidential bid of <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">H.

Many supporters of the Balanced Budget Amendment flocked to the Perot camp; most were stunned when he suspended his campaign in August of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> and were thrilled when he re-entered the race in October just in time for the presidential debates, where he again pounded the candidates of the major parties, President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H.

However, after Perot failed to carry a single state, he temporarily faded from the scene somewhat and when he made appearances, focused more on the trade deficit issue.</p>

<p>The Republican takeover of Congress in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> led to a push for a balanced budget, President Clinton and congress reduced the deficit. Major economic growth and spending controls such as <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare_reform.html" title="Welfare reform">welfare reform</a>, favored by both the President and Republican congress allowed for a balanced budget (when the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Security_%28United_States%29_305c.html" title="Social Security (United States)">Social Security</a> surplus was counted as revenue) by early in Clinton's second term - considerably earlier than what Clinton's own projections for this had indicated and, afterwards, a surplus which actually allowed the retirement of some government debt.</p>
<p>Momentarily, the deficit issue faded from view. Despite the nominal surplus, the national debt grew each year of the Clinton presidency since the surplus is not applied against spending in this calculation. <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdhisto4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdhisto4.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Out of office, former House Speaker <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newt_Gingrich_8f3a.html" title="Newt Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> called for continued payments toward the debt with a view to paying it off entirely. <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Ross Perot's</a> less effective <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1996_8d3c.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1996">1996 presidential bid</a> was in part evidence of the declining significance of the deficit, and hence the Balanced Budget Amendment, as an issue.</p>
<p>In his final State of the Union President Clinton said the USA should continue to balance its books and pay off the debt entirely. The subsequent technology downturn which began impacting the economy in mid-2000 combined with lost revenue from the Bush Administration's tax cuts as well as the cost to the country from the 9/11 attack and increased spending for military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have eliminated Clinton-era surpluses and both the deficit and debt have grown to the largest in US history.</p>
