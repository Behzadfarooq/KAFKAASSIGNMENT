<p>I began a large rewrite of this page. As an alumni, I was concerned that the definition was little more than a cut and paste from BW's admissions page. When I was a student, I did ample research on BW, and have a book prepped for publication. I borrowed the new format from other wiki definitions for colleges that seems to have served them well. Of course, i there is anything I missed, feel free to edit. I know I will be adding things as I have time--Davhenry 3.22.2006</p>
<p>I don't go there but know a number of people who do--are you sure the fraternities are accurate? A 2007 update, <a href="http://www.bw.edu/admission/campuslife/greeklife.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.bw.edu/admission/campuslife/greeklife.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bw.edu/admission/campuslife/greeklife.asp</a> doesn't list Sigma Phi Epsilon (I guess I can understand why they wouldn't also list Alpha Sigma Phi.) Without talking about the specifics any more than we have to (although they are only a google away for those who stumble on this page and have a sense of morbid curiosity,) I unfortunately heard about the incident with Sig Ep in '05--they must've had to disband afterwards or something?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sigma Phi Epsilon and Alpha Sigma Phi are both still active fraternities. Though I am unaware of the sigep incident from 05. I do know that the two fraternities are back now, whether or not they were gone before.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 05:16, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to the BW website, they do not seem to officially recognize the two fraternities in question. Perhaps the section should indicate the "official" greeks from the others. There seems to be a distinction.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavhenry_ae12.html" title="User:Davhenry">Davhenry</a> 15:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Really? They recognize them here, maybe the website needs updating. (They participated in greek sing, made a big deal abotu ASP doign it for the first time in 12 years, I don't think unofficial frats can take part in that.) I'll triple-check, but as a curent student I'd know these things. (Problem is that's OR, hmm...) At the same time, the sororities page shows a delta sigma theta, whch I've never heard of before. Though I just checked the frat page, it shows the 5 fraternities listed...--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 15:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wizardman--Well, the 2007 link above left out the colony or the fraternity involving the incident, but you may have looked at the older 2005-2006 link: <a href="http://www.bw.edu/stulife/greek/fraternities/" class="external free" title="http://www.bw.edu/stulife/greek/fraternities/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bw.edu/stulife/greek/fraternities/</a> I would think the newer link supersedes the older one, but again you're the current student and would know firsthand...</p>
<dl>
<dd>ah, I never clicke dthe above link until just now. Maybe there is something going on that I'm unaware of..--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 16:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, if the 2007 link is considered to be the most current, how is it that I cannot get to it from the main webpage, that I am simply taken to the old link? The question is, are the letters' still up on a dorm somewhere? What constitutes "active"? We should have the most current information, that is all<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavhenry_ae12.html" title="User:Davhenry">Davhenry</a> 19:17, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sigma Pi Epsilon IS living on campus next year, I believe in Heritage. The Alpha Sigs I cannot confirm that they have a dorm set aside for next year (though they are small). So, SigEps are "active" now, dunno about the other. (they do stuf on campus, but i don't know if that's good enough).--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 00:39, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I applaud the efforts put forth by the previous editor, I feel that, and this is as a current student, the text was very much biased towards casting BW in a postive light, as opposed to something that is supposed to be objective. As much as I love BW and serving it justice, I don't believe that Wikipedia is the place to do so. I have edited some of the links out of the text, as they would have simply redirected the reader back to the page (pretty pointless, in my humble opinion.)</p>
<p>I hope this is satisfactory to you, Mr. Henry (and if I'm reading the name right, I'm going to assume that you are the former Chief Justice of the Student Supreme Court... a body that has since fallen into disarray.) --<a href="../../../b/w/r/User%7EBwryan2006_c0d5.html" title="User:Bwryan2006">Bwryan2006</a> 04:10, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, BWryan, you have me at a disadvantage, for you know my name, and I do not know yours. I am new to the wiki world, I just know that the original definition was <i>really</i> laudatory toward the admissions department. I figured, best to get a better structure online, and let people parse over the style and details.</p>
<p>When it comes to the history, most of it is spot on, save for some bowdlerizing of our campus diversity which I admit, I was uncomfortable in changing from the admissions material. Most of my history can be referenced in the "History of Baldwin University and German Wallace College" by Feutcher et al, found in Ritter. Also, see any of my articles in the Exponent from 2000 to 2002, all researched at Historian's House. If you have any more suggestions as to how to make the entry more neutral, go to it my friend. <b>I concur on your changes</b>, again, the sign of my rookie status as a wikipedian. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavhenry_ae12.html" title="User:Davhenry">Davhenry</a> 05:09, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As for your assumption, my past does not escape me. When I was at BW, I did try to wrest more control over student judicial processes from the administration. Shame, that students only are agitated when a judicial system fails them, instead of trying to craft something that really was independent and run by the responsible adults we have as students (as a graduate of a big ten university, we had something special there at BW). I would be pleased to discuss the nuiances of my "body that has fallen into disarray" with you outside of wikipedia....find me on myspace under DGH or dingashenry, or facebook at Indiana University...such astute observation could only be made by a student government person, I would be curious to hear how that constitution is holding up, another one of my old BW projects. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavhenry_ae12.html" title="User:Davhenry">Davhenry</a> 05:09, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Right now I'd rate it as a B-class article, which sin't too bad. It's going to be my goal to make this college a Featured Article eventualy though. I ask if anyone has any pictures of the college though that would help improve the article, or if anyone has anything else to add. --<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman">Wizardman</a> 02:43, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Wizardman, I support your gumption to make this a featured article. I tried to lay down some "clay" to work with a while back because the original entry was horrible...right out of the admissions flyer. You might find many good pics at the Historian's House on campus, Lou Kiefer has an amazing collection of things few students ever see. Some thoughts though on your edits...it is hard to identify what makes an alumni "notable". Seems to me just ruling out say, U.S. Representatives to congress who do not have a wiki article is not very fair, while keeping some people, like the gal on deal or no deal, just because someone took the time to put her in a wiki article. I would have no problem creating the wiki articles for each of those reps if it means keeping those alumni on, but face it, running for congress and winning is no small task. So, we need a "notable" standard. You might notice on other college articles a laundry list of alumns that seems standardless. I am sure we can reach a median on this one. Oh, and I can see pulling my book as a reference until it reaches publication, as I have had some quarrels with my publisher, it may be awhile. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavhenry_ae12.html" title="User:Davhenry">Davhenry</a> 03:55, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
