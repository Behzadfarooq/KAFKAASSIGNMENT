<p>The <b>Balassa-Samuelson effect</b> (BS-effect) depends on inter-country <b>differences</b> <i>in the relative <a href="../../../p/r/o/Productivity.html" title="Productivity">productivity</a> of the tradable and non-tradable sectors</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Summary_of_the_empirical_.22Penn_Effect.22_effect_to_be_explained" id="Summary_of_the_empirical_.22Penn_Effect.22_effect_to_be_explained"></a></p>

<p>The exchange of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tradable.html" title="Tradable">tradable</a> goods and services <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_one_price.html" title="Law of one price">should</a> lead prices to converge, but convergence is only partial, because some products are not tradable. (<a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_development.html" title="Software development">Software development</a> is an example of tradable service.)</p>
<p>The interesting Penn effect is that the RER deviations usually occur in the same direction: where incomes are high, prices are relatively expensive compared to an international average, and where they are low, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumer_Price_Index_bd3b.html" title="Consumer Price Index">Consumer Price Index</a> tends to be below the average.</p>

<p>If productivity gains against foreign countries are concentrated in the tradable sector, the domestic <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relative_price.html" title="Relative price">relative price</a> of non-tradables will increase, and as the relative average price rises, the real money supply contracts, and the <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exchange_rate.html" title="Exchange rate">Real Exchange Rate (RER)</a> appreciates. If typical productivity gains are concentrated in tradables, high productivity will ultimately be correlated with high RER.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_growth.html" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a> theory it is generally postulated that productivity is increasing, so the <b>Balassa-Samuelson effect</b> (BS-effect) is usually stated as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The traded goods sector has a higher productivity growth than the non-traded goods sector, leading to higher relative non-traded goods' prices</i>".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since traded goods' relative prices are constant (at <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchasing_power_parity.html" title="Purchasing power parity">PPP</a>), but non-traded goods' relative prices are higher, the <a href="../../../c/p/i/CPI_0eb1.html" title="CPI">CPI</a> rises with average productivity growth.</p>

<p>A typical discussion of this argument (e.g. by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Krugman_2111.html" title="Paul Krugman">Paul Krugman</a>) would include the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers in some countries have higher <a href="../../../p/r/o/Productivity.html" title="Productivity">productivity</a> than in others. This is the ultimate source of the income differential. (Also expressed as productivity growth.)</li>
<li>Certain labour-intensive jobs are less responsive to productivity innovations than others. For instance, a highly skilled <a href="../../../z/u/r/Zurich.html" title="Zurich">Zurich</a> burger flipper is no more productive than his <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> counterpart (in burger/hour) but these jobs are services which must be performed locally.</li>
<li>To <i>equalize local wage levels</i> with the (highly productive) Zurich engineers, McDonalds Zurich employees must be paid more than McDonalds Moscow employees, even though the burger production rate per employee is an international constant.</li>
<li>The fixed-productivity sectors are also the ones producing non-transportable goods (for instance haircuts) - this must be the case or the labour intensive work would have been <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offshoring.html" title="Offshoring">off-shored</a>.</li>
<li>The CPI is made up of:
<ul>
<li>local goods (which are expensive relative to tradables in rich countries)</li>
<li>Tradables, which have the same price everywhere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The (real) <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exchange_rate.html" title="Exchange rate">exchange rate</a> is pegged (by the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_one_price.html" title="Law of one price">law of one price</a>) so that tradable goods follow PPP. The assumption that PPP holds only for tradable goods is testable.</li>
<li>Since money exchange rates will vary fully with tradable goods productivity, but average productivity varies to a lesser extent, the (real goods) productivity differential is less than the productivity differential in money terms.</li>
<li>Productivity becomes income, so the real income varies less than the money income does.</li>
<li>This is equivalent to saying that the money exchange rate exaggerates the real income, or that the price level is higher in more productive, richer, economies.</li>

<p>The average asking price for a house in a prosperous city can be ten times that of an identical house in a depressed area of the <i>same country</i>. Therefore, the RER-deviation exists independent of a <i>nominal exchange rate</i> cause. Looking at the price level distribution within a country gives a clearer picture of the effect, because this removes three complicating factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="../../../e/c/o/Econometrics.html" title="Econometrics">econometrics</a> of <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchasing_power_parity.html" title="Purchasing power parity">PPP</a> tests are complicated by <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exchange_rate.html" title="Exchange rate">nominal exchange rate</a> noise. (This noise would be an econometric problem, even assuming that the exchange rate volatility is a pure <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_error_%28statistics%29.html" title="Standard error (statistics)">error term</a>).</li>
<li>There may be some real economy border effects between countries which limit the flow of tradables or people.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetary.html" title="Monetary">Monetary</a> effects, and exchange rate movements<sup id="Footnote_1"><a href="#Footnotes" title="">1</a></sup> can affect the real economy and complicate the picture, a problem eliminated if comparing regions that use the same <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency.html" title="Currency">currency</a> unit.</li>
</ol>
<p>A pint of <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub.html" title="Pub">pub</a> beer is famously more expensive in the south of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> than the North, but supermarket <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a> prices are very similar. This may be treated as <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anecdotal_evidence.html" title="Anecdotal evidence">anecdotal evidence</a> in favour of the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis, since supermarket beer is an easily transportable, traded good. (Although pub beer is transportable, the pub itself is not.) The BS-hypothesis explanation for the varying <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price.html" title="Price">price</a> differentials is that <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publican.html" title="Publican">publican</a>'s 'productivity' in serving customers is more uniform (in pints per hour) than is the 'productivity' (in foreign earnings per year) of people working in the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Export.html" title="Export">export</a> sector in either half of the country.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balassa-Samuelson_effect_1231.html" title="Edit section: Empirical evidence on the Balassa-Samuelson effect hypothesis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Empirical evidence on the Balassa-Samuelson effect <i>hypothesis</i></span></h2>
<p>Evidence for the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_effect.html" title="Penn effect">Penn effect</a> is well established in the modern era (and is readily observable when traveling internationally). However, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Econometric.html" title="Econometric">econometric</a> evidence that the BS-effect is the mechanism causing the CPI differentials is much less easy to obtain.</p>
<p>Kravis &amp; Lipsey's (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>) review of the International Comparison Program has provided evidence that non-traded goods prices <i>do</i> tend to rise faster than (or relative to) traded goods prices. However, the Balassa-Samuelson (BS) hypothesis implies that countries with rapidly expanding economies should tend to have more rapidly appreciating exchange rates (for instance the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Asian_Tigers_b41b.html" title="Four Asian Tigers">Four Asian Tigers</a>); conventional time series <a href="../../../c/o/i/Cointegration.html" title="Cointegration">cointegration</a> tests tend to be unable to reject the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_hypothesis.html" title="Null hypothesis">null hypothesis</a> that there is no such link.</p>
<p>Direct tests of the connection between real exchange rates (RER)s and relative productivities are difficult to perform because of the relatively short time window for which modern-quality <a href="../../../e/c/o/Econometric.html" title="Econometric">econometric</a> data is available. However, these tests have been attempted, again with mixed findings for the predictions of the BS effect. Although some negative results were returned, there has been some support for the predictions of the BS-hypothesis in the literature, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bahmani-Oskooe &amp; Rhee (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>) did find a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistically_significant.html" title="Statistically significant">statistically significant</a> correlation between RERs and relative productivities.</li>
<li>Lafrance and Schembri (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>) (<a href="http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/publications/review/autumn02/lafrance_e.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/publications/review/autumn02/lafrance_e.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) suggest that the Balassa-Samuelson mechanism may be evident in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> productivity and exchange rate changes between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. (They think it likely that Canada's lagging productivity growth in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manufacturing.html" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> has contributed to the <a href="../../../c/a/d/CAD_eccb.html" title="CAD">CAD</a>'s RER depreciation against the <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Drine &amp; Rault (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>) argue that the difficulties of confirming the hypothesis have partly been due to testing particular components of it, and that even where the varying-productivity-RER link is established it doesn't necessarily confirm the BS-hypothesis; they analyzed its main assumptions separately:</p>
<ol>
<li>The differential of productivities between traded and non-traded sector and relative prices are positively correlated.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchasing_power_parity.html" title="Purchasing power parity">purchasing power parity</a> assumption is verified for tradable goods.</li>
<li>The RER and relative prices of non-tradable goods are positively correlated.</li>
<li>As a consequence of 1, 2, &amp; 3, there is a long-run relationship between productivity differentials and the RER.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the six <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian.html" title="Asian">Asian</a> economies they followed from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> they find that although the RER-productivity relationship (4) appears to hold in <a href="../../../c/o/i/Cointegration.html" title="Cointegration">cointegrating</a> time-series regressions, it cannot be explained by the BS hypothesis, because the evidence rejects assumptions (2) and (3) which are the channels through which the BS-effect supposedly operates. In fact, Drine &amp; Rault's Panel methodology revisions "<i>indicate the absence of a significant co-integrating relationship between real exchange rate and productivity differential</i>", in these data sets.</p>
<p>Refinements to the econometric techniques and debate about alternative models are continuing in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_economics.html" title="International economics">International economics</a> community. For instance:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A possible explanation of the BS empirical rejection may simply be that there are additional long-run real exchange determinants that have to be considered." Drine &amp; Rault conclude.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The next section lists some of the alternative proposals to an explanation of the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_effect.html" title="Penn effect">Penn effect</a>, but there are significant <a href="../../../e/c/o/Econometric.html" title="Econometric">econometric</a> problems with testing the BS-hypothesis, and the lack of strong evidence for it between modern economies may not refute it, or imply that it produces a small effect. For instance, other effects of exchange rate movements might mask the long-term BS-hypothesis mechanism (making it harder to detect if it exists). Exchange rate movements are believed by some to have an impact on productivity; if this is true then regressing RER movements on differential productivity growth will be 'polluted' by a totally different relationship between the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variable.html" title="Variable">variables</a><sup id="Footnote_1"><a href="#Footnotes" title="">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Capital inflows (say to the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>) may stimulate <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency.html" title="Currency">currency</a> appreciation through demand for <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a>. As the RER appreciates, the competitiveness of the traded-goods sectors falls (in terms of the international price of traded goods).</p>
<p>In this model, there has been no change in real economy productivities, but money price productivity in traded goods has been exogenously lowered through currency appreciation.

<p>The Penn effect PPP-deviation can be derived from the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demand.html" title="Demand">demand</a> side of the economy, rather than the Balassa-Samuelson <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supply.html" title="Supply">supply</a> side model, in a similar way to the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_disease.html" title="Dutch disease">Dutch Disease</a> explanation above.</p>
<p>When any non-tradable comes up for sale, its price will be determined by the relative <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preference.html" title="Preference">preference</a> between it and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> by the average market consumer. By definition, high income consumers have more money, and are <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indifferent.html" title="Indifferent">indifferent</a> at a higher sale prices between buying an item and not doing so, relative to consumers in a low income area. In tradable goods, supply could shift from poor regions to rich to take advantage of this, forcing price convergence. However, non-tradable supply cannot do this, by definition. Therefore, price differences are caused (in this model) by nothing but relative differences in the abundance of money.</p>
<p>In this demand-side model, the initial sources of income difference are treated as given. (Income is either <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exogenous.html" title="Exogenous">exogenous</a> or evolves based on the ability to sell non-tradables at higher prices where incomes are higher.) This model leads to <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_walk.html" title="Random walk">random walk</a> RER behaviour, as the <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exogenous.html" title="Exogenous">exogenous</a> rich trickle their wealth down to nearby workers without requiring them to improve productivity (the rich simply bid up local service prices). <i>Charging what the market will bear</i> creates the <a href="../../../p/p/p/PPP_b55e.html" title="PPP">PPP</a>-deviation in a similar way to the <i>Balassa-Samuelson effect</i>, but doesn't explicitly rely on productivity differentials or the changes in them.</p>

<p>A typical labour market pattern is that high-<a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_domestic_product.html" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a> countries have a higher ratio of service-sector to traded-goods-sector employment than low-<a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_domestic_product.html" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a> countries.

<p>Lipsey and Swedenborg (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>) show a strong correlation between the barriers to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">Free trade</a> and the domestic <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumer_price_index.html" title="Consumer price index">price level</a>.

<p>This explanation is similar to the BS-effect, since an industry needing protection must be measurably less productive in the world market of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodity.html" title="Commodity">commodity</a> it produces. However, this reasoning is slightly different from the pure BS-hypothesis, because the goods being produced are 'traded-goods', even though protectionist measures mean that they are more expensive on the domestic market than the international market, so they will not be "<a href="../../../e/x/p/Export.html" title="Export">traded</a>" internationally<sup id="Footnote_3"><a href="#Footnotes" title="">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supply-side_economics.html" title="Supply-side economics">supply-side economists</a> (and others) have argued that raising International competitiveness through policies that promote traded goods sectors' productivity (at the expense of other sectors) will increase a nation's <a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_domestic_product.html" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a>, and increase its <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_living.html" title="Standard of living">standard of living</a>, when compared with treating the sectors equally. The <b>Balassa-Samuelson effect</b> might be one reason to oppose this trade theory, because it predicts that: <i>a GDP gain in traded goods does not lead to as much of an improvement in the living standard as an equal GDP increase in the non-traded sector</i>. (This is due to the effect's prediction that the CPI will increase by more in the former case.)</p>

<p>The <b>Balassa-Samuelson effect</b> model was developed in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> by both <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bela_Balassa_66ad.html" title="Bela Balassa">Bela Balassa</a> &amp; <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Samuelson_17cb.html" title="Paul Samuelson">Paul Samuelson</a>, working independently.</p>
<p>It is surprising that both of these economists should have completed their models separately &amp; simultaneously (submitting them to different economic journals) because the outlines of the explanation had been described twenty-five years earlier by <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Forbes_Harrod_cf28.html" title="Roy Forbes Harrod">Roy Forbes Harrod</a> in "International Economics".</p>
<p>Partly because <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empirical.html" title="Empirical">empirical</a> findings have been mixed, and partly to differentiate the model from its conclusion, modern papers tend to refer to the "Balassa-Samuelson <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothesis.html" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>", rather than the "Balassa-Samuelson <b>effect</b>".

<p>If productivity growth is declining then it may limit the size of the <b>Balassa-Samuelson effect</b>, as a halving of productivity growth in both tradable and non-tradable sectors would halve the relative productivity growth as well.</p>
<p>If the Balassa-Samuelson (BS) hypothesis is largely responsible for the deviation from <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchasing_power_parity.html" title="Purchasing power parity">purchasing power parity</a> it is asked why the effect's principal assumption is true; why are productivity gains faster in tradable than non-tradable sectors? It is generally assumed that the production of tradables can be <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automated.html" title="Automated">automated</a> more completely than non-tradables. (Compare car and car-washes.) In economic <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon.html" title="Jargon">jargon</a> this is expressed as: tradables manufacture is more <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_intensive.html" title="Capital intensive">capital intensive</a>. However, the degree to which tradables business is <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_intensive.html" title="Capital intensive">capital intensive</a> may be declining; the <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge_economy.html" title="Knowledge economy">knowledge economy</a> has seen the rise of tradable services, such as <i>financial products</i>, with headcount as the principal business expense (implying a low <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginal_product.html" title="Marginal product">marginal product</a> of capital). If the productivity difference is dependent on capital accumulation, the size of the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_effect.html" title="Penn effect">Penn effect</a> may decline with the economic significance of heavy machinery.</p>
<p>However, the market in traded goods must always be more competitive than in non-tradables, simply because it is <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global.html" title="Global">global</a>. In the tradable marketplace all producers of a commodity are in competition with all the other producers of the same item (and similar substitutes). Non tradables must only out-compete the local rivals. If <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competition.html" title="Competition">competition</a> drives productivity growth, tradables will always have higher growth than non-tradables, <a href="../../../d/e/p/Dependent_clause.html" title="Dependent clause">and</a> (if the hypothesis is true) the Penn effect will always be with us.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote_1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> There may be a causal link from exchange rates to productivity, as well as (or instead of) the opposite direction of causation (from productivity to RERs) given by the BS-hypothesis model. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_E._Porter_acd0.html" title="Michael E. Porter">Michael E. Porter</a>'s <i>The Competitive Advantage of Nations</i> says that currency depreciations can reduce growth, and that 'overvalued' currencies can contribute to domestic productivity growth by 'forcing' efficiency improvements in the tradables sector (by exposing it to international competition at unfavourable terms of trade). In fact, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> gave "Competitive Appreciation" as the official reason for the high <a href="../../../s/g/d/SGD_50ec.html" title="SGD">SGD</a> policy. (Lu &amp; Yu <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>). Other mechanisms through which RERs can effect productivity growth have been advanced, such as the idea that structural transitions caused by exchange rate volatility have a disruptive effect on the real economy. There is some econometric evidence that the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causality.html" title="Causality">causality</a> from exchange rates to productivity is more significant than the reverse, i.e. the BS-effect. (For instance, Strauss, J. <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. <i>Productivity Differentials, the Relative Price of Nontradables and Real Exchange Rates.</i> in the Journal of International Money and Finance number 18.)</p>
<p><a href="#Footnote_2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> The BS-hypothesis would still explain the Cape Verde price index rise in its own terms if the incomes from rising <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emigrant.html" title="Emigrant">emigrant</a>'s remittances were counted as local traded-goods 'productivity' increases. In their study of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Verde_a290.html" title="Cape Verde">Cape Verde</a>, Bourdet &amp; Falck found that the export sector strengthened during the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> period of currency appreciation, which might support the theory of "Competitive Appreciation" mentioned in the footnote above.</p>
<p><a href="#Footnote_3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a> A typical reason for, and result of, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_barriers.html" title="Trade barriers">trade barriers</a>, is that domestic productivity of some tradable-good is below international productivity. In order to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectionism.html" title="Protectionism">protect</a> domestic producers import barriers are raised, allowing the local price for the traded good to rise beyond the international price. If this were a common phenomenon then one of the key assumptions of the BS-hypothesis (that traded-goods follow the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchasing_power_parity.html" title="Purchasing power parity">PPP</a>-hypothesis) would be invalid. However, the essence of the Balassa-Samuelson mechanism would still remain: Even without <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">Free trade</a> it may be harder to increase the productivity in the service sector as rapidly as in mass-production, so if money exchange rates are still based on the output of mass production the differentials in price level could still be caused by the <b>Balassa-Samuelson effect</b>.</p>
