<dd>As you could see from his user contributions, that revert was his last edit so he didn't log in since then most likely (it seems he edits relatively rarely); as it might be so that this page is not on his watchlist, it might be good to contact him on his talk page instead, then he would see immidietly after logging in the next time. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurann_1021.html" title="User:Burann">Burann</a> 09:49, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with some of the changes proposed by Moonshiner (e.g., "citation needed" placeholders are rather OK), while with some others I do not. For example, i) The term "Baltic Russians" really dates back to the end, not the beginning of WW2. ii) Introducing a new construct "Russian Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians" (to denote "Baltic Russians" living in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) is bound to be confusing to many. iii) Deleting the whole paragraph in the beginning which explains why "Baltic Russians" as such can be found only in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, but not in other former (Finland, Poland) or current (Kaliningrad) parts of Russia located by the Baltic Sea, again, risks leaving it unclear for many readers how such a pseudo-ethnic quasi-subgroup of Russians has come to be defined the way it is.

<dd>Ah, as I suspected, most of your issues are with the language barrier. Regarding the origins of the term "Baltic Russians," unless it was coined by some person at a specific date, in which case you can say it was coined by that someone at that date, you really cannot say that at May 9, 1945 it came into popular usage (which applies to phrases coined as well since the process of introducing new phrases into popular usage generally takes a long time). With regards to "Russian Latvians," in English it is customary when pointing out citizens of a particular country of a particular ethnicity to put the ethnicity before the country (ex: African Americans, French Canadians, etc.). As far as the introductory paragraph, after stating that "Baltic Russians are ethnic Russians who live in the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania," there is as much need to point out that the article does not refer to Russians in other countries with Baltic coasts as there is need to point out that it does not refer to Russians in Africa. If you want to clarify further, you are certainly welcome to in the main body of the article (maybe a separate section about incorrect usage of the term "Baltic Russians"), but the introductory paragraph should be concise. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoonshiner_4bde.html" title="User:Moonshiner">Moonshiner</a> 00:34, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not good at English either, but I would just like to note that far from all Russians of Latvia and Estonia has citizenship of Latvia and Estonia, while in Estonia many local Russians has the citizenship of the Russian Federation, which they had opted to receive after they understood that getting Estonian citizenship is hard. As you say "Russian Latvians" for example would be Russians who are citizens of Latvia, so this term does not includes people who lives there permanently but aren't citizens? In that case perhaps it would be better to use "Russians of Estonia" and such to denote whole communities. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurann_1021.html" title="User:Burann">Burann</a> 07:26, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Russians who migrated to the Baltics were not "ideologically motivated" or anymore loyal to the Soviet Union than Latvians were. Most were simple people who migrated to the region because of economic benefits, for example they were given jobs and/or housing there. In many cases Russians filled the jobs (factory workers etc.) which the locals were less willing to do. ...[snip] it was the Soviet KGB (with both ethnic Latvians and ethnic Russian members) who were killing/deporting ethnic Latvians (as well as ethnic Russians) in the Baltics, not Russian immigrants who settled there. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 20:56, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The original text made a declarative statement along the lines that "ethnic Russians were singled out," which (whether you believe it to be true or not) is not NPOV. You have to qualify a statement like that, and if there is a controversy, you have to provide both sides, which I hoped to do by adding some historical and present-day context, the position held by some of the governments, the concerns expressed by the CE/EU, and the opposing view. If you think some of this was mis-stated or lacked substance, or missed something out, fine, edit it, and add detail to it. But the point of Wikipedia is to provide balanced coverage of issues, not to advance one viewpoint and delete anything that disagrees with it. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 00:06, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with the above user. I am on the record of opposing russophobia many times in Wikipedia but for the sake of neutrality and encyclopedicity the position of Baltic governments on how they respond to the discrimination charges should be given. Also, a word or two should be said about the merit of their arguments but not from the POV of WP editors, but from POV of serious publications, European Council and Strasbourg court decisions (there were a couple) and publications in reputable papers...[snip] <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 16:32, May 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to explain some of my edits and would ask to respond here before reverting them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The phrase: <i>"...killed, forced to flee, or exiled to Siberia, both because of the war and due to deliberate Soviet policies that continued, to varying degrees, throughout the Soviet era"</i> seems much more questionable than <i>"...due to deliberate Stalinist policies"</i> simply for factual reasons. There were no killings and mass deportations in post-Stalin time. If I am wrong, please cite the sources.</li>
<li><i>"Party functionaries"</i> stuff the way it stood there looks like propaganda (I am sorry if this offends whoever first introduced it). The emphasis on <i>"the military retirees"</i> is factually correct. The functionaries were a very small fraction of Ethnic Russians. Let's just get real here.</li>
<li>Estonian border service's claim about many Russians crossing illegally into Estonia has no connection to an issue of discrimination (whether perceived or true) brought by ethnic Russians because those are in the country legally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please no flames. Let's just stick to the facts. I agree with hidden comments by <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> and there is much more to add. <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 15:55, May 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Comments about "illegal Russian immigrants" crossing into Estonia and no Russians leaving are simply inaccurate. First, there was a significant number of ethnic Russians who left Estonia and immigrated to either Russian Fed. or Western Europe/North America in the 1990s. Second, virtually all Russians who cross Estonian border illegally are only using it as a temporary transit point on their way to Western Europe. In regards to “party functionaries”: the largest influx of Communist officials in Soviet history was not from Russia to the Baltics, but from Latvia to Russia after the Bolshevik regime there collapsed in 1918. See <a href="../../../j/u/k/Jukums_Vacietis_743b.html" title="Jukums Vacietis">Jukums Vacietis</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakov_Peters_3653.html" title="Yakov Peters">Yakov Peters</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvian_riflemen.html" title="Latvian riflemen">Latvian riflemen</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Karlovich_Pugo_e1c6.html" title="Boris Karlovich Pugo">Boris Karlovich Pugo</a> etc.</p>
<p>Finally, what relevance does Baltic tribe of Old Prussians has to the discussed history of ethnic Russians/Slavs&#160;? (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 17:04, 24 May 2005 (UTC))</p>
<p>More information is good. Nobody "willed" or "not willed" to jobs (it was planned economy), there were qualifications or were weren't; many of worker Russians supposedly had qualifications which locals lacked so it was easier to send them instead of training locals (e.g. to work in certain specific factories or in power plants). While at the start of occupation in all Baltic States and even later in Latva and Estonia all "leading" jobs ha dto be taken by Russians. There ws indeed a settling of Russians in major cities; only reasons for that are disputable. Although there might have been planned rusification in some regions too such as Ida Viruma of Estonia. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 17:15, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most Russians in the Baltic were low to medium income factory workers, as well as sailors, soldiers etc. These are hardly "leading" jobs. (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 18:09, 24 May 2005 (UTC))</p>

<dd>The issue is not who they were, but how they influence. While it is true that the number of buraucrats was small percentage, it is also true that a single bureaucrat can ruin lives of thousands of people. Therefore the fact that Russians occupied disproportionally many managerial positions (not necessarily in government) is a fact of note, as well as their arrogance and disregard towards the language and culture of the country they lived in. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:23, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And by the way, many ordinary Russians were not much better. Can you imagine: their offensive term for Lithuanians was <i>"Labas"</i>! (For those who don't speak Lithuanian: it was based on Lit. greetings: Labas rytas, Labas vakaras, laba diena ("good morning/evening/day"), colloquially shortened to "labas"). Friendship and fraternity of Soviet peoples in action. If someone didn't see the idiotism here yet, imagine Frenchmen cursing Englishmen with the word "good". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:52, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This directly above seems more like an unnecessary generalization and stereotyping and I don't think it should go into the article. The point about disproportionate percentage in management and bureaucracy certainly should be reflected, I agree. As for the arrogance and disregard to local culture, this is true to an extent but it is too easy to go over the line writing about this. So, if anyone wants to write on this in the article, it should be done with restraint. I trust that if <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> chooses to write this himself, it would be balanced. I am just asking all interested parties not to loose balance, so that the article won't repeat the history of the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a> edit wars. <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:31, May 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The disrespect for locals by these Baltic Russians was and is true however. I know enough of them myself to know it, and from Soviet times I know situations like where Russians would beat locals just because their nationality is not Russian. Now, those were simple workers I guess because I doubt Soviet functioneers would do things like that. Even now for example Poles (great number of them at least) tends to respect local culture and such, while the disrespect forom Russians is astonishing. Anyways, what I said here is POV of course, and shouldn't be directly included in article, but Mikkalai probably will do it well. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 19:45, 24 May 2005 (UTC) +

<dd>I am afraid you overestimate my abilities. I am a small operator. I can handle only facts. I can summarize them, but cannot write nice general texts. For this reason I never work systematically. My <i>modus operandi</i> is as follows: if while reading something I stumble upon a fact I know is missing in wikipedia, I add it. Sometimes I take a red link or a poor stub in areas I am familiar with and google around to create a decent stub.

<dd>The above comments are nothing but biased generalization and stereotyping. Even if some Russians do demonstrate "disrespect" to the local cultures this is usually provoked by some locals who are trying to scapegoat completely innocent people for alleged historical injustices done to them by Stalin 50 years ago. You reap what you sow, you can't have an official policy of citizenship and language restriction and expect the people you target to love you in return. Baltic situation is not unique. Historically Swedes, for example, played the same role in Finland as Russians did in Estonia and Latvia; today Swedish is a second official language in the Finnish provinces with large Swedish presence. There are numerous other examples throughout Europe of the former "Imperial oppressors" co-existing with the majority population. Usually governments are doing everything they can to reconcile former historical adversaries living within their territory, rather than trying to score some political points by targeting minorities.(<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 08:00, 25 May 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Well, I live in Lithuania, we don't have any language policy or such here, we ave citizenship to everybody who wanted, in Russan-dominated cities such as <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visaginas.html" title="Visaginas">Visaginas</a> Russian language can be used for documents and such (see <a href="http://www.apenrade.dk/m99_russiansinbaltics.html" class="external free" title="http://www.apenrade.dk/m99_russiansinbaltics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apenrade.dk/m99_russiansinbaltics.html</a> for article about comparement of situation of Russians in Baltic States). But still, the disrespect by Russians as I mentioned is here, and it was maybe even more during Soviet times, when locals couldn't have done anything against these Russians. So I'd say this is vice versa, Russians started it, while now in Latvia and Estonia, once these countries got independent, these laws were issued. There is a major disrespect for local culture and such, they don't even try to understand it. There is no similar disrespect of Russians or Russian culture; people listens to Russian music, Russian films are popular and such. However for certain Russians listening to Lithuanian music or watching Lithuanian films might be seen almost as giving in to the "inferior" culture. And yes, my comments are biased, this is my opinion and I don't ask this to be included in article; if anyone will be able to find more documental info or such then that info will be included. And, by the way, as for comparement with Finland; in Finland there are way less Swedes than there were Russians in Latvia and Estonia at the time of independence; in Latvia they made majority in all cities, and recognising Russian as official language would have made cities completely Russianised, as Russians wouldn't learn Latvian and Latvians would have to learn Russian to talk to most of people; it would be more economic then to e.g. air programs of TV and write newspapers solely in Russian, because Russian could be understood by everybody while Latvian only by some. Latvians wante dto preserve their culture and language. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 08:29, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have met Russians who respect Lithuanian culture and Lithuanians who disrespect Russian culture. This kind of accusations are nothing more than biased generalizations, there is no place for it in an academic discussion and no need to provide "proof" or "documentation" to justify your prejudices. Aside from Finland there are many other examples of bilingual and multilingual states (Canada, Belgium, South Africa, Switzeland etc.) where various ethnic groups are able to preserve their national identities.

<dd>I only explained previous sayings about Russian disrespect for local culture as an insider. By proof or documentation, I meant various information about e.g. desecrations of Lithuanian patriotic monuments by Russians or . And don't compare Baltic States to countries you mentioned: in Switzerland, Belgium, etc. few or many nationalities historically lives together, each of them lives in their own regions, nothing related to settling or such there. Same for Canada: but in Canada both languages are those of colonisators, because colonisers fully took power there and dispersed local Indians; however it is also by traditional regions, French in former French colonies and English in former English colonies. While in Russia, where there are also similar traditional regions and many nations, only Russian language is official at state level, unlike South Africa which you've mentioned yourself for example where really many languages are official; in Russia also people of other nations has to learn Russian, while Russians living in territories of those nations does not have to learn local languages, etc. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 08:59, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I live in Latvia, I am latvian and I don`t speak in russian so maybe I am not fully informated of oppinions of russian part of society, still I think that your oppinions are stereotipical and you tend to view nations as one, not as consisting of many peoples. I was slithly interested about whole affair so I tried to get other people oppinions in internet (few forums), what I learned was that if latvian nationalists apears whole comunity will argue with them and that russians are bored of talking about it over and over again, well that was few years ago when I got those russian oppinions maybe they think diferrent now. What I learned from recent events was that some russians think that they know latvian language better then latvians and that they have brought culture to latvians and I think that is disrespect, I also think that it is disrespect and provoking to plan ilegal protests on national holydays, if there is posibility make legal protests in other days. I couldn`t find any poll nor about latvian, nor about non-latvian thoughts about each other, so I can only tell the diferrence by results of last elections where no latvian nationalists were elected, while russian nationalists was, but many latvians also could have voted for them, so that is bad measure for teling how many nationalists there are from each part of society. What I`m trying to say is that there aren`t many latvian nationalists and it does not seem that there are many russians since their protests are outnumbered and it looks like that those people making those protests just try to make latvians and russians hate each other</p>

<p>In case of a national name, in English WP an English variant of the name should be used if there is one, that is if there is a variant established by, say, English language media. This coach's name, due to the relative obscurity of the topic of Latvian Soccer in the world news, has not established in English media. So, the variant which should be used in WP should depend on the context of the usage. In the article about Latvian soccer it should be <i>Aleksandrs Starkovs</i>. In the article about Baltic Russians, the original <i>Aleksandr Starkov</i> should be used. <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:18, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for Starkovs btw - Aleksandrs Starkovs is his real name, not Alexander Starkov. If he has hs real name Latvianised it does not means we should Russianised just because article deals with Russians. In the same way e.g. <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viktor_Uspaskich_9b7c.html" title="Viktor Uspaskich">Viktor Uspaskich</a> has his Russian name unchanged, and I won't change it into "Viktoras Uspaskichas" because Viktor Uspaskich is his real name. Some Russians has their name localised however, in Lithuania too, and if their name is localised, we should use the real version. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a></dd>

<p>This argument can only convinced someone unfamiliar with the Russian names and Russians in Latvia. Nowhere else in the world are Russian names are "localized" in this fashion and this is obviously not how the name is properly pronounced. The only reason why his name is "localized" is official nationalist policy of the Latvian state and the real transliteration of the name Александр Старков is Alexander Starkov not Alexanders Starkovs. (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 23:07, 25 May 2005 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, sometimes Russians do localize their names in other counntries, if they choose to. In US that would be names like Smirnoff, Chertoff, Alexandrov (also note "X" for "KS"), etc. Some Russians choose not to localize their names and some do. If indeed Starkov wished to change his name to Starkovs that's how we should call him. Except, of course, in Russian WP he sould probably still be Старков. <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 23:15, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Smirnoff is not a localized Russian name. It is just an old way to transliterate Russian names into English, pronunciation is still the same. Obviously Alexander Starkov did not change his name, just like the rest of his soccer team players those names were changed into Aleksandrs Kolinko, Igors Stepanovs, Vitalijs Astafjevs, Maris Verpakovskis , Andrejs Rubins, Andrejs Prohorenkovs, Jurijs Andrejevs etc. See <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvia_national_football_team.html" title="Latvia national football team">Latvia national football team</a>. None of these names are ethnic Latvian, they are Ukrainian, Russian and Polish. They were only "localized" for Western media after the team started to make international headlines.

<dd>Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because "Maris" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings "as" or "is"). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something, and I just wanted to tell here that if Russian's name is localized in Baltic countries it does not means that the name should be Russianised. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship? (in that case still real name should be used though) I don't know here. But yes, I think current way of writting is acceptable. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 08:18, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>re comment above (<i>in that case still real name should be used though</i>), I think if the change of name was forced, the changed name is still a legal name, you are right. However, in this case the usage of the name in WP does become context dependent as I said earlier (See Gdansk/Danzig kilobytes of talk pages). In articles devoted to Latvia we should give a Latvian name, in articles devoted to <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Russians_3940.html" title="Baltic Russians">Baltic Russians</a> the name should be original rather than forced upon. Isn't it obvious that freely chosen and forced upon names should have different degrees of acceptance? In Ukraine names were Ukrainized by passport authorities and people were not allowed to choose. If in Lithuania they were given a choice, I am glad to hear that. If there is anyone who can tell how it was in Latvia, please let us know. In any case, we can keep both names in the article for Starkov(s) and when the list will get too large, we can move it to a separate Famous Baltic Russians article, and relieve the main article from this dispute. <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 05:01, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re localizing names abroad, certainly many Russians do that and many don't. People change Mikhail to Michael, Yelena to Helen and so on without being coerced. Same story for last names. I don't know whether the soccer players were forced to change the names. And even if they were, we don't have to find the <i>general</i> solution for this issue here for now. The last edit which gives both names next to each other should solve this particular issue and lets not argue which name of the two to put first&#160;:). We have much more contentious material in the article to work at. <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 23:54, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This issue is harder than it seems though; even if, for example, e.g. everybody when gets Latvian citizenship would automatically get Latvianised names in passport, it would be very hard to say who of them wants this and who of them wouldn't. E.g. in Lithuania there is free choice, and quite many has Lituanized names or even Lithuanian given name and Lituanised Russian surname (those are usually from mixed families, or from families where e.g. just one grandfather was Russian). This is case with Maris Verpakovskis too; and if we would apply Russianising of names everywhere where the info is related to Russians, it would be wrong for these people who are from mixed families or who decided to localize their names. Also, similar situation exists for example in Central Asia and Caucassus where people's names were ussianised by adding "ov" or "ev" to endings of surnames once; some also might say that it is involuntary, etc. and promote usage of for example Islam Karim instead of Islam Karimov, Nursultan Nazarbay instead of Nursultan Nazarbayev, Aslan Maskhad instead of Aslan Maskhadov, etc. but the nagain, many people feels ok with these surnames actually and maybe wouldn't like themselves to see them changed. So it is quite a hard issue, therefore I think oddicial name should be used. As for localization like Yelena - Helen and localisation in Baltic States, there is difference: in Baltics usually just ending is added "as"/"is" in Lithuanian, "s" in Latvian, while name is left unchanged (e.g. Ivan (John) is Jonas in Lithuanian, but Ivans with localized names are known as "Ivanas"). <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 09:33, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Explaining my reverts here: this is article about Baltic Russians, not Russians in general; in Baltic States way less Russians were killed than Jews; also many Baltic Russians ran away to Russia before German invasion. Also, there were not many Russians (I mean, not as mucha s there are now of course) in Baltic States in general at that time, except for some eastern regions of Latvia and Estonia; cities were predominantly local and Jewish - there were way less Russians than Jews in general too. And nazis killed and forced to concentration camps many locals and people of other nationalities too. I guess it should be noted in article about Russians during WW2, but in a more neutral way <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 09:59, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There were way less Russians than Jews in general too.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>There was almost as many ethnic Russians living in Estonia and Latvia prior to 1939/41 as Jews, only in Lithuania Jews were clearly more numerous. Slavs in general were treated much more brutally than Balts (esp. Latvians and Estonians classified by Nazis as more "Aryan" than Lithuanians) during the occupation. Nazis closed down and robbed a number of Russian Orthodox churches and monasteries in the Baltic not only "treated harshly" Communist activists... <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 18:48, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><strike>I just deleted some stuff from this talk page along the lines:</strike>. "Many Russians are bad" and "Many Balts are bad". These discussions won't help us improve the article. The point about the <i>disrespect to local culture during colonization</i> is made at this page and the only question is how to better express it in the article.</p>
<p>On another point. Stalinist policies of post-war mass repressions on balts were in line with similar policies of Stalin to other nations accused in collaboration with Nazis. Of course almost all of the millions of people who suffered had nothing to do with any crimes of Nazis against Slavs or Jews. However, it is true that many people in the territories recently occupied by SU understandably viewed the Nazi Germany as a liberator (not for long though). It was also true that crimes against civilians (not just Jews but especially Jews) were conducted with eager assistance of local collaborators, not only in Baltic territories but also in Ukraine (see, for instance, the highly POV article "the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_6742.html" title="Massacres of Poles in Volhynia">Massacres of Poles in Volhynia</a> which still has some truth in it). The collaboration in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> was finally acknowledged publicly even by the today's Latvian leadership. The point I am trying to make is that the article should go into some detail on these issues, not just say that Balts were collectively punished by Stalinism for nothing. The truth was that millions where collectively punished for the crimes of the hundreds. The reader would know what <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_punishment.html" title="Collective punishment">Collective punishment</a> is and will be able to judge that what was done to Balts was inhuman and unjust. This article subject is of course the Baltic Russians not the crimes of Nazi collaborators, but if the article called <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Russians_3940.html" title="Baltic Russians">Baltic Russians</a> needs to mention the Soviet repressions of Balts at all, it should give a complete picture. <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:39, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not only collective punishment, but politics too, many if not most of exiled people were either well educated or rich, or both. The later were seen as opressors (and teated that way elsewhere in USSR too) while the educated were seen as a potential threat to regime (because they werent educated under Soviet standarts). And there were collaborators in every country and it wasn't mass collaboration in Baltics, e.g. Lithuanians successfully resisted formation of local SS unit. Many people in Baltic states also helped Jews to hide and such. There were bad and good people, same as everywhere. Same for Russians probably, and therefore article never states nor should state that all Russians are bad, it speaks just about actions of government. And I think it is relevant because what happened during Soviet occupation influences relations between local Baltic nation's population and Baltic Russians even today I think. And I agree with you Irpen that probably we should keep this discution more about article, will try to do so now. <b>Also I suggest that we wouldn't make changes to article before talking about them here, because this only leads to reverts and disagreements, and in the end these changes are talked about here anyways.

I have also returned Pyotr Wrangel to the list of Baltic Russians, even though he was of Baltic German origin he identified himself primarily as a Russian.

<dd>Medieval history is fine and dandy, the problem is that in the medieval period there was no such coherent region called "medieval Baltics", nor were there any "medieval Baltic Russians". The usage of such terms makes as little sense as someone writing an article about "Benelux Spaniards", and beginning it with a long and detailed section about the medieval history of Spaniards in the Benelux region. Of course, there were Russians and early East Slavs living in what is now Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, but the history and circumstances were rather different in the three countries and, in any case, they had little to do with most of today's "Baltic Russians". Therefore I set up three different articles under the titles "History of Russians in Estonia /Latvia/ Lithuania" and moved parts of the text from the previous version of this article there, where it is far more relevant.

<dd>While different articles are OK, the title of the current article is "Baltic Russians", period. There is no such nationality, and this article is simply about Russians living at baltic shores regardless time and state. Of course, you have all rights to write your three articles, but this one still rests here, with summaries an references to new, a more detailed ones, which, as you say correctly will cover rather different histories of Russians. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 16:47, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regardless of your good intentions removal of entire sections of the article without previous detailed explanations and consensus is a serious violation of Wikipedia rules. Also some of your statments in newly created articles is highly questionable. For example: "any Early East Slavic settlements at the time in Estonia intermittent only and not continuous" , while many historians would argue what Slavs had a history of continuous settlements on the western shore of Lake Peipus for example. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 16:33, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seriously, where on the western shore of Lake Peipus were there continuous Slavic settlements before, say, the 16th century? Can you perhaps provide any references to the exact locations of these continuous settlements? If not, and regardless of your obviously somewhat wishful thinking, removal of entire sections of the article altogether without previous detailed explanations is a serious violation of Wikipedia rules on your part. Please note that I did not remove any sections, but moved them into more relevant articles. Krivichs are part of the "history of Latvia"; the raids of Yaroslav and other Kievan rulers into SE Estonia are part of the "history of Estonia". One could also make a long shot argument that these events are part of the "history of Russians in Latvia" and "history of Russians in Estonia" (albeit they did not result in any permanent Slavic/Russian settlement lasting to this day) -- which is why, as a courtesy, I also created separate Wiki-articles with these titles. However, any discussion about Krivichs, Yaroslav, etc. in the article about "Baltic Russians" is, at best, irrelevant and missing the point...

<dd>Your sources provide no reference to Slavic settlement in those places before the 16th century. In fact, they indicate that at the time some of these places were still inhabited by Votians, a Finnic (not Slavic) speaking tribe. Secondly, the way you horribly misspell names of places (jxggi, Rotzi, etc.) indicates that you have so limited understanding of Estonian geography and history as to make any further discussion pointless, before you have not done your homework properly. Whether or not the Slavic settlements in Latgalia were continuous or not, please verify that with someone more knowledgeable in Latvian history.

<p>Please don't try to insult my intelligence Mr. 3 Löwi, this is no place for personal attacks. The issue here is Wikipedia rules, not knowledge of 3Löwi vs Fesenko. The article about Votian tribes mentions what "It was in the middle of the 2nd millenium BC when Slavonic tribes started to settle in these regions." and "The people who had settled during the 12-13th centuries on the western shore of Lake Peipus were predominantly Slavs." , and this was just one example of numerous other references pointing to Slavic settlements on the western shore of Lake Peipus you can find online. Second article is more specific and is entitled "Russians of Peipus Lake region." I might mispell one or two names but it does not change the fact what numerous Estonian toponyms have Slavic origin. Many old Estonian words have also Slavic/Russian origin such as "turg" (torg), "rist" (krest), "raamat" (gramota) etc. once again pointing to Slavic presence and influence. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 18:44, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I must agree that <a href="../../../3/_/l/User%7E3_L%C3%B6wi_049a.html" title="User:3 Löwi">3 Löwi</a> main idea that the expression "Baltic Russians" as a term has short history, and his splitting the article into four are reasonable. Some of his statements are dubious (e.g., "Vestern <s>democracies</s> countries did not reocgnize..."), but this not warrant the revert war. I would suggest <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> to pursue his position within the new general article framework of the topic. In particular, a summary about the "second influx" is reasonable in this article, since it was rather significant. At the same time Peipus issue (with all your disagreements) sits well in the corresponding "Russians in Estonia" article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:50, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The statements are dubious in the sense that it is unclear how individual <b>governments</b> "did not recognize" this. E.g. AFAIK Finland and Estonian SSR had no troubles in communicating. The only solution would be to have articles</p>

<li>Estonian government in exile</li>
<li>Latvian government in exile</li>
<li>Lithuanian government in exile</li>

<p>(<small>do such articles exist? under other names? if yes, please redirect</small> ) to say that they had official ambassadors, statements of recognition, whatever, with this and that state.

<dd>In case of the majority of Baltic Germans the history of their ancestors' continuous settlement in the area began in medieval Livonia, and the same applies to their distinct Baltic (Livonian) German identity. The majority of the "Baltic Russians" are first or second-generation immigrants, and there was no "Baltic Russian" identity before WW2. The oldest continuous settlement of Russians in the area, i.e., the Old Believers' villages, dates back to the 17th century (i.e., not quite the middle ages) and these Old Belivers too have, for most of their history identified themselves primarily as (Russian) Old Believers, but not "Baltic Russians". I am not sure how much of a "Baltic Russian" identity they have even now...</dd>

<dd>As a courtesy for you, Fisenko: If in the term "Baltic Russians" the word "Baltic" is defined as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as it is ("Baltic" similar to "Benelux" when denoting three modern states) then it also becomes as patently absurd to use the so-defined term "Baltic" in medieval context as it would be to talk about "medieval Benelux". In the medieval period, there was Livonia and there was Lithuania, there was no Baltic entity that would have covered both. Under Imperial Russia, medieval Livonia became the "Baltic provinces", of which Lithuania was not part of. The Germans of Livonia (not Lithuania) became known as the "Baltic Germans", whereas there were no self-identified "Baltic Russians"...

<p>"<b>The oldest continuous settlement of Russians in the area, i.e., the Old Believers' villages, dates back to the 17th century (i.e., not quite the middle ages)</b>" This is a questionable statement. I have already gave academic references (including once written by Estonian historians themselves) what say otherwise. Are you saying there was no Russian settlements in Livonia in lets say 15th or 16th century&#160;? For example there is a Russian Orthodox saint and martyr <i>Isidor of Yur'yev</i> who was a priest in a Russian Orthodox church in <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derpt.html" title="Derpt">Derpt</a> . On <b>January 8, 1472</b> he and 72 Russain Orthodox laymen from Derpt and neighbouring villages were drawn in the river <i>Emajogi</i> by German knights.<a href="http://www.ortho-rus.ru/cgi-bin/ps_file.cgi?1_1262" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ortho-rus.ru/cgi-bin/ps_file.cgi?1_1262" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 05:11, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The oldest <b>continuous settlement</b> of Russians in the area, i.e., the Old Believers' villages, dates back to the 17th century..." -- the emphasis is on the word continuous (unbroken, continued, uninterrupted, unintermitted). Of course, in medieval Livonian towns like Dorpat (Derpt, Tartu) there existed at times small Early East Slavic settlements of merchants, craftsmen, and a few Orthodox priests from Pskov, Novgorod or Muscovy, but none of these settlements were continuous enough to survive for several centuries or until modern day, because these Slavic settlers were later either killed (thanks for your example), left the area, or their descendants were assimilated into the local population. The whole town of Dorpat was near-destroyed and emptied of its population for several occasions in later history, and there are no villages neighboring Dorpat (Tartu) at present where any Slavic peoples would have lived continuously from the 15th-16th century until now.

<p>The citizenship section is incomplete and only usefull to a certain point because it does not say what the situation is <i>right now</i>. It says that the Baltic countries have "passed the test" (which sounds more like essay writing than encyclopedic writing, if you ask me) but does not say what percentage of ethnic Russians in each country still do not have citizenship or how exactly the requirements were changed in order to "pass the test".</p>
<p>The paragraph currently makes the argument that "because those countries joined the EU, it follows that there is no discrimination because if there was they wouldn't have been allowed to join". I don't think I'm alone in thinking that this isn't nearly enough. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 16:20, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
