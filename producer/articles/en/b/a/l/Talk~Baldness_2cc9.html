<p>Like in the above cases, further counterexamples can be found, such as bald men with <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminine.html" title="Feminine">feminine</a> behavior etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>so females are not sexually active? not really a good counterexample. it should mention that the myth stems from the fact that baldness is caused by androgens.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well...the intention wasn't to say that females are not sexually active, but rather that the myth wants bald men to behave in a more "virile" manner than non-bald men, while this is not scientifically proven. The phrase "Sexually active" in this case means almost exclusively "virile" or "active" sexuality (not including passive gay sexuality etc.) <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 09:07, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

In fact balt men display more feminine characteristics. For example bald men develop gynocomastia (an enlargement of the breast and nipples). Also bald men are considered as unnatractive by the oposite sex. In ancient times monks used to shave their heads to appear unnatractive to the oposite sex.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that statement goes to the exactly opposite end, by reversing the myth. In either case, there's little or no evidence for either claim (especially bald men -&gt; gynecomastia&#160;? Any references? ). We cannot back up either of them in the article, just state that such myths exist. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 21:19, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The merge is a good idea because this really is the same topic with the common name and the scientific name.

<p>When I was in high school a friend of mine lost all of his hair--including eyelashes, eyebrows, armpit hair, etc.-- over a very short period of time. It's been ten years and the hair has not regrown. He commonly refers to his condition as "alopecia," and hence, our circle of friends has been saying "(John Doe) has alopecia" for years now. I've also heard sports reporters utter the term "alopecia" when referring to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Villanueva_84c6.html" title="Charlie Villanueva">Charlie Villanueva</a>'s condition (in fact, even Villanueva's wikipedia page refers to his condition as such). I was surprised wikipedia redirected me to generic "baldness" when I tried to research "alopecia." Evidentally, we've all been misinformed about the name of my friend's and Villanueva's condition. Since such misconception seems fairly common, I wonder if it might make sense to offer a link from "alopecia" to this specific condition, in addition to linking it to baldness, so those interested in learning about this rare condition (whatever its actually called) can do so without having to sift through such topics as "Bald is Beautiful," "Embracing Baldness," etc. After all, Villanueva's baldness is quite different from typical <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_pattern_baldness.html" title="Male pattern baldness">male pattern baldness</a> which takes place gradually over a period of years. <a href="../../../m/2E/_/User%7EM._Frederick_4b43.html" title="User:M.

<p>I've just added some text on the mechanisms which underlie baldness. I'm rather new to wikipedia. I think that some of the links that I added as 'news' might be better as references instead. I wanted to demonstrate how baldness was linked to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coronary artery disease and similar health problems. I also wanted to help clarify the strong connection between androgenic alopecia and lifestyle, which is often overlooked. The exact developmental period where MPB can be avoided or delayed if lifestyle is altered is still unclear. The incidence of MPB in Japan since WWII is the perfect example of lifestyle influencing MPB. The genetics of that nation didn't change, but the incidence of MPB increased radically along with their increased consumption of fatty foods and a general increase in the number of calories in their diet. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWiserd911_d9ff.html" title="User:Wiserd911">Wiserd</a> 11:12, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry. My citations were sloppy. I should clean things up. As for women with PCOS often having balding male relatives, that's certainly interesting. I didn't know that. I tend to come at medicine from the chemistry end of things. Is there a chance that women who have PCOS and higher androgen levels are more likely to be diagnosed with PCOS, creating a bias in diagnosed cases? Are you're saying that the stuff I put up regarding androgen levels in women with PCOS is misleading and I should remove it? As I said earlier, I'm a newbie here so just let me know what I need to work for and I'll work towards that. I just want to see this article discuss mechanisms and lifestyle related to MPB more than it did previously. As with many traits, environment plays almost as much of a role as genetics does.</dd>

<p>The note on vultures refers to natural selection as the reason for vulture head baldness, and I can agree in principle. The accompanying rationalization appears not to relate directly to natural selection, or at least not clearly. It says that feathers on the head would contribute to retention of blood and fluids, as well as making the head difficult to keep clean. Let's keep in mind that natural selection has to do with traits that aid in enhanced breeding opportunities for the individual and successive progeny. The statement about fluids and head cleanliness doesn't show a clear connection to reproductive opportunity. I'd like to see a more substantive discussion. -- Richard Gay (willbonds [at] yahoo [dot] com)</p>

<dd>They're probably referring to general survival advantage, not specific reproductive advantage.--<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENectarflowed_3ba7.html" title="User:Nectarflowed">Nectar</a> 00:17, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Whilst I do not know about the co-evolution of the species (a citation would be nice) the reasoning is sound. This isn't a place to discuss what is and isn't natural selection, and with all due respect, I think it is your understanding of evolution that is lacking. The health of a bird is crucial to it's ability to reproduce. A bird rendered ill by rotten meat staining it's feathers will not be less likely to survive long enough to breed as one that is clean. For example the large quantities of blubber surrounding a seal can not be seen to improve it's chances at breading in the sense that the blubber inhibits the physical mechanics of it. However, a fat seal can survive the cold, and periods with out food - and thus is more likely to breed. This is without even considering sexual selection. I recommend one of many books on the subject, like Dawkin's selfish gene. Either way I've gone on to long - and this isn't the place to discuss this. 158.109.58.94</dd>

<p>According to the caption of the gorilla image, evolution proceeded according to a plan. The purpose of developing a protruding, bald forehead was to gain a foreseen advantage. This total forehead development, I assume, occurred in microscopic changes over an extremely long period of time. The intermediate stages of the development were of no benefit. Only the final stages, in which the goal was approached, were helpful. Does evelution, then, occur as a result of some mind's purpose? This mind would be able to look ahead and see the advantage of a protruding, bald forehead in gorillas of the distant future. It would also choose to gradually attain its goal in very small intermediate increments of change.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 15:55, 1 March 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If so why don't women get bald. Also why most scientist and the most intelligent people like Einstein, Avogadro, etc. had a full head of hair. And the average fat and dumb guy (like Homer Simpson) is bald?</p>
<p>Once again this isn't the place to discuss this. But the flaw in your argument is that you state "The intermediate stages of development were of no benefit." and the idea that the evolution had a "plan" and destination. These are common fallacies. This is the "half an eye is as good as no eye at all" argument and has been debunked numerous times. My poorly designed eyes have terrible vision but even in the days before glasses would have been of a huge benifit. Again Dawkin's climbing mount improbable (amongst others) breaks this myth down. In the case of evoled baldness in the case of a vulture - half a bald head is cleaner than a fully feathered head and so on. There is incremental improvement. The Ape is an excellent example of sexual selection. The ape with the most extended forehead is sexually selected by the female - leading to a gradual largening of the populations foreheads. This would not be confined to the final stages. 158.109.58.94</p>

<dl>
<dd>This claim however is inaccurate. In studies, Saw Palmetto was shown not to reduce serum DHT levels to any significant extent. Unlike Propecia (finasteride), which reduces serum DHT levels noticeably, Saw Palmetto is not considered an effective treatment for hair loss.

<p>Early baldness of the ordinary type(alopecia)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Alopecia refers to all types of baldness. The phrase 'the ordinary type' is non-specific.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Androgenic alopecia is not dependant on a single gene. Rather, variabilities in the androgen receptor gene, levels of 5-alpha-reductase in the scalp, stress, pathogenic stressors, levels of testosterone, levels of SHBG, excercise and diet all play a role in the progression of the condition. The gene for the androgen receptor is located on the X chromasome. Not all the genes involved in the balding process are known, however paternal balding is also an indicator that one's children will be bald.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
If this myth were the case, the condition would have to x-linked dominant. Genes that are X-linked, and dominant are the only type of gene in which fathers are guaranteed to pass the gene to daughters. Looking at the condition of a mother's father would only help in determining who will be affected if the gene for alopecia was x-linked and dominant, which it is not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A recessive gene (i.e. a defective gene which is effectivly masked by a functioning gene) could certainly be present on the X chromasome and thus be dominant in males, but recessive in females. If a gene is X linked, a father with that gene WILL inevitably pass it to their daughters regardless of whether the gene is dominant or recessive. The daughters may not inherit the trait however.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, females may get 'androgenic alopecia' but they do not get male pattern baldness. Their hair loss is diffuse, and does not include a receeding hairline.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>We demonstrate that genetic variability in the androgen receptor gene (AR) is the cardinal prerequisite for the development of early-onset AGA...The X-chromosomal location of AR stresses the importance of the maternal line in the inheritance of AGA.</i><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15902657&amp;query_hl=5&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15902657&amp;query_hl=5&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Adjusting for age, men whose fathers had hair loss were 2.5 times as likely to have had some level of hair loss compared to men whose fathers had no hair loss (95% CI: 1.3-4.9). Likewise, men whose fathers had hair loss were twice as likely to have hair loss than men whose fathers had no hair loss even after adjusting for age (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.7 and OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4-4.7 for Norwood/Hamilton and global description of hair loss assessments, respectively). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the probability of male pattern hair loss is dependent on family history and age. Hair loss in a man's father also appears to play an important role in increasing a man's risk of hair loss, either in conjunction with a history of hair loss in the mother or hair loss in the maternal grandfather.

<dd>I find your sarcasm superfluous. Perhaps whoever misappropriated your jargon terms was not aware that one was synonymous with the other. Until about ten minutes ago, I too was under the impression that alopecia referred to a rare medical condition that was different from regular MPB. <a href="../../../m/2E/_/User%7EM._Frederick_4b43.html" title="User:M.

<p>In the brief section about ketoconazole, I recommend mentioning that Nizoral shampoo is the most common ketoconazole-containing-product used by people who have hair loss. As far as I know, Nizoral is the only OTC product containing ketoconazole. It would be beneficial to readers to mention the brand name, simply to make it easier for them to find/research it in the form it is available to them. In baldness_treatments, Nizoral is mentioned by name when ketoconazole is discussed.</p>
<p>I would make the change, but am not positive about the NPOV implications when dealing with name brands. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake222_5050.html" title="User:Drake222">Drake</a> 17:56, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For exactly similar reasons for humans losing their body hair, it is likely that humans developed male pattern baldness. With the advent of clothes and fire, humans were able to shed their fur. Amongst other advantages, this allowed humans to work harder. Obviously it is easier to control ones body temperature in hot weather without a fur coat. Mammals need the fur coat without clothes and fire to keep themselves warm in lower temperatures, but this comes at the cost of not being able to sweat to lower their body temperatures while exerting themselves at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>It is very likely that men developed male pattern baldness for exactly the same reasons humans have lost fur from the rest of their body.</p>

Ideally this content should be integrated into the Wikipedia article, then the link would remain as a reference, but in some cases this is not possible for copyright reasons or because the site has a level of detail which is inappropriate for the Wikipedia article." as well as "Sites with other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article, such as professional athlete statistics, screen credits, interviews, or online textbooks."

<li>As for "perfectly normal healthy" not quite sure that is ablsolutely true. Firstly does the coverage of scalp hair provide some natural sun protect, thus decreasing the risk of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_keratosis.html" title="Solar keratosis">solar keratosis</a> in exposed areas&#160;? Secondly there has been much research into whether baldness may be associated with increased cardiovascular risks - but of course there is nothing one can do to remove ones genetic family inheritance and I certainly do not mean to belittle the condition anymore than one might claim "bad" inherited risk of greying hair, short stature, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia etc. The issues are whether this relates to altered testosterone levels which might influence both, a shared genetic lineage (i.e. those men who happen to come from families with higher genetic risks for heart disease also have greater rates of baldness as an independant and otherwise unrelated genetic inheretence), or some other cofactor.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Linking baldness with some genetic abnormality such as diabetes is pure bunk, because it is male "pattern" baldness. The pattern strongly implies natural selection.01001 03:21, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Framingham study is the most well known study looking at heart disease (eg hypertension, cholesterol) and reported in 1995 that whilst <i>"Extent of baldness was not associated with any of the outcomes. However, the amount of progression of baldness was associated with coronary heart disease occurrence (relative risk (RR) = 2.4), coronary heart disease mortality (RR = 3.8), and all-cause mortality (RR = 2.4). Rapid hair loss may be a marker for coronary heart disease."</i><br />

<dd>First of all, I am practically certain that the standard established reason stated in basic anthropology text books is that humans lost their fur because clothes is a superior way to keep warm rather than a permanent fur coat. I am pretty certain that I read this in my college anthropology textbook. I do not have the time at the moment to research this at the library, but if noone else bothers to in the next several months I shall do it. The logic of this explanation is very compelling.</dd>

<dd>Once the reason for humans losing fur on their body is established properly, the logic follows very easily that the reason that men go bald is very likely because of hats. If not for hats, baldness would be serious problem as the head is perhaps the most important part of the body to keep warm and protected. But with the technology of hats, hair loss on top of the head would serve the same air conditioning purposes as hair loss throughout the rest of the human body. I am not sure if this second paragraph is established scientific theory but it should be.01001 19:51, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not aware of any of this being clearly 'established' particularly since most children are born with hair on their heads, even though they lack it on the rest of their body. Biology doesn't have to be single cause --&gt; single effect. There are numerous reasons to be taller or shorter. But there's a difference between saying that a trait was 'selected for' and saying that it wasn't selected strongly against. At a cellular level, folicles in a balding scalp are shown to be similar to older cells. DHT is a hair growth promoter. More DHT is linked to earlier MPB. Thus, if you grow hair faster when you're young (and have more androgens when you're young) you have less hair when you're older. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWiserd911_d9ff.html" title="User:Wiserd911">Ryan Wise</a> 03:01, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Weightlifting causing baldness? I've never seen any evidence for this, and it sounds especially fishy since men with male pattern tend to have lower levels of overall testosterone (and merely raised unbound testosterone). It's definitely relevant if true, but does someone have anything to back it up?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>If your body converts your testosterone into DHT (due to low levels of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) you're more likely to lose your hair. Men with lower SHBG (one factor influencing baldness) convert their testosterone into DHT. So they have lower T and higher unbound free androgens. Weightlifting increases testosterone which is either bound or converted into DHT depending on the person. Most anabolic steroids have the same effect. However daily aerobic exercise has been shown to raise SHBG, thus making hair retention more likely. So if weight lifting was mixed with aerobic exercise and steroids were not used, the outcome re: hair is less certain. You asked for support. Which part of this sequence do you want supported?</dd>

<dd>Apparently, men with baldness have lower total levels of testosterone, but higher levels of unbound testosterone. The only part of the equation that is not clearly substantiated is whether or not weightlifting increases the levels of unbound testosterone. It certainly seems intuitive, but I'd still like some sort of source on it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can anyone find any source, for whether or not weightlifting increases the levels of unbound testosterone? If not, it doesn't seem like the mention of weightlifting being a potential cause should be in the article.</p>
<p>To add something else, isn't it possible that muscle hypertrophy "consumes" free testosterone, and could thus be GOOD for hair? It just seems like there's no evidence regarding the effects of weight training on levels of free testosterone, so it shouldn't be in the article.</p>

<p>Subsequent versions of the treatment are expected by some scientists to be able to cause these follicle stem cells to simply signal the surrounding hair follicles to rejuvenate.*</p>
<p>While some scientists claim this, it sounds dangerous. Folicles in a bald scalp are senescent. That means they are "old" at the cellular level. While senescent cells can be made to grow again (there are cases of immune suppresant drugs leading to hair growth in senescent cells) this would pose a severe cancer risk. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWiserd911_d9ff.html" title="User:Wiserd911">Ryan Wise</a> 03:40, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Male pattern baldness is characterized by hair receding from the <i>lateral</i> sides of the forehead, known as "receding hairline" or "receding brow." An additional bald patch may develop on top (<i>vertex</i>). The trigger for this type of baldness (called <i>androgenic alopecia</i> because it is caused by male Gay-hormones or <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgens.html" title="Androgens">androgens</a>) is <a href="../../../d/i/h/Dihydrotestosterone.html" title="Dihydrotestosterone">DHT</a>, a powerful sex hormone.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>No other picture in this article illustrates the area of effect of male pattern baldness as effectively as this one. All the picture of Patrick Stewart documents is that he has a hair cut. Yes, he is known as being bald, but the picture does not illustrate the extent baldness and thinning of his hair. The picture of the 40 year old shows that a subject at 40 years old has both areas of thinning and areas of complete baldness. Until a better free picture of that is added, it should remain on the article.<a href="../../../l/k/i/User%7ELkinkade_e028.html" title="User:Lkinkade">Lkinkade</a> 18:08, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
