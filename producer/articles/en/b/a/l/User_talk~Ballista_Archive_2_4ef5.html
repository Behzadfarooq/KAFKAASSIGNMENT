I saw your impressive list of interests and contributions; I share many of them, but I'm so busied about horses that my time is almost gone... my work into wikipedia (en.wiki and mainly it.wiki) is only a part of my web work about (I've a couple of websites and a forum too). Some remarks: 1. horsemanship in a aphazard mixture of ancient, unbeliavable exact intuitions (Xenophons; Kikkuli), of recent intuitions supported by some very good scientific evidence (dr. Strasser; J. Jackson; so-called "natural horsemanship" and "natural communication") and lots of personal undocumented opinions and retained ideas. Firing about is just at its beginning. 2. I presume, many of your interests (just like mine) have a common ground: the new science of complex systems. I think, you'll add it at your list as soon as you'll take a look at. 3. Did you ever read "The art of controversy" by Schopenhauer?

<p>Hello - I've fallen prey to pedantry/obsession, here, with the fact that most Greek derivations of dinos are linked to 'Greek language' instead of 'Ancient Greek'. I started sorting them but it would be a life's work, to check them all manually. I haven't done enough with AWB to be able to enlist its help. Can you help me to do so (assuming you agree with my proposition in the first place!)? By the way, just peeped at your SuggestBot list (I had one today as well) and wondered how you managed not to receive any dino suggestions&#160;:-)&#160;??? - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 05:29, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Ballista!</dd>
<dd>An excellent question. In this situation, here is what I would do: Try to think backwards. "How am I going to fix all instances of this phrase?" The solution: Use the "what links here" page (works great for ALL disambiguation) for <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a>. Show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Ancient_Greek&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Ancient_Greek&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">the first 500 results</a>. Then use your browser (edit&gt;find on Internet Explorer) to find any instance of the partial word "saur". Right-click any "saur" you find and open in a new window/tab. Edit the article.</dd>
<dd>You <i>could</i> use AWB, too. AWB can do a google/wiki search and pull up all instances of of the word "Greek". You can refine the search by... I don't have AWB on this computer, and I forget the name, but on the second tab in the middle, there's something like "include if contains:", and then add the word "dinosaur", or "ignore if article does not contain the word:", and add "dinosaur". The third tab had a "find" field. After starting the process, add the word "Greek" to the "find" field, and then hit search each time you pull up a page. I've been able to use AWB to google/wiki search terms like "to+it's", pull up a list, ignore all "to+it's" on User pages, and then use the 'find' field to find all instances of "it's", so they could be corrected if wrong. In theory, your example should be the same, but I don't have AWB in front of me. I only use it at work, because my home PC doesn't meet the minimum requirements.</dd>
<dd>Hope this helps!&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Forgot to add: I was surprised, too, when SuggestBot didn't pull up any suggestions for dinosaurs for me. Then I kinda realized SuggestBot only suggests articles the user <i>hasn't already worked on</i>. For dinosaurs, that would be a very short list, if there are any at all.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#999FFF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 06:20, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, thinking it over, it might be best to google wiki the search terms Greek and dinosaur ("Greek"+"dinosaur"), skip the 'ignore' field, and seach the term Greek. Hard to say, since I don't have AWB in front of me, but some combination like this should work extremely well. At any rate, good luck, and good night! Or, rather, good morning in your corner of the world.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#999FFF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 08:11, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Alright, well, I tested the settings on AWB today, just to see, and if you set Google Wikipedia to "dinosaur"+"Greek", set the Set Options tab to ignore if contains Ancient Greek, and find Greek on the third tab, it works perfectly, filtering out all bad results. I was able to do five articles with no problem, in about 1 minute. I guess I'll leave the rest to you! (There were 300+ results).&#160;:) --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#999FFF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 17:57, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are a lot of tutorials on-line; you'll be able to find plenty on Google, Ballista. Photoshop isn't something you can learn in a few hours, though. I've taken many digital imaging classes as part of my computer science degree, so if you feel you can't get a nice, clean look, let me know and I can have a go. But good luck, and I hope you'll be able to get some nice results.&#160;:)</dd>

<p>Hey Ballista, I won't need you to post these anywhere else to photoshop them. I plan to work with them tomorrow, if that's alright. I have Photoshop CS2 at work, although it's not much different from Photoshop 7. I plan to only edit maybe 5 or 6 of them. The rest are quite nice as it is. The advantage of having these on the MediaWiki Commons is so that people on the Wikipedias in other languages can also use them for <i>their</i> dinosaur articles. When they're on the Commons, any Wikipedia language edition can use them: the software is amazing, and doesn't require any change in the <i>link</i> (in other words, there's no difference in how you write the link when you're editing the page; you don't need to add any fancy code, just the same as you would for a picture on our English Wikipedia). The additional photographs of <i>Cetiosaurus</i> bones are a big plus. <i><a href="../../../c/e/t/Cetiosaurus.html" title="Cetiosaurus">Cetiosaurus</a></i> has one of the shortest articles on WP, and clearly needs some filling out. I'm so glad you took these photos!!! Are you hiding any others?&#160;;) I'm not sure what the copyright status is of the three prints. I'll try to check into that today.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#999FFF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 20:19, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mentioned on the image page other images of <i>Pachycephalosaurus</i> and <i>Edmontosaurus</i>, and manus images of <i>T-rex</i>. Any chance you might add these to your image page? I think the full-length Ed, the Ed head, and the skull of Pachy are quite useable, but wonder if perhaps there aren't other pictures, particularly in the case of Pachy, with which we might supplement the articles. In other words, "more, please!"&#160;:) --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#999FFF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 19:28, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Ballista---You mentioned going back to the museum for more photos. Really, there's no need. We have tons of great ones right here. We've got a really great side-shot of <i>Pachy</i>, I only asked if you had more because you said you had others. There's no need for another trip! Same goes for <i>Edmonto</i> and <i>T-Rex</i>. And, no matter how many photos of <i>Utah</i> you take, it won't grow feathers. So there's no need for another trip. I was just asking because you said you had more.

About being soo positive: it's easy, when you like your fellow contributors. It's also easy, when you realize these new photos are so much better than outdated pictures from 1923 we've been forced to use in many cases. Sure, the old prints are neat from a historic perspective, but we're not building an encyclopedia from 1923. This project has been hamstrung from the beginning by outdated photos, which do not affect other WikiProjects that can claim Fair Use.

<p>Hey B! So, I've added a few photoshopped images to your two pages. Your new photos look good, and the only one I adjusted was the dark <i>Scelidosaurus</i>. I brightened it a bit, removed distractions, and also created a close-up of the arm. <i>Scelido</i> is one of my favorite dinosaurs. I'm not sure what you'll think of the adjustment. Yes, the ichthiosaur should go somewhere; it's great! I fixed the glare on the <i>Cetiosaurus</i> humerus, and on the <i>Eustrepto</i> head. What do you think? I cut off the head of <i>Veloci</i> and stuck it on a separate image. If it's dangerous to cut of <i>Utahraptor'</i>s tail, I guess it's also dangerous to try and behead <i>Velociraptor</i>!&#160;;) I still plan to finish the original <i>Veloci</i> image, but I ran out of time, today. Similar to the skull of <i>Velociraptor</i>, I also did a cut-out of the Mosasaur, but didn't have a chance to upload it tonight. I figure if the <i>Velo</i> skull is found suitable, I could do a few others. I tried to place the "improved" photos side by side with the originals, so we could easily compare them. They looks side by side in my browser, but I'm not sure what browser you're using, so if I messed up the alignment, I apologise in advance. I guess I'll have to work on the rest tomorrow, 'cause I'm just about ready to head home tonight. Thanks again for: 1. The awesome pictures 2. The opportunity to fiddle with them. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#999FFF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 04:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Now studied all the mods - looking great - really cool that extraction of Velo's head - actually, on mature reflection, probably less dodgy amputating the head, as that would tend to pre-empt retaliation! I NOW really regret not getting a close-up of Sceli's horn stump, at the Charmouth Centre - it looked great on the mounted specimen - any chance of a worthwhile edit to show that? Anyway, I feel a bit handicapped, as my 'zoom' button has disappeared from my camera, necessitating prodding deeply with a wooden toothpick to change the zoom setting - that's a little coarse, to say the least &amp; it's not possible to monitor the adjustment as you do it.

<p>Hey Ballista! I'm taking a bit of a break from my college algebra homework, and figured I'd see what was up on the Wiki. As usual, you're already on top of things. I'll try to address everything you've mentioned above, but if I miss something, feel free to kick me. 1. Did you let the group know about the Heritage Coast pictures? I don't think they know about them. I'm sure they will want to see them, although I don't see a problem with any of them. I'm <i>really</i> thrilled we've got <i>Scelido</i> now. 2. I'm glad you're happy with some of the current photoshops. I'll continue to make modifications, but I'm definitely done for tonight!&#160;:) 3. I haven't heard from Sheep. Did try to e-mail him, but he hasn't activated his e-mail on Wiki. 4. I guess we can start uploading any time you're ready. Dinoguy, you, and I are the only ones who left comments. As long as the photos meet what the three of us have decided, there's no reason to delay, I suppose. Any that still need work can be left on your two pages. Are you uploading them to Commons, or did you decide against it? If you did decide against it, then there's no more uploading needed. 5. Yes, I can easily do a close-up of the horn-stump, but what do you mean by "horn-stump"? Yes, I'm dense. 6. Sorry about the toothpick. You take some nice photos anyway. 7. Yes, I can add my name to the credits. I just thought it seemed "cheeky" (there's no good American equivalent for that word) of me, for you to go out, spend money in museums, and spend lots of time taking the photos and doing all sorts of field research, while I sit in my office and get co-credit. It didn't seem right, so I left my name off. But now that you've added my name to each picture anyway, it just seems like <i>that's</i> causing you extra work... I can definitely add my name, so you won't have to. 8. I guess that's it!

<dd>Thanks for the lastest batch, Baliista. They still weren't all up last night, so this is the first chance I've had to see all of them. I'm assuming that really <i>is</i> all of them...? There are so many great new ones! The pterosaurs, and the new Ichthiosaur paddle, and.. so many others.</dd>

<p>Many times, your new pictures have eliminated any need for me to rework the images. For example, the new Megalosaurus display image means I won't need to lighten the old image. Your new Velociraptor image #4 is probably suitable as is. I've left comments on the relevant pages. Aside from still wanting to do some skull cut-outs for Ornithomimus and (fixing the dark) T-rex, and maybe a cut-out for Iguanodon's hand, I guess I'm close to complete, except for one glare removal and one text-on-glass removal.

<p>I know you really enjoy editing &amp; uploading photos onto dinosaur articles, but some care must be taken! Some of your photos are out of focus/in bad light/irrelevant (choose 1 or more). Other times, you just place them in the most akward locations, such as all in one section. Take some care to carefully plan out where they will go or where they will fit. Don't just plonk them anyhere k? The ones which aren't that good, don't put them in. Think of it like a piece of cake. You've just eaten a buffet meal &amp; you're sooo full. But everyone else is eating cake, so you want some. You don't need it, but just cause it's there you eat it. Or think of a bad picture as a toy you never use. You never use the toy, so your mum wants you to throw it out. You plead that you do play with it, but you never do. If a picture is bad or is overcrowding the text, throw it away or don't use it. It will save everyone time &amp; overall, make the article ten times better. This was a friendly reminder from your friendly neighbourhood Spawn Man! Thanks, <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 00:01, 22 June 2006 (UTC). P.S. Kids, eat your veges!</p>

<dt>Just so you know, Ballista, the images Spawn Man is talking about are, for the most part, not even yours. I guess he didn't look beyond the current edit history, and ended up leaving a note on your page about photos from previous edits. Two of the four "bad" pictures are old photos that have been on the page for months. Another is the side photo of the pes (foot) of <i>T-rex</i>, which Spawn Man is somehow counting as a "double", even though it's clearly not the same picture, and shows the foot from a different angle. The other images were apparently too close together for his taste, which was easy enough to fix, and didn't warrant a rude note on your page, IMO. I'm not sure which ones he thought were "irrelevant", as he only provided seven examples, three which were "too close together", two which were not uploaded by you, and one which is a "double". I left a note on his talk page, and I hope he'll do a little more research before leaving notes on people's pages about "bad photos".--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#999FFF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 01</dt>

<dd>I can read. Your two original messages say Ballista's images are "bad", "out of focus", "irrelevant", etc, and say nothing about other editors. You only added that in later. How many angles of a <i>T-rex</i> foot do I need? Two would be good, to illustrate the foot from more than one angle. I've created no "new rules" about FAC nomination. It's there, right on the page, for anyone to read. Only those who can read, though, will see it.

<p><i>Copied from Spawn's talk page:</i> Good Morning from England. Thanks, Spawn Man for taking an interest in my images. I had hoped to avoid any objection to my uploading a significant number of pictures onto WP almost simultaneously, by consulting the Project as a whole, both on the project page and on the collaboration page, before doing so. I had some responses from Dinoguy, Cas Liber and Firsfron. There were some constructive negative comments made about some of the pictures, which was useful in preventing them going up. Generally, however, the comments were positive. Some of the pictures were posted for comment for almost a week. Another time, please try to avoid this sort of retrospective action, by contributing to discussions at the time, prior to any alterations being made to articles. As it is, I had fun taking the pictures. They are posted on WP for everyone's benefit. They are then commended to the Project editors and to the other members of the editing WP community, to do with as they see fit. No sweat if your opinions are not the same as others. That's Wikipedia. I would have waded in on this discussion earlier, had I not been asleep (UK time). I shall continue to work, as before, by consultation with the Project. Good idea if we all do, to avoid adversarial encounters.

<dd>Thanks for the note, B. I was actually checking out the images as you uploaded them. Thanks again for some wonderful images. There are some that are really dark, but others, like <i>Troodon</i>, are perfect the way they are. That <i>Troodon</i> shot looks amazing. Although there are many dark shots, you're right: many/most can be easily salvaged. A few just need some cropping, which I know you can do yourself. You took a ton of pictures, and it's... a bit overwhelming. But overwhelming in a good way!&#160;:) I don't think there's such a thing as <i>too many</i>.

<dd>Thanks for taking so much trouble, trawling thru' all that stuff and making such thoughtful and worthwhile comment. I've fed back to you, for information etc. I'm sorry that there were so many technical faults but I don't think my level of photographic skill, with a basic camera, is sufficient to overcome some of the obstacles as set. If you have any tips in that direction, I'd go back again before the end of the year, and have another go. I might have been able to do something a bit better with my old Praktika TTL camera, with 100% manual control but it broke long ago - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 05:01, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There were four or five edits to dinosaur pages from an anon user. Turned out it was you, just not logged in. You can see one such edit on my talk page, under the Mary Anning heading.

<dd>Thanks for picking that up. I visited my 'shadow' user page (stupidly not realising before that such a thing existed) and, as you can see, it's not the first time I 've done such a thing but I've usually noticed, on previous occasions! It only has the one entry on 20th July, however - is that the only one? I can see why you might have been surprised, as it involved playing about on a page that is not easily found by 'just anybody'.

<dd>Well, it's not "stupid", clearly. Do you have your sign-in page set to "remember me" or just log in? If it's not set to "remember me", I guess it <i>might</i> log you out automatically after a while. RfAs take 7 days so they can fully investigate and sift thru all of my contributions, and bring it up on the RfA page if there's anything troubling. So we'll find out in roughly six more days. Meanwhile, I've been absolutely worthless at working on articles.

<dd>Well, I suppose the best thing would be to have one picture of a disc brake, since that's one of the most common types these days, but then have a second picture of some other completely different brake (from a horse carriage, or a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cart.html" title="Cart">cart</a> or something) to keep the article generic. I'm not familiar with such things. I suppose the handle on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Image%7EAustralian_cart.jpg_d7ae.html" title="Image:Australian cart.jpg">this</a> must be a brake, I suppose one might be able to rotate that and crop it, unless there's a better close-up of a completely different brake mechanism. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 11:41, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Air conditioning, pics and stuff&#160;:D</span></h2>
<p>Hello and thanks for your message! Let me address individual points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Airco - well, I don't really know why did you come to me with that. I am not particularly interested in this topic, but I guess if you can't find anything, there isn't anything the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_conditioning.html" title="Air conditioning">air conditioning</a> article mentions a few things about applications in automobiles. From my experience, such discovery is usually a good reason to start a research and write an article. I would ask people involved in creating articles on airco and HVAC as such, as well as involved in articles on automobile engineering for support.</li>
<li>Nice images there. Again, don't know why you approached me about them, all I can do for you is congratulate you on your efforts and results! The pics have already been put in respective articles, so....? Or perhaps there's more that I don't know about?<br />
As concerns uploading to Commons, it is in general seen as courteous of the user to upload their own-made and copyright-free pics to the Commons so that they can be used by all WikiProjects. I have perhaps served as an uploader for a few people who didn't want to set up a Wiki account, but I don't feel like doing this full-time&#160;:D I also have no authority or intention to remove any pics from English WP - do also note that a picture in the Commons can be linked to from the English (or any other WP) by simply placing its name in the [[Image:sumfink.jpg]] tag, provided there is no picture with the same name within the "upload" area of a given Wiki. So, uploading those pics to the Commons would make the copies in the English Wiki simply redundant.</li>
<li>Thanks a lot&#160;:D Greeting from myself to you then, I can't provide you with greetings from entire Poland, but in general Polish people like UK people so I guess the sympathy is two-way&#160;:D</li>
</ol>
<p>Excuse me for being sarcastic and unhelpful, I have just been extremely upset by somebody, I hope it doesn't show that much in this post/edit. Regards, Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 13:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC) PS. Please let me know what exactly I could do for you (except for the uploading thing, please spare me that) and I will gladly help you - I am just too dim-witted to infer from your message.</p>
<p><a name="Two_questions_.26_greetings" id="Two_questions_.26_greetings"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Two questions &amp; greetings</span></h2>
<p>Hello again - I have two questions for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>You kindly uploaded some of my images to Commons. That was fine but I only recently found that they also 'disappeared' off the English Wikipedia. I wonder if you could let me know what process you used, for my 'learning curve'. I want to put other images up on Commons but don't want to lose them from the English WP. How do I do it, without going through the laborious process of uploading them again, <i>de novo</i>, onto Commons?</li>
<li>I can't find anything on air-conditioning or climate control, on English WP. Am I missing something?</li>
<li>Not a question: I've uploaded some more images (mostly Saab!) onto a sub-page: <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_Images_Vehicle_components_60bd.html" title="User:Ballista/Images/Vehicle components">User:Ballista/Images/Vehicle components</a>, in case you're interested. Please feel free to upload to Commons, if you wish but please don't remove them from English WP!</li>
<li>Greetings and best wishes from the UK and from me - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 09:19, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
