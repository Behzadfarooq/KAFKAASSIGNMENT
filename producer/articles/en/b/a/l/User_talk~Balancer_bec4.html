<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/User_talk%7EBalancer_bec4.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Many in the pro-Wars camp were critical of his article, arguing that Brin had no idea what he was talking about.&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Many in the pro-Wars camp were critical of his article, arguing that Brin had no idea what he was talking about."</span></h2>
<p>I've edited this back to "Many in the pro-Wars camp were critical of his article, in particular, it was pointed out several of his arguments were founded on misconceptions or addressed within the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a>."</p>
<p>The main reason for this is the other wording implies that all criticism of Brin was founded on nothing more than personal attacks, and because three major errors in Brin's reasoning can be demonstrated in an entirely NPOV fashion: namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the EU novels establish that a democratic society follows the downfall of the Empire, the New Republic [something Brin is either unaware of or is ignoring for some reason], whereas Brin seems to believe that Leia or Luke will establish some kind of monarchy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That Brin misquotes Yoda's line in Episode 1: he quotes it as "<i>Fear makes you angry and anger makes you evil</i>" when the actual line is "<i>Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</i>" <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0120915/quotes" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0120915/quotes" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This seriously affects his later points that getting angry can be justified and that SW says anger makes you instantly become evil.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>He misses exchanges like the one in TESB between Yoda and Obi-Wan: "<i>Much anger in him... like his father</i>" "<i>Was I any different when you taught me?</i>" <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0080684/quotes" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0080684/quotes" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and the later one in RotJ in which the Emperor says "<i>Good, I can feel your anger. I am unarmed. Take your weapon. Strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete</i>" <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0086190/quotes" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0086190/quotes" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which is even clearer on the matter; anger is not enough, because Jedi can be angry and remain good; the Emperor knows he must get Luke to use the Force out of hatred to bring him to the Dark Side. This means Brin is absolutely wrong: SW says clearly and repeatedly that anger alone does <i>not</i> make you evil. That alone means the inclusion of the 'based on misconceptions' comment is justified.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Brin apparently doesn't remember <i>Return of the Jedi</i> very well, since he claims Vader's sins were 'forgiven' at the end, when in fact Vader's funeral with Luke standing alone in front of the pyre is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie, and indeed the whole series. His allegations against Vader are almost all based on misconceptions about <i>A New Hope</i>; Vader had nothing to do with the operation of the first Death Star, and yet Brin constantly accuses him of "<i>murder[ing] the population of Earth many times over;</i>" apparently confusing Vader's role with that of Grand Moff Tarkin in the first film.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are others, but those are the clearest. It's correct that we don't need a link to Mike Wong's diatribe as a 'counterpoint,' but there were some very valid points raised about Brin's essay and it should at least be implied what the content of the major points was. Hrimfaxi 03:39, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No more than the content of the major points regarding the ICS etc. Those <i>aren't</i> NPOV points. Number one is a question of interpretation - not just of the EU, which (as the section makes clear) he wasn't reviewing, but of interpreting the EU itself. <i>Within the EU</i> Leia is sometimes criticized - by other characters - as a monarch-like figure. Luke and Leia remain, through much of the EU, towering Campbellian figures intimately involved in the running of society, even during periods when they don't hold office. The "misquote" is something known as a "paraphrase." Brin interprets the quote as fear being the beginning of the path to the dark side, the next two stops being anger and hate. His condensation of it (Fear&gt;anger&gt;hate&gt;dark side to anger&gt;dark side, snipping out a couple steps on the way) is considered reasonably accurate by many. Your third point doesn't ring universally either. He interprets the funeral as Vader being forgiven; his labelling Vader as responsible for the destruction of Alderaan is also hardly universally ungrounded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While you can make your case for Vader not being responsible, others can make the case that he is responsible. To say that his essay was "based on misconceptions" is to establish a clear POV. It may well be worth noting that most of the criticism of Brin comes out of the clarifications of the EU (the EU being notably absent in his review), but to say that his review was based on "misconceptions" pointed out by pro-Wars debaters is not. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 05:06, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The New Republic is a democracy, and is called such dozens of times in the EU: Brin doesn't even mention this in his allegations, so it is entirely NPOV to state that his essay doesn't address points made in the EU, even <i>without</i> a 'people point this out' qualifier. It doesn't.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>His 'paraphrasing' is dubious given he later paraphrases again as "<i>If you get angry -- even at injustice and murder -- it will <b>automatically and immediately</b> transform you into an unalloyedly evil person!</i>" and again as "<i>In other words, getting angry at Adolf Hitler will cause you to rush right out and join the Nazi Party?</i>" This doesn't fit with the facts [or your assertation of what he means]; Obi-Wan stated he himself was 'full of anger' and the Emperor knowing Luke was angry long before he turned to the Dark Side. As said, the contradictions between what the film says and what Brin says are clear and commonly stated regarding this. People say his points are based on misconceptions, and as long as it's clear in the article that <i>people say it</i> rather than <i>it is true</i> it qualifies as NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>His third point is very problematic: he implies through his comparison to the Allies "<i>throwing a parade for Hitler</i>" that <i>everyone in the entire Rebel Alliance</i> forgives Vader. That simply does not happen. Luke is the only person at Vader's funeral, no other <i>character</i> is seen to forgive him unless you count the ghosts of Yoda and Obi-Wan, and even then that's just three people in the entire galaxy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, we should have a mention of the strong arguments against his point [as per <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view</a>]; we need not say they are <i>true</i>, link to a rebuttal or go into excessive detail, merely what they are; misconceptions and the EU. 'Seemed to be founded on misconceptions' is probably a better wording, however. Hrimfaxi 05:27, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear NetOracle,</p>
<p>I understand that, in the several days since you have registered this account, you have introduced a large number of AFDs, particularly in regards to webcomics and webcomic-related articles. It would appear that you are simply putting up webcomic articles for deletion on the basis that you don't <i>think</i> they are notable when you, in fact, do not <i>know</i> whether or not they are notable. I would like to quote something <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> commented in one such recent AFD:</p>
<p><i>Putting an article up for AfD is no replacement for a source tag, especially with a subject that meets notability standards as easily as this one.</i></p>
<p>In the future, I would appreciate it if you made a reasonable effort to determine notability before putting an AFD up on the basis of notability, or, where appropriate, simply tagged the article to indicate that the article itself does not establish notability where it should. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 21:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not putting up articles for deletion on my personal feelings. Rather, I have taken a close look at articles which are either complete fancruft (as evidenced by the complete lack of notablility), or are the greater portion fancruft (as evidenced by their grossly disproportionate size and detail). I base my determination on existing Wikipedia policies and guidelines, such as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Wikipedia%7EForum_for_Encyclopedic_Standards_ea28.html" title="Wikipedia:Forum for Encyclopedic Standards">encyclopedic standards</a>. This is by no means an attack against webcomics as a form of art and entertainment. My actions are motivated merely out of a desire to keep Wikipedia from becoming a directory of anything liked and recognized by at least a few dozen people. We are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> <a href="../../../d/m/o/DMOZ_e708.html" title="DMOZ">DMOZ</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 21:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of whether your personal feelings are involved, you are putting AFDs up without making any serious attempt to verify notability or possessing the sort of familiarity with the field in which the articles fall that would allow you to make such a judgement independent of the article. Thus, you are inappropriately introducing AFDs when it would be appropriate instead to tag the article for improvement or clarification.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, the fact that you seem to view any webcomic article, no matter how well or poorly written, as "fancruft," indicates you have a bias against webcomics in general. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 01:05, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why do you say with such certainty that I have not seriously tried to verify notability? I have. How do you think I determined that most of these articles are mentioned solely on a small number of blogs, forums, chatrooms, and other user-driven social pages? When an article lacks sources which meet principles including<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliability</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Wikipedia%7EForum_for_Encyclopedic_Standards_ea28.html" title="Wikipedia:Forum for Encyclopedic Standards">encyclopedic standards</a>, <b>AND</b> standard searching fails to uncover any such sources, it can be concluded that the subject is not notable. Any person should have little to no difficulty in finding solid sources on any notable subject.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I have attempted to verify the notability. When I did not uncover sources to establish notability, I was forced to conclude that the article fit a pattern of rampant fancruft which has become a part of most collaborative encyclopediae. No specific subculture can <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> a set of articles, and the establishment of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled gardens</a> on Wikipedia is inappropriate. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that every article should have meaning to those not familiar with its subject. Just because I don't find entertainment in webcomics, and am not familiar with the genre/subculture, does not disqualify me as having the skills and knowledge needed to judge their notability. If a person such as myself, as an outsider, can read literally dozens of articles, and fail to see proper establishment of notability through proper sources in those articles, then the articles need to be deleted. One should not have to be already familiar with the subject in order to put faith in an article's profession of notability; the profession of notability should stand on its own. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 03:12, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have to reject them when they do not conform with policies.", which to me, comes aoff as an eletist statement, and implies that common editors can not speak out against the interpreted application of a policy in a specific case, in effect it is a "it's my way or the highway" cavalier attitude toward the process of concensus.

<p>Thanks for the notification. I have made a statement on the NHN request for arbitration, and I thank you for the thoughtful and well balanced presentation of the facts. Some of this is driving me nuts with frustration, but I hang in there because I believe that there are editors out there deleting notable webcomic articles because simply being a webcomic is "fancruft" by their personal definition. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 17:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I've said in the RfA, I think this particular issue is much larger than webcomics. It does, of course, make it in some ways easier to delete articles. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 23:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unbelievable. The comic that earned a #1 ranking on <a href="http://topwebcomics.com" class="external text" title="http://topwebcomics.com" rel="nofollow">topwebcomics.com</a> (it's currently #4) had it's DRV upheld and is now permanently deleted. And the page is protected, so that it can't ever be re-created. I am shocked, appalled, and I have lost a lot of faith in wikipedia because of this. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 13:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is all quite irregular. Even though most of my contributions as an editor have been to pages not likely to be deleted, I do find it a very discouraging sign that shows something on Wikipedia is broken. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 14:22, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note, by the way, that I don't think this whole flap is hurting webcomics. Sure, it's apparently making a number of "webcomics people" miffed, but The noob - for example - isn't going to start losing ground among its readers simply because it's no longer on Wikipedia. What's being hurt here are Wikipedia's principles; some of the five pillars are being quietly sunk into the mud. Wikipedia's reputation may also be suffering some, but I don't consider Wikipedia's reputation as important as its utility and integrity. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 16:17, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Got to politely disagree with you here. Wikipedia already has an uphill battle for it's reputation<a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9htfMQgKt5Fq00AqQ7QtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMHZkMjZyBHBvcwMxBHNlYwNzcg--/SIG=1422i2ev6/EXP=1172274080/**http%3a//www.vermontcynic.com/home/news/2007/02/20/News/Middlebury.College.Levies.Ban.On.Wikipedia-2730848.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9htfMQgKt5Fq00AqQ7QtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMHZkMjZyBHBvcwMxBHNlYwNzcg--/SIG=1422i2ev6/EXP=1172274080/**http%3a//www.vermontcynic.com/home/news/2007/02/20/News/Middlebury.College.Levies.Ban.On.Wikipedia-2730848.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, because of the open nature of a wiki to vandalism and inacuracy. So any further damage to what reputation Wikipeda has by editors and administrators showing bias makes this problem much worse. Losing that reputation means that people stop coming to Wikipedia to read, which leads to less people interested in editing, and that begins a downhill spiral I don't want to see happen. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 23:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
