<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balaji_giridharan.html" title="Edit section: Brief History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brief History</span></h2>
<p>Raised up in very harsh times in Sudan, Balaji Giridharan, the black horse, remains a symbol of hope. Balaji Giridharan, once just a stray horse in the forest, is now known in some large villages in the nation of Sudan, "reliable black one". He has faced some serious times in his life, going through the harsh reality of being slaughtered by Darfur's horse thugs. The people of Sudan honor him for his courage to fight back. He is their protector and guardian. He always travels through vast lands of Sudan with his owner Giri. In recent times he even won the "National Black Horse Races" in the large city of Omdurman. He gave help and suffered the pain of more than 6 people riding on his black back in order to flee the country in search of better lives. He has helped many, acheived greatness, and remains the true unsung hero. He died on January 23, 2007 after suffering a long period of brain fever.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balaji_giridharan.html" title="Edit section: Identification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Identification</span></h2>
<p>No one of Sudan really could identify what horse he had been, but some say he was a feral horse<a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_horse" class="external autonumber" title="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_horse" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a common previously domesticated creature which was released to roam the lands, however, he was later taught critical saving techniques and positions by his owner, Giri Giridharan, which led to Balaji's domestication and was tamed. Some classified him as transported Namib desert horse. Others, thought he might have been a rare type of donkey-with a broad black back and hair fading from brown to gray to black which extended to the end of his back.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balaji_giridharan.html" title="Edit section: Travels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Travels</span></h2>
<p>Over the last six years, Balaji Giridharan has traveled to many areas of Sudan providing help and support for all with his "black back". His "father", in a sense, Giri, wanted to teach him the values of life and respecting all and not coming down to a "filthy man's level." Giri was known to give speeches about Balaji's travels and the adventures they had been through smuggling people from place to place. His most prominent trips however were made from Al Pashir to Chad. In Some of Giri's speeches, he mentioned that balaji never gave up and always "fought 'till the end" and the harsh reality of Balaji collapsing with all the people's weight in the middle of nowhere did not come to his mind, for Balaji was "the best in his business". Balaji carried people on his black back for several days without food and water through the harsh desert winds and heat.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balaji_giridharan.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>At the age of 33, Balaji Giridharan was struck with brain fever-encephalitis<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Several Sudan veterinarians from all over were called to help this brave creature. After months and months of struggle, he reached a point were he was not able to get up because of parts of his body not responding. He wasn't even able to lift his broad neck. Giri knew Balaji's life was coming to a sad end, but couldn't accept the fact that his "son" was about to leave this world. He spent his LIFE saving, 200 US dollars, to get all the treatment that could have helped poor "Bala." Sadly, it came to no avail, as Balaji passed away on the scorching evening of January 23, 2007. He was remember by all and still remains a symbol of hope to the Sudani people. Balaji's life can be explained by his country's motto. "Al-Nasr Lana" , <b>VICTORY IS OURS</b>.</p>
