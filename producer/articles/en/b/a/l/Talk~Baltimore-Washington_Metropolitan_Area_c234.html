<dd>No, I am correct. Washington-Baltimore is a Combined Statistical Area. Which is different. It consists of several metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, including the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Baltimore-Towson Metropolitan Statistical Area. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 04:24, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>No, it's a Combined Statistical Area, at least officially. It doesn't make any sense to use <i>old</i> census definitions. We should use the new census definitions, which define the two as in separate metropolitan areas, but combine those metropolitan areas into a so-called "Combined Statistical Area." It is not as though the old definitions have some particular sort of logical sense to them that means we should use them forever - as a native of the region, I certainly always considered Baltimore to be a separate metropolitan area, and I still think it's absurd that Fredericksburg is supposedly in the same metro area as where I grew up. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 04:32, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Separate articles could be created, but it the term Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area is still widely used. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomf688_3308.html" title="User:Tomf688"><font size="2" face="garamond" color="#3979BF">tomf688</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomf688_b319.html" title="User talk:Tomf688">talk</a>)</sup> 04:44, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Also, please note the image I just added; it adds/removes at least two counties from what is listed in the article. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomf688_3308.html" title="User:Tomf688"><font size="2" face="garamond" color="#3979BF">tomf688</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomf688_b319.html" title="User talk:Tomf688">talk</a>)</sup> 04:45, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term is widely used, but what does it mean? Does it mean the old Washington-Baltimore CMSA, or the current Washington-Baltimore CSA? Or something else entirely? I've suggested at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Cities_224d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cities">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cities</a> creating a new wikiproject for US metropolitan areas, which are currently in a terrible state, so that we can perhaps hash this out. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 04:52, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just as an example, <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagerstown%2C_Maryland_74da.html" title="Hagerstown, Maryland">Hagerstown, Maryland</a>, was in the old Washington-Baltimore CMSA, but not the Washington-Baltimore CSA. Also, it should be noted that the latter specifically does <i>not</i> describe itself as a metropolitan area. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:02, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why are we using the official government definitions? The "Washington-Baltimore CMSA" is (or was) well-defined, but the "Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area" is, like all metropolitan areas, ill-defined. There's no reason we should use the Census Agency's definitions, which are rather coarse (full counties as the finest subdivision?). --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 01:01, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed, SPUI. I also feel that much of the list should be removed as it is unnecessarily long and... who really reads it? Perhaps remove the cities, and leave the counties/states.--<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomf688_3308.html" title="User:Tomf688"><font size="2" face="garamond" color="#3979BF">tomf688</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomf688_b319.html" title="User talk:Tomf688">talk</a>)</sup> 01:12, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The government may define these counties as part of the metro area, but the relationship for a number of them are strained.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: I think the basis for including some of the outer counties that you're probably talking about is that there are a significant # of daily commuters from those places to Wash/Balt or their suburbs. Don't forget the long distances traversed by MARC and VRE riders!</p>

<p>There seems to be some a contridiction of the status of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_County%2C_VA_af7c.html" title="King George County, VA">King George County</a>. The <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_County%2C_VA_af7c.html" title="King George County, VA">King George County</a> page indicates that King George County is <b>NOT</b> a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore-Washington_Metropolitan_Area_a015.html" title="Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area">Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area</a> page, it is.</p>
<p>This also brings to light a local controversey regarding <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_County%2C_VA_af7c.html" title="King George County, VA">King George County</a> and whether or not it is part of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Neck_f665.html" title="Northern Neck">Northern Neck</a> of Virginia.

I was educated in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland_County%2C_Virginia_3dbd.html" title="Northumberland County, Virginia">Northumberland County, Virginia</a>, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are <b>FIVE</b> counties in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Neck_f665.html" title="Northern Neck">Northern Neck</a>, including <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_County%2C_VA_af7c.html" title="King George County, VA">King George County</a>.</p>
<p>However, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland_County%2C_Virginia_3dbd.html" title="Northumberland County, Virginia">Northumberland</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancaster_County%2C_Virginia_0701.html" title="Lancaster County, Virginia">Lancaster</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westmoreland_County%2C_Virginia_ef3c.html" title="Westmoreland County, Virginia">Westmoreland</a>, and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond_County%2C_Virginia_49d1.html" title="Richmond County, Virginia">Richmond</a> counties. Locals think of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Neck_f665.html" title="Northern Neck">Northern Neck</a> more as a community with similar values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be "suburban", part of the Washington DC <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_sprawl.html" title="Urban sprawl">urban sprawl</a> and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.</p>

<p>So, uh, why was this moved back? There is no specific, defined area called the "Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area," therefore it should not be capitalized, because it's not a proper noun - it's a general concept. If we're going to capitalize the specific name of the Census area, we're going to have to spell the whole thing out.

<ul>
<li>On a subjective note, I will say that I've seen a trend over the past 30 years away from consolidating the two metropolitan areas. It seemed to be popular in the past to prepare for a time in the future when the metropolitan areas would blend into one another and eventually be considered one. Yet, as the two metropolitan areas do now actually touch, no signifigant blending of their cultures and economies has occured, despite urban planners dreams of making them become one big happy metropolitan area. Washington and Baltimore seem more polarized now than they did 20 years ago. I wonder why. Different economies and different cultures made this impossible, perhaps? I think this is reflected somewhat in sport culture allegiances. Baltimore always refused to support the washington football team as a matter of principle. Washington had a general disinterest in supporting the Baltimore baseball team. Baltimore basketball and hockey fans refuse to root for the wizards and capitals, respectively. Of course, obvs., none of this is important; but I think it is somehow reflective of the larger issue addressed by both this article and the discussion thread.</li>

<p>The official name of the CSA is "Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia". Why not make that the page title, so as to conform with the actual name, then forward anyone who searches for either "Washington-Baltimore" or "Baltimore-Washington" to that?</p>
<p>The justification given earlier, that this “Baltimore-Washington” construct is an ill-defined animal different from the official CSA, doesn’t hold water considering the entire rest of the article concerns the CSA. If the writers feel “Baltimore-Washington” is truly different than the “Washington-Baltimore-NoVa” CSA, then the two constructs should have different articles with a clear explanation as to the difference.</p>
<p>Short of that, insisting on calling what everyone else in the country, including those in charge of actually coming up with official names, calls Washington-Baltimore, strikes me as silly provincialism on the part of somebody in Baltimore who’s trying to compensate for a sense of inferiority.</p>

<p>this is too funny. I was born in washington and lived in the washington suburbs my entire life. the vernacular term, colloquially, had always been "baltimore-washington." the official name was changed to the Washington Baltimore combined statistical area sometime ago (15 years or so?), yet, the general term is still "baltimore-washington," and is used as such when spoken of outside the region. now, this may no longer be true inside the washington area, but the declarations of a baltimorean "sense of inferiority" is killing me. I love watching these two cities bite and claw at each other.</p>

<p>It really makes no sense to have an article on this area and another on the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington-Arlington-Alexandria%2C_DC-VA-MD-WV_MSA_2f19.html" title="Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV MSA">Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV MSA</a>.

<ul>
<li>The two articles, the one on Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV MSA, and the one on the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Areas, should most definately be seperate, as they are obviously about two completely different things. One is about the metropolitan area of Washington D.C., the other about is the broader issue of a combined statistical area of two metropolitan areas. A combined statistical area and a metropolitan statistical area are not the same thing, and as the Baltimore-Towson metropolitan statistical area is not in the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria metropolitan statistical area, why would the two articles be merged?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if your argument was that there is no reason that there should be two seperate articles for the Baltimore-Washington area and the Washington-Baltimore Consolidated Statistical Area, you might have a good point; but the proposal to join the two articles pointed to the wrong articles... one on the Baltimore-Washington Area and the other on the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV "Metropolitan Statistical Area." These are two completely different things and the Washington MSA does not even include Baltimore or any of the 2.6 million people who actually live in the Baltimore-Towson Metropolitan Statistical Area.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd support the merge. The Washington MSA is part of the the Baltimore Washington Metro area and it's article doesn't offer any content that isn't already here, so until it does there isn't really any reason to keep separate articles. <a href="../../../k/m/u/User%7EKmusser_3979.html" title="User:Kmusser">Kmusser</a> 14:52, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would also support a merge as long as it is made clear that the CSA contains two distinct major metropolitan areas. --<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolaron_cd38.html" title="User:Polaron">Polaron</a> | <a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPolaron_e6b4.html" title="User talk:Polaron">Talk</a> 15:10, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kmusser, i think that may be a stronger argument for an expansion for the article on the Washington MSA, or the creation of a page on the Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area. As noted many times above, the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area is more of vague notion than an official entity (and has been implied that the Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area no longer has official designation from the OFB. Of this, I am not sure... actually, I find it difficult to believe.) But merging that article about an official entity into this article about a vague notion, when they both actually have very different definitions, is problematic to say the least.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While the title is vague the content that is here is mostly about the official CSA which the MSA is a subset of and the section about Washington here is almost an exact duplicate of the Washington MSA article. I don't see the problem with including a government definition in a article about the general area, as long as it's clearly identified as such, which it is. This article isn't very long, I'd say just expand the Washington section here. <a href="../../../k/m/u/User%7EKmusser_3979.html" title="User:Kmusser">Kmusser</a> 00:19, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I found this page by looking for the Washington MSA, as distinct from the CSA, because I was rejected from a government commuter program by having a workplace outside the "Washington, DC Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as defined by the United States Office Of Management and Budget" (FYI, The mwcog.org Guaranteed Ride Home Program) This was the most convenient way for me to find that definition without wading through PDFs. I'd like to see it kept. (unregistered DC user) 72.75.56.129 00:09, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The two articles absolutely should not be merged, and I was surprised to find that this has been proposed. Irrespective of census definitions, the DC Metro area is completely distinct from that of Baltimore. Yes, the two interact all the time, but are separate politically, economically, and it could be argued, culturally. They do share a couple counties (<a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_County%2C_Maryland_b2b8.html" title="Howard County, Maryland">Howard</a>, most notably), but the same goes for Washington DC and Richmond --<a href="../../../f/r/e/Fredericksburg%2C_Virginia_8d6e.html" title="Fredericksburg, Virginia">Fredericksburg</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spotsylvania_County_5ac0.html" title="Spotsylvania County">Spotsylvania County</a> have commuters to both MSAs. In the Maryland Senatorial election, a key issue was whether <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Cardin_8e34.html" title="Ben Cardin">Ben Cardin</a> was in touch with the DC area of Maryland (he wasn't by the way). The most important division, by far, is that of the economies. I would not be surprised (yes, this is substance-less speculation) if the proposal to merge was initiated either by Baltimore-area residents or, more likely, by busybody Wikipedians from outside the region who are simply seeking to improve the articles by making them more efficient. But don't be confused -- there's a reason the Washington Post only prints local Thursday sections for Mongomery, Fairfax, Arlington/Alexandria, Prince George's, and other Virginian counties.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The proposal was made because currently the articles are almost identical, all that's in either article is basically the Census definition - there is little about politics, economics, or culture in either article. If you wanted to add information about the differences between the two metro areas then right here would be an excellent place to do so. <a href="../../../k/m/u/User%7EKmusser_3979.html" title="User:Kmusser">Kmusser</a> 16:30, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The articles are probably similar because one MSA contains the smaller Metro area, yet the DC area is the more prominent of the two (between Baltimore metro and DC metro).

<li>I've now made a few major changes: "Washington Metropolitan Area" is no longer a redirect to this article. It now is its own article, identical to the former "washington va-wv-arlington etc." which now redirects to it. I'll be spending some time to check for double redirects, but for the most part, I think we're doing OK. The reason for the name change is that the old name is not widely recognized and is markedly different from those of other major metropolitan areas, including: New York Metropolitan Area, Greater Los Angeles, Chicagoland, Deleware Valley, Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, South Florida metropolitan area, and Greater Houston, the only MSAs statistically larger by population that the DC area.<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasmallen_15b8.html" title="User:Thomasmallen">Thomasmallen</a> 15:20, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<pre>
   I clearly belive that Maryland/Virginia are southern states!

<p>Many People object to the idea of Virginia and Maryland being southern. Im from Maryland so I know. I hate it when people that don't know me come in my face with all that "yankee" crap...i aint no yankee...im myself!

<p>Next Subject: Civil war/M&amp;D line.</p>
<pre>
   If everyone knows that MD and VA are BELOW the Mason Dixon Line... why do some people feel the need to say that MD and VA are Northern????
</pre>
<p>It's quite -how can i say- IDIOTIC! Yes, folks, I know that the MDL was not made to divide the north and the south, but It's pretty usefull to divide the two. Doncha think???...About the civil war...VA was apart of the confeds...i can't lie, BUT MD was FORSED to become apart of the union and most of the people wanted to be with the feds.(yuddah im sayin)...So anyways, like i was sayin, VA &amp; MD are natrually South.</p>

   Everyone knows that MD is not like the rest of the southern states-no accent(mostly), not many confed. flags, has northern-like cities, bad traffic etc.- but it is still SOUTHERN.
</pre>
<p>I mean dang, like many other southern states, we take pride in are lil southerness, we sometimes act a lil country, and we still TALK diffrent from the north...esspecially Dc/B-more area. CUT US SOME SLACK!</p>
<p>Final Subject: Overall.</p>
<pre>
   Over all, Maryland and Virginia are southern!
</pre>
<p>They have many southern charms too. Infact, we have great hospitaliy too! Don't worry, be happy. Even if your mad, you HAVE TO admit that maryland and virginia are atleast a TAD BIT southern. YEs, YEs, YEs, we do have many qualities like the north(aka bad traffic...lol), But you must admit(if youve been too maryland and virginia...NOT B-MORE or DC)that it is southern in some areas!</p>
<p>ps. dont post nasty negitive comments about Virginia or Maryland..okedoke allipokey...lolz</p>
<p><br />
ps no 2. IF you ask a man at a gas station in Southern, MD.... you'll know that chu in the south. - Footballchik</p>

<p>Today (Jan. 17 07) I created the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Metropolitan_Area_7c62.html" title="Baltimore Metropolitan Area">Baltimore Metropolitan Area</a> page. I also re-linked the MSA-rank list. I'm sure there are numerous articles that mention the Baltimore area that should be linked to this new (and certainly unfinished) page.<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasmallen_15b8.html" title="User:Thomasmallen">Thomasmallen</a> 15:39, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
