<p>The school was opened in 1972 and is set in spacious grounds. It originally comprised of two blocks, named C Block and T Block. A few years later the J block was added, housing a Library, Maths, Geography, Science, Technical and Computing classrooms. This is linked to C Block via a bridge corridor going through L Block. There are also detached "hut" units housing a small number of classrooms. The school has two cafeterias, the L Block one being used by 1st, 2nd and 6th Year Pupils; the C Block one being used by 3rd, 4th and 5th Year Pupils.</p>
<p>Sporting Facilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a wooden floored gymnasium with gymnastic equipment</li>
<li>a gym with weight training facilities</li>
<li>a swimming pool</li>
<li>an indoor games area</li>
<li>2 squash courts</li>
<li>outdoor tennis courts</li>
<li>football/rugby pitch</li>
<li>400m running track</li>
<li>1 Blaes hockey pitch</li>
<li>1 astroturf pitch</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also an auditorium with a stage area and a full complement of lighting and sound equipment.</p>
<p>Outwith school hours, the school functions as a community centre.</p>
<p>In January 1997 a radiator fault caused a fire in the school's Music Department which is situated at the top floor of C block. The fire was extinguished quickly by the local fire brigade. The Music Department suffered the most damage through both fire and water, however each level underneath the 3rd floor suffered subsequent fire damage. The school was closed for several days with the students being allowed back in stages with Senior students, who were in the final preparations for May exams, returning first.</p>
<p>Maybe ironically, the fire began in the early hours of the morning after the schools '<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns_Night_6da7.html" title="Burns Night">Burns Night</a>' celebrations for the birthday of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Burns_c5f3.html" title="Robert Burns">Robert Burns</a>.</p>

<p>Pupils are offered a full range of courses from 5-14 in S1/ S2, through <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Grade_75ec.html" title="Standard Grade">Standard Grade</a> to National Qualifications at <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intermediate_1.html" title="Intermediate 1">Intermediate</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_%28Scottish%29_07d3.html" title="Higher (Scottish)">Higher</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Higher_%28Scottish%29_27b6.html" title="Advanced Higher (Scottish)">Advanced Higher</a> levels.</p>
<p>A high staying on rate is reflected in large numbers gaining employment, training or Further or Higher Education.</p>
<p>A wide range of extracurricular activities is on offer. These include sport, music, drama and chess. Pupils also have the opportunity of foreign travel through ski trips, visits to historical sites, school exchanges and participation in World Challenge Expeditions.</p>
<p>Pupil representatives are elected to year councils and the whole pupil council meets with the rector once a term. Working groups tackle whole-school issues.</p>
<p>The school originally won a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter_Mark_d748.html" title="Charter Mark">Charter Mark</a> Award for excellence in public service in 2001, this has now been renewed. The school also has the Schools Curriculum Award.</p>
<p>Recently pupils in an Alternative Curriculum Group won a Fife Excellence Award and the magazine club won the Scotsman/Royal Bank of Scotland ‘Design a Newspaper’. More recently, a Young Enterprise company in the school scooped two of the three trophies. Pupils and staff take part in regular fund-raising for <a href="../../../s/a/v/Save_the_Children_2746.html" title="Save the Children">Save the Children</a>.</p>

<p>The school day is divided up into six, 53 minute periods.</p>
<p>The school timetable was changed in the mid 1990s to allow children to travel home whilst it was still light during the winter months. Previously the lunch break was longer, and the school day finished at 15:50. In 2005, afternoon registration was removed, and morning registration was extended.</p>
