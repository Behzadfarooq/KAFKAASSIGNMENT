</dl>
<hr />
<p>Again, user:H.J. knows a lot of facts, and is partially right, but doesn't get the whole picture. The Baltic Germans were Germans who settled in the Baltic area very early, many for trade. This was not difficult in the period when the Teutonic Order ran the place -- and please let's remember that officially, the TO reported to the pope, not the Emperor. And please let's remember that the Emperor often did little more than rubber stamp whoever ruled an area -- it's not always what it appears. <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I substantially rewrote this article, which implied mostly additions rather than revisions; I also sorted out the nomenclature.

<p>I made some minor tweaks to your text, including changing [[Imperial Germans]] to [[Imperial Germany|Imperial Germans]], which of course can be changed back in case we really find it worth to write an article on <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Germans_2727.html" title="Imperial Germans">Imperial Germans</a>. I wonder however over your removal of the reference to <a href="../../../o/l/o/Olof_Palme_1a41.html" title="Olof Palme">Olof Palme</a>, whom I guess is more well known than the two prominent Balt Germans you inserted there instead. Anyhow, great work!<br />

<p>Many thanks for any improving changes. I think in the end there should be a small entry for Imperial Germans, in the specific sense of Germans from the Empire as classified by Germans from regions outside it. I'm not sure about the "Imperial Germany" link, because that refers only to the 1871-1918 <i>Kaiserreich</i>, whereas <i>reichsdeutsch</i> is also used for times before and after that. As regards Palme, I think there are many more people with Baltic German lineage; the reference seemed more incidental than anything else. The two scientists were there already, and I only retained them for later expansion - they are of course not the most famous Baltic German ones at all, and some other ones, such as <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Ernst_von_Baer_45f1.html" title="Karl Ernst von Baer">Karl Ernst von Baer</a>, are already here on wikipedia.<br />
<a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a></p>
<p>That's my problem with the <u>English</u> term "Imperial Germans." I think it poorly covers <i>Reichsdeutsche.</i> Maybe <i>Continental Germans</i> could work? I don't know!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Alas, no; "Imperial Germans", especially since the last decade, is in fact used in the English-language historical literature about the Baltics, the University of Dorpat (where Imperial vs. Baltic Germans was the main conflict among the professoriate), etc. Thus, it clearly is the standard term (and one would search for in an encyclopedia if unfamiliar with it).</dd>

<dd>You can certainly restore it, if you want, but I think many eminent persons have some sort of Baltic German descent, and I don't think Palme is in the end that big, even internationally, to qualify for a single link. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 17:35, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)

<dd>That may well be so. I'm sorry I deleted him, I didn't see he was an addition on purpose, I thought it was something of a loose end. As a matter of fact, I hadn't even looked at the history of the article, because it seemed so mangled and in need of revision. I only now discovered that there were all kinds of political fights over it also. If I would have known that, I might have actually let it alone entirely.</dd>

<p>The last change is clearly completely wrong; native Prussians as defined here (i.e., not Prussians in the general sense) have nothing whatsoever to do with Baltic Germans, nor, dare I say, would they ever have been in any relevant discourse or literature. This should be removed, because it is really false. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 19:25, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This way, it is certainly more correct, although still not completely so, and I don't think in the relevant literature, there is much lumping-together of the two, so I changed the qualifier from "usually" to "occasionally". <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 20:40, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both that and the only University at all in the Baltic region - the first other universities in that region are early 20th century foundations, usually former polytechnics.

<p>Why prussian german are not counted as Baltic-german?</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a difference between the Old Prussians (natives) and the Prussians in the modern sense, but neither of them are Baltic German, as they simply lived in a different area. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>As i understand only germans that lived, in what is today Latvia and Estonia, counts as Baltic-germans, am i right?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you are. Lithuania was not considered Baltic for a long time (until into the 20th Century), and it was certainly outside of any Baltic German sphere. "Baltic" in that sense were only the Russian provinces of Estonia, Livonia, and Couronia. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 11:12, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed the sentence saying that the Baltic Germans were impoverished after Estonian and Latvian independence; at least in Latvia, they were the wealthiest ethnic group and extremely organized politically (with the highest per capita representation in the parliament, for example). Also, I tried to underscore the extent of their cultural autonomy -- highly educated, they had their own school system prior to 1934 (even including a higher education institution, the Herder Institute). The school board basically ran their cultural projects for a time. In Estonia, their cultural autonomy was even more extensive. Their designs on Latvia after WWI, e.g. support for Niedra's puppet government and the Bermondt-Avalov episode (for which reason Latvia actually declared war on Germany on November 15, 1919), should be mentioned. Their departure should also be detailed (the agreement between the Latvian and German governments, for example) -- as should the fact that the main Baltic German organization was taken over by local Nazis in the late 1930s (Nazism was rather widespread, especially in the younger generation).

<p>Just as an observation, the article, as of now, really reads more like "the history of Baltic German nobility", and not "Baltic Germans as an ethnic group". Despite a popular misconception, which the article also seems to reinforce, the two (Baltic Germans and Baltic nobility) were nowhere near to being identical phenomena. In fact, throughout most of the history of the Baltic Germans (and the German-speaking population in the Baltic area) the majority of them did not belong to aristocracy, but were merchants, craftsmen, clergimen, soldiers and other laypeople. --<a href="../../../3/_/l/User%7E3_L%C3%B6wi_049a.html" title="User:3 Löwi">3 Löwi</a> 15:53, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point, but better if it were integrated into the article!&#160;:-) The emphasis on the nobility may be correct in a history of the Russian provinces etc., but not when discussing the ethnic group, which is what this article is about. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 16:55, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good observation! The inconsistency probably irises from the fact that, in English, words ending with <i>-ish</i> or <i>-ese</i> are used in all these meanings, and so <i>people</i> or <i>language</i> have to be added. But an ethnic group name ending with <i>-an</i> in the singular will most often redirect to a disambiguation or to a language or dialect whereas the plural is more likely to redirect to a group of people. I would prefer seeing the plural form in the title, since the content of the article will invariably still use the plural of the noun (if not a derived adjective). But maybe it's nitpicking, really... <i><b>;]</b></i> /<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 21:03, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ethnic_groups_221f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethnic groups">WikiProject Ethnic groups</a> has added new assessment criteria for Ethnic Groups articles.</p>
<p>Your article has automatically been given <s><b>class=stub</b> and</s> <b>reassess=yes</b> ratings. [corrected text: --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 22:58, 16 October 2006 (UTC)] Don't feel slighted if the article is actually far more than a stub -- at least in the beginning, all unassessed articles are being automatically assigned to these values.</p>
<dl>
<dd>--&gt;<i>How to assess articles</i><br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Revisions of assessment ratings can be made by assigning an appropriate value via the <i>class</i> parameter in the WikiProject Ethnic groups project banner <b>{{<a href="../../../e/t/h/Template%7EEthnic_groups_825d.html" title="Template:Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a>}}</b> that is currently placed at the top of Ethnic groups articles' talk pages. Quality assessment guidelines are at the Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team's <b><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Assessment_0e4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment">assessment system</a></b> page.</p>
<p>Please see the Project's <b><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ethnic_groups_Assessment_e07f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethnic groups/Assessment">article rating and assessment scheme</a></b> for more information and the details and criteria for each rating value. A brief version can be found at <a href="../../../e/t/h/Template_talk%7EEthnic_groups_d3a1.html" title="Template talk:Ethnic groups">Template talk:Ethnic groups</a>. You can also enquire at the Ethnic groups Project's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Ethnic_groups_e186.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Ethnic groups">main discussion board</a> for assistance.</p>
<p>Another way to help out that could be an enjoyable pastime is to visit <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikiProject_Ethnic_groups_76d9.html" title="Category:WikiProject Ethnic groups">Category:WikiProject Ethnic groups</a>, find an interesting-looking article to read, and carefully assess it following those guidelines.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<p>I assume their presence today is really tiny but it would be interesting to make a mention of their numbers and places where there may be still communities nowadays. It would also be interesting to note -if true- whether there were certain areas of present day Germany with a remarkable higher Baltic Deutsch population as a result of a coordinated migration. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMountolive_175f.html" title="User:Mountolive">Mountolive</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/u/User_talk%7EMountolive_3eea.html" title="User talk:Mountolive">Talk</a> 07:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
