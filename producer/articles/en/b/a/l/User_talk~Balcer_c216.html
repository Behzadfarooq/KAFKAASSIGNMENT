<p>I commented to your discussions at Piotrus' and Alex Bakharev's talk.</p>
<p>A side question: What do you think about <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainization.html" title="Ukrainization">Ukrainization</a> article? It's developed from initial disatrous state to its current form, largely by myself, and, if I may say so, seems to me not so bad, while the modern section could use some improvement. OTOH the modern section is the hardest one to write since the topic is hot and press is largely. The aticle is from time to time persistently attacked by the same old fellow with bad-faith tags, deletion of sourced info, adding of irrelevant suff and other nosnesne. I thought you might be interested. Take a look. If you have time for the whole talk, fine, and hisotry, cool. If not, check the recent entries and the article itself.

<p>Under RfC procedures someone involved can endorse an outside view. Outside view simply means that it was written by someone from outside the matter. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:28, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You just deleted my endorsement of the complaint against Samuel Blanning; you say I deleted comments by others. I do not understand. I went in and added my four '~' signature. I didn't delete anything, as far as I know. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfnjm_f2dc.html" title="User:Profnjm">Profnjm</a> 04:02, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

As you can see, you deleted the comments by a lot of users, by mistake it would seem. I simply reverted and invited you to vote again, but in the meantime another user readded your vote. The best way to avoid this is to check the edit history after you click "Save page" to see precisely what changes you made. I always do it on important pages (like RfC, vote etc.) to make sure I did not mess anything up. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 04:07, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Balcer has, along with the rest of us, legitimate reason to suspect sockpuppetry in this case, as participating in an RfC on one's second day of Wikipedia editing is major cause for sockpuppetry concern. If you want to call that bad faith, go ahead -- it has become clear to me that the RfC itself has been filed in bad faith, anyways. Accusations of bad faith are not personal attacks. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 16:20, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why are you so motivated to delete the El Condor Pada article? When I was in the bomb shelter (I doubt you can imagine the horrors I experienced as a 11-year old boy), a boom box was all I had down there, it could run on batteries and for an extended period of time (power cuts were often). And when I turn on the boom box, I hear music, the band Indexovci making fun of NATO and their "stealth" bombers which the Yugoslav Army shot down. That made us hopefull. In a war, hope is all you have, please try to understand the effect it had on all of us. I'm telling you the dead truth, I have no reasons to lie. The song gave us hope, and it was all we had back then, it was played regurarly in almost every bomb shelter throughout Serbia. The band that played it was an anti-Milosevic band, and of course Milosevic didn't want them to have too much publicity, but they were extremely popular. They even came to Vancouver last year. The song is the symbol of an era, where everyone was hopeless, and every ray of hope was cherished as much as possible. I beg you, try to understand this. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 01:44, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, having never been in such a situation myself, I cannot imagine how you must have felt during that war. I can only express regret for any casualties the armed forces of my country, Canada, have caused in that war. But there is no need to get emotional here. If the song played such a huge part in the Serbian resistance, that will be shown soon with reliable sources, and the song will get its own article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime, I invite you and other interested users to create Shooting down of the F-117A stealth fighter in 1999 during the Kosovo War or Serbian Cultural Resistance to NATO bombings and other articles in a similar vein, where there should be no problems with proposals for deletion at all. Those should be sufficient to express your point of view on Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please note that we are arguing here about a fine point of Wikipedia rules, which unfortunately happen to be very restrictive about which songs get their own articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At any rate, the decision about whether the song will be deleted or not is not up to me. I have made some arguments, and their worth will be judged by the community. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 01:57, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have already written about the shooting down of the F-117 aircraft on Serbian Wikipedia. I'm affraid to do that here, since it is basically showing that with the help of 30 year old Soviet radars, a small country shot down the greatest aircraft technology on the planet, some NATO-lovers mught target the article. I don't want any trouble. Thank you for expressing your regret, I'm happy that not everyone's against Serbia. Thank you for your arguments, but I would kindly ask you to not comment anymore, please, let's just let the others decide. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 02:16, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there is no reason to be afraid, and if I were you, I would start that article. Wikipedia is quite international at this point, and the pro-NATO point of view might not be as strong as you think. I changed my vote from delete to merge with the article about the group that made the song. That seems to me an ideal solution, especially since the group article is essentially empty at this point. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 02:30, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>yes, I realized that but did not have time to go back and change the red links, but continued to correct links with proper spacing on other pages. as for grammar, I actually corrected rather horrid english grammar and sentences that made no sense. So don't lecture me on that, as I was not misleading or anything of the sort, I actually corrected POV pushes and misleading information.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_b81c.html" title="User:Jadger">Jadger</a> 19:34, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>yes, but if you would look at my edits I made certain I did not make such mistakes. better to only criticize the mistakes I actually did make, rather than the ones I never did.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_b81c.html" title="User:Jadger">Jadger</a> 19:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>perhaps cite specific examples from those pages, I don't see where it says that they invaded Poland, where it says <i>active during the Invasion of Poland</i> that does not refer to which side he/it fought on.</p>
<p>if it were to say <i>took part in the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_Poland_%281939%29_e800.html" title="Invasion of Poland (1939)">Invasion of Poland (1939)</a></i> that would be totally different and match what you are complaining about, but I have made sure to avoid that.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_b81c.html" title="User:Jadger">Jadger</a> 20:02, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I thought it was clear which side it was on as the eighth word in the article was <i>Poland/Polish</i>. Also, this confuses me: it says that there were four squadrons, each made up of two escadrilles, but escadrille is the french name/equivalent for squadron. for instance, on Canadian airforce hangers at Trenton airbase the English name is given then right below it the french name, e.g <i>1. fighter squadron.... 1. escadrille</i>. what is the difference in the Polish airforce between escadrilles and squadrons? perhaps what is meant is <i>wing</i> or <i>flight</i>.</p>

<p>how has there been compromise? I have only seen Rahmel/rumia removed from the introduction, and placed further down in the article, that is not compromise, that is rearranging. <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Eastern_Germany_7ab9.html" title="Historical Eastern Germany">Historical Eastern Germany</a> keeps being removed, and the Rahmel (now Rumia) keeps being changed to a version not according to the consensus via the Danzig/Gdansk ruling.</p>

<ol>
<li>well, it was in West Prussia, and NPOV does not deal with how Poles feel, if you're offended shouldn't really matter to an objective article. It was in Germany at the time, and the geographic area it is in was called west prussia, it would be strange for a reader to try to find Voivodeships on a map of 1943 Germany.</li>
<li>it was Rumia in the fact that it was the same physical town, but it was called Rahmel, One could also claim that Rumia now is also Rahmel. Danzig and Gdansk are the same city at different time periods. your point was?</li>
</ol>
<p>please, compromise doesn't involve accusing the other users of uneducated edits. That is bad faith, how are we going to compromise when you villify all who oppose you?</p>

<ol>
<li>thank you, I did not have much time at that moment and could not find the correct one, I assumed good faith as that is what had been written before by others.</li>
<li>the way you worded that is very misleading. when you say most of the world you mean the nations at war with Germany at the time, they can hardly be said to have been uninvolved or been non-partisan. I am referring to it as it was said in the German-Polish border agreement during re-unification "facts on the ground". I am assuming good faith, you are accusing me of "sweeping it under the carpet", when you accuse me of things it hardly makes one want to cooperate with someone insulting them, compromise is two ways, you have compromise as well. I am not trying to hide anything, that is why it says Rahmel (now Rumia) and then there is a link to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Eastern_Germany_7ab9.html" title="Historical Eastern Germany">Historical Eastern Germany</a> which gives further information on the topic. perhaps a <i>further reading</i> section at the bottom of the article including historical eastern germany, <a href="../../../o/d/e/Oder-Neisse_Line_e065.html" title="Oder-Neisse Line">Oder-Neisse Line</a>, expulsion of Germans after WWII etc. etc. could be added for those who are reading it and know nothing of the forced expulsion of the majority of the population to modern Germany.</li>
</ol>
<p>I never said that your views should not count, I said an encyclopedia article should not be worried about offending people, we should not avoid telling the truth in order to not offend certain groups. and BTW, we should not include "your views" as they are POV, exactly what is trying to be avoided.</p>

<dd>I have worked that in, the link to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_eastern_Germany_5b0d.html" title="Historical eastern Germany">historical eastern Germany</a> talks about that, if you want to say had been a part of poland from 1919 to 1939 go ahead and put that in, but don't state something such as <i>illegally annexed</i>, etc. etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>but did not poland annex it after WWI and rename it Rumia? my point is exactly that. If one actually looks at public opinion rather than government policies in the allied nations, many supported the idea of ethnicly homogenous nation states, hence the reason for the appeasement of Hitler beforehand, many saw the treaty of Versailles as unnecessarily harsh. what a government does and what the majority of its citizens think are two very different things (as the war in Iraq has shown in the USA now). would you want people in 50 years thinking that all Americans (or even a majority) supported the invasion of Iraq. and we are talking 1939 here, USA was not yet involved so perhaps you can provide a source that shows that most people did not support Germany gaining her land back. of course the Nazis overstepped the bounds and annexed other land as well, not just previously German lands. of course the German/Nazi viewpoint/name was biased, but as I said, the rules on the ground are what matter, if the USA/the iraqi gov't was to change the name of Baghdad to <i>freedomville</i> the name would be changed in all the documents published thereafter. for some time the old name would be used, but eventually the new rulers would prevail.</dd>

<p>Sorry Balcer, but I have to say hear, hear to Jadger's point concerning the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> and the U.S. government's involvement in it, and it's nonsensical pursuit of it, and my pacifistic opposition to it. <i>Old men talking, and young men dying</i>. God forbid that Poland gets more entangled in that mess. As to the rest of the discussion, both of you make good debaters with many points scored by both. Don't know enough about it.

<p>your reference above refutes your own claims Balcer, the section title that you cited calls it "annexation" and it says it was "officially incorporated into the German Reich". that firmly places Rahmel in Germany in 1943, not in the General Gov't or the office in London that housed the Polish gov't in exile.</p>

<dd>The reference says Rumia was occupied, hence the word occupied must be incorporated into the article. And since Germany was not occupying itself, this can only mean that Steinbach was born in occupied Poland. Unless better scholarly references are presented to challenge my reference, this matter is resolved. If you want a different outcome, I suggest you take a walk to the library and start searching for references which will disprove mine. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 02:25, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the person in question was a King of Poland for 49 years, so if such a vote cannot be announced on the Polish Noticeboard, it cannot be announced anywhere, I guess. On the other hand, the connection with Russia is rather weak.</dd>

<p>Hi. A source showing the mistaken notion of Kerensky being Jewish on the article talk page already existed but it was ignored. I have removed him from a list of Jews he was added to. Most anti-semitic sites put Kerensky as Jewish since he inspires some sort of hatred. See <a href="http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=1744" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=1744" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Reliable stuff, right? Somehow it was derived that Kerensky's real name was Aaron Kuerbis, though that appears to be completely made up.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, your edit on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Kerensky_fc25.html" title="Alexander Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a> and his removal from the Jewish list will be re-instated. If you manage a discussion with the user removing them concerning the authenticity of whatever given reference calls him Jewish, I will join in. <a href="../../../1/4/1/User%7E141.211.251.74.html" title="User:141.211.251.74">141.211.251.74</a> 16:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That's what <i>you</i> called it earlier (sarcastically) on my talk months ago challenging me for "more sources". I hope you did not think I forgot.</p>
<p>Exhausted enough by a Wikistress, I decided tonight to take a retreat into a book which was too neglected on my shelf for too long.</p>
<ul>

<p>This 800+ page monography is the most serious work on the subject. Anyway, the author works all his life in the Museum of Kiev History. I was reading one of the early chapters about the address Instytutska 20/8 (formerly 40), the former residence of the General-Governor of Kiev. I know this location very well along with the built in the 30s house with the unusual park in its courtyard. I knew that the house was built at the location of the former Governor's mansion, the park was a garden in its backyard but I never realy knew what happened to the original mansion. The end of the chapter answers this question. The retreating Polish forces blew up the house at the same time when the wonderful <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridges_in_Kiev_c10a.html#Nicholas_Bridge" title="Bridges in Kiev">Chain bridge</a> was blown up too.</p>
<p>Now, this was just a house, not a military object and the ref is absolutely solid. More interesting is that I recall that several facilities whose being ruined I mentioned (the info was removed of course) are located in the same neighborhood (<i>Lypky</i>). This is not the book that can be read fast and I am not intereted in scanning it quickly in search for more examples of such vandalism but I thought you would be interested in the ref I found.</p>
<p>I am not editing the articles on the PSW and KO lately because I have yet to compose myself from the feeling of dispair after the barrage that undid so many days of my work. But I will get back to them hopefully soon. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 10:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am glad you are finding more sources for that sad period in the history of Kiev. If you find more solid evidence, feel free to add it. Still, remember that the whole controversy has started when you (or someone) claimed that vandalism and destruction by Polish forces "made the city unlivable", by destroying water works, electricity plants etc. . Destroying one house is not exactly in that category. And we must be careful about extrapolating from one house to the whole city.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, this should all first be established in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Kiev_89e1.html" title="History of Kiev">History of Kiev</a> before we do major changes to the <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev_Offensive_0056.html" title="Kiev Offensive">Kiev Offensive</a> and related articles. I still wonder, if the "vandalising of Kiev by Poles in 1920" was such a significant event in the history of the city, why does <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Kiev_89e1.html" title="History of Kiev">History of Kiev</a> not mention a word about it??? If it occured, it should be added, discussed, and backed up with sources there first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, what "barrage" are you talking about? <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev_Offensive_0056.html" title="Kiev Offensive">Kiev Offensive</a> has not been seriously touched in two months at least, for example. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 13:24, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What do you mean "more solid". This is a rocksolid source. There is no ref that Poles "destroyed one house". Bridges were priceless for the city located at such a wide river. Both were destroyed. Clearly they destroyed more than that. I had refs that Poles destroyed civil objects despite they claimed that only military objects were invovled. The info was removed because the sources were deemed less reliable than the own statements by the PL gov. I now give another example that the statement that only military objects were destroyed is patently false.</p>
<p>I see your point in adding this to the history of Kiev. However, this article, in whose writing I was significanly involved from the times when this was yet a section in the <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> article, does not suffer so badly from POV problems like the whole series devoted to PSW.</p>
<p>Kiev offensive was seriously invaded as well as PSW and I just temporary gave up out of desperation.</p>
<p>On the side note, unfounded accusations of other users in personal attacks are personal attacks in themselves. Please do not do it. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is not much point in arguing over this on my talk page. The natural place for this is <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_Kiev_0d11.html" title="Talk:History of Kiev">Talk:History of Kiev</a>. Surely that is the place where one is likely to find editors most knowledgeable about the history of the city.</dd>
<dd>As for the personal attack stuff, sorry, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FPiotrus&amp;diff=94639156&amp;oldid=94631780" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FPiotrus&amp;diff=94639156&amp;oldid=94631780" rel="nofollow">accusing someone of being drunk</a> when they made their edit is clearly a personal attack for me. I am really sad that you do not view it this way. Quite frankly, in the light of your comment accusing me of making "unfounded accusations" in this case, I do not think there is much point to continuing our discussions any further. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 04:56, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi<br />
why are you unhappy with the new Infobox Poland? Did you prefer the old version? I think in the old version there was a lot of information missing. Most international infoboxes have economy information, headlines, etc. If you have a good idea making the box better please tell me!<br />
(<a href="../../../f/u/j/User%7EFujicolor_ffe6.html" title="User:Fujicolor">Fujicolor</a> 16:49, 22 January 2007 (UTC))<br />
you are right, the Paris box is nicer. unfortunately I am not so good in formatting and I am not able to change this to this handsome design.<br />
The former box was very poor so I tried making it a little better. Even the former information requested for the box were wrong.<br />
As I am German and not too involved in Polish systems I had to find out their administration structure and redesign the box so that it also fits to the Polish needs. Please help (correct) me, if you can:<br />
As I understand Poland is devided in Voidoships. They are devided into powiats (countys). Usually there is a city powiat like Kalisz and a mixed powiat like Kalisz County. (Am I right?). My major problem is, that city powiats are directly devided into districts who are somelike french arrondisments and rural or mixed powiats are devided into communes and then the communes (gmina) are again devided into districts. It is difficult finding a correct way to describe the headlines. Please have a look at <a href="../../../o/p/a/Opatowek.html" title="Opatowek">Opatowek</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalisz.html" title="Kalisz">Kalisz</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalisz_County_45af.html" title="Kalisz County">Kalisz County</a><br />
Any ideas?? Any better Wordings?? best regards (<a href="../../../f/u/j/User%7EFujicolor_ffe6.html" title="User:Fujicolor">Fujicolor</a> 00:37, 23 January 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>I have noticed you commonly don't enter an edit summary as you didn't when you edited <a href="../../../%C5%BC/a/r/%C5%BBarnowiec_Nuclear_Power_Plant_cdac.html" title="Żarnowiec Nuclear Power Plant">Żarnowiec Nuclear Power Plant</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%BBarnowiec_Nuclear_Power_Plant&amp;curid=9028983&amp;diff=103283183&amp;oldid=103218047" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%BBarnowiec_Nuclear_Power_Plant&amp;curid=9028983&amp;diff=103283183&amp;oldid=103218047" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>). This causes me problems. When I patrol for vandalism, I use the summary to make a preliminary decision on whether or not the post is a vandal edit or not. If the summary is present (or at least a section header, the part inside the /* */), I commonly decide the edit is legit and move on.</p>
<p>However, if no edit summary is available, I typically resort to loading the diff for the edit. This takes time. For that reason, if your edits are all valid, I ask that you provide edit summaries. For more on how to enter an edit summary, please read <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">Help:Edit summary</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is not just me that appreciate having edit summaries. When you omit your summary, you may be telling various bots that you are vandalizing pages. For this reason, please consider providing that summary. It is very important. You can enter that summary via the edit summary box on edit pages (as shown below).</p>

<p>I know many users think that minor edits don't need summaries. However, you should at least provide a summary that identifies the edit by type (ex: "sp" for spelling changes). Unfortunately, some vandals have noticed that it is very easy and fast to press Tab, Space, and then Enter/Return. Like you edits, they now have the Minor box checked. This is why your edit came up as possible vandalism. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Pittenger_1026.html" title="User:Will Pittenger">Will</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Pittenger_ae67.html" title="User talk:Will Pittenger">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Will_Pittenger_7f0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Will Pittenger">contribs</a>)</small> 03:43, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The stub category indicates which voivodeship they are in, so that gives one an idea of their location.

I do not believe there are strict rules on what should be the minimum number of articles that a category must contain. I certainly have seen plenty of categories on Wikipedia with only one entry. No reason to waste your energy trying to delete them. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 01:30, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Come on, Balcer, please dont be sarcastic. Until they were expelled in 1945, the vast majority of the population of Karlovy Vary regarded themselves as Germans. People in Zurich have never done so, to the best of my knowledge. The people of Vienna (of the whole of Austria) regarded themselves as Germans until some time after World War II. So, for the longest part of their history, they were no more and no less German than their Bavarian neighbours. Yet, I would prefer to tag an article on the History of Vienna (I have not checked if there is such an article) or on Austrian history. But I do not really see a problem there. The tag is on the talk page, not in the article itself. In the debates I have watched so far, nationalism was seldom a problem. But accusing others of being nationalists was.<a href="../../../u/n/o/User%7EUnoffensive_text_or_character_9c05.html" title="User:Unoffensive text or character">Unoffensive text or character</a> 17:14, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The fact that the tag was a mistake or not is irrelevent until a final consensus is reached. It should still be there until a final consensus. It's no different then taking big chunks of an article out then possibly putting it back in. If you leave it in like it should be until a final consensus, then you can always take it out if final consensus says it shouldn't be there. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 02:55, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How would <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elbing%2C_Kansas_ccf5.html" title="Elbing, Kansas">Elbing, Kansas</a> fit into this scheme? <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 20:57, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Upon further consideration, I would be inclined to stick with the current form. That is what German Wikipedia uses (<a href="../../../../de/e/l/b/Elbing.html" class="extiw" title="de:Elbing">de:Elbing</a>). <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:03, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I added mention of the river. The info for <a href="../../../e/l/b/Image%7EElbl%C4%85g_1.JPG_a433.html" title="Image:Elbląg 1.JPG">Image:Elbląg 1.JPG</a> says the picture was taken in <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siedlce.html" title="Siedlce">Siedlce</a>; is that city located on the river? <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 21:14, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nope. I fixed the caption. The picture was taken in Elbląg (I am 99% sure). <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:28, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
