<p>This article is consistently being edited to convey a point of view that extremely large imbalances of trade are either good or not important. This is a POV that deserves representation, but it should not be put forward as the only POV. Contributions to the article, and posts to this talk page, that attempt to broaden the POV into something more balanced have been answered only by edits to advance an apparent agenda, usually attributed to "microeconomists".<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomcool_e27d.html" title="User:Tomcool">Tomcool</a> 18:03, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please learn some basic economics, I'm not an economist, but the following seems quite obvious and clear tome: the money used to pay for imports has to come back to the country of origin(paying for exports) balancing trade in the long term. If the money does not come back as result of exports, the country that issued the currency is even more lucky, they basically got goods for free! As long as the money is outside the country, that money represents a loan to the country of origin with a 0% interest rate! --<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELost.goblin_28b2.html" title="User:Lost.goblin">Lost Goblin</a> 22:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The trade deficit does not need to be ballanced with anything, pure and simple. Lets say that you sell your neighbor Bob accross the street a clay pot you made yourself. You charge him 20 dollars. After the transaction, are you in debt to Bob? If he does not sell you 20 dollars in wicker baskets back to you, do you have to pay him the 20 dollars back again? Do you have a single financial liability to Bob for the transaction?</p>
<p>Now lets say a national borderline is drawn down your street and he lives in another country. You make the exact same transaction, are you now in any more debt to Bob for selling him the object than you were before? Absolutely not. You already exchanged the utility values and there are no outstanding obligations on either party.</p>

<dd>You have not even said exactly what revenue would be lost, and why. --<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELost.goblin_28b2.html" title="User:Lost.goblin">Lost Goblin</a> 08:55, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure this is correct.....</p>
<p>The reason for this is that it is cheaper to buy from other countries where the costs of production are cheaper.</p>
<p>In a country with an advanced economy, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry_Primary_Sector_1670.html" title="Industry/Primary Sector">primary</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry_Secondary_sector_bb02.html" title="Industry/Secondary sector">secondary</a> industries are likely to be depressed, or uncompetitive. Thus they are restricted to niche and specialist goods. <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry_Tertiary_sector_89e9.html" title="Industry/Tertiary sector">Tertiary industry</a> will likely make a lot of money for the country, and specifically employees of such companies. As the general level of wealth in a country rises, the people will demand more and more goods, and these must be imported to satisfy demand. Thus a negative balance of payments can be generated, but is not necessarily indicative of negative economic activity.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>On the Dutch Wikipedia I've written a piece of Balance of Trade as well. (OK, I know that there is no such thing as an acknowledged author on Wikipedia, I just happened to be the guy who wrote that text...)</p>
<p>I like this article, but there is one line that may create an incorrect impression. In the second paragraph under "Economic Impact", it says "essentially allowing the United States to expert pieces of paper and get real goods and services in return". Now, I think that we would agree that those "pieces of paper" are, for instance, US Treasury bonds, Treasury bills, and bonds issued by (in this example) American companies. But they being bonds, this means that (a) there is an obligation to make periodical coupon payments to however hold those bonds, and (b) to redeem the pace value of those bonds at maturity, again, to whoever hold those bonds at the maturity date. And I think we also agree that the them holders of those bonds have no obligation to buy refinancing bonds.</p>
<p>The phrase "pieces of paper" seems to suggest (if only by the use of the word "real" when denoting "goods and services") that they are "not real" obligations, and that the issuers of those bonds can, should they choose to do so, decide to wash their hands of the affair, so to speak, and to renege on their obligations. Now, I would be extremely surprised if this were the view held by, for instance, the US government. (And I need hardly state that the mere suggestion that this would be the official view of the American government would send the financial markets in a turmoil that would make a previous financial crises look like a Sunday barbecue!)</p>
<p>I would suggest that whoever looks after this page reconsider this phrase.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to duscussions on this issue on my user page on the Dutch Wikipedia, or on another convenient location. My username is MartinD.</p>
<p>Regards, Martin</p>
<p>Hey, is anybody ever going to reply to what I wrote here? if not, I'm going to edit it myself.</p>
<p>Regards, Martin</p>
<p>Hi Martin</p>
<p>I think what the original author was trying to say is that paper is a monetary item whereas goods and services are created in the real sector. I agree with you that someone unfamiliar with this economics-speak might interpret the sentence as you describe. It should be changed. <a href="../../../m/y/d/User%7EMydogategodshat_753f.html" title="User:Mydogategodshat">mydogategodshat</a> 16:51, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you. Calling these instruments "cheaply produced paper" is facile. What they are are promissary notes to service debt. Promises made by the current generation that it and future generations will have to honor. When almost all "cheaply bought goods" are rusting in landfills, people will be servicing these debts.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomcool_e27d.html" title="User:Tomcool">Tomcool</a> 21:40, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Mydogategodshat,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. My point simply was that it would be undesirable if people outside of the USA would think that it might be official US policy to default on T-bonds... The phrase "pieces of paper" sounded rather misleading. Regards, Martin</p>
<p>Cheap pieces of paper for goods usually refers to the storage phenomenon, as in China; where the government accumulates the money from exports. If they were to permanently store the money and not send it back into the global market then America would indeed be trading paper for goods.</p>
<p>Reader observation:</p>
<p>What does "Neither is necessarily dangerous in modern economies" mean? Having just read this article this doesn't seem to convey anything meaningful (to me at least). Dangerous to who? The importer or exporter? The world economy? Shared holders? In what, sense not dangerous? What is a 'modern' economy? A contemporary one? A first world one? The phrasing of this article sounds like it's written from the one position rather than setting out and contrasting alternative perspectives. (Though not being an economist I can't tell what.)</p>

<p>Since the Wikipedia entitled "Reserve currency" is rather scant, and since the section of this article under the title "Economic Impact of Balance of Trades" deals nicely with the issue, I think that the relevant parts of that section's text should be moved over to "Reserve currency". Then the "Economic Impact.." section could simply link to that article. Any objections? Archie Paulson 01:00, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>M&amp;Ms</b> here: Im not one to argue over whether an economist considers himself macro or micro but i think with regards this article the opening of the paragraph "Myths" should begin with "Macroeconomists..." and not Micro economists. Also the bulk of Friedmans work has been to address issues at the Macro level of economic enquiry.</p>
<p>The conflict is between those who believe that the state is the salient unit of economics (macro-economic thinking) and those who believe it is firms and individuals (micro-economic thinking). Friedman exists in a strange middle, he believes in the ultimate primacy of micro units but also supports state intervention through monetary policy.</p>

<p>This article is being slanted toward theories that trade imbalances are neutral or good. Any statement to the otherwise is being modified. We should 1) describe what a trade balance is; 2) explain the mechanics of how a country responds to positive and negative trade balances; 3) outline theories about whether these responses has positive, neutral or negative impacts on economic growth, employment, investment, and so on. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_%281980%E2%80%931988%29_6bb5.html#Deficit_spending.2C_the_dollar.2C_and_trade" title="History of the United States (1980â€“1988)">History_of_the_United_States_(1980â€“1988)#Deficit spending, the dollar, and trade</a> has a much more balanced discussion of the economic impacts of government overspending and trade balance. If the contributors of that article can strike an encyclopedic balance, we should be able to in this article. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomcool_e27d.html" title="User:Tomcool">Tomcool</a> 21:40, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article mentions the EPI study that 1.5 million jobs have been lost to China as a result of the trade deficit. However, this particular study makes unverifiable assumptions -- such as imports equate to lost jobs and exports equate to gained jobs. These assumptions are not agreed upon by all economists and I think the report should not be presented as fact (as it seems to be now), and instead it should be presented as a point of view.</p>
<p>I think this problem can be resolved by adding in the proviso "all else equal": As in, "The relationship between trade deficits in manufactured goods and manufacturing employment seems obvious: imports decrease labor demand in manufacturing while exports spur this demand. A rising trade deficit means, all else equal, that labor demand in U.S. manufacturing is reduced." <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp171" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp171" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>I'll admit that I'm not much of an econmist and don't understand all the ins and outs, but I must say that I feel this page doesn't have a high informational density. I understand that an issue that is so political is also fought over and needs a lot of discussion. But right now you have about 5 lines about what a trade deficit is and after that in essence 2 different portrails over "good" or "evil" of trade deficits. Especially the second chapter is in essence a rehash of one economic scientist. I feel that as controversial as the subject might be, that is really poor for an article. What sort of questions would I see answered in such an article? - What is a trade deficit? Ok, that is answered - though in a very rough way. - How is it exactly calculated? - On which basis is this data accumulated? Based on tax declaration of companies? - How has the subject been used in politics? One doesn't have to draw a conclusion but instead just portray how it has been used. - Why don't you just write one section which discusses the fact that modern economic research doesn't agree on one or the other in one section? - What is the meaning of it? What are the modern interpretations? This is probably the most controversial thing but I don't feel the different interperatations have been shown very well. --84.63.110.18 22:54, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"Most economists do not believe that trade deficits are inherently good or bad; some even believe they should be ignored entirely"</i></p>
<p>charged statement under "dissenting opinion about trade deficits" that also lacks citations. violates NPOV. perhaps "most" should be changed to "some"? one example of the NPOV violation, I'm sure there are others. <a href="../../../p/m/o/User%7EPmoney_7224.html" title="User:Pmoney">PMoney</a> 09:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are tons of information on trade deficit, but what about trade surpluses? Can someone who know more about this issue please add a section to this page? Especially since there's a "America's trade deficit" section I think it would improve the overall NPOV to have a counter example, ie: "China's trade surplus".
