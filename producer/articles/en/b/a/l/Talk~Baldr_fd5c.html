<dd>How did you announce this proposal to carve out an exception to the "use the most common name in English" rule and the "least surprise" principle and start "standardizing on 13th century Old Icelandic"? Had I known, I would have had a comment. Let me say it here: I strongly object. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 18:06, 2005 September 8 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Object to what? I have never suggested anything but the most common English name. Baldr was an exception, chosen as a neutral compromise, because not even back then could it be established whether Balder or Baldur was the most common form. I am personally glad that we're having a vote on this, and had I believed that this matter was so controversial I would indeed have posted it at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 18:12, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Objected to the proposed naming convention. I agree with the one objection that was lodged there, that if an English version of the name exists, it should be primary over other versions on the English wikipedia. I think that should be incorporated into that proposed convention. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 18:55, 2005 September 8 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If it only were that simple this would be much easier. But, sadly, there's almost never "an English version" as opposed to "other versions". There are usually several different versions used in English. In this case, for example, there are three - and different readers are familiar with different versions. Take this comment by Sjc from the standard discussion page: "Certainly my understanding of the correct English spelling of Baldur was, er, Baldur." In many cases the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_orthography_e985.html" title="Old Norse orthography">anglicized</a> forms are basically obsolete, having been used in some 19th century translations and then dropped. Take 'Loke', for example. That's an anglicized form. Would you prefer that to the standardized Old Norse form 'Loki'? Probably not, since it's not much used any more. The problem is that trying to determine in each case what happens to be the most common current use in English for an Old Norse name would be very difficult. And we would end up with a very confusing collection of article names where different names use different conventions of anglicizing Old Norse (in fact this is what we currently have but are slowly trying to fix). Standardizing on the Old Norse form is a good solution and reflects current academic usage, with its connotations of accuracy. In the case of Baldr it also reflects modern translations intended for the general English speaking public. Take even Brodeur's translation, which is from the early 20th century and available online:</dd>

<dd>I didn't mean to imply that there is a consensus on <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a> and <a href="../../../z/%C3%BC/r/Z%C3%BCrich.html" title="Zürich">Zürich</a>. The second of those names, at least, is quite controversial. Currently a poll on names like those two is running at 49 to 37 in favor of keeping the diacritics. Certainly not a consensus in favor - but it does show that many of us do not agree with you as to what the clear policy is. To reiterate, the principle of the most common English spelling is not applied naively and mechanically on Wikipedia. As for <i>Baldr</i> I think the most common English spelling in translations of the primary sources (both popular and scholarly translations), as well as the most common English spelling in reference works and academic discussion, is <i>Baldr</i>. The most common English spelling in popular retellings of the myths may well be <i>Balder</i> and I'll even concede the possibility that that anglicized form may be familiar to more people than the original spelling. I don't think it's overwhelmingly more common, though. But even a person who's only familiar with the form <i>Balder</i> will have no trouble at all finding the Wikipedia article under the more pedantically correct title&#160;:) I can understand your point of view and I think it is valid, we just assign different weights to the different aspects of the issue. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 09:38, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Baldr</b> is the Old Norse name of this god. <i>Balder</i> is an old attempt to <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_orthography_e985.html" title="Old Norse orthography">anglicize</a> the name but I don't think you'll find that form in recent translations, like Faulkes' translation of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prose_Edda_7b3a.html" title="Prose Edda">Prose Edda</a> or Larrington's translation of the <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetic_Edda_dde2.html" title="Poetic Edda">Poetic Edda</a>, both of which are intended for the general public rather than scholars. Older translations, like Brodeur's and Young's also have <i>Baldr</i> as far as I remember. I think you may have to go back to 19th century translations to find <i>Balder</i> and even there Thorpe's translation uses the Old Norse name. Currently ("Baldur's gate" etc.) the Modern Icelandic form seems to enjoy popularity in English but I don't think we should use that either. The form <i>Balder</i> may enjoy some currency in modern (and usually inaccurate or inventive) retellings of the myths but I don't think it's appropriate for an encyclopedia. In any case I'd prefer to discuss the issue of Old Norse names as a whole rather than in individual cases. I would welcome all comments at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Old_Norse_Old_Icelandic_Old_English%29_e1f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Old Norse/Old Icelandic/Old English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Old Norse/Old Icelandic/Old English)</a>. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 08:16, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, on the other hand the convention permits individual standards such as <b>Thor</b> and <b>Odin</b>, and if someone suggests that a conventional form exists, such as Dreamguy does, the convention is that it should be discussed here. I renamed this article Baldr as a compromise between Baldur('s gate) and Balder.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 08:24, 7 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're right, of course. We could add 'Balder' to our short list of exceptions. Above I have argued why I think we should not do that. I think that the anglicizations 'Thor' and 'Odin' are far more familiar than 'Balder' and that 'Baldr' is the most common form used in English Edda translations. We already have a redirect from <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balder.html" title="Balder">Balder</a> and mention that form in the article as an anglicization so no-one starting with that form will have trouble finding the article. I'd also like to encourage anyone who wants to comment on this to read through the whole <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Old_Norse_Old_Icelandic_Old_English%29_e1f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Old Norse/Old Icelandic/Old English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Old Norse/Old Icelandic/Old English)</a> discussion.

<li><b>Balder</b> is the traditional English name. I think we should stay with that.

<li><b>Baldr</b>, since there is no standard Anglicization; and frankly, because I disapprove of the practice to Anglicize proper nouns. <i>Baldr</i> cannot possibly seem more alien to the Anglophone eye than Aztec deities such as <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quetzalcoatl.html" title="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a> or <a href="../../../h/u/i/Huitzilopochtli.html" title="Huitzilopochtli">Huitzilopochtli</a>.

<dd>FWIW, Odysseus is the more commonly used version in English, and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules.html" title="Hercules">Hercules</a> is its own article about Hercules, so these arguments don't apply. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 20:45, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't put much stock in Google tests. I think that in most cases relevant published books are more useful for determining the popularity of name variants. But since GT's are so quick and easy to do I thought I'd whip one up, just for fun. First I tried searching English pages for all three of our candidate names for this article.</p>
<ul>
<li>2,850,000 English pages for baldur</li>
<li>381,000 English pages for balder</li>
<li>42,900 English pages for baldr</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is more or less meaningless. Baldur is a reasonably common name and many or most of the above pages probably don't refer to the god directly. To try to limit the results to pages actually dealing with the mythological Baldr I searched for another name from the Baldr myth along with the variants. I chose <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draupnir.html" title="Draupnir">Draupnir</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forseti.html" title="Forseti">Forseti</a> because those are not excessively burdened with different anglicizations (though Draupner and Forsete are found). Searching for, say, Bald(u/e/Ø)r and Höðr is more complicated because there are many different anglicizations of Höðr in use.</p>
<p>This is what I got.</p>
<ul>
<li>1,830 English pages for baldur forseti</li>
<li>1,020 English pages for baldr forseti</li>
<li>796 English pages for balder forseti</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>891 English pages for balder draupnir</li>
<li>876 English pages for baldur draupnir</li>
<li>615 English pages for baldr draupnir</li>
</ul>
<p>This is far from conclusive, especially since the sample is so small. In my interpretation it does not support the theory that Balder is</p>
<ul>
<li>the* familiar form to English speakers, as 'Thor' and 'Odin' are.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd much prefer to stay with the original name. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 14:53, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The search for Baldur by itself gets the name of the very well known game but it isn't relevant for the mythology article. Your atempts to add a search along with your own prefered spellings for lesser known other names of course brings up more hits on the corresponding spelling variation you are hoping to find. Let's make this simple:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's a comparison of the name with a term it goes with for matching purposes which the spelling is not under dispute:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Balder Norse: 50,600</b></dd>
<dd><b>Baldur Norse: 30,100</b></dd>
<dd><b>Baldr Norse: 19,900</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then we can search for the name with an item from the myth that is vital to the telling of the myth:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Balder mistletoe: 19,400</b></dd>
<dd><b>Baldr mistletoe: 1,410</b> (and note that many of these hits are Wikipedia and its mirrors)</dd>
<dd><b>Baldur mistletoe: 913</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's pretty clear cut... get rid of the video game and do a general search and Balder is far and away the most common use for the mythological character. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 18:26, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's clear cut. And what do you mean with my "own prefered spellings for lesser known other names"? Forseti is Baldr's son. Draupnir is the ring exchanged by Odin and Baldr in the myth of Baldr's death. Worthwhile sources on Baldr are not unlikely to mention those two names as well - and I don't see anyone arguing for spellings like 'Forsete' and 'Loke'. I tried some more Google searches:</dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>11,900 English pages for baldr "old norse"</li>
<li>9,300 English pages for balder "old norse"</li>
<li>1,670 English pages for baldur "old norse"</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>40,600 English pages for balder loki</li>
<li>28,300 English pages for baldur loki</li>
<li>19,300 English pages for baldr loki</li>
