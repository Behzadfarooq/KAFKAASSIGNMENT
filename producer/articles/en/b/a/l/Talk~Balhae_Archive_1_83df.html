<p>The complete official name of Bohai's 3rd king, Wen Wang, is mentioned in the tombstone inscription of the <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mausoleum_of_Princess_Zhenxiao_60f0.html" title="Mausoleum of Princess Zhenxiao">Mausoleum of Princess Zhenxiao</a>, which reads <b>Great King Daxing Baoli Xiaoganjinlunshengfa</b> (大興寶曆孝感金輪聖法大王). The first two characters may not be a part of the official name proper, because it is the <a href="../../../e/r/a/Era_name.html" title="Era name">era name</a> that Wen Wang used twice. The next two may not be either, since they mean "Treasured Calendar". The last four characters, Jinlunshengfa, meaning "Golden Wheel and Holy Law", sounds <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>. Are the Bohainese royalties Buddhists? If so, we could add that to the article.</p>
<p>But this complete name does not have any character for "Wen" (文) at all. So maybe this is not the full version of the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posthumous_name.html" title="Posthumous name">posthumous name</a>? Maybe this is something else, a Buddhist honorary title used on the tombstone of his daughter to bless her on her way to the Western Paradise?</p>

<dl>
<dd>至景哀王時契丹攻滅之以爲東丹國</dd>
</dl>
<p>景哀王 doesn't mean King Ae and King Kyong but King Aekyong of Silla. This mistake first appeared on Gaikoshiko in 1910. It was corrected by Jin Yufu. As far as I know, almost all documents except for some Korean ones avoid using this wrong title today. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 02:30, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Which Korean documents, if you would please?</p>
<p>I don't believe you speak a word of Korean.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nanshu: for all your Japanese-supremacy (which can be kinda cute sometimes), this is a little far-fetched. Don't just dump a whole bunch of characters and argue your point. You have such vague sources and yet make such sweeping generalizations about Korean and Chinese points of view it's sad.</p>
<p>I'll say it again: it's sad.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genealogy of the royal family</span></h2>
<p>On the genealogy of the royal family, Korean scholars as always start their arguments with the conclusion: Da Zuorong was Korean! This is based on the assumption that Goguryeo was a Korean state, but it's not the topic here.</p>
<p>To support their claim, they pick up 舊唐書. It says: "渤海靺鞨大祚榮者, 本高麗別種也." Maybe this suffices for them. They don't pay careful attention to the phrases: 渤海<u>靺鞨</u>大祚榮 and 高麗<u>別種</u>. They don't wonder why it don't use a more common sentence, say, "渤海靺鞨大祚榮, 高麗人."</p>
<p>新唐書 says, "渤海, 本粟末靺鞨附高麗者, 姓大氏." This is an unfavorable statement for them, so they try to negate 新唐書. They claim that 新唐書 fabricated the statement and they speculate on the reasons.</p>
<p>Hey, get rid of any preconceived ideas! Analyze historical sources objectively. Then you would notice that 舊唐書 doesn't necessarily contradict with 新唐書. 新唐書 is right and you can see why the original author of 舊唐書 selected the word 別種. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 02:30, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where are you getting this from? I hope you're not getting this from some bogus Imperial-Japanese anti-Korean, anti-Chinese website of yours.</p>
<p>Besides, may i ask if you're an expert in interpreting ancient Chinese manuscripts for their original subtleties?</p>
<p><br />
Malgal, or "Mohe," refers to people outside of cities in Northern Korea and Manchuria, regardless of ethnic group or tribe; needless to say, the term can refer to a Goguryeo Korean villager or a Sukshin(肅愼) herder. However, it does not refer to a Chinese han, because they were not present in Manchuria during this time period. In relationship to the New Tang Records, Dae Joyeong is stated as a Malgal man with connections to the Goguryeo kingdom; additionally, the Old Tang Records state that Dae Joyeong is of the Goguryeo kind. This means that Dae Joyeong, the founder of the Balhae Dynasty, is Korean --or at least of the ethnic stock which created the Koreans we know to-day. Even if this conclusion is false, it does not make Dae-Joyeong ethnic Han Chinese.--Solert 5:30, 18 Feb 2005 (EST)</p>
<p>The Malgal tribes were allies of Goguryo(고구려). Dae Geol Jungsang(대걸중상) was a general of Goguryo before it fell, and this can be seen in most accurate records. That probably means that he lived in Goguryo. The fact that the Tang recorded in their little books that Dae Joyeong was a Malgal cant exactly be trusted. Why? The Tang probably did not have any reason to write down anything good about a person from Goguryo. Would the USA historians write that Saddam Hussein was a genius?? or Osama Bin Laden was a savior?? HELL NO! so y would anyone assume that what the Tang wrote down is true at all?? The Tang were stuck-up, arrogant and extremely proud ppl dat thought dat they were the center of the universe jus like their equally proud and arrogant ancestors. AND that any nation beyond their borders or walls were barbarians. The historians probably werent even sure themselves. They just saw him as an inferior barbarian. Just another one of dem Dongyi. Dats jus me thinkin. There is one thing dat i agree wit da Tang about. Dae Joyeong was certainly from Goguryo. BUT i dont believe dat he was a malgal. If solid evidence ever pops up, then i'll believe it. and there probably is a 50-50 chance that he was of the Malgal. nobody knows. U can definately cross out Han Chinese. i dont think any fancy, proud Chinese guy woulda had da balls to cross da "Wall of Non barbarianism." Honestly... Does anyone else think dat?? I'm a Bak. i kno for a fact dat i'm Korean. It realli hurts me sometimes to read dis stuff. There's always one Jack ass in every one of these discussions dat r too proud to see da truth. Too proud to realize dat da Korean ppl should not b fucked with. anybody agree? ---Joe Park 10:40, 29 July 2006 (EST)</p>
<p>Huh? I agree that Mohe did not refer to a single (ethnic) group but was a collective term for several tribes in Manchuria. But I don't think Mohe included Goguryeo people. Can you bring from historical sources any examples of Mohe referring to Goguryeo people? And no one claims he was Chinese. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 14:40, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nanshu, your interpretation of the chinese characters in these old records is based on modern defintions, you cannot conclude many things you have said. If you did read your Old Tang and New Tang records well, you would realise that the Old Tang Record focuses on the ethnicity of the royal family of Kingdoms --when it states them-- and that the New Tang Record focuses on the ethnicity of the people of the Kingdom. Don't make me pull out the 松漠記聞(Songmakgimun) as what it says about the ethnic lineage of the Jurchen Jin Dynasty. <font color="red">Bezant</font></p>

</dl>
<p>Funny, that, Nanshu. Comming from <b>you!</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Okay, first of all, most Korean scholars do not dismiss what the new Tang Records say.</p>
<p>Hey! That's not what I asked you to answer. I asked you how to interpret "渤海, 本粟末靺鞨附高麗者, 姓大氏."? My humble translation is "[The] Bohai [royal family] is originally the Sumo Mohe who has been under Goryeo [Goguryeo], and is surnamed Da." In Classical Chinese (or pre-modern) usage, a state is often synonymous with its monarch. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 15:13, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My interpretation is: "The Balhae royal family is from Sokmalmalgal (which is an area, not a tribe) {Quoting the 東亞漢韓大辭典, p. 1163: " [粟末 속말] . . . 2) 部落 이름. 靺鞨七部의 하나. 옛날 松花江 유역에 살던 粟靺靺鞨의 部落. 후에 勃海國을 세움.] This source, at least, appears to assert that the Sokmalmalgal are a tribe, one of seven tribes of the Malgal who lived along the Sungari River and were involved in the foundation of the Kingdom of Parhae.}--<a href="../../../e/d/4/User%7EEd4linda_9741.html" title="User:Ed4linda">Doc Rock</a> 19:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC) was from the realm of Goguryeo and surnamed Dae." One should note that the New Tang Records classify royal families geographically and the Old Tang Records classify the royal families by the culture of the royal family; so, in this case you are the one <i>ignoring</i> the Old Tang Records and what it has to say. Also, the "Dae" family clan only exists Korea. The family clan can be traced back to last Balhae king. And no my interpretation is not "seemingly weird," you are just too biased and arrogant. I've never seen you discuss in the Diaoyu islands discussion --perhaps you believe these islands are historically and fundamentally Japanese? Oh, and furthermore, you've seemed to "shut up" after you've been corrected rather harshly on every discussion.--Zippie</p>
<p>Wat da fuck is Bohai?? Its Balhae or Parhae u motha fucka... damn.. who da hell is dat fag dat keep callin it Bohai? y da fuck did dem Chinese mofos take Korean empires and give dem some fucked up names like dis?? 아이씨.. 그 노모 짱개 새끼들. 짱개든 쪽발이든... 다 똑같헤. 에이.. 짱개 시발놈들!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">korean v. chinese, again</span></h2>
<p>Balhae was a Korean kingdom whose culture and political structure was transplanted from a Goguryeo. The founder and ruling structure considered their culture korean, any question about additional ethnic makeup of Balhae is specious. Tungusic and other elements that were absorbed into Balhae as a result of expansion is analagous to immigration in modern US. A thousand years from now, it would be ridiculous to argue that the United States was an Asian nation due to its ethic makeup and culture having Chinese, Indian and Latin elements. If this was a Chinese language Wiki that would be one thing, but referring to this article as covering "Bohai" would be innappropriate as Balhae is identified as successor to Goguryeo in basically every Korean history text in the US, including Eckert's "Modren History of Korea" and Wagner's "Korea Old and New" and clearly refer to these people as Korean. I know I'm not sourceable, but for the sake of just plain common sense, note that when I was taking East Asian history classes in college Balhae was presented without reservation as a Korean state as much as Shilla or Joseon. I'm a little surprised by the controversy here on this board since even notable China scholars like Peter Bol considered Balhae as Korea a non issue. I realize that the discussion here is probably a reaction to elements from China but keep in mind that this is an English language Wiki. Classification of articles really needs to be on the standards of conventional Western scholarship. -K</p>

<dd><b>Parhae</b>: State established in the 8th century AD in northern Manchuria and northern Korea. Chinese Pohai. Founded by a former Korean general, Tae Cho-yang, it was considered a successor state to Koguryo, which had occupied much of the same territory before its conquest by Silla in 668. Like Silla, Parhae was a tributary state of Tang-dynasty China. It traded with the nomadic tribes of the north and with China and Japan. Parhae was conquered in 926 by the Khitan tribes almost 20 years after their creation of the Liao dynasty on China's northern borders.<a href="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9374564" class="external autonumber" title="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9374564" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>Original research in this context means untested theories: data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication, or <b>any new interpretation,</b> analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts or ideas that, in the words of Wikipedia's founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation".</p>
<p>We report what <b>other reliable secondary sources have published,</b> whether or not we regard the material as accurate.</p>
<p>If you have an idea that you think should become part of the corpus of knowledge that is Wikipedia, the best approach is to arrange to have your results published in a peer-reviewed journal or reputable news outlet, and then document your work in an appropriately non-partisan manner.</p>
<p>What counts as a reputable publication?</p>
<p><b>Reputable publications include peer-reviewed journals, books published by a known academic publishing house or university press, and divisions of a general publisher which have a good reputation for scholarly publications.</b></p>
<p>From Jim Wales memo&#160;: An article that makes no new low-level claims, but nonetheless synthesizes work in a non-standard way, is effectively original research that I think we ought not to publish. This comes up most often in history, where there is a tendency by some Wikipedians to produce novel narratives and <b>historical interpretations with citation to primary sources</b> to back up their interpretation of events. Even if their citations are accurate, <b>Wikipedia's poorly equipped to judge whether their particular synthesis of the available information is a reasonable one.</b> ... I think in part this is just a symptom of an unfortunate tendency of disrespect for history as a professional discipline. Some who completely understand why Wikipedia ought not create novel theories of physics by citing the results of experiments and so on and synthesizing them into something new, may fail to see how the same thing applies to history</p>
<p>Like most Wikipedia policies, No original research applies to articles, not to talk pages or project pages, although it is regarded as poor taste to discuss personal theories on talk pages.</p>

<dd>That applies to citing primary materials <i>to back up their interpretation of events</i>. Your interpretation appears to include simply relating the events as interpreted by the primary materials, which is different. An example that I'd think of is:
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi_Ji_8ba6.html" title="Shi Ji">Shi Ji</a> claimed that the <a href="../../../x/i/o/Xiongnu.html" title="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> were descended from <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xia_Dynasty_8d04.html" title="Xia Dynasty">Xia Dynasty</a>.

(citation to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi_Ji_8ba6.html" title="Shi Ji">Shi Ji</a>) (Original research, under this definition; I have some quibbles with Jimbo's definition in this regard, but this is how his definition should be interpreted.)</dd>

<dd>Note how he also was discourging "Wikipedias [from] produc[ing] novel narratives." Further, he started off with, "An article that makes no new low-level claims, but nonetheless synthesizes work in a non-standard way, is effectively original research that I think we ought not to publish." This appears to imply that if the theory is not novel, then it's not covered by <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 18:27, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i have no problem with the statement "x claims y" when y is verifiable. but when a wikipedian cites to primary source document x hundreds or thousands of years old in a different language, it is likely to be subject to an "interpretation" rather than a direct translation. so in actuality, "x claims y" turns out to be wikipedian z interpreting x as claiming y^1, because y cannot be accurately, directly translated into modern english without some interpretive gloss. to avoid this whole mess, i think jimbo is saying that when an article says "x claims y," it should be based on "reputable publisher or scholar z interprets x as claiming y^2," in general, but especially in controversial interpretations.

<p>Why exactly was this article moved to Balhae? Bohai is the more commonly used name.

<p>Thank u Appleby.. i agree wit u all da way. Balhae was definately Korean. A HUGE piece of evidence is da fact dat da only ppl wit da Clan name of Dae or Tae live in Korea. And another thing. If Balhae was truly CHinese, then y did Taejo Wang-Gon of Goryeo accept the survivors of Balhae into his own kingdom?? Wang-Gon accepted them cuz they also had the blood of Goguryo flowin thru their veins. ya heard?</p>
<p>Yes, as Appleby stated, "Bohai" is NOT a commonly used name for Kingdom of Balhae. Bohai is more commonly referred "Bohai Sea" or variation on Korean name "Balhae". Many other encyclopedic websites and encyclopedias, including AsianInfo.org, Classroom of the Future, Reference.com, Columbia Encyclopedia, Britannica Encyclopedia, Answers.com, and countless more uses the name "Balhae" (or variations thereof) and lists Bohai as the Chinese variation of the name or Bohai Sea. Also, Balhae is featured prominently in "History of Korea" category and article. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 01:14, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In that case, I stand corrected.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed move (back)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Scope: Bohai-related articles (and by extension Fuyu, Yilou, Wuje and Mohe)</li>
<li>Suggestions:
<ol>
<li>use Hanyu Pinyin for article titles and contents
<ol>
<li>use personal names (instead of posthumous names) for article titles of Bohai kings</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>use langbox that lists Chinese reading first and Korean reading next (and Russian Cyrillic letters if you wish).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Just a reminder to those who are unfamiliar with Bohai. All the primary sources of Bohai were written in Classical Chinese (maybe some Japanese sources were partly written in kana, but I'm not sure). The research on Bohai is a combination of the analysis of Classical Chinese documents and archaeological achievements from China (Manchuria) and Russia (Primorye). Classical Chinese is composed of Chinese characters and how to read Chinese characters is left to readers. Chinese use Mandarin reading (Bohai), or readings in Cantonese and other dialects. Koreans use Modern Korean reading (Parhae) and Japanese use Japanese reading (Bokkai). Note that none of them are the pronunciation by the Bohai people. I guess the Bohai reading was close to Middle Chinese, but it is not clear due to lack of linguistic sources. So both Pinyin and Korean transcriptions are just symbols used for the sake of convenience.</li>
<li>Appleby seems a worshipper of Britannica, but actually, Britannica and other English sources are not authoritative for this field because, as far as I know, there is no comprehensive work on Bohai in English. For example, look at "Central Asiatic Journal." It covers Turkestan, Mongolia and Tibet but deals with Manchuria only after the Manchus appeared in history. As for German, <i>Bohai: Geschichte und Kultur eines mandschurisch-koreanischen Königreiches der Tang-Zeit</i> by Johannes Reckel (1995) seemingly offers in-depth information, but no good English book is known. The poor quality of Britannica's article, which looks like having been written a century ago, demonstrates it.</li>
<li>So examine what are really authoritative and we will see Chinese reading is much commoner.
<ol>
<li>China. Let us examine Chinese papers first. Whether you like it or not, you have to check Chinese reports if you are interested in Bohai archaeology. They are almost always written in Chinese but prominent journals provide English titles, and sometimes English abstracts. I checked them and found out that they always use Chinese romanization (e.g. Li Jiancai 李健才, <i>Remarks on the Original Capital of Bohai</i> 渤海初期都城考, Northern Cultural Relics 北方文物 No. 3 2002).</li>
<li>Russia. I admit I don't understand Russian but I can read Cyrillic alphabet since I'm learning Mongolian. As far as I know (I checked references in Chinese and Japanese papers), Russians always use a Mandarin-based Cyrillic spelling system. And the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" uses "Pohai" too. I guess that the original Russian article was Бохай and that the English version adopted Wade-Giles according to its transliteration policy: "proper names so familiar in English that to transliterate them otherwise would mislead the user."</li>
<li>Japan. Although no portion of Bohai's territory belongs to Japan today, Japan did pioneer works for research on Bohai and still make considerable contribution. And Japanese sources such as <i>Shoku Nihongi</i> 続日本紀, <i>Shoku Nihon Koki</i> 続日本後紀 and <i>Ruiju Kokushi</i> 類聚国史 are absolutely essential. So I examined English titles of Japanese papers. Journals for overall history including "Shigaku=Zasshi" 史学雑誌 and "Shien" 史淵 use Chinese romanization (Bohai or P'o-hai). One exception is "The Toyo Gakuho" (東洋学報), which used Palhae. As for journals for Korean history, "Chosen Gakuho" 朝鮮学報 (Journal of the Academic Association of Koreanology in Japan) and "Chosen Bunka Kenkyu" 朝鮮文化研究 (Korean Culture) also use "Bohai", and "Nenpo Chosengaku" 年報朝鮮学 (Annual Review of Korean Studies) uses Chinese romanization first (Bohai/Parhae). Only "Chosenshi Kenkyukai Ronbunshu" 朝鮮史研究会論文集 (Bulletin of Society for Study in Korean History) uses Korean romanization (Parhae or Palhae). As for archaeology, Tamura Koichi 田村晃一's "Higashi Ajia no tojo to Bokkai" gives the English title, "The capital castles of East Asia and Bohai".</li>
<li>I can conclude that researchers except for Koreans and their sympathizers use Chinese romanization.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A large portion of Bohai's territory belongs to the People's Republic of China today, including four of the five capitals. The name of Bohai originated in "Prince/King of the Bohai commandery" 渤海郡王, the title given by Tang China to the founder Da Zuorong. The Bohai commandery was set up in a coastal area of Hebei Province during the Han Dynasty and thus shares the root with Bohai Bay and Bohai Sea.</li>
<li>For article titles of Bohai kings, we should use personal names instead of posthumous names. Only nine of the 15 kings had posthumous names known today. Although monarchs usually called by posthumous name by the subject, we cannot follow this practice because, unfortunately, Bohai people did not leave their own records except for some epitaphs.</li>

<p>i'm just not sure why we need to do this convoluted analysis and original research of foreign language sources, when wikipedia is an english language encyclopedia and its policy is to use common english names and to rely on reputable unbiased sources. i think the citations i linked to above show that balhae is the common english spelling in english reference works, because they discuss balhae as a part of korean history. (early japanese historical terms are not romanized from chinese even when source texts are in chinese). everything else seems either inconsistent with wp policy or pales in comparison to the weight of authority. Appleby 17:47, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just wondering, but exactly which of your reference sources states Balhae as a Korean state? None of your source say so, they all merely say that it was founded by a former Koguryo general. And those same sources you cited call it a multi-ethnic state with Tungusic populations, yet you deleted all my mentions of it by me and <a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKamosuke_db5a.html" title="User:Kamosuke">user:Kamosuke</a> <b>despite this being from the very same sources you quoted</b>. For example, when the very same Britannica was cited as the source for its mixed ethnic composition, you deleted it without explanation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=37222676" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=37222676" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></dd>

Of the references to Japanese views, none of the actually reference any Japanese sources, but rather, a Korean one and a non-academic language page run by non-Japanese. According to actual Japanese historical records, it seemed to have regarded Balhae as a vassal state and accepted tribute from the kingdom. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;vid=ISBN0824815904&amp;id=H0TAO98c9acC&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;pg=PA230&amp;sig=ZIPeyfadNj9Bvd6rERKDyd_qDeQ" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;vid=ISBN0824815904&amp;id=H0TAO98c9acC&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;pg=PA230&amp;sig=ZIPeyfadNj9Bvd6rERKDyd_qDeQ" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></dd>

<dd>Then there's mass deletion of sources, and those western sources that did get kept not supporting the argument of it being a Korean kingdom are somehow reclassified as Chinese sources.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=37068335&amp;oldid=37067907" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=37068335&amp;oldid=37067907" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. When presenting sources showing western scholars considering the founder's ethnicity in dispute, you deleted all the sources and replaced it with a sentence that says "but some Chinese scholars dispute this."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=37048242&amp;oldid=37039598" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=37048242&amp;oldid=37039598" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></dd>

<li>Balhae consisted of (supposed) Koreans ruling over a mostly non-Korean population, therefore it's an exclusively Korean state.</li>
<li>Wiman Joseon consisted of non-Koreans ruling over a mostly (supposed) Korean population, therefore it's an exclusively Korean state.</li>
<li>The majority of Wiman Joseon's territory falls mostly within the borders of modern-day Korea, therefore it's exclusively Korean history.</li>
<li>The majority of Balhae's territory falls mostly outside of the borders of modern-day Korea, therefore it too is exclusively Korean history.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In addition, I'm also seeing the following:
<ul>
<li>Using the fact that one romanization is more popular than the other as actual justification for <b>deletions</b> of Chinese names despite their usage in most well-known academic sources. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=39509579&amp;oldid=39508860" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=39509579&amp;oldid=39508860" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.</li>
<li>Of course, when a non-Korean (and internationally accepted name) is more popular, you revert the removal of the Korean one [Sea of Japan].</li>
<li>And in articles like <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yalu_River_23dc.html" title="Yalu River">Yalu River</a>, no subsequent deletions of the almost unknown Korean names despite similar removals of Chinese names in other similar articles.</li>

<p>Wiman may have been a general under a dynasty of China, but he was of the Ye-Maek, AKA Dongyi. Da only reason King Jun of Gojoseon accepted Wiman and his followers was because they were of the same race or whatever u would call dat. Gojoseon was of Ye-Maek, and so was Wiman. Its jus like Yi Ja-Chun, the father of Yi Songgye. Yi Ja-Chun was a general under the Yuan, but he was ethnically Korean. wat now, BITCH!</p>

Sadly, I have yet to see a prominent english encyclopedia that uses the name Bohai instead of Balhae (or variations thereof). Only Chinese sources use the nomenclature "Bohai" instead of "Balhae", and prominent English encyclopedias (see the sources on the article) use the name "Balhae" (or Romanized variations thereof, including Parhae, Barhae, etc.).

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Russian names in langbox</span></h3>
<p>How should we handle a Russian name in Bohai langbox? As I explained above, A Russian name is the transliteration of modern Chinese. And the Great Soviet Encyclopedia suggests they use Chinese romanization when translating from Russian. So a Russian name is a "Chinese" name in one sense. We can include it in langbox as a spelling of the Chinese name or as the separate entry, "Russian name." In either case, a Russian name should be put next to a Chinese name for users' better understanding, I think.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Balhae (or Bohai in Chinese) was a Korean kingdom</span></h2>
<p>If the article itself acknowledges that the ethnic makeup of the kingdom was in dispute, that Da Zuorong (Dae Joyeong) was a 高麗別種, a description that's open to interpretation, that the culture has Goguryeo, Tungusic and Chinese elements, that the controversy is being used by contemporary groups as justification for territorial aspirations, why then does the article start out so blatantly in the POV that Balhae was a Korean kingdom?</p>
<p>maybe cuz Balhae WAS indeed a Korean empire.. y r u wastin muh time wit such dumb-ass remarks, Mr. smart-ass? Balhae was and still is remembered today as a Korean empire. damn Chinese ppl r tryin to take Goguryo from us too. fukin 짱개s b hatin on us Koreans jus cuz we were powerful enough to control Manchuria centuries earlier than they were ever able to. they jus dont wanna admit dat da Korean nation was powerful during one time, and dat Manchuria rightfully belongs to Korea!! HIS NAME IS DAE JOYEONG.. NOT ZUORONG.. WTF!</p>
<p>Of all the controversial articles I've tiptoed through, from <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> to <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> to even <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, this is the most astonishing that I've seen yet. In those articles, we've always concentrated on giving an intro that is as broad and neutral as possible; then we spend a long time describing exactly how the dispute arises and what the arguments are. After all, Wikipedia's standards demand such careful treatment. So what happened to Wikipedia's NPOV standards here? Perhaps I should go back to <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and insert in the intro, that "Tibet is an independent country"? Or I should go back to <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and rename it: "Formosa (or "Taiwan" in Chinese) is an independent Taiwanese island nation"? I would get reverted immediately. And yet here at <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balhae.html" title="Balhae">Balhae</a>, the Korean interpretation is holy writ, and the Chinese and Russian interpretations are hidden somewhere in the body text?</p>
<p>Please... if you value the standards of Wikipedia, then don't ruin Wikipedia yourself by writing articles with such a blatant POV slant.

<dd>You haven't answered any of the the objections I brought up above. Exactly which of these sources says it was a Korean kingdom? Why the ethnocentric treatment of history? If it's completely irrelevent to Chinese history, why is it that each of your quoted sources gives mentions the Chinese connection and Chinese name as well (but not say the Japanese or Tibetan one)? I suppose by the standards you believe Wikipedia follows, I'd be justified going through <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yalu_River_23dc.html" title="Yalu River">Yalu River</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changbai_Mountains_ba2d.html" title="Changbai Mountains">Changbai Mountains</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumen_River_7a59.html" title="Tumen River">Tumen River</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thousand_Character_Classic_873f.html" title="Thousand Character Classic">Thousand Character Classic</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/l/Lelang.html" title="Lelang">Lelang</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Sea_bf5b.html" title="Yellow Sea">Yellow Sea</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Japan_4ec4.html" title="Sea of Japan">Sea of Japan</a>, and so on, and systematically deleting the Korean names in them all because they're less common? After all, the name East Sea is only used by Koreans, and adding in that small minority view arguably gives it a lot of undue weight compared to international usage. And I would add that even among Korean scholars, the opinion of it as a Korean kingdom isn't unanimous, both historically and in present-day. For example, a book called The History of Northeast Asia was published by a Korean scholar, in which the author explicitly rejects categorizing it as Korean history and states his views that the kingdom should be treated as a Northeast Asian cultural entity in its own right.<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 23:08, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chinese history is not completely irrelenvant: Appleby never deleted the Chinese variant of the name from the article itself, and the article makes lengthy mention of position of Chinese historians on the kingdom. But most (if not all) western and English-termed publications refer it to as "Balhae", so that nomenclature is used. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 00:29, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Appleby: When you make the statement that "Bohai was Korean", what exactly are you attempting to say? That Bohai "belongs" to Korea? How does this "belonging" work, exactly: how do the modern governments of North and South Korea "own" a kingdom that existed a thousand years ago?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think by "Balhae is Korean" - it means A) Balhae was founded by Dae Joyeong, a general who is believed to be of <a href="../../../g/o/g/Goguryeo.html" title="Goguryeo">Goguryeo</a> descent, and Goguryeo is identified as a part of Korean history. B) Most western publications identify Balhae as part of Korean history.
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, Dae Joyeung is identified to be 高麗別種, which is open to interpretation. Why is it 高麗別種 and not say 高麗人? Secondly, just because Dae Joyeung was possibly of Goguryeo descent does not mean that a state that he founded, a state that then managed to last for another 300 years, ruled over a mishmash of ethnicities over a vast area, stayed independent from both Tang and Silla, ended up being conquered by the Khitans, etc. was therefore "Korean". This would be like saying that the modern United States is "English" because the earliest arrivals and founders were generally English. (At least the United States still speaks English: did Bohai, or for that matter, Goguryeo, speak Korean?) As far as Western publications go, they identify Bohai as a state that existed in Manchuria and northern Korea, which is factually correct. As for whether Bohai is "Korean", since this is a relatively meaningless statement that implies some sort of retroactive ownership of a kingdom 1,000 years ago by an ethnicity today, I'm not surprised that they don't generally make this blanket statement. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 01:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fact was that its elite were from Goguryeo or related to Goguryeo, that its people were a mingling of Goguryeo and Tungusic elements, that it was heavily influenced by China. (I should also add that Goguryeo wasn't even Korean-speaking.) After Bohai was conquered, its people were probably absorbed by the surrounding Khitan, Jurchen, and Korean peoples, and their descendents can probably be found across Mongolia, northern China, Manchuria, and Korea today. So why exactly does Korea have the exclusive right to claim Bohai as a part of "their" history? How do the modern Korean people "own" another state and people that existed 1,000 years ago and whose descendents are probably now scattered across all of northeastern Asia? -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 23:39, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is becoming more of a personal attack on Appleby. Appleby cited major English references sources with proper citations, and the articles identified Balhae with Korean history. As per precedented set by such pages as <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurchen.html" title="Jurchen">Jurchen</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Japan_4ec4.html" title="Sea of Japan">Sea of Japan</a> (East Sea), the most common English name for the article, was used first for both the article and infobox. I see <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">user:Ran</a> and <a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">user:Yuje</a>'s concerns lie most with the article's content, and I think the issue can be solved without personal attacks. I would say the Political interpretation part is NPOV, because it makes a fair mention of all the positions regarding Balhae history. The history itself is pretty NPOV too. I see <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">user:Ran</a>'s concerns lies with the introduction. The wording can be changed something more neutral. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 00:29, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the introduction should be changed. Bohai was a political entity that existed over a thousand years ago in Inner and Outer Manchuria and northern Korea. It is connected - by blood and by culture - to all of the ethnicities that have passed through the area since, including Khitans, Jurchens, Koreans, Mongols, Han Chinese, etc. To say that it is a "Korean kingdom" from the outset is absurd. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 01:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I think this could be worked out. I was sad to see many personal attacks on user:Appleby; he made great contributions to many Korea-related pages (not just History of Korea related pages) and he isn't a "POV slated editor". He was also accused of edits he have never done (ex. He never deleted Chinese name off the infobox). As the article suggests, the ruling class of Balhae was of Goguryeo ethnicity, but the ethnic composition of its people may have been more varied. Balhae wasn't a kingdom consting purely of ethnic Koreans, but it certainly is more commonly associated with Korean history (as per cited sources). Although the ethnic composition of Balhae may have been varied, it should be taken into account that the ruling class of Balhae were of <a href="../../../g/o/g/Goguryeo.html" title="Goguryeo">Goguryeo</a> descent, which is largely identified as a Korean kingdom, and western publications generally characterize Balhae as part of Korean history. But nevertheless, presence of other ethnic groups in Balhae, such as Jurchens and later Khitans should not be ignored. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 01:16, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I planned to tackle this problem after the romanization issue would be solved. So I only discuss a basic policy for now. "A Korean state", "an ethnic minority local government of Tang China", "the first class society by ethnic groups in Russian Far East" .. confine all these stuffs into the "Characterization and political interpretation" section and use terms that appear in historical sources as far as possible. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 10:48, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Support</b>, possibly also <b>use multiple romanizations</b> as necessary for NPOV purposes, but I am not <i>at all comfortable</i> with attempts to portray this as exclusively a Korean state. Several sources keep on getting parroted out, but my questions on where they state it was Korean (above) have been completely evaded, as have been other raised objections. Also, the information fromm those sources seem to have been cherry-picked to suit an NPOV. As also noted above, <i>additions from those very same sources have been reverted</i> when it didn't suit the "Balhae as a Korean kingdom" POV. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 03:04, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Balhae as a Korean kingdom" is more of a content dispute; this poll is about Romanization of Balhae. In English sources, and all the sources, regardless of their contents, made exclusive or major uses of Balhae (or variations thereof) over Bohai (or variations thereof). I see your beef is with the contents of the article, and I think that could be discussed seperately and adjustments to the articles can be made. Also, if you note that "Balhae" is Korean POV, why is "Bohai", which has almost <b>zero</b> usage in major English encyclopedias and publications (after all, this is English encyclopedia), is NPOV? Wouldn't they be Chinese POV? Multiple Romanization is also an option, but under <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>, <i>Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers</i>, and most prominent and influential English publications uses the term "Balhae" over "Bohai", and that is a undisputable fact. The sources <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">user:Nanshu</a> listed are Japanese, Chinese and Russian sources. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 07:30, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Which is why I also supported the use of multiple romanizations. It's not immediately clear which name for the kingdom is more common, since the Chinese name is also the name of the sea. But for the monarchs as such, the Chinese romanizations are definitely more common. You and Appleby have been <i>deleting</i> Chinese names from the list to support the POV that it's been solely a Korean state.
<dl>
<dd>I don't know why you accuse me of "Deleting" Chinese names from the articles, but Chinese names are still in articles such as <a href="../../../d/a/e/Dae_Joyeong_bc65.html" title="Dae Joyeong">Dae Joyeong</a>.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, at issue is the default romanization method for names in the article. Let's do a comparison of them, shall we?</dd>

<dd>Erm, google searches aren't the most effective way to determine the commonness in English, and it was basis of your argument for "commonness" in English. I just proved you wrong by showing how unreliable google searches are. I don't know why you argue "Bohai" is the NPOV format, seeing as how all major English encyclopedia + publications use Korean romanization (and variatns thereof) over Bohai. Well, again, that's your opinion, so I won't haggle you for it. But if you want to support that "bohai" is the NPOV naming for it, I think presenting valid NPOV English-based major publications and encyclopedias as sources are in order. I mean, <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">user:Nanshu</a> claims that the NPOV english sources were writtin in "Korean context" and <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">user:Endroit</a> "Korea-POV" (U.S Library of Congress = vehicle for North Korean propaganda&#160;??), but the only ENglish sources that present Chinese romanization as the default one are...

Note that they are all websites maintained by Chinese people or Chinese gov't in the case. The only one article that wasn't a Chinese source was www.about.com, and that article was copy+paste from www.China.org (official Chinese gov't website). Contrary to this, Korean romanization, Dae Joyeong (and variations thereof, including Tae Joyeong), are all used in NPOV, English-based sources cited in the article itself (Lib of Congress, Jesuit Wheeling University, Various encyclopedias) The google search done here reveals nothing but that Chinese-based sources use Chinese Romanization, but it is still clear that NPOV, prominent and major English sources use Korean romanization when referring to the monarchs (such as Dae Joyeong); I have yet to see a prominent NPOV English publiation + encyclopedia that utilize Chinese romanization for the monarchs.

<dd>The encyclopedia cites are largely a difference in manual of style, not a reflection of actual usage. For example, in its Korean romanizations, it prefers the McCune-Reischauer romanizations, while you seem to be advocating the South Korean romanizations, so I fail to see how it supports your argument. In its Chinese related articles, it prefers as its article names the Wade-Giles system, whereas it's trivial to show that <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> is overwhelmingly dominant. And as Wikipedia itself states, encylopedias are neither primary nor secondary sources, but tertiary sources.--<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 02:24, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not going to bother going on because the proportion of wikipedia mirrors keeps increasing with the obscurity of the monarch, but it's pretty clear the the Chinese romanization is predominately the most popular one. In fact, the monarch names themselves originate from this page <a href="http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/bohai.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/bohai.html" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, and the Korean names came after some editor ran the Chinese characters through a machine translator.</dd>
<dd>I don't know where you are getting this "machine translator" thing from, but let us compare direct machine translation from www.worldlingo.com of the Chinese.[<a href="http://www.worldlingo.com/en/products_services/worldlingo_translator.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldlingo.com/en/products_services/worldlingo_translator.html" rel="nofollow">[58]</a> for Traditional Chinese. Try converting the table to Korean in the translator; you get utter nonsense that does not make any sense. The names used for the monarch table is not "machine translation" as you boldly claim, but actual names used by Korean sources and English publications (such as Dae Joyeong). <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 06:27, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's quite obvious from looking at the addition <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bohai&amp;diff=2157228&amp;oldid=2157221" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bohai&amp;diff=2157228&amp;oldid=2157221" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> that the table was just cut-and-pasted from the Chinese one, and the Chinese characters just run through an electronic dictionary. For example, the Chinese table incorrectly lists the fifth monarch as (Da Huaxing|大華興 da4 hua1 xing1), where it should actually be 華璵 in Chinese. (The current Korean list uses 華與, which I don't know if is correct in Korean context or another typo). But as you can see in the copy-and-pasted Korean table, it repeats the exact same mistake as the Chinese table in using (Dae Hua Heung|대화흥|大華興). This wouldn't have happened unless some sloppy person simply just ran each Chinese character through an electronic translator to get the Korean pronunciations. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 02:24, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Substitute in words like "Balhae", "Parhae", "Korea", etc, in place of Manchuria, and the results are similar.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, for the default romanizations of the names of the capitals, the Chinese romanizations are preferred by academia. The primary research being done on this subject seems to be by Japanese researchers, who seem to prefer the Chinese romanizations when writing in English.
<dl>
<dd>It is your POV that primary research done on Balhae is by Japanese researchers, as there has been Korean books predating to Joseon Dynasty that dealt with subjects regarding Balhae. I could just easily argue that Korean researchers are the leaders in the field and present Korean sources and Romanizations. And your claim that academia prefers Chinese romanization has no support in major English publications and encyclopedias. If you also think that we should use Chinese romanization becaues Japanese researchers tend to do so when presenting their findings in English, I think you've mistaken here for <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>. Just comparing simple google search number in disregard of their contents and sources quite does not establish NPOV and consensus, as suggested by Wikipedia policies and guidelines.

<dd>I'm curious as to why you sort <a href="../../../v/a/n/VANK_fab3.html" title="VANK">VANK</a> as Korean <i>propaganda</i>; following your reasoning, I would see you would also term <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>'s e-mail sending policy for releasing of political prisoners as <i>propaganda</i>? Sorting <a href="../../../v/a/n/VANK_fab3.html" title="VANK">VANK</a> as "propaganda ministry" is Japanese POV, as many issues they touch upon is controversial and can be viewed in various perspective. Calling <a href="../../../v/a/n/VANK_fab3.html" title="VANK">VANK</a> as an organization that tries to inform people of <i>absolute truth</i> would also be Korean POV. The supermajority of prominent English sources used Korean romanization before the formation of VANKS and its cyber activitism which came recently on 2002 (<a href="../../../v/a/n/VANK_fab3.html" title="VANK">VANK</a> was formed on 1999 but did not engage in cyber activities since internet wasn't as prominently distributed back then)]. I would call the real "propaganda" and "terrorists" are some 2ch users, as they engage in various hacking activities against Korean websites including <a href="../../../v/a/n/VANK_fab3.html" title="VANK">VANK</a> and websites on the Liancourt Rocks disputes. Also, the North Korean propaganda website you mentioned exclusively uses "Balhae" over "bohai" (or variations thereof). I see this poll is about Romanization of Balhae, and your source just enhances that most English publications uses exclusive or major usage of term "Balhae" (or variations thereof) then "Bohai". Also, I agree that North Korean historians tend to distort some historical facts to make their historical standing seem vastly superb, and that is greatly damaging for the South Korean historians. North Koreans largely identify Goguryeo and Balhae as forerunner of North Korea and directly links with their community ideology, <i>Juche</i>. This is very regrettable, as history of Balhae also has great importance on Korean history as a whole (not just North Korea) and various ethnic groups of Manchuria. However, North Korean <i>propaganda</i> plays no role in major and prominent English sources using <i>Balhae</i> as main romanizations for Balhae and its related articles. Thus it is vastly irrelevant to Romanization of the article itself. But I found the article very interesting, and I think the North Korean linkage of Balhae + Goguryeo and their <i>Juche</i> ideology at least deserves a mention in the political interpretation part of the article. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 03:29, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've read the article over, and I didn't find any mention of North Korean Balhae <i>propaganda</i> is aimed at convincing western publications to change their romanizations on the article. And if the article is calling "Balhae" in the context of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korean_897a.html" title="North Korean">North Koreann</a> propaganda, i would assume they would refer Balhae as "Bohai" in the main context or at least mention that "Bohai" is the accepted standard romanization for the name of the kingdom and "Balhae" is just a Korean variant (or North Korean propaganda!). The article itself, however, makes no mention of the name "Bohai" or variations thereof. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 08:26, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>it seems there is some confusion about the point of this discussion. to remove a distraction, i will remove the wording "korean kingdom" from the intro, although i think it's a fair description of what the references say. right now, per nanshu, we should be discussing the default romanization. we should do that by discussing applicable wikipedia naming policies and manual of style, and comparing npov verifiable sources, not get sidetracked by ad hominem or "guilt by association" rhetoric. although i think an issue like this is settled by wikipedia policies &amp; npov sources, we could have a more useful poll if there was a brief description of the issue and arguments on both sides, and it should be publicized at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and/or <a href="../../../c/s/_/WP%7ECS_79c7.html" title="WP:CS">WP:CS</a>.

<dd>The general number of google searches does not reflect the commonness of the name in English, when done by searching "Balhae kingdom" (or variations thereof) For example, when you search "Bohai Kingdom" (disregarding Wikipedia links). <a href="http://www.chinaculture.org" class="external free" title="http://www.chinaculture.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinaculture.org</a>, <a href="http://www.china.org.cn" class="external free" title="http://www.china.org.cn" rel="nofollow">http://www.china.org.cn</a>, <a href="http://www.regenttour.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.regenttour.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.regenttour.com/</a>, <a href="http://www.kaogu.cn" class="external free" title="http://www.kaogu.cn" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaogu.cn</a>, <a href="http://www.holidayschina.com" class="external free" title="http://www.holidayschina.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.holidayschina.com</a>, etc. etc. as the firsthand results. (disregarding such websites as <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/bohai" class="external free" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/bohai" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/bohai</a> and <a href="http://www.governpub.com/Bee-J/Jilin.php" class="external free" title="http://www.governpub.com/Bee-J/Jilin.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.governpub.com/Bee-J/Jilin.php</a> seeing as how their information is copy+paste of old wikipedia articles). Also, just by simple denomination, "Bohai Kingdom" gives 600 hits while "Balhae Kingdom" alone grants over 900 hits. You can all see that the sources that makes exclusive or major usage of the term is Chinese websites and the English version of those websites (with Chinese POV). There are numerous Korean sites that use the term Balhae, and those sites invariably reflect Korean POV. Those sites can't determine the "commonness" of names. However, Parhae and Balhae and variations thereof are used in prominent English encyclopedias and publications. Also, Bohai possesses many alternate meanings in Chinese, so to narrow the search (Notably Bohai Sea; searching Bohai at google will not give you information on Bohai Bay and Bohai industries first), dictions as "Bohai state" should be used when searching at google. However, Balhae does not hold any alternate meanings (major) in Korean, so you do not necessarily need to type "Balhae state" (or variations thereof) to get the results about Balhae. Also, "Parhae" has no alternate meaning, so you do not need to search "Parhae state"; you will see that atleast for the first 10 pages or so, "Parhae" will give you information on the kingdom. The only alternate meaning for "Parhae" for first 10 pages (the sites with most hits) is <a href="http://www.throneworld.com/lords/lote27/archive/turn007.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.throneworld.com/lords/lote27/archive/turn007.html" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. Only alternate meaning for Balhae that was found was a guild name in a multiplayer game called "Ultima Online" (2 hits) for the first 10 pages of google searches. So "Parhae" gives over 10,000 hits just on the kingdom alone. Clearly, Balhae and variations thereof are most commonly used name for major English publications and encyclopedias, as "Bohai" and variations thereof are employed by Chinese websites (and occassionaly Japanese websites as well). Typing "Parhae Kingdom" is pretty much redundant when just "Parhae" gives you accounts on "Balhae" kingdom and there is no alternate meaning for "Parhae" in Korean or English. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 09:23, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>endroit, you're confusing two different questions, which is not clear in the poll wording:</p>

<li>romanization of 渤海, which is more appropriate for a chinese dictionary. the more common romanization of these chinese characters is of course bohai/bo hai, since it is a contemporary name of a sea, a gulf/bay, a prefecture, a river, many companies, etc. once you determine that 渤海 is most commonly romanized as bohai, what goes on the page titled "Bohai"? as you showed, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/bo/Bohai.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/bo/Bohai.html" rel="nofollow">Columbia Encyclopedia</a>, <a href="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9357595" class="external text" title="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9357595" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Bo%20hai" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Bo%20hai" rel="nofollow">Merriam Webster Online</a>, and <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/91/B0369100.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/91/B0369100.html" rel="nofollow">American Heritage Dictionary</a> say the primary meaning of bohai/bo hai is <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohai_Sea_6bc3.html" title="Bohai Sea">Bohai Sea</a>, so the wikipedia page titled "Bohai" needs to redirect to Bohai Sea, or to Bohai (disambiguation) with Bohai Sea as the top link.</li>

</ul>
<p>if you want to google for the spelling for this <b>kingdom</b>, you have to be careful that's what you're doing, with all the various spellings of parhae/palhae/barhae/balhae and bohai/pohai/bo'hai/bo hai (and don't forget jin/chin) and state/kingdom/country/nation, &amp; be careful about the kind of results you actually get, as deiaemeth points out. this is far less helpful, in principle, in practicality of results, and in weight, than the publications cited above.</p>
<p>if we're gonna have a useful poll, the poll question needs to be fixed, and <b>then</b> get more outsiders to take a look. (for the purpose of this poll, it should also be explained that various romanization systems/common misspellings for both balhae and bohai are being considered equivalent, since there is no one established spelling that rises to the level of a loan word).

<p>please stop with the guilt by association, and address this topic on its merits. if you don't treat the kingdom separately, the page titled "bohai" would be a disambiguation page, with the primary meaning being "bohai sea." this poll is about the kingdom's english name. i'm not disagreeing with you, we're just talking about different things.

I cannot speak for others like Appleby did, but here is my reasoning behind my own decision: <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">Etymologically</a> speaking, the name <i>Bohai Kingdom</i> (渤海國) was derived from <i>Bohai Sea</i> (渤海). And so <i>all</i> uses of <i>Bohai</i> would be treated equally, including <i>Bohai Sea</i> and <i>Bohai Kingdom</i>, according to my interpretation. We are having a poll here, because we disagree over such things. It is not right for Appleby to tell me whether I am wrong, because nobody can speak for me. This is merely my opinion, just as Appleby has stated his own opinion here.--<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a> 18:14, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>if this poll is about how to romanize 渤海 (primary meaning <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohai_Sea_6bc3.html" title="Bohai Sea">Bohai Sea</a>), i'd agree "Bohai" is the most common romanization. if the question is about the subject of this article (which is what i thought i was voting on), then english reference publications are pretty much unanimous on using korean romanization, &amp; since wikipedia uses the rr system, this article should remain titled Balhae. but i guess that hasn't been asked.

<dd>I would say that the poll clearly says "<b>default romanization for Bohai-related articles</b>", which would obviously include <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohai_Sea_6bc3.html" title="Bohai Sea">Bohai Sea</a> as well as <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jilin.html" title="Jilin">Jilin</a> and other Bohai-related articles.

<p>you're the one who considered bohai sea, bohai prefecture, etc to be relevant. i thought this was just about the balhae/bohai kingdom, since this is the discussion page for that specific topic. i'd guess that's what some other people thought too, but you are disagreeing. you are saying the vote included all meanings of 渤海, treating the sea, prefecture, and kingdom as if they were one entity, even though they are different topics and referred to differently in english. you and i voted on different issues.

<dd>Appleby, I hope you are not saying that you will ignore this poll. I urge Appleby to come up with an alternate poll, and it is up to Appleby to do so if he doesn't like this poll. However, the way it stands now, I believe there is consensus already, and it is a matter of time before we start reverting to "Bohai" in these articles.</dd>
<dd>Let me add that Appleby has a choice whether he follows Wikipedia rules, or defies consensus and resorts to revert wars (as he has done in other articles).

<dd>Are you seriously suggesting Balhae should be romanized "Bohai" because "Bohai Bay/Sea" is commonly used in English? Balhae and Bohai kingdom is a seperately treated issue, as you may realize from reading the article itself. Also, since you emphasize "consensus" in this matter, I suggest you read <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>. <i>Consensus should not trump NPOV (or any other official policy). A group of editors advocating a viewpoint do not, in theory, overcome the policy expressed in Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not concerning advocacy and propaganda. However, a group of editors may be able to shut out certain facts and points of view through persistence, numbers, and organization. This group of editors should not agree to an article version that violates NPOV, but on occasion will do so anyway. This is generally agreed to be a bad thing.</i> Per cited sources, do you see that Bohai is the most common Romanization in prominent English-based sources and publications? Bohai is commonly used to refer to Bohai Sea, not Balhae kingdom, and that is a indisputable fact, as per cited sources. I would hardly suggest 5 Chinese &amp; Japanese editors and 2 Korean editors reflect "NPOV" and "consensus" in this matter, but the fact of the matter is, most English sources and publications exclusively or majorly use the term "Balhae" (or variations thereof) over Bohai. Again, if you are suggesting that we use "Bohai" for "Balhae" related articles because "Bohai Sea" has common usage in English (whihc is quite irrelevant to the article itself), I think you are reading the wrong article here. That's like suggesting renaming <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohai_Sea_6bc3.html" title="Bohai Sea">Bohai Sea</a> as <i>Balhae Sea</i> because <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balhae.html" title="Balhae">Balhae</a> is the most commonly accepted Romanization for Balhae kingdom in prominent and influential English sources and publications. Also, if you think Polls are de jure Wikipedia policy and that everything should be reverted disregarding cited sources just because one group of editors outnumber others by 3 people, you should definitely think about reading <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVoting_is_evil_8af3.html" title="Wikipedia:Voting is evil">Wikipedia:Voting_is_evil</a>. Contrary to what you think, let me cite some stuff from the guideline; You claim that this pole established absolute consensus and that this article should be renamed, per <i>Wikipedia Policy</i> Let's start from some of the excerpts from the <i>WIkipedia guideline</i>, which you suggest we must adhere by. <i>Polling isn't fair, either</i> (HUH?), <i>Polling discourages consensus</i></dd>

<p>Having the option of settling a dispute by taking a poll, instead of the careful consideration, dissection and eventual synthesis of each side's arguments, actually undermines the progress in dispute resolution that Wiki has allowed. Having the option of settling a dispute by taking a poll, instead of the careful consideration, dissection and eventual synthesis of each side's arguments, actually undermines the progress in dispute resolution that Wiki has allowed. Wikipedia is not a democracy. This is a strength, not a failing. en:Dialectics is one of the most important things that make Wiki special, and while taking a poll is very often a lot easier than helping each other find a mutually agreeable position, it's almost never better.Polling encourages the community to remain divided by avoiding that discourse; participants don't interact with the other voters, but merely choose camps. Establishing consensus requires expressing that opinion in terms other than a choice between discrete option and expanding the reasoning behind it, addressing the points that others have left, until all come to a mutually agreeable solution. No one can address objections that aren't stated, points that aren't made. Yes, establishing consensus is a lot harder than taking a poll. So are most things worth doing. <i>(This excerpt is from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVoting_is_evil_8af3.html" title="Wikipedia:Voting is evil">Wikipedia:Voting is evil</a>.

<p>Interesting, isn't it? Do you think it sheds some new light on the subject? Realized that your <i>beloved poll' doesn't establish NPOV just because some editors persuing their own POV outnumber other editors with their own POV and completely disregard the NPOV English sources&#160;?</i></p>

Its primary method of finding consensus is discussion, not voting. In difficult cases, straw polls may be conducted to help determine consensus, but are to be used with caution and not to be treated as binding votes</i>. Very interesting; contrary to your claim, voting and disreagrding the provided prominent and influential English sources isn't the proper way to establish NPOV and fairness after all Hmm. Very interesting.</p>
<p>Also, Again, if you really suggest renaming Balhae related articles "bohai" just because "bohai sea" is commonly used name in English sources and disregard the fact that Balhae Kingdom and Bohai Sea is a seperate matter, that is against Wikipedia policies and true spirit and mission of Wikipedia. Following your argument, should we rename <i>Buyeo</i> to <i>Fuyu</i> because <i>Fuyu persimmon</i> is a common English name for the persimmons even though they carry different meanings? Also, please not that Bohai Bay and Bohai Kingdom uses different Chinese characters, thereby carrying different meanings. I gotta say, this is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard today. You emphasize that Appleby isn't the one adhering to Wikipedia rules, but you're the one that is actually carrying matters contrary to what the Wikipedia policies directly states, as per cited excerpts from the policy itself. If you think that NPOV in this matter is established by simple poll between Chinese, Japanese and Korean editors here and disregard main prominent and influential English sources, you are gravely mistaken. You accuse Appleby of "Edit Wars" - infact, there has been no edits for the Balhae article itself that can be termed "edit war" for the last 3 days. Not many seem to have problems with the current version of article, and Appleby removed the <i>Korean Kingdom</i> excerpt per <a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">user:Yuje</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">user:Ran</a>'s request. Have a nice day, and remember; when you start telling other people to adhere to Wikipedia policies, it's generally a very good idea to read them first yourself. Adhere to the policies and guidelines set by Wikipedia! You also noted that this it is just matter of time until we start reverting articles to "Bohai". As long as there are editors that stands by NPOV and true spirit of Wikipedia, editing articles just by way of Straw polls in complete disregard of Wikipedia policies, guidelines, and prominent English-based sources will not be tolerated. *note that <i>Wikipedia:Voting is evil</i> isn't a Policy but a guideline.

<dd>My mistake there; also, when the most ridiculous thing I was referring to was your claim that Balhae should be renamed Bohai per Bohai sea. Meanwhile, I would suggest you to read about Wikipedia policies (please get your facts straight about the Consensus and voting part, as some materials you suggested runs contrary to Wikipedia policies and guidelines) and please learn to differentiate between Balhae Kingdom and Bohai sea, as prominent English sources and publications tend to specifically utilize Balhae (KRN Romanization) when referring to the kingdoms and use Chinese romanization when referring to Bohai Sea. If your reasoning that Balhae kingdom should be renamed per Bohai Sea, I would expect to see major English-based publications and encyclopedias do so and call the kingdom itself "Bohai Kingdom", based on the reasoning that "Bohai Sea" = Balhae Kingdom. But they do not, as per cited sources, most English-based publications and sources chooses the standard "Balhae" over bohai. Clearly, they see the difference between the Balhae kingdom and Bohai Sea. Let me sum it up for you; <i>Balhae Kingdom =/= Bohai Sea.</i></dd>

<dd>I disagree with Deiaemeth that we need to follow other publications <s>regarding this matter</s> which prioritize the name "Balhae." The name of the Kingdom (Bohai) is a Chinese name and needs to mentioned first with the Chinese name Bohai, and then followed by Korean name Balhae in parentheses. Otherwise I believe it would be inconsistent and illogical. But that's merely my opinion, and other editors have their opinions too.--<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a> 04:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know why you would associate Chinese name with Balhae (Bohai) Kingdom, when per Wikipedia policy (Which you seem to really put a heavy emphasis on), the most common variations used by English-based sources and publications used. But I agree that the Chinese name should also be featured in infobox. I would call it inconsistent and illogical to disregard the NPOV and prominent &amp; influential English-based sources to use the Chinese name. I don't see any major English-based encyclopedias/publiations/researches using the standard "Bohai" over "Balhae" when referring to the ancient kingdom. Also, you noted that " I disagree with Deiaemeth that we need to follow other publications regarding this matter." So you would disagree with NPOV and prominent English-based sources? But do you still think Chinese/Russian/Japanese sources listed by Nanshu are still applicable? Also, I thought you suggested renaming article to Bohai because English-based sources used the term "Bohai Sea" to refer to Bohai Sea and you claimed that directly correlated to "Balhae Kingdom". (even though they used seperate Romanization for the kingdom and differentiated it with the sea) But you just stated that you "disagree with Deiaemeth(me) that we need to follow other publications regarding this matter". I'm <i>really</i> confused here. So, are you stating a) Use the English-basd sources for your claim of <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohai_Sea_6bc3.html" title="Bohai Sea">Bohai Sea</a> = Balhae Kingdom (Bohai) but disregard them when they use the Korean romanization over Chinese one when referring to the Kingdom itself (which is, the main point of the article, u know, Balhae (Bohai) kingdom).<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 04:35, 28 February 2006 (UTC) (modified <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 04:47, 28 February 2006 (UTC))

<dd>So you want to diregard the sources if they romanized the kingdom itself as Balhae (the prominent English-based sources) and only consider them as verifiable sources if they use the Chinese romanization over Korean romanization. So When Brit. Encyclopedia calls the sea "Bohai Sea" and romanizes the kingdom as "Parhae", you want to disregard the latter. I see. Thank you for clearing your point up, and have a nice day!

<dd>I merely applied a single standard for both names (Bohai Kingdom and Bohai Sea), and concluded that "Bohai" is more appropriate (and more common) than "Balhae" in English in general.

<dd>Yes, I agree that Bohai is more (or most) common name for Bohai Sea, but English-based sources utilize seperate Romanization for Balhae Kingdom, and grouping them under one umbrella is inconsistent. If the major English-based sources and publications and encyclopedias took such approach and refer both the Sea and Kingdom as "Bohai" instead of referring the kingdom as "Balhae Kingdom", what you're proposing would be reasonable. But however, Balhae kingdom and Bohai Sea is quite often differentiated in terms of Romanization. So disregarding that fact and grouping them under a single standard would be quite unreasonable. BTW Bohai needs a disambig Page between Balhae Kingdom and Bohai Sea, I think. But also, I think I understand your concerns regarding the Romanization. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 05:22, 28 February 2006 (UTC) (modified <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 05:33, 28 February 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>This entire discussion is quite ugly. I'll just limit myself to pointing out the main problems with <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a>'s position that there can only ever be one single way to write 渤海 in English. As far as I can tell, Endroit doesn't make clear the reasons behind this argument, so I am left to guess. Obviously, the reason cannot be that all place names derived from the same Chinese characters should use the same romanisation, because that would suggest that both <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonkin.html" title="Tonkin">Tonkin</a> (東京) should use the same spelling in English (presumably, the pinyin-based 'Dongjing' would be preferred).</p>
<p>So I'm guessing that the argument is that when a place name that is still in use is the etymological origin for an ethnonym and the name of an ancient kingdom, then the same name should be used for all those variations. Step back now and consider the implications of such an argument. Would this mean the same spelling should be used for <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guyana.html" title="Guyana">Guyana</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiana.html" title="Guiana">Guiana</a>? Should we go back to using the name '<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belorussia.html" title="Belorussia">Belorussia</a>' to make the etymological connection to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> plainer? Actually, should we just collapse all variations of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rus%27.html" title="Rus'">Rus'</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenia.html" title="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a> (including <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Ruotsi</a>, which actually refers to Sweden) into one? No, we use different names because they refer to different things, although in each case they are etymologically related and are part of the same cultural/geographical continuum. The only reason we are even having this argument is because in the case of 渤海, the name is written with the same characters whether referring to the sea, the region, or the ancient kingdom, thus masking all those distinctions and driving home their shared etymological origin.</p>
<p>So the main argument then becomes one of choosing the path of simplicity, not necessity; and as such, it's actually pretty decent: as long as we're dealing with an ancient kingdom whose actual self-appellation we have no way of determining, why not use the same romanisation as we would use for the Chinese region and the sea? Not bad, but it comes nowhere close to saying that using a single romanisation is the <i>only</i> way to go. And it is clearly not the only option, as we can see from the fact that there is a substantial tradition of making such a distinction in recognition of the fact that the kingdom has been considered to have a closer relationship to Korean history than to Chinese history (whether that is justified or not is a separate issue). That is why the references above – and from my experience, most of the English-language works in the academic literature – choose a romanisation based on the Korean for the kingdom, while Pohai/Bohai is almost universally used for the sea.</p>
<p>So failing that, I guess Endroit's argument is that North Korean propaganda calls the kingdom by the Korean name, so it just must clearly be wrong. There may be little of merit about the North Korean historical viewpoint, but you cannot accuse it of pushing an unpopular name for the kingdom. In calling it by the name based on the romanisation of Korean, the North Korean historiography is merely following a well-established practice in the English-language literature. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceager_71f5.html" title="User:Iceager">Iceager</a> 09:33, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not agree that if most English-language works choose Korean romanization for the Bohai (Balhae) "kingdom", <i>all</i> Wikipedia articles should do the same. I will acknowledge what Iceager says, that "the kingdom has been considered to have a closer relationship to Korean history than to Chinese history", as also shown by most of Appleby's citations.
<dl>
<dd>So you actually disagree with Wikipedia policy, per most common usage for the context in English? <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 23:04, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So I propose the following: For articles written in the Korean context, the "kingdom" should be referred to as "Balhae (Bohai)". For articles written in the Manchurian context, Chinese context, Japanese context, and Russian context, the "kingdom" should be referred to as "Bohai (Balhae)". And for articles written in the general context, such as this particular article, the "kingdom" should be referred to as "Bohai (Balhae)" as voted here.
<dl>
<dd>Read the policy on voting and consensus please. Well, your proposal is certainly interesting, but I don't know why you still insist "Balhae" is Korean POV (and North Korean propaganda), when clearly all cited English major sorces uses the Korean romanization over "Bohai" in context of the ancient Kingdom. I would call it sinocentrism to ignore the mainstream romanization utilized by all English-based major sources. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 23:04, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will add that the Bohai Kingdom is multi-ethnic, and more Manchurian (<a href="../../../m/a/l/Malgal.html" title="Malgal">Malgal</a>) than Korean. There's no need to make this particular article Korea-centric. We should restore some of the Chinese romanizations that were deleted, such as the names of the rulers. We can still keep the link to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Korean_monarchs_d2e2.html#Balhae_.28669_-_926.29" title="List of Korean monarchs">List of Korean monarchs#Balhae (669 - 926)</a> at the bottom, and call it "List of Korean monarchs, Balhae (Bohai)", though.</dd>
<dd>For all romanizations within this particular article, the Chinese romanization should be listed first, followed by the Korean romanization.--<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a> 16:36, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i think english-speaking scholars already knew the ethnicity and history of the kingdom when they chose the korean romanization in independent reference works. i don't know of any other encyclopedia that uses different primary spelling of the same topic depending on national context. the only close analogy i can think of is wikipedia's own <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Japan_4ec4.html" title="Sea of Japan">Sea of Japan</a>, where the alternate english name (East Sea) is used as an alternate name in the main and korea-related articles, but since "Sea of Japan" is the primary english name, that is used throughout wikipedia, consistently. so, here, since "Balhae" is the primary english name for this kingdom, it should be used consistently throughout as the primary name, and "(Chinese: Bohai)" can be included in this main and china-related articles.

<dd>With respect to this Bohai (Balhae) article, you'd have to at least admit that both romanizations need to be there for pretty much everything (even if we don't agree on the ordering, etc.). That means a link to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Korean_monarchs_d2e2.html#Balhae_.28669_-_926.29" title="List of Korean monarchs">List of Korean monarchs#Balhae (669 - 926)</a> is not enough, and the list of monarchs needs to be restored here with both romanizations.--<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a> 18:10, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>again, independent reference works treat balhae/parhae as the primary spelling, and "bohai" is already in the first mention and infobox and disambiguation. the cited npov sources show, even with mixed ethnic composition, the leadership was of goguryeo and balhae is treated as a part of korean history (just as china consists of more than the han). as far as monarchs go, the consistent format would be to have all the relevant romanizations in an infobox in the individual articles. 18:25, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What I find curious about Endroit's argument is the claim that since the kingdom was multiethnic and primarily Malgal (debatable but certainly plausible), we should avoid the Korean name because it would make the article Korea-centric. If we accept that the kingdom was primarily Malgal in ethnic composition, then I am not picking up on the difference between using the Korean and Chinese names. By the same argument, shouldn't we avoid the Chinese name because it would make the article Sinocentric? (Unless, of course, one belongs to the sort of people who consider all ancient East Asian cultures to be Chinese and vehemently argue, for example, that <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genghis_Khan_804b.html" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> was Chinese.) I wish there was an available neutral alternative, but failing that, the Korean name is actually more neutral than the Chinese name and should be preferred since the Chinese connection to the kingdom is even more tenuous than the Korean one. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceager_71f5.html" title="User:Iceager">Iceager</a> 19:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not just my opinion. Other editors have mentioned that this article has become too Korea-centric. An equal balance between Chinese(Manchurian-POV) and Korean is preferred to make this article NPOV to begin with, as Chinese is the universal language of the Manchuria region today. And apparently, most editors also think Chinese should be the default, but I believe we should always list BOTH romanizations.</dd>
<dd>Also, concurrent citations are slanted towards a Korean-POV and tend to ignore Manchurian-POV.

<dd>I think this is year 2006 now, and right now, it is mentioned as Kingdom of Parhae. I would really like to hear your elaboration on all prominent and major English sources being "Korean POV'd" and only presenting Korean POV. Are you trying to refute the verifiability and reputation of those encyclopedias and publications (such as U.S Library of Congress)? That is an interesting point, I must say. So all major English-based encyclopedias and publications slanted towards a Korean-POV .. interesting.. Btw, your article regards that Chinese <i>Chow</i> dynasty (sp?) called the nation under different names such as "Pohai". Britannica Encyclopedia right now calls it "kingdom of Parhae"; primarily because Encyclopedias tend to update old information with more NPOV and factually accurate information.( And your article merely remarks that "Thus under the Chow dynasty (1122—225 B.c.) they were known as Sewshin, and at subsequent periods as Yih-low, Wuh-keih, Moh-hoh, Pohai," - Chinese Chow dynasty called it "Pohai") <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 23:04, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>If this page actually followed the usual pattern of naming disputes on Wikipedia, one would have suspected the issue would be whether to call it "Parhae" or "Balhae", because a reasonable argument could be made that "Parhae" <i>is</i> the English name, being found on numerous reference works such as Britannica, perhaps a majority of them. It is not a simple issue of updating the romanisation from the previous standard to the current one, because strict McCune-Reischauer would yield "Palhae". So it's possible to treat "Parhae" as a widely-recognised English word that has been given life beyond the simple transcription of the Korean name. (I'm not actually arguing this; I'm merely pointing out that it would be natural for such an argument to be raised.)</p>
<p>Now there's the issue of "Bohai" as well. Endroit says that Chinese is the universal language in the Manchuria region today; that's a bit of a hyperbole, but I guess what he means is that Chinese is the predominant language spoken by the Manchus (many of the other ethnic groups in Manchuria speak their own languages, while <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchu_language.html" title="Manchu language">Manchu language</a> itself is almost extinct). So that's one argument for considering the Chinese name as a sign of respect for the Manchu claim, supposing of course that the Malgals can be equated with the Manchus for this purpose (which is actually not as clear-cut as one might think). But let me tell you why it still does not follow automatically that the Chinese name should be used. In dealing with Manchu history, English-language historiography tends to use Manchu names such as <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurhaci.html" title="Nurhaci">Nurhaci</a>, switching to Chinese only when Manchu history becomes seriously intermingled with that of China. The kingdom of 渤海 never conquered China as did the later Manchus, and it was no more sinified than Silla or any of the other neighbours of China in the Tang era, so there is no overwhelming reason to apply Chinese names in dealing with the ancient kingdom if we are to keep the pretense that we are respecting the Manchu claim to it. But then, I have never seen an attempt to call 渤海 by the Manchu name in English.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that for better or worse, considering 渤海 to be a part of Manchu history is a historical novelty even more recent than the Korean claim, and even then it is one helped along a bit by outsiders with ulterior motives (i.e. Japanese imperialists; for an interesting and illuminating variation, you might want to read up on how Macedonian nationalism's groundless identification with ancient Macedon was initially helped along by the Greek nationalist movement in their campaign against the Ottomans). That is why the Korean name came into currency in English while no one even talks about the Manchu name. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceager_71f5.html" title="User:Iceager">Iceager</a> 11:20, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you want to make that claim, I'd expect you to justify it. Can you cite where such an interpretation of history was motivated by Japanese imperialism? If that were true, it would imply that post-war Japanese research would show a significantly different historical interpretation. But it's I've seen in western sources as well (which I've cited on the main page). I'm sure that researchers from all the interested parties (China, N Korea, S Korea, Russia, Japan, etc) may have some of their own biases, but one would expect actual errors or gross distortions of facts to be pointed out instead of just dismissing a particular interpretation based on alleged biases. You now seem guilty of doing the same thing that <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> is accusing <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a> of doing, namely attempting to discredit an argument through guilt by association instead of attacking the argument's actual merits.

Even by your way of simple google search, Gaoguli - wikipedia reveals a whopping 6 searches. <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=gaoguli+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=lrtip7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=gaoguli+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=lrtip7" rel="nofollow">[84]</a> It is a Romanization found in no major English works, and even Chinese authorities very rarely use that Romanization (search for article regarding Goguryeo in china.org) So basically, Koguryo -wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=koguryo+-wikipedia&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=koguryo+-wikipedia&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[85]</a> - 181,200 searches, Goguryeo -wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=goguryeo+-wikipedia&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=goguryeo+-wikipedia&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[86]</a> 43,600 searches. So you're totally for claiming that when referencing the name, referencing the name that almost 0 usage in English first then the internatinally accpeted and used one is NPOV? I mean, google searching is pretty silly when discussing pages that have like 100 searches each, but 224,800 searches (English only -wikipedia) to 6 searches (English only -wikipedia) is pretty darn silly. But hey, this articles not for Romanization of Goguryeo anyway.

I should have known that what I thought was a harmless aside would be misinterpreted like this, but it's my fault for not recognising that the mention of Japanese imperialism sends automatic warning bells. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceager_71f5.html" title="User:Iceager">Iceager</a> 04:11, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you thought Bohai/Balhae in every context was NPOV even when Bohai has minor usage in English works? and Gaoguli/Goguryeo too? (see my post above) There is a specific mention of Bohai in the introductory paragraph of the article. By your logic, we should then note all Sea of Japan references in articles as East Sea (Sea of Japan). I mean, if we are to use the name that is reference more often as secondary name.

<p>i thought we covered this in the mountains of discussion above. inclusion is not the same thing as npov. if independent reputable reference works identify a topic a certain way, that's npov. adding a very small minority view that's not recognized by major reference works, in a way that suggests equivalent popularity or weight, that is unreasonable pov. again, note how East Sea, even though it is widely recognized as an alternate english name by major english encyclopedias, still is not even mentioned except in korea-related articles, because Sea of Japan is the most common name. sometimes, leaving a minority pov out is the npov. see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> Appleby 02:15, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether it is an exclusively Korean-only kingdom or not is being questioned right now; the nature of the discussion is most common Romanization featured in NPOV, major English publications and encyclopedias and such. No one here claims that Balhae is an exclusive Korean kingdom, which you might have realized if you've read the previous posts. Chinese romanization is only in extreme minor use among major English sources (see cited sources), and it is redundant to feature Balhae (Bohai) every time in the article and its related articles. You'll see no one deleted the Chinese name (Bohai) in the context of the article, and it is still in the infobox. Per your logic, should we featuer Sea of Japan (East Sea) (or actually what you're insisting would be East Sea (Sea of Japan)) Every time the article is referenced? Why do you insist proper Romanization is Bohai/Balhae, when Bohai is in extreme minor use (or no use at all) among NPOV major English sources (including Dae Joyeong, etc.)?

<p>Taking into mind <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a>'s comments, I've refined the Google searches somewhat. Here, I'll use <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Scholar_5e38.html" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a>, which searches academic papers only, which will avoid Wikipedia mirrors somewhat, and search among actual areas of research or academic discussion. Google Scholar probably isn't anywhere near comprehensive, yet it might give a good sampling of current scholarly usage.</p>

<p>Discounting Bohai, and from just a quick sampling of available internet research papers, 52 papers use some variation of "Bohai" while 79 use some variation of "Parhae", so Chinese romanization is hardly the extreme minority view characterized by some. Ironically enough, of all the names, "Balhae" turned up the fewest results. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 06:20, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first 10 searches on "Bohai" is actually a paper done on rRNA sequence of several viral strains by a person named Bohai Wen. Also, check the first 6 pages - just skim it if you want to, ALL results were about Bohai Sea/Bohai Bay, and JrBohai Engineering college, etc. Completely irrelevant searches. Also, if you type in Bohai Kingdom or States, all are researches done by Chinese researchers, or researches done on Bohai Sea by scientists from United Kingdoms. Again, I don't see any basis that Bohai is widespread Romanization for Balhae Kingdom in NPOV, major English-source.

As I said, even scrapping the entire collective results of search "Bohai", there are still 52 papers directly related to the kingdom, which use the Chinese romanization.

<dd>All of your sources are from around year 1960s. If you take the example of Asian journal, the more recent versions actually tend to use Korean romanizations and such. If you take a look at one of my 30ish articles I've cited above, you'll find that they mostly date after 1990, with most recent ones being 2005. I mean, researchers, they tend to update things and make changes to their works over 40-50 years. Older versions of encyclopedias, such as Britannica, called Balhae "P-ohai"; they've made the appropriate changes now. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 07:29, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>bohai as the minority spelling is not being disputed, it's already in the first mention, article body &amp; infobox here. what more are you trying to accomplish? you are trying to counter the unanimity of major <b>reference</b> works, with the difference (against you) of <b>tens</b> of journal articles found in incomplete google searches, many of which actually use the chinese romanization as the <b>second</b> reference after the korean, others of which the context cannot be determined from google results. surely you are not saying that "bohai" is <b>equal</b> in weight or frequency, much less preferred, and under no wikipedia policy or example is the minority spelling <b>always</b> mentioned with the majority.

<dl>
<dd>Actually Appleby, many of the reference works found by the tool provided by Yuje did not even feature Chinese Romanization (bohai) - If you see my above posts, most papers actually made exclusive use of Korean romanization.. including two chinese sources. When all cited works points that Korean romanization is the major one and Chinese one being minor, including publications, encyclopedias, and now academic papers, insisting that Bohai holds the equal weight of frequency as Balhae (or variations thereof) is just a silly notion. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 07:00, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you want to go do a raw count of all hundred or so hits and count the number of ones that exclusively use Chinese, exclusively Korean, Chinese secondarily, or Korean secondarily, then go ahead. I lack the time, myself. Have you found out how many of those fall under which categories?</dd>

<dd>Well, yah. Counting all the sources that utilizes Korean romanization is pretty hard because there are too many. But i've had real success in Bohai though. Well, for "Bohai" , it was pretty easy. I mean, you just have to ctrl+f and search "sea" and frantically press the enter key 30 times and you'll see maybe one search referring to the kingdom itself. Just did that for 2 minutes. Well, Korean romanization was much harder. I've invested 10 minutes and found over 40-ish papers that actually predominantly user Korean romanization, and are relatively recent sources prostdating 1990. BTW, sources that utilizes Korean as main Romanization (or exclusively) and Chinese as secondary (or not at all). Most postdating 1990, recent one being 2005. I didn't list all of them here. <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0027-0741(198624)41%3A4%3C502%3ALRODJA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-D" class="external autonumber"

<p>no, i'm relying on the commonly accepted reference texts. Appleby 07:22, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I'll just quote something that Appleby says on this same page, somehwere above:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>ok, even shorter: "historical interpretations with citations to primary sources" are inappropriate because "wikipedia is poorly equipped to judge" those interpretations. so "we report what other reliable secondary sources have published", reputable publications being "peer-reviewed journals, books published by a known academic publishing house ..., general publisher which have a good reputation for scholarly publications, ..." Appleby 18:06, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As he himself quotes, he's poorly equipped to interpret and judge between the merits of different peer-reviewed journals, reputable publications, etc, yet...........now he proposes that we do the exact same thing, and support his pet sources over other equally reputable ones. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 07:23, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>um, that's a quote from the founder of wikipedia, not myself. wikipedians shouldn't be interpreting primary original texts, but citing reputable publications. so far, all reputable reference works and apparently the majority of journals you found use the korean romanization exclusively or primarily. what exactly are you proposing we change? Appleby 07:28, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know why Yuje keeps claiming <i>Lib of Congres</i>, <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, and other sources are Appleby's <i>Pet sources</i>. Just because they do not portray history in a sinocentric way, that does not make the sources automatically <i>pet sources</i>. If he wants to dispute the verifiability and reliability of those institutions, I suggest he take care of that first. He also seems to have forgotten that his findings actually discovered 3-4 old papers that predates 1970s (the most recent one being 1980s) that uses the old romanization "Po-Hai", half of them being written by Chinese researchers. His findings also helped find about 40-50 papers (excluding the Korean ones) that dominantly used the Korean romanization, with the most recent one being published in the late 2005. This is pretty funny. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 09:15, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a>: When you volunteered to help look through the sources, I assumed, that despite differences in views, you would at least be honest and not distort facts. But I did get a bit suspicious when you claimed to be done so soon, and without any kind of numbers). I can hardly say where your claim that the majority of sources that use Chinese romanization use it secondarily to the Korean one. Here are the results from the Chinese romanization searches laid out and classified, and the links clearly labeled so that anyone can check and verify:</p>

<p>As for the accusation of Sinocentrism, I was wondering how long before I would get accused of that. Funny how you were accusing <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a> of trying to exploit guilt by association and now you're trying to do the same thing by calling me a sinocentrist. I have neither called you a VANKer nor a sinophobe, but regardless of whether or not you extend the same courtesy to me, you surely realize that it doesn't help your arguments.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the "Sinocentric" thing was in reference to sources, as in my original quotes <i>Just because they do not portray history in a sinocentric way, that does not make the sources automatically pet sources</i>. I was making a suggestion that you not label the sources <i>pet sources</i> just because they utilize Korean romanization. I've never called YOU a senocentrist. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for the sources, I meant exactly what I said. Instead of accepting available sources, only the favorable ones were being supported and the non-favorable ones being disgarded. Again, here's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39331198" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=39331198" rel="nofollow">great example</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, user:Kamosuke distorted the entire reference regarding "western historians" and duplicated the excerpt on positions of Korean historians, which entailed "Western reference publications generally consider Balhae a part of Manchuria history." by citing britannic article that listed Balhae under History of Korea. So I tried to revert his claim, but accidentally duplicated the same excerpt twice (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;oldid=39331325" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;oldid=39331325" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;oldid=39331325</a>), which I fixed in later edits. I accidentally deleted the whole excerpt on Korean historians, not just the sources, which you would find out if you looked closely. Whatever part you put it wasn't deleted and is still in the article to this day - <i>Koreans believe the founder Dae Joyeong was of Goguryeo stock. The Book of Tang says that Dae Joyeong was of Goguryeo kind (高麗別種), and the New Book of Tang states that he is "from the Sumo Mohe of the former realm of Goguryeo.</i><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 07:48, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This source was being cited as evidence, but when cited again to support a non-favorable view, instant revert. And yes, I find it extreme hyprocrisy that above, this was stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>ok, even shorter: "historical interpretations with citations to primary sources" are inappropriate because "wikipedia is poorly equipped to judge" those interpretations. so "we report what other reliable secondary sources have published", reputable publications being "peer-reviewed journals, books published by a known academic publishing house ..., general publisher which have a good reputation for scholarly publications, ..." Appleby 18:06, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>.....yet immediately after <b>peer-reviewed journals</b> are quoted, they're immediate attempts to characterize them as lacking credibility. Attempting to favor only certain sources, but dismissing other credible ones is exactly what I mean by "pet sources". I don't favor removing them, or holding one over the other, only presenting both, in the NPOV manner. I mean, someone who can't even get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primorsky_Krai&amp;diff=36913728&amp;oldid=36374394" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primorsky_Krai&amp;diff=36913728&amp;oldid=36374394" rel="nofollow">simple</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=36526265&amp;oldid=36473390" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=36526265&amp;oldid=36473390" rel="nofollow">facts</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=37070343" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balhae&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=37070343" rel="nofollow">right</a>, is now supposed to <i>subjectively</i> interpret that certain academic sources are more credible than others?</p>
<p>In any case, I feel like I'm whacking on pop-a-moles here, everytime I satisfy every demand for rejecting Chinese romanization, I find the goalposts being moved further back:</p>
<ol>
<li>The original justification for all the changes was that it's a Korean kingdom <b>False</b>-There's a lack of concensus among scholars, and it's characterized as part of the history of other cultures as well</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The matter of dispute wasn't on whether the kingdom was <i>Korean</i> - Appleby removed the <i>Korean kingdom</i> part after you and <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">user:Ran</a> protested over it. No one portrayed Balhae as an exclusive Korean kingdom.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Chinese romanization is only used by an extreme minority, and therefore should be excluded <b>False</b>-Although not quite as prevalant, its notable, percentage wise, in use by all those major reference sources, pointed out earlier, some of the Chinese romanizations are even more prevalent than the current romanization,</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No one said it shouldn't be in use, but rather, my position was, Balhae should be in primary use. No one deleted the Chinese name off the infobox or anything. No one said it should be "Excluded". <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 09:36, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>IF Chinese Romanization is not as prevalent as "Balhae" (or variations thereof), why should it be in primary use in Wikipedia then? I</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Only Chinese sources use the alternate romanization <b>False</b>-As shown in half this page, the alternate romanization is widely used as well, by numerous non-Chinese sources</li>
<li>The other listed sources aren't prominent or aren't credible <b>False</b>-They're peer-reviewed journals, many of them from prominent institutions</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No one here said those sources weren't "credible". I said of the 6 sources you cited , 5 of them dated to 1970s. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 07:48, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, there's being yet another attempt to discredit them by attempting to characterize them as old or outdated (years of publication are listed in the above table). I wonder whether an outsider viewing this debate would see this as NPOV behavior, considering all the excuses being tossed in front of what should be a standard NPOV procedure on every other subject that has shared history between different cultures.</p>
<p><br />
Well, it seems that the discussion is going nowhere. Looks like it's probably going to end up in requests for mediation, just like East Sea. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 05:39, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since this page is tagged for NPOV and Factual accuracy dispute, I wanted to ask which part (other than Romanization) other editors thought were factually inaccurate. There hasn't been much edits on the factual contents of the articles&#160;; I thought some editors were dissastified with the Romanization of the article, which isn't factual inaccuracy (but rather a NPOV dispute).

<p>高麗別種 = Goguryeo kind? I can't believe people can do this kind of selective reading and translation on Wikipedia. What happened to the 別? We can negotiate on how to translate 別, but Deiaemeth etc. need to stop pretending that this character does not exist.</p>
<p>Also, those four sources that Appleby likes do not prove that Balhae is exclusively part of the History of Korea. As I've already explained at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManchuria_41d1.html" title="Talk:Manchuria">Talk:Manchuria</a>, Balhae is part of the history of every place that it ruled.

<p>Balhae is not <b>exclusively</b> part of the history of Korea.

I've already explained at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManchuria_41d1.html" title="Talk:Manchuria">Talk:Manchuria</a> why the history of Balhae is entwined with the history of everyone else in the region, and how it is illogical to claim an <b>exclusive</b> ownership over the history of Balhae for any particular modern state. Thus, the fact that sources list Balhae under the history of Korea proves nothing, because they do not indicate that Balhae is <b>exclusively</b> the history of Korea.</p>
<p>As for 高麗別種 -- are you seriously telling us, that instead of looking <b>directly at the primary sources, written in a language we can understand</b>, we should be looking at secondary sources with layers of posterior interpretation or simplification? That we should actually give these secondary sources precedence, and translate the primary sources in a way that we can see <b>is inaccurate</b>, because some of those secondary sources appear to so?</p>

<dd>Are you disputing the verifiability of Britannica Encyclopedias as a source? That maybe be kinda severe there. I think you could take that up at <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a> discussion page, and maybe try to change the wording of the article to <i>Britannica Encyclopedia contains many <b>highly suspect</b> articles, including that of Balhae. Some Britannica articles contradict primary sources, and uses the wrong choice of words</i>. Anywho, since we've established that primary English romanizatino of Balhae is in most cases, Korean (even noted by <a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">user:Yuje</a>, <i>(Chinese Romanizatino is) Although not quite as prevalant, its notable, percentage wise</i> (you may read his post above), I don't know why you still insist Balhae should be primarily romanized in Chinese, in direct disregard of Wikipedia policies and a romanization that is more commonly used. No one deleted the Chinese romanization from Balhae article, it was simply reverted to a more common usage (Korean romanization), as per Wikipedia Policy. As for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Korean_monarchs_d2e2.html#Balhae" title="List of Korean monarchs">List of Korean monarchs#Balhae</a>, the introduction regards that <i>Names are romanized according to the South Korean Revised Romanization of Korean.</i> If there were a seperate article entailing sovereigns of Balhae, I guess Chinese romanizations could be added secondarily. Also, Romanization is a seperate issue from contents of the article. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 08:01, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deiaemeth just further proved here that Britannica was alone in calling Da Zuorong (Tae Cho Yong) a "<b>Korean general</b>" ("Korean" rather than "Koguryo" or "Mohe"). So based on other citations (including Deiaemeth's here), we can say that the Britannica's "Parhae" article is suspicious. This is a big warning flag, and as mentioned in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Advice_specific_to_subject_area" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Advice specific to subject area</a>, it shows that such Britannica articles "are written in batches by freelancers with little expertise." Again, I repeat that this Britannica citation for their "Parhae" article (and its interpretations in the Wikipedia articles) need to be thrown out completely.</dd>

<dd>History is history. Fact is fact. Deiaemeth has repeated over and over again the truth that it was established by a Korean General Tae Cho Yong. Why is this still under discussion? Did anyone here suddenly claim that the history of Balhae shouldn't be included in other countries' (or ethnicities') histories? Obviously not. What's so ridiculous is that history is mentioned so many times on this page, but it's given clearly that it was established by a Korean descent. Yes, it played a part in the history of Manchuria, Japan, China, etc. (and I doubt any one country never has any affect on its surroundings) and it's even possible that the majority of the population of Balhae were of Chinese/Mongol descent. But clearly, it rose from what Goguryo used to be, which is obviously a Korean Kingdom, clearly distinguishing it as a Kingdom of Korean descent.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>About the romanization of the actual words to describe the Kingdom, I support Deiaemeth as well. Balhae and Pohai are pronouncing the same two Chinese characters, and I do agree that Balhae and Pohai are both pronunciations that are plausible for the search. However, I disagree with the notion that because it is written in Chinese, it should be something pronounced with the Chinese pronunciation. This Balhae/Pohai Kingdom is of Korean descent. Koreans will be using this encyclopedia to know of the significance of this kingdom to Korea. It is more important to keep the Balhae romanization there because this article is related to Koreans moreso than the Chinese or the Mongols, because it is something of their descent. I'm not saying let's get rid of all the different pronunciations of those two characters, but I'm saying that the Korean pronunciation is the most important and it's crucial for Koreans to know that it is of Korean descent. I know for sure that I would like to type in "Balhae" over "Pohai" because Pohai is not something you would come across in the Korean tongue.</dd>

<dd>As has been mentioned above, even the part of Korean descent is disputed. Leaving aside completely whether or not one considers Goguryeo to be Korean, the oldest source texts on the matter indicate that the general who founded the kingdom wasn't even ethnically Goguryeo, but an ethnic Mohe from Goguryeo, and this has been repeated in some of the modern western sources which I have provided. And as other sources mentioned, many Korean scholars and historians didn't even consider it part of their history proper until the 19th century when they started making irredentist claims on Manchuria. That's why it's Koreaness has been disputed. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 07:34, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Archaeology has revealed that Balhae was a multi-ethnic state that comprised Koreans and Manchurians. Balhae itself had nothing to do with the Chinese, except for international/intercultural exchanges. There is no grounds for any claims that the term "Bohai" should be used because it was a "Chinese" state. Many of the claims made by Chinese nationalists here in Wikipedia - Nanshu and Yuje being some of the prominent extremists - are ridiculous beyond comprehension. If Balhae is to be addressed by a different terminology on the ground that it wasn't "Korean", I suggest it be in Manchurian, because Chinese had nothing to do with the kingdom, as much as Japan had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Balhae called itself Dae Jin Gook/Goguryeo, while the Chinese called it Bohai(where the term Barhae comes from) and Shillans called it Buk Gook(the northern country).</p>

<dd>And so far, which of my claims have been ridiculous? If you see somewhere where I make a factual error, then by all means, please point it out and I'll try to correct it.

<dd>To the first discussion under this paragraph: actually there is strong evidence that Manchuria was ruled over by Goguryeo before. In cities where Balhae is located, you will find people who have Korean last names (Kim, Lee, Bak), therfore proving that Koreans had settled and ruled Balhae. But the catch is that although these "Koreans" have Korean last names, they have been controlled by the Chinese government for so long, after Koreans moved out of Balhae, these "Koreans" forgot their own language, and now speak Chinese, and, well, really are <b>Chinese</b>, with citezenships and so on. <a href="../../../o/y/o/User%7EOyo321_e9c5.html" title="User:Oyo321">Oyo321</a> 18:08, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not accurate to label Kim and Yi as Chinese last names because they are original Korean names, written in the "Samguksagi" (Three Kingdoms Annals). They chose to write it with the characters 金 and 李 because at the time, Hangul did not exist. Kinda like how every single "Smith"s and "McManus"es out there are not related. Linguistically, this can be proven at least for Kim because Koreans have two pronunciation for the character 金. When it is a last name, it's pronounced Kim (김), but when it is not a last name, it's pronounced Koom(금).</dd>

<p>What's funny is that whether Balhae was a Korean kingdom or not was not in question until modern Chinese state start claiming that it was. Same thing with Goguryuh and Gojoseon.</p>
<p>Christ.. you guys already have the largest population in the world with like 4th (I think?) largest territory in the world and that's not enough? You look through the history between Korea and China, and it's always China trying to claim (through militaristic, 'historic', or political means) that Korea's part of China. Just a price a small nation have to pay for being a neighbor of such a huge expansionist nation, I guess... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.150.238.206 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.150.238.206_1cdc.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.150.238.206">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I suppose the primary tension here comes between people who see history in a regional context and those who see history in a racial, ethnic, and cultural context. In a regional context, claiming Balhae as a Korean kingdom makes no more sense than saying that the Roman Empire was an English empire. Although some of the territories of both larger countries (Rome and Balhae) lie within the present-day territories of both modern countries (England and (North) Korea), most of them lie outside. By the same token, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to call Balhae 'Chinese' either, but it does make sense to say that Balhae is a part of Chinese history, just as it makes sense to say that Balhae is also a part of (North) Korean history. A cultural, ethnic, and racial context, on the other hand, identifies Balhae as Korea (or at least more Korean than Chinese) because that's where the kingdom's cultural roots are -- on the Korean peninsula. People in Balhae lived/looked more like people in Shilla than they did people in China, therefore they were Korean. Of course, to me, it just seems more logical that a historical country, most of which lied within modern China, at least have a Chinese name in its Wiki entry alongside the Korean one, seeing how Balhae is a fairly important part of the history of at least one region in China. --<a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZonath_9ba0.html" title="User:Zonath"><font face="palatino linotype"><font color="green">Zonath</font></font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/o/n/User_talk%7EZonath_d627.html" title="User talk:Zonath"><font color="blue">Yak</font></a></small></sup> 21:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the history of this area isn't as simple as 'X is Chinese' and 'Y is Korean.' If we could deliniate historical states like that, it would make learning world history a lot easier. Like I said above, I think it's fair to say that Balhae was part of Korean history (although most of it lies outside modern-day Korea) because of the ethnic roots of its inhabitants, and because of the ways in which it influenced Korean history. By the same token, however, Balhae was part of Chinese history, as well. Whether or not Balhae was 'Korean' or 'Chinese' is a silly question to ask, since obviously, Balhae belonged to neither -- it was an independant country. Just because something is part of Chinese history doesn't necessarily make it 'Chinese'. --<a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZonath_9ba0.html" title="User:Zonath"><font face="palatino linotype"><font color="green">Zonath</font></font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/o/n/User_talk%7EZonath_d627.html" title="User talk:Zonath"><font color="blue">Yak</font></a></small></sup> 21:19, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seriously Chinese people think everyone is chinese. For example Taiwan. Just because they are a chinese territory doesn't make them chinese. There were natives already dwelling there before the Fuks got there. Secondly, everyone knows that Mongolians are not chinese!!! Why do the chinese argue that they are??? The two languages and its origins ard different.</p>
<p>Now they are basically trying to argue that Koreans are chinese.</p>
<p>Well to be real specific all those "states" in china are not even really chinese. Your only a true chinese if your family is related to the Qin clan or kingdom... whatever. So leave Korea alone. It's already bad enough that the Japs took our culture and get credit for it. and to those japanese...

<dd>Balhae/Bohai are neither Korean nor Chinese. To say that it is one or the other is politically motivated. Having said that, it is OK to have both Chinese and Korean romanizations.

<p>Let the chinese call Balhae Bohai... It's just what they call it in their language.. We say Han Guk they say Han Guo. They are known for claiming that everything is theirs. Balhae is Korean territory. They are just saying that its theirs i think because recently they reclaimed hong kong from GB and they were afraid that korea would reclaim manchuria.. (balhae yanbian). I also noticed that the chinese try to claim all great accomplishments. They are currently doing so with the Ghengis Khan and the Mongolians. Im suprised that they aren't claiming that Sae Jong Dae Wang is chinese and that they sent him to create han gul for the Koreans. I mean Coreans. ( original spelling of Korea is with a C not K.

<p>I would first like to say that Balhae is Korean History. And Jumong is a real person. Chinese people tried to make him into a myth. HOw can you do that when there's evidence? Yah Koreans didn't have an established writting. But what you also dont know is that the hanja used by koreans had different meanings because it was modified as the Koreans were using it. Another thing China recently is trying to claim that Koguryo is also their history. I believe some time in 1990's the Chinese went to the tomb of Gwang gae To Dae Wang and change couple of Hanja to make it completely Chinese. This already indicates that even though Koreans used Chinese characters, the meanings for which they were being used was different than the Chinese. I dont understand!!! I think China's claims of Koguryo and Balhae are only going to unite the two Koreas. I really dont understand why chinese people argue that Koguryo is theirs when an Chinese textbook editor of Bejing named Liu DongMing clearly states the Koguryo is Koreans. By the way Korean as a language was always there. We just didn't have a form of writing. Therefore Kings did use korean Language but Hanja writing until Sae Jong Dae Wang.

What are you talking about? The language was always there! We just didn't have a form of writing. I'm not saying Korean language as in the terms of today.

<p>Also the <b>North Korean language is from Koguyro DynastyGa Eul 07:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</b>. North Koreans call it Pure Korean. Those that are Korean from the South know that this is a pure form of Korean. It means unlike South Korean language, it isn't influenced by Hanja. South Korean and North Korean language in itself however is the same. They just take out Hanja words. Infact from what I have heard, North Koreans dislike the fact that South Koreans are speaking Korean that is derived from Hanja. <a href="http://www.mygoguryeo.net/history03.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mygoguryeo.net/history03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mygoguryeo.net/history03.htm</a></p>
<p>Zonath. You are right!!! Korean Kings didn't use Hangul they used Hanja. But Im trying to point out that some of the characters written in Hanja have different meanings than the Chinese. For example In Chinese, the characters for Dong Xi means "things" but in Hanja we read it as Dong Suh and it means East and West. If you were to show the character Wo to a Korean, they won't be able to read it.Ga Eul 03:12, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another reason why Balhae is Korean is came after the fall of Koguryo, due to the attack of Silla. But Koguryo, baekjae and Silla all existed at the same time. Silla united with Dang and defeated the Koguryo. The survivers of Koguryo restablished themsevles as a nation called Koryo and defeated Silla. Now during this time, of the reign of Koryo, Trades between Muslims began. Muslims had difficulty pornouncing Koryo so they named us on their map as Korea.</p>
<p>They are all also the same RACE (the three kingdoms). IF you learn in ethics or socialogy, you will learn that Koreans are one of the few races called the PURE race. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ga Eul (<a href="../../../g/a/_/User_talk%7EGa_Eul_d4a0.html" title="User talk:Ga Eul">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ga_Eul_4a8c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ga Eul">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I don't think any of my ethics or sociology teachers ever identified Koreans as a 'pure' race (or, indeed, even accepted or espoused the concept of a 'pure' race), especially in light of the placement of Korea and the fact that it's both been invaded a few times, and served as an important center of cultural exchanges.

<p>Correction. But they do say that. If you actually had the time to study Sociology you will know that there races that are considered a pure race. Korea was indeed considered one of the few countries that is a pure race. You can see this in their culture as well. Koreans in general are extremely racist people and they in fact do not like mixing of blood. Hins Ward, the football player from the Steelers recently did a documentry about this whole issue. He goes on to talk about how he and his mother were not excepted as a Korean because of his mom's interracial marriage. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ga Eul (<a href="../../../g/a/_/User_talk%7EGa_Eul_d4a0.html" title="User talk:Ga Eul">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ga_Eul_4a8c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ga Eul">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Racist attitudes aside, considering Koreans (or any other cultural group that isn't on an island in the middle of the ocean) 'pure' flies in the face of a couple thousands of years of history. Korea had significant influx of populations from other parts of NE Asia (Japan, China, Manchuria, Mongolia) at various times during its history, as well as the intermixing that accompanied it. In addition, modern nationalist views of 'pure race' aren't really informative of what attitudes Koreans have traditionally held towards intermixing with people from other cultures, so it's a bit disingenuous to relate modern racist ideals back into the days of Balhae. --<a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZonath_9ba0.html" title="User:Zonath"><font face="palatino linotype"><font color="green">Zonath</font></font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/o/n/User_talk%7EZonath_d627.html" title="User talk:Zonath"><font color="blue">Yak</font></a></small></sup> 00:14, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well thats what I learned... And maybe they were talking of todays terms since Korea is very strict when it comes to giving out their citizenship. Korean gov't doesnt give out citizenships to people unless they have a Korean blood line. Even if the person was born there. The only way they give them a citizenship is if they feel that you can benefit the country. Another thing Koreans are taught that they are originally of Mongolian descendant and this has also been confirmed by Mongolia. So I dont consider that a racial mixture. But you are right we did have trade relations with chinese japanese and arabs therefore somewhere down in history we are not pure.</p>
<p>P.S. Just wanted to let you know that I am happy to have these friendly conversations with you. As you can already see that Im Korean. hehe. If I say things to upset you I am terribly sorry. I have no intentions of hurting feelings. I just want people to know what Korea is about too. We are always ignored or unappreciated compared to the Japanese and the Chinese. It hurts to not get recognition. I mean everyone knows that Kimchi is Korean but still you see the Japanese arguing that its theirs.

Zonath about Taiwan... I read something that you said about Taiwan. Actually they want to be independant fron China. I no this because of my boyfriend. He is native taiwanese ( not fj). His family only speak Taiwanese and hates anyone who speaks mandarin. Their country is very divided. There are two different groups right now , the only taiwanese speaking and only mandarin speaking. My friend went there last year. She only speaks Mandarin because she was born in NY. Well she tried to buy something there and tried to communicate with the people there with Mandarin. She told me that the people there pretended to no hear her and ignored her until someone translated for her. Just thought you wanted to know. Oh Since I think you know more about history maybe you would know but I heard that Native Taiwanese were actually Paken Indians and that they have likes to Mongolia. Is that true? Im asking because Native Taiwanese, Koreans, and Mongolians look extremely alike. Taiwanese language actually sounds like a mixture of chinese and Korean.Ga Eul 05:39, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about taking so long to respond, but I have been a bit busy lately. About Taiwan: You're right that there is a disenfranchized minority consisting of native Taiwanese who would rather expel the ethnic Chinese from their island and declare their independance. In stting that Taiwan considered itself a part of China, I was referring to the official position of the Taiwanese government rather than that of ethnic Taiwanese. I'm not incredibly well-versed on Taiwanese history, however, so can't really answer your other questions.</dd>

<dd>Re Korean citizenship: You're partly right... To be considered a 'native born' Korean with citizenship, one generally had to have a Korean father (although the ethnicity/race of the mother is somewhat less important). On the other hand, I believe that distinction has eroded somewhat since the abolition of the family register system, so that now, either a Korean father <i>or</i> a Korean mother could pass on citizenship to their native-born children. Of course, the option of naturalizing as a Korean citizen isn't restricted on account of race, although there are some pretty difficult hurdles to jump. At any rate, this is getting pretty far off-topic (as far as this article is concerned), so I'll post any further answers to this conversation on your talk page. --<a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZonath_9ba0.html" title="User:Zonath"><font face="palatino linotype"><font color="green">Zonath</font></font></a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/o/n/User_talk%7EZonath_d627.html" title="User talk:Zonath"><font color="blue">Yak</font></a></small></sup> 00:24, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
