<p>The first attempt to establish a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> department in Baltimore occurred in 1784, nearly 60 <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year.html" title="Year">years</a> after the founding of the original town, when a guard force of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constable.html" title="Constable">constables</a> were authorized to enforce town laws and <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrest.html" title="Arrest">arrest</a> those in violation. In 1845 the current Baltimore Police Department was founded by the state <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislature.html" title="Legislature">legislature</a> “to provide for a better security for life and property in the City of Baltimore". In 1861, during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">U.S. Civil War</a>, the police department was taken over by the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_government_of_the_United_States_6043.html" title="Federal government of the United States">federal government</a> and run by the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_the_United_States_8982.html" title="Military of the United States">U.S. Military</a> until it was turned back over to the legislature in 1862.</p>
<p>BPD has evolved its <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a> fighting technology and techniques over the years beginning with the introduction of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_box.html" title="Police box">call boxes</a> in 1855. Other major technological upgrades include the introduction of the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphonse_Bertillon_37bd.html" title="Alphonse Bertillon">Bertillion</a> system in 1896, police <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> communications in 1933, a police <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laboratory.html" title="Laboratory">laboratory</a> in 1950, computerized booking procedures and <a href="../../../9/-/1/9-1-1.html" title="9-1-1">911</a> emergency systems in 1985, the first ever <a href="../../../3/-/1/3-1-1.html" title="3-1-1">311</a> non emergency system and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed-circuit_television.html" title="Closed-circuit television">CCTV</a> cameras (like those in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>) in 1996, and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/CompStat_1eae.html" title="CompStat">CitiStat</a> system in 2000.</p>
<p>As of a 2000 <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sample_survey.html" title="Sample survey">survey</a> published by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Justice_619c.html" title="United States Department of Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a> in 2003, BPD is the 8th largest <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipality.html" title="Municipality">municipal</a> police department in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> with a total of 3,034 <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_officer.html" title="Police officer">police officers</a>. Comparatively as of the 2000 U.S. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census.html" title="Census">census</a> Baltimore ranked as the 17th largest city in the United States with a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population.html" title="Population">population</a> of 651,154.</p>
<p>The first BPD officer to die in the line of duty occurred when Sergeant William Jourdan was shot and killed by an unknown <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun.html" title="Gun">gunman</a> during the first city council <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election.html" title="Election">elections</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">October 14</a> 1857. Night Watchman George Workner was the first law enforcement officer to be killed in the city when he was stabbed during an escape attempt by nine <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">inmates</a> in the Baltimore <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_jail.html" title="County jail">Jail</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_14.html" title="March 14">March 14</a> 1808, but his death predates the founding of the department. As of 2006 there have been 118 police officers killed in the line of duty, which is by far the largest total in Maryland. The next largest total belongs to the Maryland State Police, with 39 <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_officer.html" title="Police officer">troopers</a> killed in the line of duty as of 2005.</p>

<p>BPD, like many other police departments in the United States, has experienced negative publicity in recent years due to a few high profile <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_corruption.html" title="Police corruption">corruption</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_brutality.html" title="Police brutality">brutality</a> allegations, including the 2005 arrest of Officers William A. King and Antonio L. Murray by the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_d581.html" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> for federal <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_drug.html" title="Illegal drug">drug</a> conspiracy charges.</p>
<p>Former Commissioner <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Norris_f9d0.html" title="Ed Norris">Ed Norris</a> was indicted on three charges by US Attorney Thomas DiBiagio. Two of the counts charged Norris had made illegal personal expenditures from the Baltimore Police Department’s supplemental account. The third count alleged that he had lied on a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortgage.html" title="Mortgage">mortgage</a> application, stating that approximately $9,000 he received from his <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father.html" title="Father">father</a> was not a gift—as was stated in the loan papers—but a loan. As part of a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> in May 2004, Norris pleaded guilty to the first two counts and was sentenced to six months in <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_prison.html" title="Federal prison">federal prison</a>, six months of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_detention.html" title="Home detention">home detention</a>, and 500 hours of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_service.html" title="Community service">community service</a>, which <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">Judge</a> Dick Bennett said must be served in Baltimore. The plea bargain avoided a possible 30-year sentence on the mortgage <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a> charge.</p>
<p>A rash of high profile corruption and brutality allegations have surfaced in late 2005 and early 2006, including the suspensions and arrests of Southwestern District flex squad officers for the alleged <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> of a 22 year old woman they had taken into custody for illegal possession of <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcotic.html" title="Narcotic">narcotics</a>.</p>
<p>Stories surfaced about flex squad officers planting evidence on citizens. <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">Murder</a> charges were dropped by the city when it was revealed that the gunman was dropped off in rival <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gang.html" title="Gang">gang</a> territory after a police <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interrogation.html" title="Interrogation">interrogation</a> in a squad <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">car</a>. The man was beaten badly and exacted his revenge the next day. The squad's role in the shooting prompted State's Attorney <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricia_Jessamy_f9a4.html" title="Patricia Jessamy">Patricia Jessamy</a> to drop the charges.</p>
<p>Amid all this, intense criticism has surfaced regarding so-called "stop-and-frisk" arrest procedures and their alleged misuse by the BPD. The president of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternal_Order_of_Police_315b.html" title="Fraternal Order of Police">Fraternal Order of Police</a> Lodge 3, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant.html" title="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> Paul Blair, has stated that there are arrest <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quota_Share_503b.html" title="Quota Share">quotas</a> at work in the police department which lead to Baltimore's astronomical arrest rate, and to roughly 1/3 of the charges being dismissed by the State's Attorney's office.</p>
<p>Many of these arrests were for "quality of life" violations such as drinking in public, loitering and public urination. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_citation.html" title="Criminal citation">Criminal citations</a> have generally been used for these types of offences however, BPD General Orders and State law forbid these being issued to persons not possessing a valid state issued identification. In cases where a <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defendant.html" title="Defendant">defendant</a> does not have the required identification, the officer may make an arrest.</p>
<p>BPD was portrayed in the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> series <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Homicide%7E_Life_on_the_Street_4b34.html" title="Homicide: Life on the Street">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></i> which ran for seven seasons and spawned a TV movie. The series is based on the book <i><a href="../../../a/_/y/Homicide%7E_A_Year_on_the_Killing_Streets_691f.html" title="Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets">Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</a></i> by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Simon_0c5b.html" title="David Simon">David Simon</a> and was produced by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Levinson_b15f.html" title="Barry Levinson">Barry Levinson</a>. The <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Box_Office_11e2.html" title="Home Box Office">HBO</a> original series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wire_%28television%29_0fac.html" title="The Wire (television)">The Wire</a></i> also features the department and was created by David Simon. At times, there has also been crossover in stories and characters from <i><a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_%26_Order_27ea.html" title="Law &amp; Order">Law &amp; Order</a></i> and <i>Homicide: Life on the Street</i>.</p>

<p>In the early 1960's the Baltimore City Park Police were absorbed into the Baltimore Police Department. In 2005, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City Police were disbanded and operations taken over by the Baltimore Police Department. Housing Authority officers, if they desired, had to apply for jobs with the city police losing their time and seniority they had from previous employment with the Housing Authority of Baltimore City. There is current talk of merging the Baltimore Schools Police into the department as well though it is unclear if those officers would have to reapply for positions within the Baltimore Police Department and what if any job benefits such as seniority and pension they might be able to bring with them in the new position.</p>
