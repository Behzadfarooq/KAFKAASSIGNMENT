<p>The most beloved, revered, and highly esteemed of all C.O.P.S., Bulletproof is a selfless, strong, caring, dedicated leader, an inspiration to the C.O.P.S. team, who's extremely loyal to his men, his city with all of its inhabitants, and his job, and never lets them down, not even once.</p>
<p>Bulletproof is, hands down, the best <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_government_of_the_United_States_6043.html" title="Federal government of the United States">Federal</a> Agent there is as well as the founder and leader of C.O.P.S. He is an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>, the first African American leader and the only C.O.P.S. officer to appear in each and every episode in the series. He is easily distinguished by dark <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunglasses.html" title="Sunglasses">sunglasses</a> he wears all the time except on one occasion when he's at the <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> bed bandaged up like a <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mummy.html" title="Mummy">mummy</a> after being seriously injured in an accident set up by Big Boss' Crooks in Part 1 of <i>The Case of C.O.P.S. File #1</i>. Afterwards, the only time when he's seen with his sunglasses off is when he's working at the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desk.html" title="Desk">desk</a> in his <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office.html" title="Office">office</a>. Two examples of this can be found in <i>The Case of The Big Bad Boxoids</i> and <i>The Case of The Missing Memory</i>.</p>
<p>He's also distinguished easily by his <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trench_coat.html" title="Trench coat">Trench coat</a> covering his stainless steel cybernetic armor suit that has a special <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> jack, allowing him to control machines just by plugging himself into them. An example of this can be found in Part 2 of <i>The Case of C.O.P.S. File #1</i>. Also, he has a special <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compartment.html" title="Compartment">compartment</a> located in the <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdomen.html" title="Abdomen">abdomen</a> area of the torso that stores up special disks that can short circuit any robot or machine the crooks have up in their <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal.html" title="Arsenal">arsenal</a>. An example of this can be found in <i>The Case of The Bogus Justice Machines</i> where Bulletproof uses the disks to destroy the instant justice robots sent to take him and his C.O.P.S. down by Vargas at the Vetrocon factory. Bulletproof has short black hair and wears a yellow shirt with a narrow black tie, carrying a gun holster with a gun inside of his Trench coat on his left shoulder (in the cartoon), and carries a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handcuff.html" title="Handcuff">handcuff</a> <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suitcase.html" title="Suitcase">suitcase</a> (in the toy series). He also wears reddish pants, and black and white shoes (brown pants and brown and white shoes in the toys series and the comics). Sometimes he wears an orange hat, as shown in <i>The Case of Big Boss' Bye Bye</i></p>

<p>Special Agent Baldwin P. Vess is sent to Empire City by Mayor Davis to take down one of Empire City's most notorious criminals led by the criminal mastermind <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Boss_and_Scratch_a1aa.html" title="Big Boss and Scratch">Big Boss</a>. Unfortunately, Vess got injured badly. Two versions were made on how he got injured by the Crooks: the first involved being sandwiched in between a delivery fish van and a brick wall that collapsed on him afterwards (as told in the first part of <i>The Case of C.O.P.S. File #1</i>) and the second having him being blown away when <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbo_Tu-Tone_cb88.html" title="Turbo Tu-Tone">Turbo Tu-Tone</a> fired a <a href="../../../b/a/z/Bazooka.html" title="Bazooka">bazooka</a> at the 647 Precinct on the floor where Vess was at as told in the comic adaptation. Vess had to be taken to a nearby <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> where the doctors gave him a special armor plated cybernetic torso that allows him to resist bullets. While at the hospital he encounter <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Krusher_1f3d.html" title="Rock Krusher">Rock Krusher</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserko.html" title="Berserko">Berserko</a>, Big Boss' dim-witted <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nephew.html" title="Nephew">nephew</a> (Berserko, Turbo, and Ms. Demeanor in the comic adaptation), who is sent by Big Boss to try to take him down by firing rifles at him, but Vess' torso resisted the bullets allowing Bulletproof (as he was called later on) to get the best of him while Rock Krusher escapes. While staying at the hospital, Bulletproof sent out <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">Police</a> <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">Sergeant</a>, P.J. O'Malley (Codename: <a href="../../../l/o/n/LongArm_6762.html" title="LongArm">LongArm</a>) and Rookie Officer, Donny Brooks (Codename: HardTop) to round up the best law enforcers from all over the country. With these men and women, including LongArm, Hardtop, and Tina Cassidy (Codename: Mainframe), Special Agent Baldwin Vess (Codename: Bulletproof) became the founder and commander of C.O.P.S.</p>

<p>In this episode, Bulletproof came face to face with a clone version of himself that <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_BadVibes_and_Buzzbomb_114f.html" title="Doctor BadVibes and Buzzbomb">Dr. BadVibes</a> had created: a robotic clone version of Bulletproof that was controlled and operated by a small robot named Waldo which tried to use him to replace the real Bulletproof and give C.O.P.S. a hard time. Turbo Tu-Tone snook into Bulletproof's green car and seized control over it leaving Bulletproof trapped inside it all the way to his <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garage.html" title="Garage">garage</a> where Turbo used a large power <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnet.html" title="Magnet">magnet</a> to pin Bulletproof way up in the air.</p>
<p>Then, Waldo went to the precinct and assume the role of the real Bulletproof with Big Boss and BadVibes keeping a close watch on him through the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monitor.html" title="Monitor">monitor</a>. When the <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a> is brought out for the C.O.P.S. to drink, Waldo, out of curiosity, splashes hot coffee in his <a href="../../../e/a/r/Ear.html" title="Ear">ear</a> for an unpleasant experience to see what coffee is like, not liking it at all, and then smashes the cup on the table. The C.O.P.S. looked up. Waldo assures them that everything is fine.</p>
<p>He then tried to pet Blitz, Bowser's robot dog companion, who came in wanting for attention. Blitz, however, who knows the real Bulletproof, is the only COP member who can easily identify Waldo as a faker. He growled and barked at him when Waldo tried to reach out and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet.html" title="Pet">pet</a> him. Noticing that something could be wrong with him, Bowser went to check on Blitz's <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuitry.html" title="Circuitry">circuitry</a> and hears a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distress_signal.html" title="Distress signal">distress signal</a> coming from Blitz being given out by the real Bulletproof, who sends out a distress signal from his cybernetic <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torso.html" title="Torso">torso</a>.</p>
<p>As Bowser and Blitz raced to where the signal was coming from, Big Boss orders Turbo to get rid of the real Bulletproof for good. Turbo does just that by sending a small robotic <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insect.html" title="Insect">insect</a> to destroy him while he goes out to rob a bank. Fortunately, Bowser and Blitz arrived right in the nick of time to rescue Bulletproof from being done in by the bug. The bug tried to make a getaway but Blitz caught the bug and destroyed it. Bowser freed Bulletproof from a huge magnet and together, the three C.O.P.S. raced back to the precinct. Back at the precinct, Mainframe reported to the C.O.P.S. that there's a <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_robbery.html" title="Bank robbery">bank robbery</a> taking place at this moment. But, Waldo claimed that the report was a fake and ordered them not to respond. When the C.O.P.S. begin to protest, Waldo starts yelling at them, threatening <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspension_%28punishment%29.html" title="Suspension (punishment)">suspension</a> if they don't do as he says. Taken aback by the harshness of Waldo, The C.O.P.S. began to suspect that this is not the Bulletproof they know and love. The real Bulletproof would never yell at them, restrain them from doing their jobs, nor give out harsh, cruel orders to them. Just then, the real Bulletproof, Bowser, and Blitz arrived.</p>
<p>"There the impostor! Arrest him!" Waldo demanded. "No way!" Mainframe called out defiantly. Blitz barks aggressively at Waldo, who's in fact the real impostor. "I'll show you who the impostor is!" the real Bulletproof yelled back, and a fight between the two Bulletproofs ensued that ended shortly afterwards with Bulletproof tricking Waldo into flying through the window and falling five stories down to the concrete pavement, screaming like Big Boss all the way. With that, Bulletproof sent the faker to the scrap heap.</p>
<p>"Bulletproof?" Hardtop asks as they point to him, seeing Blitz running up to greet Bulletproof and receive a warm stroke from him.</p>
<p>Bulletproof: "There is a robbery in progress at the Empire National Bank. Proceed there at once. IT'S CRIME FIGHTING TIME!"</p>
<p>The C.O.P.S. cheered, happy that the real Bulletproof has returned. With that, the C.O.P.S. gleefully headed off, arriving at the bank just in time to bag Turbo and send him all the way to the slammer.</p>
<p>Mainframe: "Welcome back, sir."</p>
