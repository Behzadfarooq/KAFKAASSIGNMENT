<p>There are three main types of balloon aircraft:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_air_balloon.html" title="Hot air balloon">hot air balloons</a> obtain their buoyancy by heating the air inside the balloon. They are the most common type of balloon aircraft.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_balloon.html" title="Gas balloon">gas balloons</a> are inflated with a gas of lower molecular weight than the ambient atmosphere. Most gas balloons operate with the internal pressure of the gas being the same as the surrounding atmosphere. There is a special type of gas balloon called <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpressure_balloons.html" title="Superpressure balloons">superpressure balloons</a> that can operate with the lifting gas at pressure that exceeds the pressure of the surrounding air with the objective of limiting or eliminating the loss of gas from day-time heating. Gas balloons are filled with gases such as:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> - not widely used for aircraft since the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindenburg_disaster.html" title="Hindenburg disaster">Hindenburg disaster</a> because of high flammability (except for some sport balloons as well as nearly all unmanned scientific and weather balloons).</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/e/l/Helium.html" title="Helium">helium</a> - the gas used today for all airships and most manned balloons in the United States</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonia.html" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> - used infrequently due to its caustic qualities and limited lift</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal_gas.html" title="Coal gas">coal gas</a> - used in the early days of ballooning; it is highly flammable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/o/z/Rozi%C3%A8re_balloon.html" title="Rozière balloon">Rozière balloons</a> use both heated and unheated lifting gases. The most common modern use of this type of balloon is for long distance record flights such as the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumnavigation.html#Notable_aerial_circumnavigations" title="Circumnavigation">recent circumnavigations</a>.</li>

<p>The hot air balloon <a href="../../../k/o/n/Kongming_lantern.html" title="Kongming lantern">Kongming lantern</a> was developed for military communication service round about the 2nd or 3rd century AD in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>.Later this kind of Hot air balloon were very popular in children and in carnival.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that some ancient civilizations developed manned hot air balloon flight. For example it has been proposed that the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazca_lines.html" title="Nazca lines">Nazca lines</a> (which are best seen from the air) presuppose some form of manned flight, and a balloon was the only possible available technology that could have achieved this. Julian Nott designed and built a balloon using woven cotton fabric and a Torta reed gondola, both readily available to the peoples who made the Nazca lines. Heating the air in the balloon with a wood fire, Nott flew over the Nazca Plains. He comments that there is no evidence of any kind that that ancient peoples did fly but this flight proved beyond doubt that most early civilizations <i>could</i> have flown: all they needed was a loom and fire.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/0/1709.html" title="1709">1709</a> in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartolomeu_de_Gusm%C3%A3o_4d0d.html" title="Bartolomeu de Gusmão">Bartolomeu de Gusmão</a> made a balloon filled with heated air rise inside a room. He also made a balloon named <i>Passarola</i> (Port. <i>Big bird</i>) and attempted to lift himself from Saint George Castle, in Lisbon, but only managed to harmlessly fall about one kilometre away.</p>
<p>Following <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Cavendish_b6b8.html" title="Henry Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a>'s work on <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, of <a href="../../../1/7/6/1766.html" title="1766">1766</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Black_cfaf.html" title="Joseph Black">Joseph Black</a> proposed that a balloon filled with hydrogen would be able to rise in the air.</p>

<p>The first recorded manned balloon flight was made in a hot air balloon built by the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgolfier_brothers.html" title="Montgolfier brothers">Montgolfier brothers</a> on November 21, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1783.html" title="1783">1783</a>. The flight started in Paris and reached a height of 500 feet or so. The pilots, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Pil%C3%A2tre_de_Rozier_05b2.html" title="Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier">Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier</a> and Francois Laurent (the Marquis of d’ Arlanders) covered about 5 1/2 miles in 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Only a few days later, on December 1, 1783, Professor <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Charles_7e43.html" title="Jacques Charles">Jacques Charles</a> and Nicholas Louis Robert made the first gas balloon flight. Like the first hot air balloon flight, this flight left from Paris. The hydrogen filled balloon flew to almost 2000 feet, stayed aloft for over 2 hours and covered a distance of 27 miles, landing in the small town of Nesle.</p>
<p>Once flight was shown to be possible, the next great challenge was to fly across the English Channel. The feat was accomplished on January 7, 1785 by <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Pierre_Blanchard_7cdd.html" title="Jean-Pierre Blanchard">Jean-Pierre Blanchard</a>, a Frenchman, and American John Jeffries, who sponsored the flight.</p>
<p>The first aircraft disaster occurred in May 1785 when the town of <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tullamore.html" title="Tullamore">Tullamore</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/2E/Co._Offaly_f136.html" title="Co. Offaly">Co. Offaly</a> <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> was seriously damaged when the crash of a balloon resulted in a fire that burned down about 100 houses giving the town the unusual distinction of being home to the world's first aviation disaster. To this day, the town shield depicts a phoenix rising from the ashes.</p>
<p>Blanchard went on to make the first manned flight of a balloon in America on January 9, 1793. His hydrogen filled balloon took off from a prison yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The flight reached 5,800 feet and landed in Gloucester County in New Jersey. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> was among the guests observing the take off.</p>
<p>Gas balloons became the most common type from the 1790s until the 1960s.</p>
<p>The first steerable balloon (also known as a <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airship.html" title="Airship">dirigible</a>) was attempted by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Giffard_47fc.html" title="Henri Giffard">Henri Giffard</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1852.html" title="1852">1852</a>. Powered by a steam engine it was too slow to be effective. Like heavier than air flight, the internal combustion engine made dirigibles, especially blimps, practical, starting in the late nineteenth century.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Yost_1e51.html" title="Ed Yost">Ed Yost</a> reinvented the design of hot air balloons in the late 1950s using rip-stop nylon fabrics and high powered propane burners to create the modern hot air balloon. His first flight of such a balloon, lasting 25 minutes and covering 3 miles, occurred on October 22, 1960 in Bruning, Nebraska.</p>
<p>Yost's improved design for hot air balloons triggered the modern sport balloon movement. Today, hot air balloons are much more common than gas balloons.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balloon.html" title="Balloon">balloon</a> is conceptually the simplest of all flying machines. The balloon is a fabric envelope filled with a gas that is <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighter_than_air.html" title="Lighter than air">lighter than the surrounding atmosphere</a>. As the entire balloon is less dense than its surroundings, it rises, taking along with it a basket, attached underneath, that carries passengers or payload.</p>
<p>The first balloons capable of carrying passengers used hot air to obtain buoyancy and were built by the brothers <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgolfier_brothers.html" title="Montgolfier brothers">Josef and Etienne Montgolfier</a> in Annonay, France.</p>
<p>Balloons using the light gas hydrogen for buoyancy were flown less than a month later. They were invented by Professor <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Charles_7e43.html" title="Jacques Charles">Jacques Charles</a> and first flown on December 1, 1783. Gas balloons have greater lift and can be flown much longer than hot air, so gas balloons dominated ballooning for the next 200 years. In the 19th century, it was common to use <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_gas.html" title="Town gas">town gas</a> to fill balloons; it was not as light as pure hydrogen gas, but was much cheaper and readily available.</p>
<p>The third balloon type was invented by <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pil%C3%A2tre_de_Rozier_6f14.html" title="Pilâtre de Rozier">Pilâtre de Rozier</a> and is a hybrid of a hot air and a gas balloon. Gas balloons have an advantage of being able to fly for a long time and hot air balloons have an advantage of being able to easily change altitude so the <a href="../../../r/o/z/Rozier_balloon.html" title="Rozier balloon">Rozier balloon</a> was a hydrogen balloon with a separate hot air balloon attached. In 1785, Pilâtre de Rozier took off in an attempt to fly across the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> but the balloon exploded a half-hour into the flight. This accident earned de Rozier the title "The First to Fly and the First to Die". It wasn't until the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> that technology once again allowed the Rozier balloons to become feasible.</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Pierre_Blanchard_7cdd.html" title="Jean-Pierre Blanchard">Jean-Pierre Blanchard</a> made the first piloted balloon flight in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">January 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1793.html" title="1793">1793</a>. Although a balloon has no propulsion system, a degree of directional control is possible through making the balloon rise or sink in altitude to find favorable wind directions.</p>
<p>Both the hot-air, or Montgolfière, balloon and the gas balloon are still in common use. Montgolfière balloons are relatively inexpensive as they do not require high-grade materials for their envelopes, and they are popular for balloonist sport activity.</p>
<p>Light gas balloons are predominant in scientific applications, as they are capable of reaching much higher altitudes for much longer periods of time. They are generally filled with helium. Although hydrogen has more lifting power, it is explosive in an atmosphere full of oxygen. With a few exceptions, scientific balloon missions are unmanned.</p>
<p>There are two types of light-gas balloons: zero-pressure and superpressure. Zero-pressure balloons are the traditional form of light-gas balloon. They are partially inflated with the light gas before launch, with the gas pressure the same both inside and outside the balloon. As the zero-pressure balloon rises, its gas expands to maintain the zero pressure difference, and the balloon's envelope swells.</p>
<p>At night, the gas in a zero-pressure balloon cools and contracts, causing the balloon to sink. A zero-pressure balloon can only maintain altitude by releasing gas when it goes too high, where the expanding gas can threaten to rupture the envelope, or releasing ballast when it sinks too low. Loss of gas and ballast limits the endurance of zero-pressure balloons to a few days.</p>
<p><br />
A superpressure balloon, in contrast, has a tough and inelastic envelope that is filled with light gas to pressure higher than that of the external atmosphere, and then sealed. The superpressure balloon cannot change size greatly, and so maintains a generally constant volume. The superpressure balloon maintains an altitude of constant density in the atmosphere, and can maintain flight until gas leakage gradually brings it down.</p>
<p>Superpressure balloons offer flight endurance of months, rather than days. In fact, in typical operation an Earth-based superpressure balloon mission is ended by a command from ground control to open the envelope, rather than by natural leakage of gas.</p>
<p>For <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_transport.html" title="Air transport">air transport</a> balloons must contain a gas lighter than the surrounding air. There are two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>hot air balloons: filled with hot air, which by heating becomes lighter than the surrounding air; they have been used to carry human passengers since the 1790s;</li>
<li>balloons filled with:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> - highly flammable (see <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindenburg_disaster.html" title="Hindenburg disaster">Hindenburg disaster</a>)</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/e/l/Helium.html" title="Helium">helium</a> - safe if used properly, but very expensive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Large helium balloons are used as high flying vessels to carry scientific instruments (as do <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather_balloon.html" title="Weather balloon">weather balloons</a>), or even human passengers.</p>

<p>The first military use of a balloon was at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fleurus_%281794%29_7061.html" title="Battle of Fleurus (1794)">Battle of Fleurus</a> in 1794, when <i>L'Entreprenant</i> was used by French Revolutionary troops to watch the movements of the enemy. On the 2 April 1794, an aeronauts corps was created in the French army&#160;; however, given the logistical problems linked with the production of hydrogen on the battlefield (it required constructing ovens and pouring water on white-hot iron), the corps was disbanded in 1799.</p>

<p>The first major-scale use of balloons in the military occurred during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Army_Balloon_Corps_adc9.html" title="Union Army Balloon Corps">Union Army Balloon Corps</a> established and organized by Prof. <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thaddeus_S._C._Lowe_f50f.html" title="Thaddeus S. C. Lowe">Thaddeus S. C. Lowe</a> in the summer of 1861. The balloons were inflated with <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_gas.html" title="Town gas">coke gas</a> from municipal services and then walked out to the battlefield, an arduous and inefficient operation as the balloons had to be returned to the city every four days for re-inflation. Eventually <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_production.html" title="Hydrogen production">hydrogen gas generators</a>, a compact system of tanks and copper plumbing, were constructed which converted the combining of iron filings and <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulphuric_acid.html" title="Sulphuric acid">sulphuric acid</a> to hydrogen. The generators were easily transported with the uninflated balloons to the field on a standard buckboard. In all Lowe built seven balloons that were fit for military service.</p>
<p>The first application thought useful for balloons was map making from aerial vantage points, thus Lowe's first assignment was with the Topographical Engineers. General Irvin McDowell, commander of the Grand Army of the Potomac, realized their value in aerial reconnaissance and had Lowe, who at the time was using his personal balloon the <i><a href="../../../e/n/t/Enterprise_%28balloon%29.html" title="Enterprise (balloon)">Enterprise</a></i>, called up to the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run_8962.html" title="First Battle of Bull Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a>. In a later exercise, Lowe was called to act as a Forward Artillery Observer (FAO) from which aerial station he was able to direct artillery fire by a set order of flag signals, from an unseen position, onto a Confederate encampment. FAO is still used today from either ground or aerial positions.</p>
<p>Lowe's first military balloon, the <i>Eagle</i> was ready by October 1, 1861. It was called into service immediately to be towed to Lewinsville, Virginia, without any gas generator which took longer to build. The trip began after inflation in Washington and turned into a 12-mile, 12-hour excursion that was upended by a gale force wind which ripped the aerostat from its netting and sent it sailing to the coast. Balloon activities were suspended until all balloons and gas generators were completed</p>
<p>With his ability to inflate balloons from remote stations, Lowe, his new balloon the <i>Washington</i> and two gas generators were loaded onto a converted coal barge the <i>George Washington Parke Custis</i>. As he was towed down the Potomac, Lowe was able to ascend and observe the battlefield as it moved inward on the heavily forested peninsula. This would be the military's first claim of an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>The Union Army Balloon Corps enjoyed more success in the battles of the Peninsula Campaign than the Army of the Potomac it sought to support. The general military attitude toward the use of balloons deteriorated, and by August 1863 the Balloon Corps was disbanded.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balloon_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Edit section: Confederate Army uses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Confederate Army uses</span></h4>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_Army_35c0.html" title="Confederate Army">Confederate Army</a> made use of balloons, but they were gravely hampered by supplies due to the embargoes. They were forced to fashion their balloons from gaily colored silk dress-making material, and their use was limited by the infrequent supply of gas in Richmond. By the Summer of 1863, all balloon reconnaissance of the Civil War had ceased.</p>

<p>In Britain during July 1863 experimental balloon ascents for reconnaissance purposes were conducted by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Engineers_bc48.html" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> on behalf of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a>, but although the experiments were successful it was considered not worth pursuing further because it was too expensive. However by 1888 a School of Ballooning was established at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatham%2C_Medway_e556.html" title="Chatham, Medway">Chatham, Medway</a> Kent. It moved to Stanhope Lines, <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldershot.html" title="Aldershot">Aldershot</a> in 1890 when a balloon section and depot were formed as permanent units of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Engineers_bc48.html" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> establishment.</p>
<p>Balloons were used by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Engineers_bc48.html" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> for reconnaissance and observation purposes during the Bechuanaland Expedition (1885), the Sudan Expedition (1885) and during the Anglo Boer War (1899-1802). On 5 October 1907 Colonel John Capper (late Royal Engineers) and team flew the military airship <i>Nulli Secundus</i> from <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farnborough.html" title="Farnborough">Farnborough</a> round At Paul's Cathedral in London and back with a view to raising public interest.</p>
<p>Hydrogen-filled balloons were also widely used during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> (1914-1918) to detect enemy troop movements and to direct artillery fire. Observers phoned their reports to officers on the ground who then relayed the information to those who needed it.</p>
<p>Because artillery was such an important factor in World War I, balloons were frequent targets of opposing aircraft. Though balloon companies were protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolling fighters, casualties were frequently heavy. One reason for this was the hydrogen that filled the balloons was highly flammable, and planes assigned to attack enemy balloons were often equipped with <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Explosive_Incendiary_Armor_Piercing_Ammunition_b12c.html" title="High Explosive Incendiary/Armor Piercing Ammunition">incendiary bullets</a>, for the purpose of igniting the balloon.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeronaut_Badge_2ca3.html" title="Aeronaut Badge">Aeronaut Badge</a> was established by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> in World War I to denote service members who were qualified balloon pilots. Observation balloons were retained well after the Great War, being used in the Russo-Finnish conflicts (1939-40 and 1941-45).</p>
