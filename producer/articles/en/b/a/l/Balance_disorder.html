<p>Balance is the result of a number of body systems working together. Specifically in order to achieve balance the eyes (visual system), ears (vestibular system) and the body's sense of where it is in space (proprioception) need to be intact. Also the brain, which compiles this information, needs to be functioning normally.</p>
<p>The semicircular canals, found within the vestibular apparatus, let us know when we are in a rotary (circular) motion. The semicircular canals are fluid-filled. Motion of the fluid tells us if we are moving. The vestibule is the region of the inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochlea.html" title="Cochlea">cochlea</a> (the hearing organ). The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).</p>
<p>Movement of fluid in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the direction and speed of rotation of the head - for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs that are part of the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.</p>
<p>The balance system works with the visual and skeletal systems (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to maintain orientation or balance. For example, visual signals are sent to the brain about the body's position in relation to its surroundings. These signals are processed by the brain, and compared to information from the vestibular, visual and the skeletal systems.</p>

<p>Problems with balance occur whenever there is a disruption in any of the vestibular, visual, proprioceptive or cognitive systems. Symptoms of a balance disorder may include dizziness, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertigo_%28medical%29.html" title="Vertigo (medical)">vertigo</a> (spinning), disequilibrium (off balance and falls), pre-syncope (light headedness). Abnormalities in balance function may indicate a wide range of pathologies from causes like low blood pressure to stroke or brain tumors.</p>
<p>Many different terms are often used to describe what is collectively known as dizziness. Common descriptions include words such as lightheaded, floating, whoozy, giddy, confused, helpless or fuzzy. Vertigo, Disequilibrium and Pre-syncope are the terms in use by most doctors.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertigo_%28medical%29.html" title="Vertigo (medical)">Vertigo</a></b></p>
<p><i>The word "vertigo" comes from the Latin "vertere", to turn + the suffix "-igo", a condition = a condition of turning about.</i></p>
<p>Vertigo is a specific medical term used to describe the sensation of spinning or having the room spin about you. Most people find vertigo very disturbing and report associated nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../e/q/u/Equilibrioception.html" title="Equilibrioception">Disequilibrium</a></b></p>
<p>Disequilibrium is the sensation of being off balance, and is most often characterized by frequent falls in a specific direction. This condition is <b>not</b> often associated with nausea or vomiting.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../f/a/i/Fainting.html" title="Fainting">Pre-syncope</a></b></p>
<p>Pre-syncope is most often described as lightheaded or feeling faint. Syncope, by contrast, is actually fainting.</p>

<li><a href="../../../b/e/n/Benign_Paroxysmal_Positional_Vertigo_6a7d.html" title="Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo">Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo</a> (BPPV) - The most common cause of vertigo. Typically described as a brief, intense sensation of spinning that occurs because of a specific change in the position of head. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting out of bed in the morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced crystals called otoconia. Otoconia are normally found in the utricle and saccule and are used to sense movement. When loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement, causing a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, this is interpreted as spinning.</li>

<p>When balance is impaired, an individual has difficulty maintaining orientation. For example, an individual may experience the "room spinning" and may not be able to walk without staggering, or may not even be able to stand. Some of the symptoms a person with a balance disorder may experience are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sensation of dizziness or vertigo.</li>
<li>Falling or a feeling of falling.</li>
<li>Lightheadedness or feeling woozy.</li>
<li>Problems reading and difficulty seeing.</li>
<li>Disorientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some individuals may also experience <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nausea.html" title="Nausea">nausea</a> and vomiting, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarrhea.html" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, faintness, changes in heart rate and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_pressure.html" title="Blood pressure">blood pressure</a>, fear, anxiety, or panic. Some reactions to the symptoms are fatigue, depression, and decreased concentration. The symptoms may appear and disappear over short time periods or may last for a longer period of time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Diagnosis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Diagnosis</span></h2>
<p>Diagnosis of a balance disorder is complicated because there are many kinds of balance disorders and because other medical conditions - including ear infections, blood pressure changes, and some vision problems - and some medications may contribute to a balance disorder. A person experiencing dizziness should see a physician for an evaluation.</p>
<p>The primary physician may request the opinion of an otolaryngologist to help evaluate a balance problem. An otolaryngologist is a physician/surgeon who specializes in diseases and disorders of the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck, sometimes with expertise in balance disorders. He or she will usually obtain a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination to start to sort out possible causes of the balance disorder. The physician may require tests and make additional referrals to assess the cause and extent of the disruption of balance. The kinds of tests needed will vary based on the patient's symptoms and health status. Because there are so many variables, not all patients will require every test.</p>
<p>Some examples of diagnostic evaluations are from an <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audiologist.html" title="Audiologist">audiologist</a> (diagnostic professional specializing in disorders of the hearing and balance system): hearing examination (because some disorders that affect the balance system may also affect the hearing system), an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronystagmography.html" title="Electronystagmography">electronystagmography</a> (ENG/VNG - a test of the vestibular system), or with a laboratory: blood tests, or imaging studies of the head and brain.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Treatment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Treatment</span></h2>
<p>There are various options for treating balance disorders. One option includes treatment for a disease or disorder that may be contributing to the balance problem, such as ear infection, <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebrovascular_accident.html" title="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</a>, or <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_sclerosis.html" title="Multiple sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a>. Individual treatment will vary and will be based upon symptoms, medical history, general health, examination by a physician, and the results of medical tests.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_disorder.html" title="Edit section: BPPV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BPPV</span></h3>
<p>BPPV is caused by misplaced crystals within the ear. Treatment, simply put, involves moving these crystals out of areas which cause vertigo and into areas where they do not. A number of exercises have been developed to shift these crystals. The following article explains with diagrams how these exercises can be performed at the office (surgery): <a href="http://www.tchain.com/otoneurology/disorders/bppv/bppv.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tchain.com/otoneurology/disorders/bppv/bppv.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> The success of these exercises depends on them being performed correctly.</p>
<p>The two exercises explained in the above article are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Brandt-Daroff Exercises</b>, which can be done at home and have a very high success rate but are unpleasant and time consuming to perform.</li>
<li>The <b>Epley Exercises</b><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>, which can either be done by a Doctor in the surgery, or at home with the use of a device such as <a href="http://www.dizzyfix.com" class="external text" title="http://www.dizzyfix.com" rel="nofollow">"The DizzyFIX"</a>. These exercises are immediately effective.</li>

<ul>
<li>Diet: Dietary changes such as reducing intake of sodium (salt) may help. For some people, reducing <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">caffeine</a>, and/or avoiding <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicotine.html" title="Nicotine">nicotine</a> may be helpful. Stress has also been shown to make the symptoms associated with ménière's worse</li>
<li>Drugs:
<ul>
<li>Beta-histine (Serc) is available in some countries and is thought to reduce the frequency of symptoms</li>
<li>Diuretics such as hydrochlorohyiazide (Diazide)have also been shown to reduce the frequency of symptoms</li>
<li>Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin) can used to treat Ménière's disease. Systemic streptomycin (given by injection) and topical gentamicin (given directly to the inner ear) are useful for their ability to affect the hair cells of the balance system. Gentamicin also can affect the hair cells of the cochlea, though, and cause hearing loss in about 10% of patients. In cases that do not respond to medical management, surgery may be indicated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surgery for meniere's disease is a last resort
<ul>
<li>Vestibular neuronectomy can cure Meniere's disease but is very involved surgery and not widely available. It involves drilling into the skull and cutting the balance nerve just as it is about to enter the brain.</li>
<li>Labyrinthectomy (surgical removal of the whole balance organ)is more widely available as a treatment but causes total deafness in the affected ear.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Labyrinthitis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Labyrinthitis</span></h3>
<p>Treatment includes balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation). The exercises include movements of the head and body specifically developed for the patient. This form of therapy is thought to promote compensation for the disorder. Vestibular retraining programs are administered by professionals with knowledge and understanding of the vestibular system and its relationship with other systems in the body.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Drugs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drugs</span></h2>
<p>Sedative drugs are often prescribed for vertigo and dizziness, but these usually treat the symptoms rather than the underlying cause. Lorazepam (ativan) is often used and is a sedative which has no effect on the disease process rather helps patients cope with the sensation.</p>
<p>Antinauseants, like those prescribed for motion sickness, are also often prescribed but do not effect the prognosis of the disorder.</p>
<p>Specifically for meniere's disease a medication called Serc (Beta-histine) is available. There is some evidence to support it is effective to reduce the frequency of attacks. Also Diuretics, like Diazide (HCTZ/triamterene), are effective in many patients. Finally, ototoxic medications delivered either systemically or through the eardrum can eliminate the vertigo associated with Meniere's in many cases, although there is about a 10% risk of further hearing loss when using ototoxic medications.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Research">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Research</span></h2>
<p>Scientists are working to understand the various balance disorders and the complex interactions between the labyrinth, other balance-sensing organs, and the brain. Scientists are studying eye movement to understand the changes that occur in aging, disease, and injury. Scientists are collecting data about eye movement and posture to improve diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders. Scientists are also studying the effectiveness of certain exercises as a treatment option.</p>
<p>Other projects supported by NIDCD include studies of the genes essential to normal development and function in the vestibular system. Scientists are also studying inherited syndromes of the brain that affect balance and coordination.</p>
<p>The Institute supports research to develop new tests and refine current tests of balance and vestibular function. For example, scientists have developed computer-controlled systems to measure eye movement and body position by stimulating specific parts of the vestibular and nervous systems. Other tests to determine disability, as well as new physical rehabilitation strategies, are under investigation in clinical and research settings.</p>
<p>Scientists hope that new data will help to develop strategies to prevent injury from falls, a common occurrence among people with balance disorders, particularly as they grow older.</p>
