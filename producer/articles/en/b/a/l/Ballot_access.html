<p>Each State has its own ballot access laws to determine who may appear on ballots and who may not. According to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution_de54.html" title="Article One of the United States Constitution">Article I</a>, Section 4, of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, the authority to regulate the time, place, and manner of federal elections is up to each State, unless Congress legislates otherwise.</p>
<p>The main rationale put forward by States for restricting ballot access has been the argument that setting ballot access criteria too low would result in numerous frivolous candidates cluttering the ballot, which would cause confusion and waste the time of voters. However, proponents of ballot access reform say that reasonably easy access to the ballot does not lead to a glut of candidates, and that, even where many candidates do appear on the ballot, as was the case in the crowded <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_California_recall_30c0.html" title="2003 California recall">2003 California recall</a>, actual election results show that such crowding does not in fact confuse voters.</p>
<p>Historically, there were generally no restrictions on ballot access in the United States until after the introduction of the so-called "<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_ballot.html" title="Australian ballot">Australian ballot</a>" beginning in the 1880s. The eighteenth century prevalence of "voice voting" gave way to paper ballots, but until the 1880s paper ballots were not officially designed and printed by the government but were instead privately produced "tickets" that were distributed (usually by political parties) to the voter, who would take the ticket to the polling place and deposit it in the ballot box. The 1880s reform movement that led to officially designed secret ballots had some salutary effects, but it also gave the government control over who could be on the ballot. As historian Peter Argersinger has pointed out, the reform that conferred power on officials to regulate who may be on the ballot carried with it the danger that this power would be abused by officialdom and that legislatures controlled by the established political parties (specifically, the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> Parties), would enact restrictive ballot access laws to influence election outcomes, for partisan purposes, in order to ensure re-election of their own party's candidates.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most prominent advocate of the 1880s ballot reform movement, Dean Wigmore, suggested that "ten signatures" might be an appropriate requirement for nomination to the official ballot for a legislative office. In the twentieth century, ballot access laws imposing signature requirements far more restrictive than Wigmore had envisioned were enacted by many state legislatures, often in response to election victories by Socialists, Communists, or other disfavored political organizations<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>; in almost all of these cases, the two major parties framed the laws in such a way that the burdens created by these new ballot access requirements (usually in the form of difficult signature-gathering petition drives) fell on alternative candidates, but not on major party candidates. Proponents of more open ballot access argue that restricting access to the ballot has the effect of unjustly restricting the choices available to the voters and typically disadvantages <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_party_%28United_States%29_f0c0.html" title="Third party (United States)">third party</a> candidates and other candidates who are not affiliated with the established parties.</p>

<p>Ballot access laws in the United States vary widely from state to state. A brief outline of such laws follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Alabama - Major party candidates are nominated by the state primary process. Independent candidates are granted ballot access through a petition process and minor political party candidates are nominated by convention along with a petition process; one must collect 3% of the total votes cast in the last election for the specific race or 3% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election for state-wide ballot access. The figure for 2006 state wide ballot access was 41,012 good signatures. Be aware that the validity of signatures generally means that 20-30% more signatures will need to be collected to ensure that the goal is achieved. To retain ballot access a third party has to poll 20% in a state wide race and it will retain state wide ballot access through to the next election.</li>
<li>Alaska</li>
<li>Arizona</li>
<li>Arkansas</li>
<li>California</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>Connecticut</li>
<li>Delaware</li>
<li>Florida</li>
<li>Georgia</li>
<li>Hawaii</li>
<li>Idaho</li>
<li>Illinois</li>
<li>Indiana</li>
<li>Iowa</li>
<li>Kansas</li>
<li>Kentucky</li>
<li>Louisiana</li>
<li>Maine</li>
<li>Maryland - Party certifications are done for each gubernatorial cycle (e.g. 2006 - 2010). If the number of registered voters to a political party is less than 1%, then 10,000 petition signatures must be gathered for that party to be considered certified. A party must be certified before voters can register under that party. A party can also be certified for a two year term if their candidate receives more than 1% of the vote.</li>
<li>Massachusetts</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Minnesota - Major party candidates are nominated by the state primary process. Independent and minor political party candidates are nominated by a petition process; two-thousand signatures for a statewide election, or five hundred for a state legislative election. Candidates have two week period to collect nominating petition signatures. Independent candidates may select a brief political party designation in lieu of independent.</li>
<li>Mississippi</li>
<li>Missouri</li>
<li>Montana</li>
<li>Nebraska</li>
<li>Nevada</li>
<li>New Hampshire</li>
<li>New Jersey</li>
<li>New Mexico</li>
<li>New York - A new party or independent candidate may gain ballot access for one election by collecting a set number of petition signatures for each office (or 5 percent of the votes cast for governor in the most recent election in the jurisdiction, if that is lower). A new party that wins 50,000 votes for governor is recognized statewide as a political party and qualifies to participate in primary elections for four years. This total can be and often is obtained through <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_fusion.html" title="Electoral fusion">electoral fusion</a>. Candidates may gain access to primary election ballots by being "designated" by a relevant committee of the party or collecting signatures equal to 5 percent of the party's enrollment in the jurisdiction, up to a set number for each office. A candidate seeking the nomination of a party to which she or he does not belong – e.g. for purposes of fusion – must be authorized by a relevant committee of the party.</li>
<li>North Carolina</li>
<li>North Dakota - Seven thousand petition signatures to create a new political party and nominate a slate of candidates for office. Independent candidates need a thousand for a statewide office or 300 for a state legislative office. The independent nominiating petition process does not allow for candidates to appear on the ballot with a political party designation, in lieu of independent, except for presidential elections <a href="http://www.nd.gov/sos/electvote/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nd.gov/sos/electvote/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>Ohio - Late in 2006, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Sixth_Circuit_8fe1.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit">6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</a> invalidated Ohio's law for ballot access for new political parties. After the November elections, the outgoing Secretary of State and Attorney General requested an extension to file an appeal to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Supreme_Court_e75f.html" title="United States Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> so that the decision whether or not to appeal could be made by the newly elected Secretary of State and Attorney General. The new deadline to appeal was set at February 6, 2007.</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>Oregon</li>
<li>Pennsylvania - A new party or independent candidate may gain ballot access for one election as a "political body" by collecting petition signatures equal to 2 percent of the vote for the highest vote-getter in the most recent election in the jurisdiction. A political body that wins two percent of the vote obtained by the highest vote-getter statewide in the same election is recognized statewide as a "political party" for two years. A political party with a voter enrollment equal to less than 15 percent of the state's total partisan enrollment is classified as a "minor political party," which has automatic ballot access in <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">special elections</a> but must otherwise collect the same number of signatures as political bodies. Political parties not relegated to "minor" status qualify to participate in primary elections. Candidates may gain access to primary election ballots by collecting a set number of petition signatures for each office, generally significantly fewer than required for political bodies and minor political parties.</li>
<li>Rhode Island</li>
<li>South Carolina</li>
<li>South Dakota - For a registered political party in a statewide election they must collect petition signatures equal to one percent of the vote for that political party in the preceding election for state governor. An independent candidate must collect petition signatures equal to one percent of the total votes for state governor, and a new political party must collect two-hundred and fifty petition signatures. In state legislative elections a registered political party needs to collect fifty signatures and an independent candidate must collect one percent of the total votes cast for state governor in the preceding election <a href="http://www.sdsos.gov/electionsvoteregistration/upcomingelection_signersrequired.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sdsos.gov/electionsvoteregistration/upcomingelection_signersrequired.shtm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</li>
<li>Tennessee – 25 signatures is all that is required <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">as of 2006</a> to be put on the ballot for any elected office. A candidate for President of the United States must put forward a full slate of candidates who have agreed to serve as electors (11, at least until the 2010 census). A party must maintain five percent of the vote statewide in order to be recognized as a party and have its candidates listed on the ballot under that party's name; the last third party to do so was the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Independent_Party_973b.html" title="American Independent Party">American</a> Party in 1968; none of its candidates received five percent of the statewide vote in 1970 and it was then decertified as an official party.</li>
<li>Texas - For a registered political party in a statewide election to gain ballot access, they must either 1) obtain five percent of the vote in any statewide election or 2) collect petition signatures equal to one percent of the total votes cast in the preceding election for governor, and must do so by January 2 of the year in which such statewide election is held. An independent candidate for any statewide office must collect petition signatures equal to one percent of the total votes cast for governor, and must do so beginning the day after primary elections are held and complete collection within 60 days thereafter (if runoff elections are held, the window is shortened to beginning the day after runoff elections are held and completed within 30 days thereafter). The petition signature cannot be from anyone who voted in either primary (including runoff), and voters cannot sign multiple petitions (they must sign a petition for one party or candidate only). <a href="http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/candidates/guide" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/candidates/guide" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>

<li>the right to <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_protection.html" title="Equal protection">equal protection</a> of the laws under the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourteenth_amendment.html" title="Fourteenth amendment">fourteenth amendment</a> (when the restrictions involve a discriminatory classification of voters, candidates, or political parties)</li>
<li>rights of political association under the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_amendment.html" title="First amendment">first amendment</a> (especially when the restrictions burden the rights of political parties and other political associations, but also when they infringe on the rights of a candidate or a voter not to associate with a political party)</li>
<li>rights of free expression under the first amendment</li>
<li>rights of voters (which the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_35ae.html" title="Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a> has said are "inextricably intertwined" with the rights of candidates)</li>
<li>property interests and liberty interests in candidacy</li>
<li>other rights to "<a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_process_of_law.html" title="Due process of law">due process of law</a>"</li>
</ul>
<p>It has also been argued that ballot access restrictions infringe the following constitutional rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_to_petition_the_government.html" title="Right to petition the government">right to petition the government</a> (this argument is sometimes raised to allege that signature-gathering requirements, or the rules implementing them, are unfairly restrictive)</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_the_press.html" title="Freedom of the press">freedom of the press</a> (which historically included the right to print ballots containing the name of the candidate of one's choosing);</li>
<li>the right to a "republican form of government," which is guaranteed to each state (although this clause has been held not to be enforceable in court by individual citizens)</li>
</ul>
<p>(NB: to be completed)</p>
<p>From a structural point of view, ballot access restrictions affect the most fundamental rights in a democratic society. (NB: to be completed)</p>
<p>The United States Supreme Court has upheld constitutional challenges to ballot access restrictions in a number of important cases, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Williams v. Rhodes,</i> 393 U.S. 23 (1968)</li>
<li><i>Anderson v. Celebrezze,</i> 460 U.S. 780 (1983)</li>
<li><i>Bullock v. Carter,</i> 405 U.S. 134 (1972)</li>
<li><i>Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party,</i> 440 U.S. 173 (1979)</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Term_Limits%2C_Inc._v._Thornton_590b.html" title="U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton">U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton</a>,</i> 514 U.S. 779 (1995)</li>
<li><i>Lubin v. Panish,</i> 415 U.S. 709 (1974)</li>
<li><i>Norman v. Reed,</i> 502 U.S. 279 (1992)</li>
</ul>
<p>Various state courts and lower federal courts have also upheld constitutional challenges to ballot access restrictions, for example:</p>
<p>(NB: to be completed)</p>
<p>On the other hand, a number of court decisions are routinely cited as supporting the principle that states have considerable leeway, if justified by legitimate and compelling interests, to regulate who may appear on the ballot. The Supreme Court case cited most often this effect is <i>Jenness v. Fortson,</i> 403 U.S. 431 (1971), where the Court declined to strike down a very restrictive ballot access law in Georgia.</p>

<p>International agreements that have the status of treaties of the U.S. are part of the supreme law of the land, under Article VI of the United States Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Art. 25</li>
<li>Copenhagen Document, ¶¶6-8, Annex I to 1990 Charter of Paris</li>
</ul>
<p>Another source of international human rights law derives from universally accepted norms that have found expression in resolutions of the U.N. General Assembly. Although the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not binding under U.S. law the way a treaty is, this type of norm is recognized as a source of international law in such treaties as the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to which the U.S. is a party:</p>

<p>Depending on the office and the state, it may be possible for a voter to cast a <a href="../../../w/r/i/Write-in_candidate.html" title="Write-in candidate">write-in</a> vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot; but, it is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office. In some cases, write-in votes are simply not counted. Having one's name printed on the ballot confers an enormous advantage over candidates who are not on the ballot. The United States Supreme Court has noted that write-in status is absolutely no substitute for being on the ballot. One of the rare cases, and perhaps the most notable case, of a write-in candidate actually winning an election was <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strom_Thurmond_a5db.html" title="Strom Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a>'s election as a write-in candidate to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> in 1954. More recent examples were the write-in election of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Burks_f7a5.html" title="Charlotte Burks">Charlotte Burks</a> to the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_State_Senate_e1c6.html" title="Tennessee State Senate">Tennessee State Senate</a> seat of her late husband, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Burks_4923.html" title="Tommy Burks">Tommy Burks</a>, murdered by his <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Looper_e540.html" title="Byron Looper">only opponent on the ballot</a>, and the write-in re-election of Mayor <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_A._Williams_e23a.html" title="Anthony A. Williams">Anthony A. Williams</a> of the <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_of_Columbia_9454.html" title="District of Columbia">District of Columbia</a>. Each of these cases involved unique political circumstances, a popular and well-known candidate, and a highly organized and well-funded write-in education campaign.</p>

<p>The growth of any third political party in the United States faces extremely challenging obstacles, among them restrictive ballot access. Other obstacles often cited as barriers to third-party growth include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the role of corporate money in propping up the two established parties</li>
<li>the allegedly related general reluctance of news organizations to cover minor political party campaigns</li>
<li>politically motivated gerrymandering of election districts by those already in power, in order to reduce or eliminate political competition</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Past_the_Post_electoral_system_687b.html" title="First Past the Post electoral system">plurality voting</a> and the absence of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a></li>
