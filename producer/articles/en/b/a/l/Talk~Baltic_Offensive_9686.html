<dd>The issue is the title. "The Battle of the Baltic" should really refer to the naval action during WW2, e.g. articles such as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_b08a.html" title="Battle of the Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a> refer to naval battles. There is even a book published that refers to it as a naval campaign, called "Battle of the Baltic: The Sea War 1939-1945" <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Battle-Baltic-Sea-War-1939-1945/dp/184415422X" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Battle-Baltic-Sea-War-1939-1945/dp/184415422X" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Some of the battles mentioned in the article were really a part of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bagration_53fd.html" title="Operation Bagration">Operation Bagration</a>, or the aftermath of the breaking of the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Leningrad_5a77.html" title="Siege of Leningrad">Siege of Leningrad</a>.

<dd>I'm sorry you think this is a "nonsense", perhaps someone could suggest an alternative title. The article <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Baltic_%281941%29_0480.html" title="Battle of the Baltic (1941)">Battle of the Baltic (1941)</a> is a stub that explicitly refers to the naval campaign, not the Nazi takeover as you wrongly claim. The fact is the title "Battle of the Baltic" should properly refer to the naval campaign in the Baltic, not the territorial campaign in the Baltic region. That this article does not include battles in Finland, which was considered a Baltic country in the 1940's, indicates that the title of this article is inappropriate and is possibly a tendentious collection of events. I think it is incumbent on the editor of this article to provide source that the land battles outlined in the article are commonly known as the "Battle of the Baltic", so I respectfully ask you not to revert the tag until this is resolved. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 02:15, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The title for an article devoted to an encyclopedic subject can be either an established name for the subject or a neutrally chosen descriptive name. If you think that the land battle is not article worthy, this is one thing. If you think it is just that the better name can be picked, it's another thing.</p>
<p>In the former case, try to propose the deletion. In the latter case, try to propose a better name. If you really don't know what is that you want, please think first and write second. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:33, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Battle of the Baltic" is the established name for the naval campaign. Perhaps "Operation ..." would be a better title, but given that this region was considered as the right flank in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bagration_53fd.html" title="Operation Bagration">Operation Bagration</a> and its aftermath, I would want evidence that this article discusses a real separate operation and not a tendentious collection of events from some other operations. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 02:42, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please be more clear. Are you saying that this article should be renamed to "Operation of what"? Or are you saying that this operation did not exist? What then existed? I can't discuss this with you until you intelligibly spell out your suggestion. You tagged the article, wrote a set of confusing statements and insist on the tag based on that. This is not a good faith approach.</p>
<p>You want the article deleted? Go <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. You want it renamed? Propose the new name. You want it split? Be specific where and how. While you just pose some vague objections, the tag is not justified. Judging from your behavior in a different conflict, it very much looks like <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. If this is not so, please present your suggestions in a clear and intelligible form instead of the vague "I don't like it". --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 03:07, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought my objections were quite clear and reasonable, despite your apparent continued intent of painting this as something else. I'll restate it: "Battle of the Baltic" is the established name for the naval campaign. Since this region was considered as the right flank in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bagration_53fd.html" title="Operation Bagration">Operation Bagration</a> and its aftermath, I would want evidence that this article discusses a real separate operation and not a tendentious collection of events from some other operations. Perhaps the source verifying this article describing it as a separate operation will suggest a better "Operation ..." name. As it stands, "Battle of the Baltic" is not appropriate. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 03:41, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is because you describe your objections in the vague form that I have trouble understanding you. So, you dislike the current name but what the better name should there be you happen to no know. Do I understand this correctly? --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And you think the current name, which should properly refer to the naval campaign, is appropriate? In my view, this article really duplicates many aspects of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bagration_53fd.html" title="Operation Bagration">Operation Bagration</a>, with both articles claiming: "The result ... was a permanent loss of contact between Army Groups North and Centre, and the creation of the Courland Pocket". Are we talking about two separate operations here? But I am attempting to be fair minded about this, hence the suggestion of a rename. However, the reason I can't suggest anything beyond "Operation ..." is that I have not seen any source that refers to this as a separate operation. If you can provide a cite to such an operation, I will be glad to offer something more appropriate after I view the source if you like. Afterall, the names of articles on operations such as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bagration_53fd.html" title="Operation Bagration">Operation Bagration</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Saturn_d9be.html" title="Operation Saturn">Operation Saturn</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Polar_Star_b363.html" title="Operation Polar Star">Operation Polar Star</a> are all rooted in real operational names used by the allies at the time. So if this article describes a real operation, distinct from <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bagration_53fd.html" title="Operation Bagration">Operation Bagration</a>, then it wouldn't be too difficult to cite an appropriate source that lists the name of the operation that could be used for a more appropriate title, would it? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 04:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another problem is the scope of the article. The campaign box states this operation occurred between September - November 1944, yet the text claims The Battle of the Baltic covers a number of smaller battles, including the campaign for Narva, comprising of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Narva_-_Battle_for_the_Narva_Bridgehead_%281944%29_d29b.html" title="Battle of Narva - Battle for the Narva Bridgehead (1944)">Battle for the Narva Bridgehead (1944)</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Narva_-_Battle_of_the_Tannenbergstellung_%281944%29_d4b4.html" title="Battle of Narva - Battle of the Tannenbergstellung (1944)">Battle of the Tannenbergstellung (1944)</a>. However these campaigns for Narva were between February - September, which is obviously outside the scope of the article. Checking the Oxford Companion to World War 2, this campaign only evolved into a separate operation after phase two of Bagration. This implies that this operation was quickly formed to exploit the breakthrough created by Bagration and attempt to stop the Germans escaping Estonia. Operations of Army Group North during the September-November period can be characterised as a tactical retreat into the Courland Pocket precipitated by the success of Bagration, therefore Soviet operations for this period should be seen as a consolidation in the aftermath of Bagration. For example, German troops had already left Tallinn a few days before the Soviets arrived. So for lack of an official operational title, perhaps Operation Bagration - consolidation may be suitable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 04:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Strictly speaking, in most books, Operation Bagration stops in August 1944, and following operations are treated in a seperate way.</dd>
<dd>I agree that the title is maybe not the most fortunate, although Glantz, for instance, calls the whole thing "Drive to the Baltics". Trouble is, one has to find a common title, because the thing regroups a lot of operations (both before and after Bagration) and by definition there would be no common name, as each author uses a collective title as he sees fit.</dd>
<dd>But the most important thing is that an unreferenced title does not make it a POV one. POV has a very specific meaning, and this case does enter the scope of the policy. If you want to propose a better one, file a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> request as it is specifically asked by WP policy. Until then, I'm removing the tag, (which incidentally, borders a WP:POINT violation because of another article...). -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 15:49, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you say, Bagration ended in August, so the article ought to cover the period after that, from September to November. It seems to group many unrelated events into one operation. By including operations in Narva which span from February to August, and then implying the defeat of the Nazis led to the formation <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Brothers_2982.html" title="Forest Brothers">Forest Brothers</a>, seems to make this article border on a POV fork. The <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Brothers_2982.html" title="Forest Brothers">Forest Brothers</a> concerns an insurgency that lasted over ten years, many members were either too young to have participated in WW2 or were veterans of the Finnish Army, and certainly none of the Lithuanian <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Brothers_2982.html" title="Forest Brothers">Forest Brothers</a> fought on the German side.

Grafik is correct exactly, this what I was saying all along. We can discuss the renaming to Drive to the Baltics (1944) or whatever other name (Martin pointedly refuses to propose a specific name). We can discuss the deletion (Marting pointedly refuses to submit the article for AfD as well) but the POV-title has a clear meaning. POVness of the title is not demonstrated by Martin in any way. Article is not called the <i>Liberation of Baltic</i> (although many WW2 sources, the western ones including, use the L-term for any operation where the Nazi forces where driven out, including from the E. Europe).</p>
<p>In any case, I would be open to the discussion on the title's neutrality should it have been "Liberation" or "invasion" or "occupation" or any other of the strong term. Such terms are not used. The title may not be the best possibly, but it is clearly neutrally phrased. I am removing the tag (as I see Martin reverted on the spot without explanation) and advise Martin to reread the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> guideline. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:39, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have provided an explanation above, so your reversion is unjustified. If the article strictly covers the September-November period, then there would be no objection. The issue is the neutrality of the subject matter. Reference to the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Brothers_2982.html" title="Forest Brothers">Forest Brothers</a>, which were formed well after the September-November period this article should cover, is an issue. I will delete this reference. Your brandishing of the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> club is an assumption of bad faith and really not helpful. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 19:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was no active local civilian resistance for any veteran to join until 1945, well after the period spanned by this article. The resistance was a consequence of Soviet policies in 1945, i.e. conscription, repression and deportation, not a consequence of the defeat on Nazi forces in September-November 1944. I will delete this paragraph, as its aim appears to be to tendentiously juxapose the defeat of Nazi forces and the insurgency against Soviet rule. If you revert this, I think am quite justified to tag the article POV. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 22:11, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen's</a> claim that I pointedly refuse to propose a specific name is rather misleading. I clearly stated above that the name should reflect the operational name as used by the Allies at that time. So I suggested that it ought be called "Operation ..." and suggested that sources be consulted as to what "..." should be. The Oxford Companion to WW2 suggests that this operation was an evolution from the second phase of Bagration, so I suggested Operation Bagration - consolidation, but obviously that is not really suitable either.</p>
<p>However I think we can all atleast agree that <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Baltic_d097.html" title="Battle of the Baltic">Battle of the Baltic</a> is more suitable for the naval action in the Baltic. Drive to the Baltics is also unsuitable, since the Soviets were already in the Baltics. I suggest we brainstorm a few titles here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 22:37, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks to <a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen's</a> forfilment of my request for a source (D. Muriyev, Preparations, Conduct of 1944 Baltic Operation Described, Military History Journal), a more suitable name can be found. The text of the source formerly calls it "The Baltic Strategic Offensive Operation", so I suggest a suitable title would be <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Offensive_7592.html" title="Baltic Offensive">Baltic Offensive</a>. If that is acceptable, I propose the article <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Baltic_%281941%29_0480.html" title="Battle of the Baltic (1941)">Battle of the Baltic (1941)</a> be also renamed <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Baltic_%281939-1945%29_c5f6.html" title="Battle of the Baltic (1939-1945)">Battle of the Baltic (1939-1945)</a> so we can have an article about the sea war. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 23:43, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Baltic offensive (1944) (assuming we can have an article on 1941 German offensive in the same area) is another possibility. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 13:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Seems okay too. Do we need the date to disambugate the title? I have no objections to another article on the German offensive in 1941, but I thought <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> covered it. The Germans swept through Estonia to the outskirts of Leningrad in the period from September 1st to the 9th, is this worthy of a separate article? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 19:41, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well you did provide some cites. I know it is a direct translation from Russian, but is it appropriate in English? A quick Google search reveals 278 hits for "Baltic Offensive" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22baltic+offensive%22+1944&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22baltic+offensive%22+1944&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and 167 hits for "Baltic Operation" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22baltic+operation%22+1944&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22baltic+operation%22+1944&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 20:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On reflection "Baltic Operation" is okay with me, the number of hits compared to "Baltic Offensive" is fairly even, within the same order of magnitude. Afterall, it is the term the Soviets originally used, we should go with that. But do we need the date? Aren't dates only meant to disambiguate similar titled articles? If we all concur, will a simple move be sufficient, I don't think there are any linking issues and the move seems uncontroversial if we all agree. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 21:52, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough, as long as it is clear that this article refers to the post-Bagration operation of September through to November. I disagree with Grafikm's view that this article should describe a collection of operations both before and after Bagration, on the grounds that there already exists articles covering pre-Bagration operations, and there is a gap in post-Bagration operations that this article will neatly fill. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartintg_0415.html" title="User:Martintg">Martintg</a> 22:37, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Baltic Operation" would indeed need be disambiguated, as there's a <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/baltops.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/baltops.htm" rel="nofollow">major military exercise</a> that shares the name. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 04:06, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Baltic Operation is a POV name. Calling it Baltic Operation automatically places makes it read from the prespective of the Soviets. Just as the name <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> tends to put the initial stages of German invasion of the Soviet Union in a German perspective. It is better to put it back to the name it had <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Baltic_%281944%29_8d8d.html" title="Battle of the Baltic (1944)">Battle of the Baltic (1944)</a>. -- <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 15:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>However as some object to that name I am moving this article to "Baltic Offensive" from "Baltic Operation" as Offensive was the agreed name to use for Soviet Offensive Operations, See <a href="../../../p/r/a/Talk%7EPrague_Offensive_bbdd.html" title="Talk:Prague Offensive">Talk:Prague Offensive</a> --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 15:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
