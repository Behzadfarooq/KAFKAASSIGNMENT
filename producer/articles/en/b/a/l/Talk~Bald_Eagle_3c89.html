<p>Bald is not a zoological term, it is an English word.

<dd>It is an English zoological term, used of other birds and mammals as well. Perhaps we should have an article on it. But there is absolutely no possibility that the bird is named from the Old English; noone (aside from philologists) has ever spoken Old English in North America.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 08:08, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, surely we all agree the Bald Eagle was not named by Old English speakers? Anyway, my dictionary says "bald" is derived from the Welsh <i>bāl</i>, but that's a different matter. I'm not disputing that "bald" originally meant "white", but simply pointing out that the use here of course doesn't derive directly from Old English or Welsh. The word "bald", like most words, has just evolved several distinct meanings, one of which is an animal with a white top. What if we word it this way: <i>"bald" is here a term for an animal with a white top, sharing an etymology with bald as in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldness.html" title="Baldness">baldness</a> in deriving from the Welsh/Old English for "white"</i> Or something like that: at the the momemt I'm waxing a bit tired and verbose&#160;;)--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 08:34, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, ok, so you think it's misleading to state that bald is derived for baeld when it was probably not named after that? Yes, I suppose that's a valid point - it makes a connection where not is meant to exist. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 08:42, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I take the point that you make, that it is the derivation of "Bald Eagle", and not the derivation of the word "bald" that is relevant here. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 08:47, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Cut from article pending clarification:</p>
<p><i>They were on the Endangered Species list until their removal on February 13, 2006.</i></p>
<p><i>Please note that the US Fish and Wildlife Service has opened a public discussion period on removing the bald eagle from the endangered/threatened species list. The eagle has not yet been removed. the comment period extends until May 17, 2006.</i></p>
<p>Just so you know Ben wasn't kidding he made a hard push at the founding of our country for the turkey to be the national symbol mostly for the "intelligence" that he thought he saw...but as we know it today the turkey just have really good sense except for smell</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Talk%7EBald_Eagle_3c89.html" title="Edit section: Contradiction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Contradiction</span></h2>
<p>This article and the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_turkey.html" title="Wild turkey">wild turkey</a> one disagree on the truth of Ben Franklin's preference for the national bird. 68.39.174.238 20:18, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The full text of Franklin's letter is [<a href="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~insrisg/nature/nw98/franklinturkey.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~insrisg/nature/nw98/franklinturkey.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] - this wikipedia article has heavily trimmed it (and in fact reworded it - Franklin didn't say 'though vain and silly' - he said, parenthetically, "though a little vain and silly, it is true") to make it appear that Franklin did advocate the turkey for the national bird. Carefully reading, first of all, he is clearly being tongue-in-cheek to make fun of the Society of the Cincinnati (which he hated - the first part of the letter makes that plain enough); however, even if we take him at face value, he never says the turkey should be the symbol of the US - he says he's disappointed it was the eagle, and he's glad that *The Society of the Cincinnati's* emblem, which was an eagle, was poorly enough done to look like a turkey. Again, he's talking about what the Cincinnati's symbol looks like - not what the US national bird should be. Further, he notes that turkey was served at the wedding of Charles IX - is that really a selling point of a national symbol? ...And he talks about the turkey's bravery in the farm yard - making it clear he's talking about a tame turkey not a wild one. Again, would one choose a domesticated farm animal as a national symbol? The most comprehensive biography of Franklin ("The First American") falls on the side of this being just humor to tweak the Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Finally, this letter to his daughter in 1784 *is the only record* of Franklin mentioning, in seriousness or jest, that the turkey is a worthy symbol of anything. If he really advocated the turkey as the US national symbol, then in 1782 (when the eagle was chosen), he would have written a letter to the congress (because he was in Europe from 1776-1785), and no such letter exists.</p>
<p>Apologies if this is not the place to make the argument. I hope whoever resolves the dispute finds this verifiable information useful.</p>

<p>The French version of this page claims the bird is not a true eagle. Is that correct? I've never heard that before, and I don't see that in this article. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunnyhat_e35c.html" title="User:Funnyhat">Funnyhat</a> 07:13, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It actually depends on what one terms as a true eagle. By the sounds of it the French article is a little biased towards the fact that the bird is not a member of the Aquila genus. (Aquila is the latin term for "eagle." ) However, the habits and physical appearance of the bald eagle indeed mark it as an eagle: it has the hook shaped beak, the large grasping feet, and wingspan of an eagle Futhermore, its closest relative in Europe is the white tailed eagle (you can tell the difference between the two by looking at the feet: bald eagles have yellow feet, but the European one has orange feet.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A similar situation occurs with the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrush.html" title="Thrush">thrushes</a> and some other groups. Genus <i>Turdus</i> is often described as the "true" thrushes, to differentiate it from the American <i>Catharus</i> and Asian <i>Zoothera</i>. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 12:13, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Diet is of little significance - a very quick check in my European field guide showed that Golden and Spotted Eagles (both <i>Aquila</i>) as well as White-tailed (<i>Haliaeetus</i>) will also take carrion - large birds of prey in northern latitudes can't afford to let a good corpse go to waste. Eagle is a poorly defined term, and refers more to size and appearance than anything else - the eagles are not necessarily closely related to each other. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 05:47, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The religious symbol section <b>is</b> wikified. Words such as "eagle" only need to be linked the first time they appear in an article, not every time.</li>
<li>The agreed convention is that the names of bird species are capitalised, so Bald Eagle, Golden Eagle</li>
<li>The section stating frequent comparison with the bible and crucifix is improbable and unsourced, so I've removed it pending a verifiable source.</li>
<li>"Certifiable" tribe - sounds improbable, since it suggests legal ethnic separation still exists in the US, but I don't know if it's true or not, so I left it in. Shouldn't it be certified anyway?</li>
<li>External links should be to sites giving more information on the bird, not linkspam to campaigning groups like "Religious Freedom with Raptors".</li>

RE: CRUCIFIX/BIBLE COMPARISON: comparison between eagle feather and the bible and cruifix are common in native american community, i've used it myself and so have many others i've known. am including a couple references in this regard, although will try to locate more.</p>
<p>RE: LEGAL/ETHNIC SEPARATION: legal ethnic separation still exists in the united states, which is what the link to that website showed. i saw the site, it links to lots of articles that verify this and have therefore put it back. i believe that articles that directly relate to the bird and its status as a religious object in this country does provide additional information about the bird itself. read the articles i'm including in the references and you'll have a better idea.</p>
<p>RE: CERTIFIABLE TRIBE: i'm not sure i understand what you're getting at by asking "shouldn't it be certified anyway?", although I will say that one's race or skin color should not determine one's religious freedom. similarly, i find it detestable to require someone to prove their ethnicity in order to be treated with compassion and respect.</p>
<p>Link to group Religious Freedom with Raptors (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/eaglefeatherlaw" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/eaglefeatherlaw" rel="nofollow">www.geocities.com/eaglefeatherlaw</a>) provided as additional information resource to readers regarding current status (legal, religious, and cultural) of the bald eagle as a religious object. Link was neither positive or negative, simply provided, in Wikipedia standards, for reader to have additional information and to make up their own minds.</p>

<p>Removed part of the "Range, habitat, and restoration" section. It says that there are no hunting restrictions (and that there is somehow an overpopulation in the US), yet the species has yet to be taken off the endangered species list and it remains illegal to own any portion of the bird (except under the special circumstances mentioned later in the article). Furthermore, if "State Park officials" really wanted eagle hunters to "trim the population," one would think specific states would be mentioned. The section smells fishy (heh, puns...) to me, I'm removing it until someone can cite a source. --65.24.137.39 06:25, 6 October 2006 (UTC)Dan.</p>
<p>I'm gonna remove that section, as it is obviously false. It doesnt even fit with the rest of the paragraph. It gave me a good laugh though. <a href="../../../a/c/b/User%7EAcbrog_8123.html" title="User:Acbrog">Acbrog</a> 21:09, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

More Vandalism "The species was on the brink of extinction in the US late in the 20th century, but the species population has increased by 10,000 in the last year thanks to the works of Stephen Colbert, and has been finally removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species.

<p>Now that we have lots of new images added to the pool, can we agree to drop all the photos of the birds in captivity? There are still two that have barn-board siding in the backgrounds. We should try to show only wild birds in their natural habitat now. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 22:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Besides the two you mentioned from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Aviary_abba.html" title="National Aviary">National Aviary</a>, there are a number of images that are also from captivity currently in use. Plus many of them do not say whether they are from the wild or not. Is the standard whether or not they <i>look</i> like they are in captivity or not? <a href="../../../b/a/l/Image%7EBald.eagle.closeup.arp-sh.750pix.jpg_4d04.html" title="Image:Bald.eagle.closeup.arp-sh.750pix.jpg">this image</a> is from captivity, but it's also a featured picture. I counted 5 images from captivity being used (at least). All of them are of high quality and I think we should keep all of them, unless of course there is an <i>otherwise exactly equivalent</i> picture from the wild. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 23:38, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Photos with obvious evidence of captivity are less valuable. In many of the photos dropped from the gallery, the birds appeared to be in poor condition. On one of the new gallery images, the perched bird is on a man-made perch, and is wearing bewits, so it's more appropriate for an article on falconry. We should drop these in favor of images that at least appear to show the birds in their natural setting. I don't think they need to be equivalent, since the image choice is arbitrary. One head-shot is enough, so let's keep one with blue sky, rather than a man-made background, for example. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 01:08, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you for most part, except that I think that images should only be replaced with wild ones if the only major difference is the background. And since the head-shot with a blurred man made background is a featured picture and the one with the blue background is not, i'm going to disagree with you again. The better picture here should prevail. I have no problem keeping both, however. Image choice is not exactly arbitrary, because the goal should be educational value. Most or all of the quality images are already in the article. Are there any others that you've found that would be better? -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 01:22, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The pro-DDT stuff in here seems biased an unnecessary.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. Not only is it completely out of place in the article, it is an awful lot of material which is not balanced at all by anything. It's not just that it's unbalanced, it just sort of jumps at you and screams "why is this here?" Additionally, I'm not sure it agrees very well with scientific consensus. It seems like an malicious insertion by an anti-environmental lobby and begs the question as to why we're talking about what didn't hurt eagles instead of what did. 66.57.99.110 19:35, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me the most important question to ask about the DDT comments is - are they accurate? They appear to be more accurate than generic statements like "DDT didn't contribute to declining Eagle populations."</p>
