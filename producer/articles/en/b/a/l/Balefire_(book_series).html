<p>After seventeen-year-old Thais Allard loses her widowed father in a tragic car accident, she is forced to leave the only home she has ever known. She moves to live with a total stranger in New Orleans, which greets her with many secrets and mysteries. However, none of these moments are as unbelievable as the one in which she unknowingly comes face to face with her identical twin, Clio Martin. Thais soon learns that she and her twin come from a family of <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witches.html" title="Witches">witches</a> and that she possesses astonishing powers. Both Thias and Clio have a key role in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balefire.html" title="Balefire">Balefire</a> - the coven in which they are born into. However, fiery Clio is less than thrilled to have to share the spotlight, but the twins must learn to combine their powers in order to complete a rite that will transform their lives and the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coven.html" title="Coven">coven</a> forever.</p>

Thais follows the rules and rarely parties. She went to live in New Orleans with Axelle until she found out she had a twin, Clio. She then moved in with Petra and Clio where Petra began to teach Thais witchcraft. Thais is a <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sagittarius_%28astrology%29.html" title="Sagittarius (astrology)">sagittarius</a> and her element is <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a>. She is also a powerful witch like her sister and sometimes when she is in danger, spells will pop into her head. Unlike Clio, who has it on the left, Thias has a birthmark on her right cheek. At the beginning of the book series, she began to date Luc-Andre Martin and later found out he was also dating Clio at the same time. Thais was hurt by this and so began to date a boy named Kevin LaTour but broke up with him in final book. In the end, she becomes friends with Luc. She and her sister both are identical to Cerise, their ancestor, except they have black hair, like Melita.</dd>
