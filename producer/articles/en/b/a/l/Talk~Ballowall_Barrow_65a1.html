<p>Does this subject have enough (potential) information to justify an article? Would it not be better as a section within either the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Just_in_Penwith_ebd4.html" title="St Just in Penwith">St Just in Penwith</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penwith.html" title="Penwith">Penwith</a> articles? The categories could also be transferred.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 16:10, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I created the page because this particular <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumulus.html" title="Tumulus">Barrow</a> is an English Heritage property. I believe that this alone merits a unique page, as it is an important archaelogical site. I personally intend to expand upon it at a later date. Excavations have taken place, so there is some potential for expansion, if this research can be located. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMortimerCat_ce93.html" title="User:MortimerCat">MortimerCat</a> 18:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay. I realise that many articles start as a stub, it is just that I wasn't aware of the potential for this. If there is more to come then fine. Are you creating this as part of an English Heritage thing, or from an archaelogical angle, or is it a one-off personal interest project?I only ask as there in a Penwith Wikiproject, and Penwith is full of quoits, standing stones and other items of interest (including <a href="../../../c/h/y/Chysauster.html" title="Chysauster">Chysauster</a> Iron Age village), which you may find useful in your areas of interest. Since this article is your baby I won't slap the template on this page, but you can if you think it appropriate. An example of the template can be found on the St Just talk page. Anyhow, I hope you enjoy developing this piece.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 19:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a personal project. Basically, I was looking for the information, but it wasn't there. I have an interest in English Heritage properties which is why I felt I was <i>qualified</i> to do this task.</dd>
<dd>Feel free to slap the template on. As a newbie editor, I was not quite sure what you were talking about&#160;:-) I do not have any problems with others taking over my articles, I would prefer it if they did. Although, I am full of enthusiasm now for my little project I cannot guarantee I will ever complete it. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMortimerCat_ce93.html" title="User:MortimerCat">MortimerCat</a> 10:10, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I've added the template that LessHeard vanU was talking about. Its basically just a way of grouping pages which fall within a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikiproject</a> so that people who stumble across one of the articles in the project know that there is a project that they can contribute too (in this case the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_geography_of_Penwith%2C_Cornwall_39f4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject geography of Penwith, Cornwall">Penwith Wikiproject</a>). The point of the project is basically as a focus of effort to improve a given area of wikipedia. If there was an English Heritage wikiproject then that would be equally as valid to stick here (and a page can be in more than one project).</dd>
<dd>Its great that you have the skills to expand the entry - would you consider writing a short leader section for the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penwith.html" title="Penwith">Penwith</a> mainpage? I was thinking just a short paragraph that would summarise all of the English heritage sites in the district. Not a massive ammount of detail, but enough to whet people's interest and let them know where to go if they want to read more in wiki. take care <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 10:25, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The members of the Penwith WikiProject are no more qualified than you to write articles relating to it - for instance I live in the neighbouring District now, and I only moved to Penwith/Cornwall 15 years ago. If there is anything to you feel you can contribute to any of the pages <b>be bold</b> and do it. As Mammal4 said, if there is anything you can add to the Penwith page regarding English Heritage sites then it would be gratefully received. Cheers.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 19:18, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Restored the text as below - statement is about something political concerning this site, but is not written in a pov or inflammatory way - mentioning a political fact concerning this site is not against wikipedia rules so long as neutrally written.</p>
<p>In 1999 there was some controversy regarding this site and others under the care of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Heritage_58b3.html" title="English Heritage">English Heritage</a> organisation. The <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revived_Cornish_Stannary_Parliament_4f38.html" title="Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament">Cornish Stannary Parliament</a> wrote to English Heritage asking them to remove all signs bearing their name from <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornish.html" title="Cornish">Cornish</a> sites by July 1999 as they regard the ancient sites as Cornish heritage, not English. Over eleven months eighteen signs were removed by members of the Cornish Stannary and a letter was sent to English Heritage saying <i>"The signs have been confiscated and held as evidence of English cultural aggression in Cornwall. Such racially motivated signs are deeply offensive and cause distress to many Cornish people"</i>. (see external BBC link).</p>
