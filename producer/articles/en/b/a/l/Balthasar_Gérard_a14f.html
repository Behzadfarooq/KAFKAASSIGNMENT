The murder of William the Silent by Balthasar Gérard.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Balthasar Gérard</b> (in <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>, Gerards or Gerardts) (<a href="../../../1/5/5/1557.html" title="1557">1557</a>-<a href="../../../1/5/8/1584.html" title="1584">1584</a>) was the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassin.html" title="Assassin">assassin</a> of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> independence leader, William I of <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Orange-Nassau_d8f9.html" title="House of Orange-Nassau">Orange</a>, also known as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Silent_7502.html" title="William the Silent">William the Silent</a>.</p>
<p>Gérard was born in Vuillafans (<a href="../../../f/r/a/Franche-Comt%C3%A9_a4c7.html" title="Franche-Comté">Franche-Comté</a>) in modern <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, at number 3 in the street now called Rue Gérard. He came from a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> family with 11 children and was a great admirer of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Spain_23db.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II</a>, the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html#Kings" title="Monarch">king</a> of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. He studied law at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Dole_cc03.html" title="University of Dole">University of Dole</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dole%2C_Jura_698d.html" title="Dole, Jura">Dole</a>. Even before the reward Philip II offered, he told his fellow students that he would put a knife in William the Silent's heart.</p>
<p>Philip II offered a reward of 25,000 crowns to anyone who killed William the Silent, calling him a 'pest on the whole of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and the enemy of the human race'.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balthasar_G%C3%A9rard_a14f.html" title="Edit section: Preparations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Preparations</span></h2>
<p>After the ban was published he came to <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> where he learned that John Jaureguy (<a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: Juan de Jáuregui) was attempting the assassination. Before long, it became known that that attempt was a failure. In March 1584 he left Luxembourg and went to <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trier.html" title="Trier">Treves</a>. There he put his plan before the regent of the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuits</a> but another Jesuit convinced him to change his original scheme and go to the prince of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parma.html" title="Parma">Parma</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tournai.html" title="Tournai">Tournay</a> he held council with a celebrated <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a>, Father Gery. There he wrote a letter of which a copy was deposited with the guardian of the Franciscan <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey.html" title="Abbey">convent</a>. The original was presented by himself to the Prince of Parma, to whom he said: "The <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vassal.html" title="Vassal">vassal</a> ought always to prefer justice and the will of the king to his own life."</p>
<p>He explained his scheme but did not specify the exact nature of his trap and bait. At first the prince thought him unfit but after consulting Haultepenne and others with the letter he was assigned to Christoffel d' Assonleville. Assonleville spoke with Balthasar and asked that he would write down his plan, which was done on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_11.html" title="April 11">April 11</a>, 1584.</p>
<p>He requested absolution from the prince of Parma "as he was about to keep company for some time with heretics and atheists, and in some sort to conform himself to their customs."</p>
<p>For his first expenses he begged for 50 crowns which were refused. "I will provide myself out of my own purse," said he to Assonleville, "and within six weeks you will hear of me."--"Go forth, my son," said Assonleville, paternally, after this spirited reply, "and if you succeed in your enterprise, the King will fulfill all his promises, and you will gain an immortal name besides."</p>
<p>The first opportunity he had for his crime he was unprepared and had no plan of escape. At that time William lay unarmed and alone in bed. He awaited another chance.</p>
<p>On Sunday July 8 he loitered in the courtyard examining the premises. A <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halberd.html" title="Halberd">halberdier</a> asked him why he was waiting there. He excused himself by saying that in his shabby clothing and without new shoes he was unfit to join the congregation in the church opposite. The halberdier had no suspicion of Balthasar's real purpose and through pitying his poverty arranged a gift of 50 crowns for Balthasar.</p>
<p>The following morning Gérard purchased a pair of pistols from a soldier, haggling the price for a long time because the soldier couldn't supply the particular chopped <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet.html" title="Bullet">bullets</a> or <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slug_%28projectile%29.html" title="Slug (projectile)">slugs</a> he wanted. After hearing about the events of the following day, this soldier is believed to have stabbed himself to death after hearing what the price for this sale had really been.</p>

<p>As William the Silent climbed the stairs to the second floor, he was spoken to by the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> captain, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Williams_%28soldier%29_ad9d.html" title="Roger Williams (soldier)">Roger Williams</a>, who knelt before him. William put his hand on the bowed head of the old captain, at which moment Balthasar Gérard jumped out of a dark corner. Gérard drew his weapon and fired three shots at the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadtholder.html" title="Stadtholder">stadtholder</a>. William the Silent collapsed. His sister knelt besides him, but it was too late. 'Mon Dieu, ayez pitié de moi et de mon pauvre peuple.' (My God, have mercy on my soul and these poor people.) are reportedly his last words.</p>
<p>In the mean while, Gérard had fled through the side door and ran across the narrow lane, pursued by Roger Williams. He had almost reached the ramparts, from which he intended to jump into the moat. On the other side a saddled horse stood ready. A pig's bladder around his waist was intended to help him float. However, he stumbled over a heap of rubbish. A servant and a halberdier of the prince who had raced after him caught him.</p>
<p>When called a traitor by his captors, he is said to have replied, "I am no traitor; I am a loyal servant of my lord." "Which lord?" they asked. "Of my lord and master, the king of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>".</p>
<p>At the same time more pages and halberdiers of the prince appeared and dragged him back to the house under a rain of fists and beatings with the butt of a sword. From the talk he heard he thought that the prince was still alive. "Cursed be the hand that missed!" he yelled.</p>

<p>At the house he immediately underwent a preliminary examination before the city <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magistrate.html" title="Magistrate">magistrates</a>. Upon being interrogated by the magistrates, he showed neither despair nor contrition, but rather a quiet exultation. He said that "Like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Biblical_character_bf2f.html" title="David/Biblical character">David</a>, he had slain <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goliath.html" title="Goliath">Goliath</a> of <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gath_%28city%29.html" title="Gath (city)">Gath</a>."</p>
<p>The magistrates sentenced that the right hand of Gérard should be burned off with a red-hot iron, that his flesh should be torn from his bones with pincers in six different places, that he should be quartered and disemboweled alive, that his heart should be torn from his bosom and flung in his face, and that, finally, his head should be taken off.</p>

<p>In the first night of his imprisonment Balthasar Gérard was hung on a pole and lashed with a whip. After that his wounds were smeared with honey and a goat was brought to lick the honey off his bruised skin with his sharp tongue. The goat however refused to touch the body of the sentenced. After this and other tortures he was left the night with his hands and feet bound together, as a ball, so he couldn't sleep. During the following three days, he was repeatedly mocked and hung on the pole with his hands tied on his back. Then a weight of 300 pounds (136 kg) was attached to each of his big toes for half an hour.</p>
<p>After this half hour he was fitted with shoes made of well-oiled, raw dog's leather; the shoes were two fingers shorter than his feet. In this state he was put before a fire. When the shoes warmed up, they contracted crushing the feet inside them to stumps. When these shoes were removed, his half broiled skin was torn off. After his feet were damaged, his armpits were branded. After that he was dressed in a shirt soaked in alcohol. Then burning bacon fat was poured over him and sharp nails were stuck between the flesh and the nails of his hands and feet. Gérard is said to have remained calm during his torture. In their frustration, the torturers poured urine over him.</p>
<p>Then, the magistrates sentenced that the right hand of Gérard should be burned off with a red-hot iron, that his flesh should be torn from his bones with pincers in six different places, that he should be <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drawn_and_quartered.html" title="Drawn and quartered">drawn and quartered</a> and disemboweled alive, that his heart should be torn from his bosom and flung in his face, and that, finally, his head should be cut off.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Philip II gave Balthazar's parents, instead of the reward of 25,000 crowns, three country estates in Lievremont, Hostal, and Dampmartin in the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franche_Comte_8067.html" title="Franche Comte">Franche Comte</a> and the family was raised to the peerage. Later, Philip II offered to give those estates to the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Orange_7ed2.html" title="Prince of Orange">Prince of Orange</a>, provided he would continue to pay a fixed proportion of the rents to the family of his father's murderer. This was rejected with scorn. The estates remained with the Gerard family.</p>
<p>A certain Sasbout Vosmeer tried to have Gerard canonized. He stole Gérard's head and showed it to the church officials in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, but the Church rejected the idea.</p>
