<p>Niu, what are you saying is that Chinese scholars are accurate about Chinese history?? Chinese historians or China never practice " censorship"?? or China isn't Communist state???? Whats your point? That Korean historical information is all wrong??? China never built "Great Wall" to separate between Chinese territory and Manchurian territory???? Its not Semi- political or historical or even Semi-Racist. I'm just justifying and sick and tired of "Corrupt" Chinese historians trying to justify and change Korean history based on Corrupt Chinese political view. Lets not debate " narrow" topic. Lets discuss about much more wider topic Why? is China trying to change Korean history???. The reason is its China " Political and Economical" interest. Just accept the fact. PLEASE!!! ENOUGH WITH SEMI-THIS GARBAGE.</p>
<p><br />
China is still " Communist" country. What it means is that China practices " Censorship" so the people aren't getting real History. In which in future it can lead serious problem between Korea and China. In past years Chinese Historians aren't providing real facts and real information about Korguryo and Balhae Kingdoms. These two Kingdoms had vast territory and it was behind " Great Wall China" which it means it didn't belong to China or Chinese. But instead it belonged to Koreans. Chinese historians are nervouse about " Greater Korea Syndrom, as we call it " G.K.S Syndrome. Its Korean westernized syndrome that 1.2 billion Chinese are afraid. The reason is simple, Korean culture aren't scary to average " Joe" Chinese. Why?? Koreans never invaded China in 20th century. The Greater Korea Syndrome, is Manchuria did belonged to Koreans and Manchuria belonged to Korean history. The Chinese are afraid of " Korean influence in Manchuria" or "Korean influence in China ( Chinese youth). Korea always has been " Lip and teeth" to China. If lip don't protect the teeth. Then China can always crack. Learning or Studying Chinese history. Yes, it can. China is vulnerable to foreign influence. Once Chinese get the taste of Korean culture or westernized Korean culture. Like eating Kimchee, it can't be stopped. That is what they are afraid of. Regarding to " Balhae and Korguryo" Kingdom. Thier both belong to Korea. Yes, Manchuria belongs to Korea. Like I said. Great Wall that divides Manchuria and China. That always has been Chinese history, other side of Great Wall China never cared because it wasn't part of China. It was part of Korea/ Koreans. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeacherjjlee_8f08.html" title="User:Teacherjjlee">Teacherjjlee</a> (<a href="../../../t/e/a/User_talk%7ETeacherjjlee_2fc9.html" title="User talk:Teacherjjlee">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Teacherjjlee_6646.html" title="Special:Contributions/Teacherjjlee">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I agree with Ksyrie. Or, if you prefer it, I think "proto-Koreans" and "proto-Manchus" is also a good way to put it, unless you just want to keep it simple.

<p>Don't rewrite history. Its historically proven fact. Balhae Kingdom is Korean territory. Balhae Kingdom history comes after fall of Korguryo Kingdom.</p>
<p>Yes, Balhae is Korean kingdom.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No i agree with you partially, Balhae is not a really an Korean kingdom but it belongs to Korean history tough.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Manchuria and Korean peninsula always had deep cultural and historical kinship. Ko-chosun, Korguryo, Balhae, Koryo, Chosun kingdom. All those kingdoms has close connection with Manchuria because Manchuria always had been part of Korea and Korean history.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Manchuria had been closely related to Korean history but we can not consider that region as part of Korea.<a href="../../../w/h/l/User%7EWhlee_2402.html" title="User:Whlee">Whlee</a> 13:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its historical fact between two Northeastern part region. Manchuria like Tibet, was never part of China historically and culturally.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Teacherjjlee_6646.html" title="Special:Contributions/Teacherjjlee">Teacherjjlee</a> (<a href="../../../t/e/a/User_talk%7ETeacherjjlee_2fc9.html" title="User talk:Teacherjjlee">talk</a>).</small></p>
<p>Manchuria: History and Culture always had been isolated one for China. Reason is Chinese separated what is Chinese territory and what is independent Manchuria by building " GREAT WALL". So Chinese can't really say too much about Manchuria whereas Korean history and Culture is directly link with Manchuria. It was cradle of Korean civilization and birth of Korean Kingdom. ( Ko-Chosun, Korguryo, Palhai, Koryo) all of these Korean Kingdom has close kinship with Manchuria. Simply cannot deny historical and geographical location of the country and culture.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Concerning Manchuria case, I'm agree with you it belongs to China <b>since 1860</b> but before it didn't belong before (see <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Proper_9be8.html" title="China Proper">China Proper</a> article): After the Primorsky Krai area (滨海州) was ceded to Russia in 1860 <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_of_Peking_19a3.html" title="Convention of Peking">Treaty of Peking</a> (北京條約), the Manchu/Qing government began to open the area up to migration, which quickly resulted in Han Chinese becoming the dominant ethnic group in the region at the dawn of the twentieth century.<a href="../../../w/h/l/User%7EWhlee_2402.html" title="User:Whlee">Whlee</a> 13:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think people disagree on whether Balhae is Chinese or Korean, so I don't know why this page is classified under Korean History and written in a pro-korea tone. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.97.195.124_40b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.97.195.124">155.97.195.124</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.97.195.124.html" title="User talk:155.97.195.124">talk</a>).</small></p>
<p>According to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Whlee#Goguryeo_a_Korean_kingdom_.3F_The_.22Silk_Road_Philosophy.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Whlee#Goguryeo_a_Korean_kingdom_.3F_The_.22Silk_Road_Philosophy.22" rel="nofollow">my point of view</a> concerning Balhae Kingdom. It would be very difficult to defend Korean claims on Balhae Kingdom, because&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>it can be considered as a multi-ethnical nation like Goguryeo was. No written records from Balhae itself survived.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Balhae Kingdom was strongly influenced by Chinese Tang dynasty more than Silla was.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unlike Goguryeo, Balhae rarely fought Chinese (only in the beginning under Mu Wang) but sought to expand its hegemony over the Mohe in Manchuria [under Mun Wang (737 - 793) and Seon Wang (818-830)]. Balhae policy was more friendship than Gorguryeo's one were previously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the statements i mentionned above, Balhae belongs to Korean History because&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extreme southern part of Balhae Namhae Prefecture (남해부) and part of the Yongwon Prefecture (용원부) the present-day South and North Hamgyong Province respectively</li>
<li>Silla and Balhae fought each other on the beginning of the 8th century and then remained indifferents themselves.</li>
<li>After the fall of Balhae (in 926), Goryeo instead of Silla welcome Balhae peoples for an asile first. and in addition to that Goryeo was not able to reconquer southern Balhae territory (Hamgyong Province) which were left and settled by Jurchen, we can also remark that Goryeo Cheonlijangseong built between 1033 and 1044, which serve as a border between Goryeo-Khitan Liao and Jurchens, ran from the mouth of the Yalu River at Uiju to around Hamheung.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion&#160;: Balhae is less "Korean" than Gogouryeo was and should have to be considered as an independent state. <a href="../../../w/h/l/User%7EWhlee_2402.html" title="User:Whlee">Whlee</a> 18:28, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Click on the encyclopedias in the External Links section. Balhae is under Korean history topics. Likewise, the Korean history template belongs in this article. The introduction is pretty clear about the character of the state, being a union of Korean and Malgal people, with Goguryeo ruling class. And yes, the other encyclopedias call Goguryeo "Korean."

Maybe it is good to make a template for Chinese history eastnorth area so less content shall be included--<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeahsoo_b2b5.html" title="User:Yeahsoo">Yeahsoo</a> 17:41, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just have a question. Why are Chinese people claiming that Goguryeo and Balhae is theirs so suddenly? It may seem racist to the Chinese, but I just do not understand why u guys were quite for a looooong time, and then suddenly bursting out to take Goguryeo and Balhae. I apologize for my unneutrality and incoviniance. Je comprende pas! Le Coree a Goguyei et Balhaie quod le shine mal.Orthodxy 04:33, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hereby paste the Admin comment as a reminder, the below is from Talk:Goguryeo:--<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeahsoo_b2b5.html" title="User:Yeahsoo">Yeahsoo</a> 23:33, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>"I think a compromise needs to be first reached on Goguryeo. The Balhae issue is a separate one and needs to be dealt with separately. (But yes, I do think that the Chinese name should be above the Korean in that article -- but again, that's something to be discussed later -- but I'd also be advocating adding the Russian name.) If there is no way to reach a compromise here as to Goguryeo, it bodes poorly for the hopes of doing so eventually universality.</li>
</ul>
<p>I oppose "Northeast Area of China" (or any variation thereof) as cumbersome and historically problematic -- because what constitutes the "Northeast Area" of China was constantly shifting throughout history. It is for the same reason why I felt it was boneheaded for the Republic of China authorities to refer to the Indochina Peninsula -- as problematic as that name itself was -- as the "Central-Southern Peninsula" (中南半島) -- not only did it show disrespect to the people of the region but, even when that problem was ignored, it was not historically accurate. I can be convinced, otherwise, though, if there are good reasons, and I don't see any right now. Again, "Manchuria" was coined by Hong Taiji, not the Japanese. --Nlu (talk) 07:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)"</p>
