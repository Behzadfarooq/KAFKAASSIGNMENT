<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_I_of_Jerusalem_ca15.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Baldwin was a son of <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eustace_II_of_Boulogne_faf6.html" title="Eustace II of Boulogne">Eustace II of Boulogne</a> and Ida of <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-sur-Mer_baa6.html" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a>, and the younger brother of <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eustace_III_of_Boulogne_ca4b.html" title="Eustace III of Boulogne">Eustace III of Boulogne</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godfrey_of_Bouillon_75f1.html" title="Godfrey of Bouillon">Godfrey of Bouillon</a>. As the youngest brother, Baldwin was originally intended for a career in the church, but he had given this up around 1080; according to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Tyre_c43c.html" title="William of Tyre">William of Tyre</a>, who lived later in the 12th century and did not know Baldwin personally: "in his youth, Baldwin was well nurtured in the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_arts.html" title="Liberal arts">liberal studies</a>. He became a cleric, it is said, and, because of his illustrious lineage, held benefices commonly called <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prebend.html" title="Prebend">prebends</a> in the churches of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheims.html" title="Rheims">Rheims</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambrai.html" title="Cambrai">Cambrai</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge_%28city%29.html" title="Liège (city)">Liège</a>." Afterwards he lived in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a>, where he married Godehilde (or Godvera) de Toeni, a member of a noble Anglo-Norman family (and formerly betrothed wife of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_de_Beaumont%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leicester_80d4.html" title="Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester">Robert de Beaumont</a>). He returned to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine_%28province%29.html" title="Lorraine (province)">Lorraine</a> in order to take control of the county of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdun-sur-Meuse_8469.html" title="Verdun-sur-Meuse">Verdun</a> (previously held by Godfrey).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_I_of_Jerusalem_ca15.html" title="Edit section: First Crusade">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Crusade</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/0/9/1096.html" title="1096">1096</a> he joined the First Crusade with his brothers Godfrey and <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eustace_III_of_Boulogne_ca4b.html" title="Eustace III of Boulogne">Eustace III of Boulogne</a>, selling much of his property to the church in order to pay for his expenses. His wife Godehilde (or Godvera) also accompanied him. This was the second movement of crusaders; the first, the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Crusade_7946.html" title="People's Crusade">People's Crusade</a>, had been composed of the lower classes and caused much destruction on their march before being destroyed in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>. When Godfrey passed through <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coloman_of_Hungary_f385.html" title="Coloman of Hungary">King Coloman</a> demanded a hostage to ensure their good conduct, and Baldwin was handed over until his companions had left Hungarian territory.</p>
<p>After entering <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> territory, there were a few skirmishes with the Greeks, who had also suffered from the People's Crusade. Baldwin commanded a detachment of troops which captured a bridge in the vicinity of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. After reaching the city, the mass of troops could not be restrained from pillaging the surrounding territory, and <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_emperor.html" title="Byzantine emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexius_I_Comnenus_c80b.html" title="Alexius I Comnenus">Alexius I Comnenus</a> was forced to provide a hostage in order to restore peace. The hostage, his son the future emperor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_II_Comnenus_a2a1.html" title="John II Comnenus">John II Comnenus</a>, was entrusted to the care of Baldwin. According to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Comnena_d65e.html" title="Anna Comnena">Anna Comnena</a>, Baldwin reprimanded one of his soldiers who dared to sit on Alexius' throne in Constantinople.</p>
<p>Baldwin accompanied his brothers as far as <a href="../../../e/r/e/Ere%C4%9Fli.html" title="Ereğli">Heraclea</a> in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, where he broke away from the main body of the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">crusaders</a> with <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tancred%2C_Prince_of_Galilee_1132.html" title="Tancred, Prince of Galilee">Tancred</a> to march into <a href="../../../c/i/l/Cilicia.html" title="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. Tancred was surely seeking to capture some land and establish himself as a petty ruler in the east, and Baldwin may have had the same goal. During his absence his wife fell ill and died at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marash.html" title="Marash">Marash</a>, which meant that Baldwin could no longer depend on his wife's lands for support. Some historians have suggested that his entire strategy changed from that point, others believe that the change happened earlier.</p>
<p>In September of <a href="../../../1/0/9/1097.html" title="1097">1097</a> he took <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarsus_in_Cilicia_07e2.html" title="Tarsus in Cilicia">Tarsus</a> from Tancred, and installed his own garrison in the city, with help from a fleet of <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate.html" title="Pirate">pirates</a> from <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-sur-Mer_baa6.html" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a>. Tancred and Baldwin's armies skirmished briefly at Mamistra, but the two never came to open warfare and Tancred marched on towards <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antioch.html" title="Antioch">Antioch</a>. After rejoining the main army at Marash, Baldwin received an invitation from an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_people.html" title="Armenian people">Armenian</a> named Bagrat, and moved eastwards towards the <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphrates.html" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, where he occupied <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbessel.html" title="Turbessel">Turbessel</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Count_of_Edessa" id="Count_of_Edessa"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_I_of_Jerusalem_ca15.html" title="Edit section: Count of Edessa">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Count of Edessa</span></h2>
<p>Another invitation came from <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoros_of_Edessa_5a52.html" title="Thoros of Edessa">Thoros of Edessa</a>, where Baldwin was adopted as Thoros' son and successor. When Thoros was <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinated</a> in March of <a href="../../../1/0/9/1098.html" title="1098">1098</a>, Baldwin became the first count of <a href="../../../e/d/e/Edessa%2C_Mesopotamia_1ae0.html" title="Edessa, Mesopotamia">Edessa</a>, although it is unknown if he played any role in the assassination. He ruled the county until <a href="../../../1/1/0/1100.html" title="1100">1100</a>, marrying <a href="../../../a/r/d/Arda_of_Armenia_a6f6.html" title="Arda of Armenia">Arda</a>, the daughter of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoros_I_of_Armenia_e897.html" title="Thoros I of Armenia">Thoros I of Armenia</a>, and acting as an ambassador between the crusaders and Armenians.</p>
<p>During these two years he captured <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samosata.html" title="Samosata">Samosata</a> and Seruj (Sarorgia) from the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a>, and defeated a conspiracy by some of his Armenian subjects in <a href="../../../1/0/9/1098.html" title="1098">1098</a>. During the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Antioch_3479.html" title="Siege of Antioch">Siege of Antioch</a> he sent money and food to his fellow crusaders, although he himself did not participate. <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerbogha.html" title="Kerbogha">Kerbogha</a>, the governor of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosul.html" title="Mosul">Mosul</a>, was marching to relieve <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antioch.html" title="Antioch">Antioch</a> but first stopped at Edessa, which he besieged for three weeks, to no avail. Kerbogha was later defeated at Antioch and the crusaders established <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality_of_Antioch_0539.html" title="Principality of Antioch">a principality</a> there. Later that year Baldwin had consolidated his power enough that he was able to march out and besiege <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azaz.html" title="Azaz">Azaz</a> with his brother Godfrey, where they defeated the forces of <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridwan_of_Aleppo_42a2.html" title="Ridwan of Aleppo">Ridwan of Aleppo</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="../../../1/0/9/1099.html" title="1099">1099</a> he visited <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> along with <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemund_I_of_Antioch_df3d.html" title="Bohemund I of Antioch">Bohemund I of Antioch</a>, but he returned to Edessa in January <a href="../../../1/1/0/1100.html" title="1100">1100</a>. After returning to Edessa, Baldwin aided in relieving the siege of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melitene.html" title="Melitene">Melitene</a>, at which Bohemund was captured by the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danishmends.html" title="Danishmends">Danishmends</a>. The Armenian ruler of the city, <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel_of_Melitene_c5b6.html" title="Gabriel of Melitene">Gabriel</a>, then recognized Baldwin as overlord of the city.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_I_of_Jerusalem_ca15.html" title="Edit section: King of Jerusalem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">King of Jerusalem</span></h2>
<p>After Godfrey's death in July of 1100 he was invited to Jerusalem by the supporters of a secular monarchy. He granted Edessa to a cousin, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_II_of_Jerusalem_a77a.html" title="Baldwin II of Jerusalem">Baldwin of Bourcq</a>, and on the way to Jerusalem he was ambushed by <a href="../../../d/u/q/Duqaq.html" title="Duqaq">Duqaq</a> of <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> near <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beirut.html" title="Beirut">Beirut</a>. Duqaq’s troops were defeated and there was no further trouble on the way to Jerusalem, where he arrived at the beginning of November.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem Baldwin was opposed by his old enemy Tancred, as well as the new <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Patriarch_of_Jerusalem_2712.html" title="Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem">patriarch</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagobert_of_Pisa_85cb.html" title="Dagobert of Pisa">Dagobert of Pisa</a>, who would have preferred to set up a theocratic state while Godfrey was still alive. As soon as he arrived Baldwin set out on an expedition against the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egyptian</a> territory to the south and did not return until the end of December. On <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Day_0d60.html" title="Christmas Day">Christmas Day</a> he was crowned the first king of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> by the patriarch himself, who had in the meantime given up his opposition to Baldwin, although he refused to crown Baldwin in Jerusalem. The coronation took place instead in <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem.html" title="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a>.</p>
<p>The struggle between church and state continued into the spring of <a href="../../../1/1/0/1101.html" title="1101">1101</a>, when Baldwin had Dagobert suspended by a papal legate, while later in the year the two disagreed on the question of the contribution to be made by the patriarch towards the defence of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Land_6f3c.html" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a>. The struggle ended in the deposition of Dagobert in <a href="../../../1/1/0/1102.html" title="1102">1102</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_I_of_Jerusalem_ca15.html" title="Edit section: Expansion of the kingdom">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion of the kingdom</span></h3>
<p>In 1101 Baldwin captured <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsuf.html" title="Arsuf">Arsuf</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesarea.html" title="Caesarea">Caesarea</a>, with assistance from a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa.html" title="Genoa">Genoese</a> fleet. In return the Genoese were granted trading quarters in these towns, and an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Caesarea_7e29.html" title="Archbishop of Caesarea">archbishopric</a> was established in Caesarea. In September of that year Baldwin defeated the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptians.html" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ramlah_1dfb.html" title="Battle of Ramlah">Battle of Ramlah</a>, although it was believed in Jerusalem that the crusader army had been defeated and Baldwin had been killed. Tancred was prepared to take up the regency before it was finally reported that Baldwin had been victorious.</p>
<p>In 1102 another battle was fought at Ramlah, with remnants of the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade_of_1101.html" title="Crusade of 1101">Crusade of 1101</a>, including <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen%2C_Count_of_Blois_dd4f.html" title="Stephen, Count of Blois">Stephen, Count of Blois</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_IX_of_Aquitaine_c2d9.html" title="William IX of Aquitaine">William IX of Aquitaine</a>, and <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_VI_of_Lusignan_c36b.html" title="Hugh VI of Lusignan">Hugh VI of Lusignan</a>. This time the Egyptians were victorious; Baldwin lost most of his army including Stephen of Blois, but he himself escaped back to Arsuf on his horse (unusually for this period, especially considering the high death rate of horses during the First Crusade and afterwards, the name of the horse has survived: she was called Gazala). He did not want to risk venturing out of the city in fear of being captured by the Egyptians, so he was ferried back to <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jaffa%2C_Israel_45aa.html" title="Jaffa, Israel">Jaffa</a> by the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate.html" title="Pirate">pirate</a> <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godric_of_Finchale_c1c1.html" title="Godric of Finchale">Godric of Finchale</a>, and thence secretly to Jerusalem. The Egyptians were still in the field, however, and Baldwin met them again outside Jaffa, and this time was victorious.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/0/1103.html" title="1103">1103</a> Baldwin besieged Acre, without success as it was relieved by an Egyptian fleet. That year he also paid the ransom for Bohemund of Antioch, who was still in prison following his defeat at Melitene; Baldwin preferred Bohemund to Tancred, who ruled Antioch as regent, and was also <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Galilee_51be.html" title="Prince of Galilee">prince of Galilee</a> earlier in Baldwin's reign. In <a href="../../../1/1/0/1104.html" title="1104">1104</a> however Baldwin was assisted by a Genoese fleet and Acre was captured. In <a href="../../../1/1/0/1105.html" title="1105">1105</a> another battle was fought at Ramlah and Baldwin was victorious here as well. In <a href="../../../1/1/0/1109.html" title="1109">1109</a> he acted as arbitrator of a council of the greatest barons outside the walls of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripoli%2C_Lebanon_6409.html" title="Tripoli, Lebanon">Tripoli</a>, and forced Tancred to give up his claim to the city. Soon after <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Tripoli_8495.html" title="Siege of Tripoli">the city fell</a> to the crusaders, forming the nucleus of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Tripoli_bc98.html" title="County of Tripoli">County of Tripoli</a>. In <a href="../../../1/1/1/1110.html" title="1110">1110</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beirut.html" title="Beirut">Beirut</a> was added to the territory of Jerusalem, again with help from the Genoese. Baldwin then travelled north to assist Edessa, under siege from Mawdud of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosul.html" title="Mosul">Mosul</a>.</p>
<p>On his return, Sidon was captured with aid from <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigurd_I_of_Norway_e745.html" title="Sigurd I of Norway">Sigurd I of Norway</a>. In <a href="../../../1/1/1/1111.html" title="1111">1111</a> Baldwin assisted Tancred in besieging <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaizar.html" title="Shaizar">Shaizar</a>, and then also besieged <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyre_%28Lebanon%29_aa4b.html" title="Tyre (Lebanon)">Tyre</a> with no success. In <a href="../../../1/1/1/1113.html" title="1113">1113</a> Baldwin faced a large invasion by the combined forces of Toghtekin of Damascus and <a href="../../../a/q/_/Aq_Sunqur_al-Hajib_759c.html" title="Aq Sunqur al-Hajib">Aksunk-ur</a> of Mosul, and though the kingdom was on the brink of destruction Baldwin was assisted by troops from Antioch and new arrivals of European pilgrims.</p>
<p>In 1113 he also married <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_del_Vasto_c895.html" title="Adelaide del Vasto">Adelaide del Vasto</a>; he had abandoned his Armenian wife Arda in <a href="../../../1/1/0/1108.html" title="1108">1108</a>, on the pretext that she had been unfaithful, or, according to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guibert_of_Nogent_01a0.html" title="Guibert of Nogent">Guibert of Nogent</a>, because she had been raped by <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate.html" title="Pirate">pirates</a> on the way to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. It is more likely however that she was simply politically useless in Jerusalem, which had no Armenian population. Under the marriage agreement, if Baldwin and Adelaide had no children, the heir to the kingdom would be <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_II_of_Sicily_7ac9.html" title="Roger II of Sicily">Roger II of Sicily</a>, Adelaide's son by her first husband <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_I_of_Sicily_6894.html" title="Roger I of Sicily">Roger I</a>. Technically the marriage to Adelaide was bigamous because Arda was still alive in a monastery in Jerusalem, and it would later cause many problems both for Baldwin and <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnulf_of_Chocques_c926.html" title="Arnulf of Chocques">Patriarch Arnulf</a>, who had sanctioned it.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/1/1115.html" title="1115">1115</a> he led an expedition into <a href="../../../o/u/l/Oultrejordain.html" title="Oultrejordain">Oultrejordain</a> and built the castle of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_%28Crusader_castle%29_8b23.html" title="Montreal (Crusader castle)">Montreal</a>. The Syrian Christians who lived in the area were invited to settle in Jerusalem to replenish the population, which had been mostly massacred in 1099. In <a href="../../../1/1/1/1117.html" title="1117">1117</a> he built the castle of Scandalion near Tyre, which was still in Muslim hands.</p>

<p>In 1117 Baldwin also fell ill. He was convinced that the sickness was due to his bigamous marriage to Adelaide, and in response Adelaide was sent back to Sicily, much to her disgust. Baldwin recovered however, and in <a href="../../../1/1/1/1118.html" title="1118">1118</a> he marched into Egypt and plundered <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farama.html" title="Farama">Farama</a>. According to <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulcher_of_Chartres_8b7a.html" title="Fulcher of Chartres">Fulcher of Chartres</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then one day he went walking along the river which the Greeks call the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile.html" title="Nile">Nile</a> and the Hebrews the <a href="../../../g/i/h/Gihon.html" title="Gihon">Gihon</a>, near the city, enjoying himself with some of his friends. Some of the knights very skillfully used their lances to spear the fish found there and carried them to their camp near the city and ate them. Then the king felt within himself the renewed pangs of an old wound and was most seriously weakened."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">historian</a> <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fuller_8398.html" title="Thomas Fuller">Thomas Fuller</a> remarked more succinctly, Baldwin "caught many fish, and his death in eating them."</p>
<p>Baldwin was carried back to Jerusalem on a litter but died on the way, at the village of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Arish_255b.html" title="Al-Arish">Al-Arish</a> on April 2. Fulcher of Chartres says "The Franks wept, the Syrians, and even the Saracens who saw it grieved also." His cousin Baldwin of Bourcq was chosen as his successor, although the kingdom was also offered to Eustace III, who did not want it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_I_of_Jerusalem_ca15.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Fulcher described him as another <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua.html" title="Joshua">Joshua</a>, "the right arm of his people, the terror and adversary of his enemies." William of Tyre remarked that he was similar to <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saul.html" title="Saul">Saul</a>. Although William did not know him personally like Fulcher did, he left a detailed description of him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He is said to have been very tall and much larger than his brother…He was of rather light complexion, with dark-brown hair and beard. His nose was aquiline and his upper lip somewhat prominent. The lower jaw slightly receded, although not so much that it could be considered a defect. He was dignified in carriage and serious in dress and speech. He always wore a mantle hanging from his shoulders…[He] was neither stout nor unduly thin, but rather of a medium habit of body. Expert in the use of arms, agile on horseback, he was active and diligent whenever the affairs of the realm called him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baldwin's personal life was controversial. After abandoning Arda and marrying Adelaide it was suspected that he was <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a>, since he had no children with either, nor any from his first wife Godvera. William said that he "struggled in vain against the lustful sins of the flesh."</p>
<p>The <i>Historia Hierosolymitana</i> of Fulcher, who had accompanied Baldwin to Edessa as Baldwin's chaplain, and had lived in Jerusalem during his reign, is the primary source for Baldwin's career.</p>
