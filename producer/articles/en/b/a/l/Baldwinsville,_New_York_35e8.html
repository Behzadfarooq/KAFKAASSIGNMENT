<p>What is known today as Baldwinsville was founded as an unnamed settlement by John McHarrie (originally a farmer from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>), who used to provide portage across the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Seneca_River_%28New_York%29_fdc0.html" title="Seneca River (New York)">Seneca River</a>.</p>
<p>It is named after Dr. Jonas Baldwin and his wife Eliza who visited the area in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1798.html" title="1798">1798</a>, returning to settle in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1808.html" title="1808">1808</a> to start the community. Dr. Baldwin built a dam across the Seneca River to generate energy and a private canal to keep the integrity of the water highway. It incorporated in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a> as the Village of Baldwinsville.</p>
<p>Baldwinsville initially grew as a local center for a prosperous farming area, with a <a href="../../../g/r/i/Gristmill.html" title="Gristmill">grain mill</a> located on an island in the center of town between the Erie Canal (now the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Barge_Canal_ef42.html" title="New York State Barge Canal">New York State Barge Canal</a>) and the Seneca River. It was also served by the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erie_Lackawanna_Railway_959a.html" title="Erie Lackawanna Railway">Erie Lackawanna Railway</a>, connecting Baldwinsville to the cities of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_New_York_b662.html" title="Syracuse, New York">Syracuse</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/w/Oswego%2C_New_York_1547.html" title="Oswego, New York">Oswego</a>. In addition to agriculture, Baldwinsville had small factories, such as Morris Machine Works, Jardine Bronze Foundry, and others. A large brewery now owned by <a href="../../../a/n/h/Anheuser-Busch_c875.html" title="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a> was constructed in the 1970s to take advantage of ample water supplies from Lake Ontario. As agriculture and industry have receded, Baldwinsville has evolved into an attractive and picturesque bedroom community.</p>
<p>Grace Episcopal Church, formerly of Elizabeth Street, is believed to be the first church in the United States to use electric lighting.</p>
<p>Dozens of local farm boys are listed on the Civil War monument in the village cemetery along the Seneca River, having served and died in several units of the Union Army. Those listed on this monument served under General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Logan_633d.html" title="John A. Logan">John A. Logan</a> as part of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_T._Sherman_37f4.html" title="William T. Sherman">William T. Sherman</a>'s army. Other units included 1st Regiment, Light Artillery, N. Y. S.

<p>Several community festivals are held each year. <a href="http://www.celebratebaldwinsville.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.celebratebaldwinsville.com/" rel="nofollow">Celebrate Baldwinsville</a>, a festival that celebrates the village and surrounding community is held every September. The Seneca River Day festival (formerly the John McHarrie Day festival) occurs in July; it features an <i>anything that floats race</i>, which encourages entrants to build a floating vehicle without spending more than a set amount (currently $50). Many functions are held at the Anheuser-Busch amphitheater on Paper Mill Island. There have been several local, regional and national bands playing on weekends throughout the summer months. In the downtown area, there are 5 bars and one wine and coffee bar.</p>

Its 24th lock sports a local restaurant.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Census_Bureau_2c85.html" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the village has a total area of 8.4 <a href="../../../k/m/%C2%B2/Km%C2%B2.html" title="Km²">km²</a> (3.2 <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_mile.html" title="Square mile">mi²</a>). 8.0 km² (3.1 mi²) of it is land and 0.4 km² (0.2 mi²) of it (5.23%) is water.</p>
<p>Baldwinsville is located on gently rolling country shaped by the glaciers of the Ice Age, which also created nearby <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ontario_d812.html" title="Lake Ontario">Lake Ontario</a> and the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finger_Lakes_9f1b.html" title="Finger Lakes">Finger Lakes</a>. It lies in a transitional zone between the nearly flat plain immediately adjacent to Lake Ontario, and the hills to the south that form the approaches to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegheny_Mountains_1d86.html" title="Allegheny Mountains">Allegheny Mountains</a> of southern New York and northern Pennsylvania. This rolling glacial terrain is intersected and divided by forests, meadows, farmland, and bodies of water of all types, which, combined with significant seasonal variations, presents a constantly changing tableau of immense beauty. Local soils are a rich and varied blend, with deposits of gravels, sands, and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_flour.html" title="Rock flour">rock flour</a>, ground up and tilled by the glaciers, and left behind as they receded to the north. As is typical of the Great Lakes plains, these varied soils and gentle slopes create ideal conditions for specialty agriculture, orchards, and vegetable farming. The "<a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_effect.html" title="Lake effect">lake effect</a> " moderates the harsh arctic winters found on the north side of Lake Ontario, but this comes at a price. Snowfall in the region is the highest for any metropolitan area in the United States. High average rainfall and snowfall result in abundant water resources.</p>
<p>Baldwinsville is in a region of rivers, lakes, streams, swamps, marshes, creeks, and ponds. Local forests, while predominantly hardwoods such as <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar_Maple_2e9b.html" title="Sugar Maple">Sugar Maple</a>, are also widely variable due to the variations in soil, drainage, and microclimate. Nearly every tree species found in the northeastern United States can be found in the forests near Baldwinsville. Wildlife is abundant, and many varieties of fish are found in the local waters.</p>
