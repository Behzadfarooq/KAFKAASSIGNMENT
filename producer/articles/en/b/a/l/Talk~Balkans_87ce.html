<p>There's no end to this discussion. Trust me. Greek nationalists demand that Macedonians should be called Macedonian Slavs and not Macedonians, because Macedonians were an ancienct semi-greek people (see <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a>). There position is completely ridiculous, though - it's like Germans demanding that the French be called something else because Franks were a German tribe or Swedes demanding that Russia changes its name because the name originally comes from a Swedish tribe. There are examples like this all over the world, so the only difference here is Greek nationalism.</p>

<dd>Not the UN or EU recongizes Republic of Mecodonia. Its considered Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. So I dont understand why do Slavic Macedonians can have their nationlist views expressed and have the right to put Republic of Macedonia?If your going to use "Republic of Macedonia" then you MUST use "The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprius" as well. They both are not recongnized, so what are the rules? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 22:45, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that Albania is considered to have Muslim majority, but it is not a clear cut case. Most people seeing such statements would be reminded of other Islamic countries, but there is a big difference in Albania. Most people who are considered Muslim now are just "born" into that description as a result of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> influence from a long time ago. They do not adhere strictly to the 5 pillars. Although you can hear the call of prayer in Tirana and other cities, it is only because the government is really tolerant. There are no doubt "true" Muslims, but there are also many more people who just call themselves Muslim. People of different faiths intermarry without any prejudice. Also all holidays are observed by all people in some form. I think most people are generally religious (as in believing in a higher being), and there are a good deal of atheists (having resulted mostly from the communist regime). These are just my observations. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 03:50, 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is it different for Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia, the Muslim population of Greece, and Bosniaks? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 08:05, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure, but I would speculate that this is the case for Albanians. In Greece, there are likely Muslims from other countries that would behave differently. For example, there was a big raucus over the issue of building the only mosque in Athens. This does not mean that all Albanian muslims behave this way, but I *suspect* that the majority does. All the media seems to leave this aspect out and instead focuses solely on stating that there are muslims in the balkans. I don't know if there are any studies anywhere, but I would be interested to know. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 16:31, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that would be really interesting. I wrote because I suspected that for example in Bosnia the situation was similar to that of Albania. Then your note should be extended.

<p>It seems to me that in this article inconsistency arises because the Balkan peninsula as a physical-geographical concept and the Balkans region as a human-geographical concept are confounded. If we accept the physical boundary along Danube, Sava and the Julian Alps, then a small eastern part of Rumania, a big southern part of Serbia (excluding Vojvodina) and a southern part of Croatia are included. Slovenia is excluded. When Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia were part of Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia partly belonged to the Balkan peninsula. When determining the boundaries of the Balkans region, we have no clear-cut criteria, and we are bound to have disputes because different nations have different ideas of the Balkans region. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 05:10, 25 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The whole idea of a peninsula is rather stretched. One could argue that the mentality of people from the Dalmatian coast is much less Balkan than of those in Slavonian plains, which would be the reverse of the above. The page should probably be renamed to "Balkans", it's simpler and avoids that issue. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShallot_7c68.html" title="User:Shallot">Shallot</a> 06:44, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think then it would be better to have different articles for the peninsula and the Balkans region. I think there is a peninsula, and the peninsula should include Romania because the corner of the Black Sea is where Romania ends. But this is another issue how to define that peninsula. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 09:05, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Possibly. But then you'd probably get a heap of Romanians complaining how they are getting included in the infamous Balkan peninsula. It's a lose-lose situation, really&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShallot_7c68.html" title="User:Shallot">Shallot</a> 17:26, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think the article about the Balkan peninsula could include only physical geography along with the discussion of the existent different conceptions about its boundaries. Then hardly Romanians would complain. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 19:17, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And it seems obvious that the border of the peninsula should run from near <a href="../../../r/i/j/Rijeka.html" title="Rijeka">Rijeka</a> to near the estuary of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> (no, rather even the estuary of Dniestr) but how it runs leaves room for convention. Probably Danube is chosen either then the border has a more or less east-west direction. I am curious about that. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 21:51, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

Its form doesn't even nicely fit the description of being land surrounded by water on three sides.

<p>So, should we go ahead and implement that? Probably first by moving this article to <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> and then changing the peninsula article to include a discussion about it. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShallot_7c68.html" title="User:Shallot">Shallot</a> 23:23, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you split then please let the discussion of nature and natural resources remain in the article "Balkan peninsula". It also should contain the history of the concept of Balkan peninsula along with the different conventions, which still demands research. I only know that the term "Balkan peninsula" was coined by the German geographer August Zeune in 1808. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 06:02, 15 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll just move the article to the shorter and more popular term "<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a>" until we figure out the content exactly.

<p>Before 1948, it was Yugoslavia's idea somehow to "merge" with Bulgaria and Albania (see <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_and_post-Communist_Albania_c8d1.html" title="Communist and post-Communist Albania">Communist and post-Communist Albania</a>). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 06:24, 25 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In Stalin's grand scheme of things, the logical course of events would have been for all south Slavic nations to be in one union which would in turn become part of the Soviet union -- Tito and Dimitrov are simply mentioned to have talked about it in public. Obviously this didn't go particularly well because the different entities couldn't even begin to be made to function as one (an internal problem to Yugoslavia itself, in fact). --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShallot_7c68.html" title="User:Shallot">Shallot</a> 06:44, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is probably right.

<p>The paragraphs about the Greek minority in Epirus and later Albanian immigrants in Greece fail to make clear which of them are Arvanites.

<dd>I gave it a shot at fixing this, but I suspect the whole minority thing should not be here since many countries in the balkans have minorities from other countries.

<dd>You are right that in the present state the material about Albanian minorities is overweighed. But I think it would be better to compensate this by adding other material than by deleting this. My reasons: I think it is good to have a section or a separate article about ethnic minorities on the Balkan peninsula both because it helps to understand the ethnic composition of the population on the Balkan peninsula and because the minorities are an actual or potential source of tensions and so have an overall importance for understanding the political situation on the peninsula. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 08:05, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand this, but it is obvious that there are minorities in all the countries. Since in most cases there are no credible data (all official values are likely to be either overstated or understated) to be able to give specific values, the generality that would result would in my opinion would make the addition useless to the article. Anyone is of course wellcome to give it a shot and we can take it from there. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> 16:27, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would be better to say "ethnic composition of population" because "nationality" is at least ambiguous, meaning citizenship and only secondarily meaning the belonging to an ethnic group.

<p>There is a strange thing in this article. The top implies that including Romania and Slovenia to the Balkans is not <i>usual</i>, and further it is said that <i>normally</i> Romania and Slovenia are included to the Balkans. Isn't that strange? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 19:08, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know too much about Slovenia....but Romania IS "normally" included to the Balkans alot, thats for sure. if you look at the map you will see that Romania is alot bigger than other Balkan countries. so theres a big North Romania(Central Europe) and South Romania...seems like the same problem we have with the state of Kentucky if its South or Mid-Western and other states.</p>
<p>When we say that the Balkans include only the northern part of Greece then we exclude what without doubt belongs to the peninsula (with the exception of the islands)! So I still think that the article should be split.</p>
<p><br />
And, I don't agree that "South East Europe" is an adequate term for the region. It seems to me that South East Europe must be the European South Russia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 19:19, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well the Balkans are in South Eastern Europe, all of the countries (Balkans) east of Italy are called "South East Europe". I think the term is right. Many people dont think of European South Russia as South Eastern Europe. many people just think of it as simply "Eastern Europe". Because the Balkans are more South anyway than European Russia.</p>

<p>Bitte&#160;? I dont "preach" anything except the freedom of speech. But, if you refer to the "Balkans" and similar nonsense- this is a dated concept (and, more-it's not even a peninsula.

<p>Romania and Slovenia are not in the Balkans. Balkan is a peninsula, not a region. It's boundary is river Sava with Dunav. If you look in to the map you will see that Romania and Slovenia are not south but north from this line. Also Vojvodina, a province of Serbia is not on the Balkans, but Ser&amp;Mon is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Balkans is <i>not</i> a peninsula in the classic geographical sense - there's no clearly defined isthmus so the boundary is as much political and cultural as geographical. On this basis, Slovenia's cultural, historical and ethnic links with the south Slav nations of the Balkans means that it is often also classified as a Balkan country (though I know many Slovenes don't like that description). Similarly, Romania's shared history with the other Balkan states (especially its status as part of the Ottoman Empire) mean that it's also commonly regarded as a Balkan state.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What shared history? You comparing Slovenia's 73 years as part of Yugoslavia to over 1000 years of completely shared history with Austria? In contrast, for the majority of this time, Croatia and other former Yugoslav republics were under the influence of Hungary and/or the Ottoman empire.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Are you comparing Slovenia's 1000 years as a part of Austria to thousands of years of completely shared history in the Proto-Slavic community? Or even to milions of years of shared history with amphibians?</dd>
<dd>Comparing just the number of years doesn't really work. The order of events is very important. Yugoslavia was an important phase in recent Slovenian history and there is a substantial mutual intelligibality with other Southern Slavic languages, not to mention a sizable proportion of Slovenian population with relatives in other former Yugoslav republics. You are much more likely to hear the same music as in Ljubljana's clubs in Zagreb or Belgrade than in Vienna (apart from MTV hits). And most importantly, the aversion to the Balkans and popularity of Austria and other Middle European countries is far from universal in Slovenia and many Slovenians consider Slovenia to be a part of the Balkans, whatever their concept of the term is. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 04:20, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a substantial mutual intelligibility between Slovak and some South Slavic languages - Slovene and Serbocroatian.

If we use linguistic criteria, then the argument is whether the language belongs to the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkan_linguistic_union.html" title="Balkan linguistic union">Balkan linguistic union</a>. The Slovenian language has no Balkan features at all. Neither do Croatian Kajkavian and Chakavian dialects. Serbian has some Balkan elements in grammar (the more to the south, the more balkanized the dialects are).

If it were true, than by virtue of your logic this border would have been a few kilometres south of present-day Slovenia (or Austrian Styria) making that country Balkan. Furthermore, if we follow the same logic than we have to take into consideration that it wasn't until 1718 that the last portion of Hungary was liberated from the Turks that had held it from 1526. Is Hungary in the Balkans? No, I don't think so. Despite the fact that Zagreb was never taken by the Ottoman Empire which isn't the case with Buda (the capital of Hungary). Also, the siege of Vienna by the Turks doesn't make Austria or Vienna in the slightest bit Balkan. There are too many contradictions in this article and it is impossible for those who are intent on classifying Croatia as a Balkan country to prove their case by arguments which would be applicable to all countries concerned.</dd>

<dd>If we were deciding how to divide Europe into regions with real geographical borders and differences in topography, IMO the Balkans would end on the Danube, Sava, then Savinja or even Sotla/Sutla and Mura, the Alps and the edge of the Karst plateau, including all the mountanious parts of Europe to the southeast of the Alps and excluding the Panonian plain. The Balkans would thus include most of Slovenia and Croatia, but not most of Romania.</dd>
<dd>But since the Balkans is also a politically defined region with touchy sensibilities involved, all we can do is explain the varios definitions. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 14:33, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we adopt topographical criteria, the boundary would be as you described (but Karst and Istria should be included). The Balkans, however, are described as a <b>peninsula</b> and this is why topographical criteria are rarely taken into account. If we agree that the Balkans are a peninsula, then Kupa and Sava are the most logical natural boundary. And they are also traditionally considered the northern boundary of the Balkans. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 09:29, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Sava is the boundary, not Kupa (at least for us who live in Slovenia)</i></p>
<p>Traditionally, the exact boundary is Kupa-Sava-Danube. Drawing the boundary to the spring of the Sava would bring about weird consequences - one would have to admit that a part of the Alps and of Italy lies within the Balkan peninsula. Besides, a glance at the map is enough to realize that Ljubljana, for example, does not lie within the mass of land which forms the Balkan peninsula. The statement that "for those who live in Slovenia the boundary is the Sava" surprises me, because a Slovenian friend of mine said she had learned at school that the Kupa was the boundary. So, once again: the Kupa is not only traditional, but also the most logical boundary. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 12:14, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I learned at school that Sava is the boundary. Today I went to check it and found it in the textbook for secondary schools, in the section about Balkan peninsula, written by dr. Mirko Pak. I found it also in the Lexicon of Cankarjeva zalozba (Cankar's publishing house), which is one of the most important Slovenian printed lexicons. I'll also check the information in the Encyclopedia of Slovenia next week.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, the use of Kolpa seems arbitrary to me. Perhaps the boundary should be the northern boundary of Dinarides, which is more to the north than Kolpa. --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleassar777_7cf2.html" title="User:Eleassar777">Eleassar777</a> 16:44, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And the use of the Sava and of the Danube does not seem arbitrary to you?&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>The Sava is the boundary. But, as you surely know, the Sava does not rise in or fall into the Adriatic Sea. So the boundary has to leave the Sava at some point and go to tha Adriatic Sea, which constitutes the western boundary. Drawing the northern boundary along the Sava river to its springs is against the geographical tradition and, so to speak, against the reason. My guess is that this is a misunderstanding which stems from the fact that many encyclopaedias and books simply state that the Sava and the Danube form the northern boundary of the Balkan peninsula. This is correct, but it is obvious that this is only a rough description of the northern boundary, and not a full and detailed description which would allow to precisely draw the northern boundary on the map. The northern boundary of the peninsula is precisely defined, but rarely precisely described. The first approximation is "the Danube and Sava rivers". The second approximation is "the Danube, Sava and Kupa rivers" and this is how <i>Enciklopedija Jugoslavije</i>, which you will probably find in a Slovenian library, describes it. Chances are you will find <i>Enciclopedia italiana</i>, which gives a more detailed description of the boundary:</dd>
<dd><i>[Regione Balcanica] si attacca alla massa continentale europea lungo una linea che convenzionalmente è segnata dal corso del Danubio tra la foce e la confluenza della Sava, poi da questo fino alla confluenza della Kulpa, infine dalla Kulpa sino alla zona sorgentifica presso Ossiuniz, di dove il limite attraversa la linea di rilievi, paralleli alla costa orientale del Quarnaro, in quella parte più depressa che a mezzogiorno del Monte Nevoso segna il termine delle Alpi Giulie.</i></dd>
<dd>So, the boundary goes along the Danube river to the confluence of the Sava, then along the Sava river to the confluence of the Kupa, then along the Kupa river to its springs near Osilnica, then it crosses the Gorski Kotar (not named in the encyclopedia) and arrives at the Gulf of Quarner.</dd>
<dd>I have never seen any detailed description of the northern boundary of the Balkan Peninsula which stated that the northern boundary goes along the Sava river to its springs. I would be glad to know such a description if it exists, even though such a description would seem irrational to me.

<p>I can agree with you to the point that the boundary does not go along Sava all to its source.

<dd>Well, the Kupa is the only big river in the region which is parallel and close to 45°20'N, i.e. the line from the Gulf of Quarner to the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube_Delta_90b2.html" title="Danube Delta">Danube Delta</a> which cuts off the Balkan peninsula from the "mainland" like this:</dd>

<dd>you have spent a bigger portion of your expose defining the geographical borders of the Balkans. What on earth should, then, the phrase "I think Slovenia is very beautiful and interesting, but I don't find any Balkanic traits in it." mean? As for the northern border of the Balkans, the Britannica goes as following: "In the extreme northwest of the Balkan Peninsula are the highest peaks of the Julian Alps, part of the main European Alpine system. These rise to 9,396 feet (2,864 metres) in Mount Triglav, one of the highest peaks in the Balkans."</dd>

<p>I am seriously concerned with this paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The distinct identity of the Balkans owes as much to its fragmented and often violent common history as to its mountainous geography. The region was perennially on the edge of great empires, its history dominated by wars, rebellions, invasions and clashes between empires, from the times of the Roman Empire to the latter-day Yugoslav wars. Its fractiousness and tendency to splinter into rival political entities led to the coining of the term Balkanization (or balkanizing). The term Balkan commonly connotes a connection with violence, religious strife, ethnic clannishness and a sense of hinterland.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think it represents any kind of neutrality. It is one of the many ways the West looks at the Balkans, and one of the more harmful ones at that. Do you think anybody in the Balkans talks about "Balkanization"? Obviously not. In addition, it is trying to excuse the extensive harm done by the continuous involvement of the "Great Powers" in the Balkans through some kind of inherent "instability" in the region. In fact, the Balkan Peninsula is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in Europe and as such has managed to keep together pretty well over the millenia, when its inhabitants were managing their own affairs. Unless I hear a good justification for this opinion I will delete it or rework it as it is very biased and potentially insulting. I like the mountainous geography part. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitkouwcad_8ecb.html" title="User:Mitkouwcad">Mitkouwcad</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>That would be censorship, don't do it. It is indeed the most common view of the Balkans in the west, and that's pretty evident throughout the 20th century. It most certainly doesn't excuse the involvement of the great powers in any way, it merely explicates what the result of their involvement was. I agree, however, that the current verbiage is a bit too graphic. It should be rephrased back to how it was before, and extended to include the overview of international power involvement (it hints at it saying that it was "on the edge of great empires"). --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 11:15, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree that this is the most common view of the Balkans. Maybe in <i>some</i> countries in the West it is, and those also happen to be the ones mostly involved with questionable benefits in the Balkans. And why should the West (which is only a fraction of the world) get such a prominent and biased view on this page? And isn't this an encyclopedia? This is clearly an opinion, not fact. It might be good for the BBC, with the language softened.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, a lot of it is plain wrong, let me elaborate on this (I'll concentrate on the important parts):
<ul>
<li><i>fragmented and often violent common history</i> — besides being an oxymoron, this statement is also an obvious case of weakly based generalization. Even as an opinion, it stands a lot of argument. The history of the Balkans has been more the one of fusion than the one of fragmentation. The two classical "fragmentation" events - The Balkan Wars and the recent Yugoslav Wars can at least partially be traced back to indiscriminate involvement of the Great Powers in the border-drawing process in the Balkans (The <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Berlin%2C_1878_3b6e.html" title="Treaty of Berlin, 1878">Treaty of Berlin</a>, the <a href="../../../a/f/t/Aftermath_of_World_War_I_0c1b.html" title="Aftermath of World War I">Aftermath of World War I</a> and so forth). In addition, the last two big wars in Europe were not brought on by Balkan nations, but by their much more "civilized" western neighbours.</li>
<li><i>perennially on the edge of great empires</i> — This is some meaning of "great empires" and "perennially" I am not familiar with. Maybe if you mean the British Empire. The Ottoman, Byzantine, Bulgarian (not really an empire, but still), Roman and Macedonian (as in Alexander the Great and his dad) Empires all had a lot of their heart in the Balkans. Plus, why should history be about Great Empires, after all? Isn't it about the people?</li>
<li><i>violence, religious strife, ethnic clannishness and a sense of hinterland</i> — This is the most spiteful and ethnically biased part, and I don't even feel a need to argue with it. It argues itself. Obviously whoever wrote it thinks there is such a thing as "better people" and "worse people" in this world and that he/she is from the better part. Consult <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ugly_Duckling_2d8a.html" title="The Ugly Duckling">The Ugly Duckling</a> if you didn't read it when you were little (the part about the cat and the hen). In addition, it shows a lot of ignorance about the Balkans. There actually <i>are</i> many parts of the Balkans where ethnicities have lived together for centuries and such statements and the associated stereotypes can only do harm to such communities (and we've had enough harm, thank you!).</li>
</ul>

<dd>I don't want to censor anything, but I really like the Wikipedia project and this paragraph does it no credit. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitkouwcad_8ecb.html" title="User:Mitkouwcad">mitkouwcad</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On another note, I went through the history of this paragraph and I think I am starting to understand where you are coming from. (Between "'Balkan' being a pejorative term acording to some" and the whole "Croatia and Greece don't necessarily feel themselves part of it".) I appreciate your point, but I still don't think it's exactly neutral the way it's presented. Maybe a change of wording? Or addition of something to the effect that some people do not feel Balkan is a pejorative term? I don't know, having been subjected to the whole "PC revolution" thing, I find myself thinking that it's not the actual terms that are harmful but the opinions of the people who use them. So whether you call someone "Nigger", "Negro", "Black" or "African American" it really doesn't matter, if you are inherently racist, but don't want to admit it and deal with it. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitkouwcad_8ecb.html" title="User:Mitkouwcad">mitkouwcad</a> 01:32, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Take the first paragraph. Since we "know" the Balkanites to be bloodlusting tribal barbarians then it is only too clear that "The identity of the Balkans owes as much to its fragmented and often violent common history". This isn`t "identity of the Balkans". This is a perception of the Balkans in the West, and as such should be titled so and not presented as fact.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the second paragraph the story repeats itself. Because we "know" the term `Balkanisation` means fragmentation and refers to the Balkans, then it must be that the Balkans are a fragmentious place. Wrong. The word itself has been around for no longer than 10 years and it came around due to a break up of a single federal state in the Balkans. That doesn`t mean the rest of centuries and centuries of history were anything like that. (And in fact for the state in question to be formed in the first place multiple recognised and unrecognised states had to merge so you could by the same token argue the Balkans are a place of unifications.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The third paragraph is OK but it is there just to lessen the effect of the first two, which shouldn`t appear in the introduction and under "The Balkans" in the first place.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fourth and last paragraph again is bad. In this context it is both patronising and sounds of as an appology saying that not the whole of the Balkans is made up of the savages, its only the black sheep in the Western part while the East is OK. Also the EU mention here makes it sound like EU entrance is somekind of benchmark for civilisational level. I.e. since we "know" the civilised western EU takes in only civilised countries it follows that Bulgaria and Romania ain`t really that bad since they are in the EU.

<p>I have re-written the section now. I hope it will not be reverted. I admit that maybe it is not written as skillfully as what was removed (you can help with that and add to it and word it better), but at least the information contained is Balkano-centric in the sense that it presents the positive things of how the Balkanites themselves percive the region and its history (its own "identity") as opposed to the spotlight being on what the West thinks of it.

<p>I don't know, but in Bulgarian балкан does mean "mountain", although it could be that this is a consequence of the fact that the Balkan mountains <i>are</i> the most prominent mountain in Bulgaria. The etymology of the word in Bulgarian is not very clear, though. The confusion might also come from the fact that the Ottomans are far from the only Turkic tribe to have left their mark on the Balkans.

<dd>the usual bulgarian word for 'mountain' is "planina", while "balkan" too is listed as bulgarian for 'mountain', but seems to be in relation with the Balkans <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">Criztu</a> 10:54, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I can tell you that it is still currently used to mean "any mountain", although it has a quaint feeling to it. It would be interesting to see at what time the specific usage of "Balkan" for the Стара Планина mountain began. That might throw some light on the question. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitkouwcad_8ecb.html" title="User:Mitkouwcad">mitkouwcad</a> 22:17, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 500,000 number I saw mentioned in an official greek government document (on the web) a couple of years back (so I am taking that as the lower bound), the 1,000,000 number I've seen from some Albanian sources so I am taking that as the higher bound.

<p>The presence of Slavs in the region of Thessaloniki is important from the political, cultural, historical and linguistic points of view. Please notice the issue of the name of FYROM and the origins of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Church_Slavonic_09a4.html" title="Old Church Slavonic">Old Church Slavonic</a> language, for example. Hence, I'm bringing the mention of the Slavic minority back. You are welcome to add any estimates. I don't, because I consider the estimates very uncertain (since Greece supresses any research on the Slavic minority). <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 09:51, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your statement is incorrect. All the "Slavs" from the region of Thessaloniki, as well as from the whole central and eastern Greek Macedonia were either expelled as Bulgarians to Bulgaria in 1913 as a result of the Second Balkan War, or resettled, again as Bulgarians and again to Bulgaria, as a result of a voluntary population exchange agreement in the 1920s. Since then there have been Slavs in Greece only in western Greek Macedonia (Kastoria, Florina and Edessa), the majority of which was dispersed and again expelled but this time to FYROM during the Greek Civil War. At present, there is a Macedonian Slav minority in Greece only in the Florina disrtict, along the border with FYROM, and it is usually appraised at some 10,000.

<p>Dear VMORO, I'm sorry, but I can't agree with some things you wrote.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the territory inhabited by Slavs (like, for example, villages of Sugo and Visoka famous for their archaic dialect) is close enough to Thessaloniki to be termed "Thessaloniki region". But I don't insist on using this name. Suho and Visoka are situated in the region of Central Mecedonia and their inhabitants were NOT expelled during or after the civil war.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some of the Bulgarians in Suho and Visoka did leave for Bulgaria both during the Balkan Wars and then again in the the 1920's. The Slavs who stayed in Central and Eastern Macedonia were the adherents of the Constantinople Patriarchate who even before the Balkan Wars regarded themselves as Greeks.
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, Suho and Visoka are still inhabited by Slavic-speaking people. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 20:30, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They are not, they have been Hellenised. And they cannot in any way be labeled as "Macedonian Slavs". There are certainly people in the Florina district who declare themselves as Macedonian Slavs as can be seen by the communal elections where the Macedonian Slav party "Rainbow" won several seats in the communal council, but there aren't such people in the Thessaloniki region. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 13:41, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)~</dd>

<dd>Since the policy of the Greek government towards the Slavic minority becomes less and less opressive, some of my professors and colleagues went to Greece a few years ago to gather some dialectological material. They were in Suho and Visoka and they met some Slavic-speaking people. So, as you can imagine, your conviction, your expert-pose and your reference to Roudometof do not convince me. If you, and possibly Roudometof, claim that there are no Slavic-speaking people in the region of Central Macedonia, you are simply wrong. The presence of Slavic speakers in the region of Thessaloniki is also attested by other scholar sources, for example:</dd>

<dd>Whether those Slavic speakers may be called Macedonian Slavs depends on the definition, of course. If we define "Macedonian Slavs" as "autochtonous Slavic speakers living in Macedonia", then they comprise the speakers in question. The definition of "Macedonian Slavs" as "people who vote for a Macedonian party in elections" is nonsensical and I guess you do not really want to defend it. You seem to be in favor of another possible defnition, which is based on identity: Macedonian Slavs are people who feel themselves Macedonian Slavs (and their small children). But in this case drawing conclusions on identity from self-declaration would require that 1) people had an occasion to express their ethnic identity 2) social conditions allowed free and open expression of one's identity. Both assumptions does not hold in the case of Greek Slavs. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 18:01, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As far as the number of members of the Slav minority is concerned, estimates vary to an enormous degree and high estimates are not rare. For example, in 1994 Human Rights Watch estimated that the Slavic speakers in Greece may be as many as 250,000 (Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, <i>The Macedonians of Greece</i>, Human Rights Watch, New York 1994).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is a considerable difference between "Slav speakers" and "Macedonian Slavs" - which you don't seem to understand as the vague term "Slav" in your edit links directly to the article <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a>. Human Rights Watch is hardly the best source you can quote, its articles are usually prejudiced and its criteria are dubious. I can certainly agree that some 200,000 people in Greece have Slavic ORIGINS. Considering, however, that, they, especially the Patriarchists, have had education only in Greek for the past 200 years, the chances for them to be speakers are quite slim. Pls, read some Roudometof before you quote again such a statistics, I am well acquainted with all of them.

<p><i>The est. no. of Slavic speakers in Greece ( &gt;0.9%) is no more different than that of Albania or Bulgaria. In Serbia the % is much higher. Large minorites in *other* countries are not mentioned at all</i></p>
<p>Yes, undoubtfully the % of Slavic speakers in Serbia is much higher. So is the % of Slavic speakers in Bulgaria, as Serbs and Bulgars are Slavic speakers. But I don't see why this should be a reason to suppress the information about the Slavic speakers in Greece. If other large minorities are not mentioned, maybe this is a reason to mention them, but not to suppress another piece of information. I explained why IMO the Slav minority was important and should have been mentioned. My arguments were not answered. If you think that the low number of Slavic speakers makes them irrelevant, why don't you mention that number and let the reader decide if this is relevant? I consider the deletion unsubstantiated.

<dd>Because there is no sizeable Slavic (or Macedonian Slavic) population in Greece. The arguments were clearly presented in the previous posts.
<dl>
<dd>But you admit that there IS a Slavic group in Greece. If there is a small Slavic minority in Greece, this is a reason to write that there is a small Slavic minority in Greece rather than a reason to suppress information about this minority. I openly said that any data about the size of the minority were welcome and might be put in the article. But you prefered to suppress any information about the minority, which is not justified by your explanation that the miority is not numeruous. I'm asking again - why don't you let the reader decide if the minority is numerous enough to be noticeable or not? <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 12:30, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If indeed a thorough breakdown is preferable for one case then this should and must apply for every other case. It is not that hard to add the same information in Albania, Bulgaria , Serbia &amp; Montenegro, Crotia, Romania etc.In addition, ALL other ethnic/ethnolinguistic/ religious groups for EVERY state, many of whom are highly numerous, must be analytically referred. --<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinio_7792.html" title="User:Ninio">Ninio</a> 20:14, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The percentage of Slavic speakers in Greece, which you, a priori considered only as Macedonian Slav is said to be around 0.9% of the total population. Even if we assume that this specific group is non-Greek, the magnitude of the number does not justify this sentence: "<i>and a smaller <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_peoples.html" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic</a> minority in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28Greece%29_f0f8.html" title="Macedonia (Greece)">Macedonia</a></i>", because it gives the (false) impression of a sizeable minority comparable to the 120,000-strong Muslim one.
<dl>
<dd>First, I don't classify Slavic speakers in Greece a priori as Macedonians. On the contrary, I was careful not to classify them as Macedonians, Bulgars or Slavophones. They undoubtedly can be called "Macedonian Slavs" in the sense "Slavic-speaking people living in Macedonia". As the WP article "Macedonian Slav" gives another definition, I removed the link to it.</dd>
<dd>Second, INTEREG estimated that there were 100,000 Macedonians in Greece. According to these data the Slavic minority is indeed comparable to the Muslim one. If you thought that the article gave an erroneous impression as to the size of the minority, a logical solution would have been to include information about the size or to change the wording and not to delete any information about the minority. Again, your explanation does not justify your action. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 12:30, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The lower bound (40,000 -1951) seems to be derived from the official census data of Greece (1951) which claimed 40,017 *Slavic Speakers* (roughly 0.5% of its total population in 1951). This figure does *not* refer to people that may) considered themselves as ‘ethnic (Mac) Slavs’. In fact, a large part of this population was considering itself as ‘ethnic Greek’. The arguments are clearly presented in the previous posts by VMORO.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But let’s assume that a (large or small) part of that population was considering itself as non-Greek and/or as ‘ethnic Macedonian Slav’.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Two key points are:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1)The settlement (of people that considered itself as Macedonian Slav and/or Bulgarian) to the ex-Communist/Socialist Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, during and after the Greek Civil War (1944-1949).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2)The massive economic immigration that underwent during the following period (15 years, from early 1950s to late1960s). A large part of the Greek population during that period migrated to countries as Australia, Canada, Germany and the United States. A sizeable part of this immigration wave was ‘Slavic speakers’ (of whom some may considered themselves as ‘Macedonian Slavs’) and established their communities mainly in Australia, Canada and to a lesser degree the U.S.; a large part of the ‘Macedonian Slav’ communities currently present in the above countries are these people (or descendants of).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In shorts, at least a sizeable part of that 0.5% of Slavic *Speakers* (of whom an unspecified number MAY considered itself as ‘Macedonian Slav’) have migrated by the end of 1960s.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For the higher bound Eurominority (not E.U. nor INTERREG I /II /III)speculates some 100,000 Macedonian Slav (but why they pseudo-quote "INTEREG 1994" is a mystery),I can only speculate that they:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Erroneously, considered every Slavic Speaker of 1951 as Macedonian Slav. Many considered themselves as Greek, being mostly bilingual, some as Bulgarian and some as Mac Slavs.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Erroneously, did not consider the migration wave of the 1950s and 1960s.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Erroneously, they assumed that 40,000 people from the 1951 became 100,000 in 1994.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think it is very risky to embark on speculations like this, because we actually do not know how INTEREG estimated the number of Macedonian Slavs. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 08:59, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even by assuming that:
<ul>
<li>All 40,000 (1951) were considering themselves *only* as Macedonian Slavs, and</li>
<li>that they did *not* join the following migration wave at all, and</li>
<li>The actual population growth of Greece (from 1951 approx. 7,500,000 to 1994 approx. 10,500,000),</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Then the number of potential Slavic Speakers (I won’t explain again) population becomes around 55,000 in 1994. I hope that you can understand why even this number does NOT really represent a Macedonian Slav population.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you are estimating the number of Slavic speakers, the assumption about their identity is irrelevant. The estimate of 55,000 would rather assume that the data from the Census 1951 are correct and that the population growth of the Slavic group was more or less the same as the overall population growth in Greece.

<dd>The actual population that may consider itself as Macedonian Slav does not seem to exceed 10,000 people in Greece (1999)."<i>Indeed, the political party “Rainbow” which was created in 1994 and has campaigned for the recognition of a national Macedonian minority, received 7,300 votes in 1994 and 5,000 in 1999, two elections it contested alone: these figures correspond to some 7,000-10,000 citizens of all (not just voting) ages. One can estimate that besides this “hard core” there may be other citizens voting for mainstream parties that also espouse this identity, hence the above estimate.</i>"<a href="http://www.minelres.lv/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.minelres.lv/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></dd>

<dd>I'd say the election results suggest that the Macedonian Slavs (as a "nationally conscious" group) are much more numerous than 10,000. As evidence from other European countries shows, the biggest part of a minority group usually do not vote for their minority parties, due to using non-national criteria of selection, due to strategic voting, etc. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 08:59, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But you claim that 0.09% are those Macedonian Slavs who have a non-Greek national identity. Can not a Muslim consider himself a Greek? If he can, than all Muslims do not constitute a separate national group. You can either compare the number of people who have a Macedonian (Slav) national identity with the number of people who have a Muslim national identity, or the number of Slavs as members of a minority linguistic group with the number of Muslims as members of a minority religious group. It does not make too much sense to compare Macedonian Slavs with a non-Greek national identity only with all Muslims with different (or simply Greek) national identities. To make a logically valid comparison, you need to specify the level of comparison - either you compare national groups (people who have a national identity) or you compare ethnic groups (people who are connected by common language, religion, etc.) <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 09:27, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Further more, why do you refer to them as 'Macedonians' since you know the important differences between those terms, the ambiguity and controversy created by applying the term 'Macedonian' only to the 'Slavic speakers' of Macedonia (region)?</dd>
<dd>If you and your sources distinguish them as a linguistic group, why do you not clearly state that?</dd>
<dd>What exactly those claimed sources are saying? -- <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinio_7792.html" title="User:Ninio">Ninio</a> 22:01, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>By <b>Macedonians</b> I mean a Slavic nation which now has its own state governed from Skopje. Whether the Greek government likes it or not, the term "Macedonians" is already used in this sense.</dd>
<dd><b>Slavic speakers</b> are people who speak Slavic as their native language.</dd>
<dd><b>Macedonian Slavs</b> is a very confusing and ambiguous term. It seems to mean "Slavs from Macedonia". But you seem to use this term to denote people who have a Macedonian (Slav) identity.</dd>
<dd>'<i>Slavs</i> are not a nation, and they are hardly an ethnic group. They are rather a conglomerate of ethnic groups which have one thing in common: they speak Slavic languages. Since the criterion of distinguishing Slavs is linguistic, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavs.html" title="Slavs">Slavs</a> can be identified with Slavic speakers and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_peoples.html" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a>. Given this, the same individual can be a Slav and a Greek at the same time and be classified as a "Slavophone Greek". <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 09:47, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1) Why did you referred to the (ambiguous at best) “estimates” of Eurominority group as “estimates” from INTEREG?</dd>

<dd>First, thank you for refraing from editing the article before discussing it. Second, I'd like to say that I really appreciate your detailed research on the subject.</dd>
<dd>Now, to the questions.</dd>
<dd>1) Eurominority mentions INTEREG as the source of the esitmates. So according to the Eurominority site the estimates come from INTEREG rather than from Eurominority. Warning: this is INTE<b>R</b>EG and not INTE<b>RR</b>EG. You can see their website here: <a href="http://www.intereg.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.intereg.org" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. I feel kind of discomfort when citing second-hand data like this, but I couldn't find any better solution at the moment.
<dl>
<dd>Even though I had indeed noticed that 'misspelling', the question still remains.</dd>
<dd><b>How these groups (Intereg and Eurominority) derived those ambiguous 'estimates'?</b></dd>
<dd>The site you are citing does not provide -again- any references what-so-ever about the methodology, the collection of data, the analysis, even the numbers claimed by Intereg group itself. -- <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinio_7792.html" title="User:Ninio">Ninio</a> 01:13, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2) Just because other data from Eurominority were not present in the version of the article from 6 Feb. Generally, I didn't add new data (except for Serbs in Croatia and Macedonians in Bulgaria), I just restored data from an older version. I don't object adding data from Eurominority for other countries at all.
<dl>
<dd>I do. They are providing very ambiguous, uninformative data with no analysis, no references and a highly degree of bias. For example, it seems that the 'Macedonian Slav' data (in *every state* of the region, not only Greece) are compiled by a Macedonian Slav himself; "<i>Mr. Darko GAVROVSKI (Secretary of the group) International law graduate at the University in Skopje)</i>".But for being there I presume it is endorsed by the group itself. -- <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinio_7792.html" title="User:Ninio">Ninio</a> 01:13, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3) Just because they were not present in the version from 6 Feb. The report from GHM is more than valuable. It seems to be very reliable. Thanks for bringing it here.
<dl>
<dd>That report was analysed in the very first post (of the thread, I’ve created here). It seems that you did not even read my analysis in the first place but still you were quick to object to it. I am sorry, but I do not appreciate this behaviour.</dd>

If you want to criticize the data or omission of some data in the article, you have the same reason to criticize yourself as to criticize me, as they are data from your own version. Your activity would me more productive if you add data in the article instead of adding them on the talk page and then criticizing others for not including them in the article.

<dd>GHM and MGR-G can be considered as the biggest critics of ALL 'Balkan' countries for minority matters, including Greece. But even those highly critical organisations (<a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr" class="external free" title="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekhelsinki.gr</a>) are concluding:<i>"the combined figures for those with a non-Greek national identity indicate that they do not exceed 1% of the 11 million population. Besides the numerous groups of Roma, Arvanites/Arberor, Vlachs/Aromanians, a few Meglenopromanians, and a small number of Jews, no one among them proclaims nowadays a non-Greek national identity: whereas a few among them have what can be described as a corresponding ethnic identity, along the national one..."</i> <a href="http://www.minelres.lv/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.minelres.lv/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.

<dd>Even IF, their conclusions are underestimating some figures, fact remains, that Greece is considered as the most homogeneous country in the region. On the other hand, that does not mean that ethnic/linguistic/religious groups do not exist; but your edits simply 'draw' a highly misleading picture about the ethnic/linguistic/religious composition of the country in question. -- <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinio_7792.html" title="User:Ninio">Ninio</a> 01:13, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a page called <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Bulgaria_d036.html" title="Demographics of Bulgaria">Demographics of Bulgaria</a> where full information about the ethnic composition of Bulgaria is contained. As for the rest of the claptrap - according to Bulgarian sources there are 1.5 mln Bulgarians in FYROM, 300,000 in Greece, 300,000 in Serbia and around 200,000 in Romania. So, if we are gonna include what Macedonian sources say, then we are include what Bulgarian sources say, as well.</p>
<p>And something more, there is an official Bulgarian census, if you don't like the results of it, either point out your reasons or refrain from commenting. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 21:28, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)~</p>

<dd>Censuses always underestimate the numbers of members of small minorities. I think this should be clear to anybody who studied the problems of ethnic minorities in Europe and I do not need to explain the reasons here. The underestimation is the reason why it is important to treat censuses as but one (valuable) source to draw conclusions on the size of a minority and to take other sources into consideration to counterbalance a possible distortion. All the more so if the minority is subject to pressure, as it is in the case of Bulgaria.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Human rights organization estimates tend to be inflated and minority estimates usually border on science fiction. A census, as long as it is free and non-discriminatory, is the only way to distinguish between groundless and substantiated claims and census results tend to be the only results included in official publications. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirkemaal_238e.html" title="User:Birkemaal">Birkemaal</a></dd>

<dd>I am sorry, but I cannot agree with your last statement. In fact, some official documents (even those prepared by government offices) include a wide range of data, not restricted to census data or data provided by GOs. I can provide some examples, if you want me to. Some encyclopaedias and scholar works include estimates by NGOs and minority organizations too. Generally, to treat census results as the ultimate and unquestionable source of information is a serious methodological error. The same error would be, of course, to treat estimates of organizations of minorities as such a source, for the reason you correctly stated. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 21:30, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another thing we deal with here is the controversy about the purported Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. Macedonian sources and, as you surely know if you really examined the subject, many Western sources consider many inhabitants of the Bulgarian part of Macedonia Macedonians. Bulgarian sources consider them Bulgarians. According to <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, our task is to present the conflicting views without asserting them. So the description should take the form: "Macedonians say A, Bulgarians say B, the census indicates X, etc.". It is up to the reader to decide which source is more reliable. Personally, I believe the census results are closer to the truth than the Macedonian claims, but this is my personal opinion I would not like to be reflected in the article.</dd>

<dd>You are interpreting the NPOV rules of Wikipedia rather frivolously.

Wikipedia, however, does not and will never require that all claims, irrespective whether substantiated or not, be included in the articles, especially in ones with "hard" data like this one. If users start to apply your principles, articles will be clattered up with conflicting claims and in more sensitive areas like the Balkans, there will be incessant edit wars. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirkemaal_238e.html" title="User:Birkemaal">Birkemaal</a></dd>

When you start applying your principles on all minorities in all countries (starting with your own), then I can believe that you are doing it for the sake of the principle and not for the sake of revenge. I checked a number of demographics pages of a number of Balkan and East-European countries today, you have tempered only with the Bulgarian and Greek pages (what a surprise). I can't see either the inclusion of any of the Bulgarian claims - which is a direct infringement of the NPOV standards of Wikipedia - such as you understand them, not such as they are. And there are quite many researchers who think that the Macedonian Slavs are ethnic Bulgarians. As for the rest of the harangue directed against me - trying to hide a personal POV opinion behind the standards of Wikipedia is a disgrace. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 20:44, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)~</dd>

<dd>You know what, Boraczek, instead of me and Ninio trying to explain why this page should not contain estimates from unofficial organizations, minority groups and nationalist circles in neighbouring countries, why don't <b>you</b>, explain to me why you haven't applied the numbers given by these organizations, groups and circles to your country first? Since you are so passionate about it? But don't worry, I have fixed that for you. Eurominority, for example, gives some 5.0 mln Ukrainians, 1.5 mln Germans and 1.5 mln Kashubians for Poland, and I have taken a good care to include that fact in the article <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Poland_9e37.html" title="Demographics of Poland">Demographics of Poland</a>.</dd>

<dd>Something else - since you consider that the claim of "certain sources" is sufficient to counteract the results of an official census, then my next intension is to search on the net what German, Czech, Slovakian, Silesian, Kashubian, Ukrainian, Belarussian, Russian, Lithuanian, Tatar and African sources think about the number of Germans, Czechs, Slovaks, Silesians, Kashubians, Ukrainians, Belarussians, Russians, Lithuanians, Tatars and Africans in Poland. I don't even slightly doubt that, you, a staunch advocate of minority rights, will nót only support me in that noble endeavour but will also help me with the search. But so much about it now, I don't have more time today but you can send me your gratitude for my contribution either here, or on the talk page of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Poland_9e37.html" title="Demographics of Poland">Demographics of Poland</a> which I have added to my watchlist as from today.

<dd>The edit is clearly a revenge action and as such is of questionable integrity... However, your motives are far from impeccable, either, Boraczek. The Balkans are seeming with minority claims but you have paid attention only to Macedonian claims, which raises the question of use of double standards. The question of Albanian claims to the number of the Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia is much more pertinent and much better substantiated than the one of Macedonian ones in Bulgaria and even, to some extent, in Greece, as a great number of publications have adressed the assertion that Albanians in Macedonia represent 40% of the overall population and clearly some part of the Albanian population there does not have any identity papers and has not been counted in last two censuses. Unlike what you say, no Western sources have mentioned the numbers of Macedonians you are quoting in recent years and human rights organization, when talking about human rights violations in Bulgaria, have mentioned 1,000-2,000 Macedonians in Pirin Macedonia. You are clearly defending Slav Macedonian positions, there is nothing bad about that, but it doesn't have anything to do with the neutrality of Wikipedia, either. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirkemaal_238e.html" title="User:Birkemaal">Birkemaal</a></dd>

<dd>It is true that I only added data related to Greece and Bulgaria (but not only to Macedonian claims) and in this sense my edits were partial. But expecting me to add all relevant data about all European minorities at once is a bit too much, I think. All the more so when much of my time was consumed by the discussion with VMORO and Ninio about their repetitious deletions. I maintain that many Western sources consider many inhabitants of Pirin Macedonia Macedonians (but this is not relevant to the article anymore). You seem to think that I am in favor of the Macedonian claims, which, paradoxically, makes me think that I was able to transcend my POV, because my personal opinion on the number of Macedonians in Bulgaria and Greece is unfavorable for rhe Macedonian claims. Cocluding, I cannot agree with most of your critical comments. Nonetheless, I really appreciate them.

<p>No, Western sources clearly consider the majority of the population of Pirin Macedonia Bulgarian, this is valid both for encyclopedias where it is unconditional, for documents by state institutions, as well as for recent research - by for example, Roudometof and Poulton, who have clearly presented the most impressive Western research on the Macedonian question in the 1990s. The reaction of the two may not be especially "gracious" but they are likely to have considered your edits inflammatory. A Macedonian editor will react in the same way if you place the Bulgarian claim that the Macedonians are ethnic Bulgarians on the Macedonian page although this is at least partially true in a historical perspective... May be you should consider moving your edit to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a> or "Macedonians" as VMORO has suggested in order to prevent further escalation of the conflict, as you two are progressively losing your heads.

<dd>The Bulgarian claims are also worth mentioning and in fact they ARE mentioned in the article about <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a>. I can understand that mentioning Macedonian claims may enrage a Bulgarian editor and mentioning Bulgarian claims may enrage a Macedonian editor, but I think our task is not to please biased Macedonian and Bulgarian editors (and it is impossible to please them both), but to report on the controversy preserving acuraccy and neutrality. I wonder why you think that I am "losing my head". On the contrary, I am rather calm, as I am not emotionally engaged in the disputted matter (unlike VMORO, who seems to be driven by strong nationalist emotions).

<dd>Address that comment to yourself, may be it is gonna help. No demographics pages here (as well as in all other major online Encyclopaedias such as Britannica and Encarta) make use of Intereg or unofficial reports, to say nothing of what a country claims that its minority in another country is. (And that is not even the official position of FYROM as the Macedonian government has accepted the results of the Bulgarian census, it is Macedonian nationalist circles that make such claims)</dd>

<dd>There is no reason to exclude INTEREG data, or at least you did not show there was such a reason. I moved information which was previously only included in the article about the Balkans to the corresponding articles about particular countries, so as not to loose information (the reason why I only edited articles about Bulgaria and Greece is that only in these articles the data were not included, all other articles had more detailed information on ethnic minorities). Calling it <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a> is in my opinion an obvious abuse of the term and a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_attack_9aed.html" title="Wikipedia:Personal attack">personal attack</a>. I am offended by this term and I think that you should apologize for using it. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoraczek_910d.html" title="User:Boraczek">Boraczek</a> 21:30, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, and I am offended by your inflammatory, offensive and POV edits which are not only made in conflict with the NPOV policy of Wikipedia but are disguised as a defence exactly of that policy. The only reason you launched your personal attack against Greece and Bulgaria was because <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinio_7792.html" title="User:Ninio">Ninio</a> and I did not accept your argumentation about the existence of a minority of 200,000-300,000 Macedonian Slavs in Greece, which is something you yourself admitted was wrong eventually and agreed to a number of 10,000-30,000.</p>
<p>Now let's get down to business, i.e. why I removed and I'll keep removing your POV edit in <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>:</p>
<p>Your edit is POV as it regards only one part of a dispute which has been going on for about 60 years and in which Bulgaria says that <b>all Slavs in Macedonia are Bulgarians</b>, and Macedonia says that <b>all Slavs in Macedonia are Macedonians</b>. If you reiterate that in any of the articles here and afterwards you give the census results for Bulgaria and Macedonia, then you can say that you are treating the matter in an NPOV spirit.</p>
<p>However, you are reviewing the claim only from the Macedonian side which is essentially a partiality and a POV treatment. Particularly offensive for me as a Macedonian Bulgarian is the statement that "the matter is the subject of heat contension". All major sources in recent years have quoted only the results of the Bulgarian census and it is only human rights organizations which have questioned it and have made <b>estimates</b> of 10,000-25,000 Macedonian Slavs in Bulgaria (as Birkemaal points out - an inflated estimate), admittig simultaneously that the vast majority of the population of Pirin Macedonia is Bulgarian. The "heat contension" (do you want to say a "heated contension" or what???) exists only in your head.</p>
<p>Third of all - the inclusion of this questionable edit in the article <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Bulgaria_d036.html" title="Demographics of Bulgaria">Demographics of Bulgaria</a>. There are so many minority claims in Europe and especially in the Balkans but none of the demographics pages or the head pages of any country reviews them. You have the questionable pre-eminance of being the first editor who engages in speculations of this sort. Until there is a general understanding that the pages I mentioned will include POV information of the sort you want to include in our page (i.e. the page Demographics of FYROM will, for example, include information on the Albanian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Turkish claims, the page of Serbia will include information on the Albanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, etc. claims, the page of Bulgaria will include information on Macedonian, Turkish and Romanian ´claims, etc.), I have the full right to view your edits as POV and as a personal attack against me as an editor and against my country. Your POV edit has no place on the page <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, it may be placed on the page <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> (but only accompanied by the Bulgarian POV claim), or on the page <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a> along with the Macedonian POV claims against Greece and Albania and only followed by the official data of the Macedonian population in the three mentioned countries. <a href="../../../v/m/o/User%7EVMORO_6430.html" title="User:VMORO">VMORO</a> 14:03, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)~</p>

<dd>I am restoring information which is necessary and useful and has been wrongly erased by Boraczek. At least in my opinion there should be an overview over larger, esp. territorial minorities, which are PROVED to exist, not which is speculated about. I tried to read through the argument above and I find some things which are disturbing, if not bizarre. What was that claim that a newspaper is as important a source of information as a census? If the Sun comes out with a headline that "Prince William is a pansy and likes to take it up.....", I would believe that we all have to rush to write half a page about that, right? Sure, both a newspaper and a census are a source of evidence, but on the scale of 1 to 10, the importance of a census is 10 and the importance of a newspaper is -5. JayO 10:55, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are quite right about the newspaper, but I think this does not need to be discussed at the moment, so I drop the topic. In my opinion ethnic compositions for particular countries should be placed in articles about particular countries. This article concerns the Balkans as a whole and ethnic composition should be described with regard to the Balkans as a whole. If we follow the country by country method, the information will be uselessly doubled and an edit war in this article will probably go on, as we did not agreed on any version yet. If you want to include that part in the article, we need to reach a consensus on that part first. I am putting that part below in case such an attempt is made.</p>
<p>If some more detailed information is to be put, then in my opinion we should determine two things:</p>
<p>1. What is that information for?</p>
<p>Is this to present all Balkan countries one by one in the ethnic aspect? Personally, I think it merely doubles the ethnic part of "Demographics of" articles and as such is superfluous.</p>
<p>Is this to show how ethnically differentiated the Balkans are? If so, we should even mention small minorities.</p>
<p>Is this to give more detailed information about the ethnic groups and minorities in the Balkans. If so, then I think a better layout would be to present ethnic group by ethnic group (including the places they live in), rather than country by country. This seems to be more closely related to the subject of the article and has the additional virtue of not repeating information from the "Demographics of" articles. There is only some risk that we will repeat information from articles about ethnic groups, but as ethnic groups are usually not restricted to the Balkans (emigration, etc.), this would not be exactly the same information.</p>
<p>2. What is the size of minority which makes the minority worth mentioning in the article? What is the threshold? 1% of the total population? 0.5%? 0.1%? 500,000? 100,000? 50,000?</p>

<p>Why is romania in pale green? As far as I know Romania is part of the Balkans; even though Transilvania is in central europe, the other two Romanian regions of Moldova and Vallachia are and have always been in the Blakans. On top of that many would argue that becuse of its proximity, even Hungary is sometimes considered to be part of the Balkans (as a consequence clearly making Transilvania a balkan region as well)</p>
<p>Moreover guys, I think we should distinguish between South-Eastern Europe and Balkans because I think they mean 2 very similar yet still different things. Usually Turkey and Greece are always considered in the Balkans, however when people say South-East Europe they only mean Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro, FYROM(acedonia)m Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova. Greece and Turkey are rather omitted here.</p>
<p>Anyways these are minor additions but I think they deserve some thought.</p>

<p>It is incorrect to say that Greece is omitted in the definition of South East Europe. I am look at a dozen various think tanks, several with the name South East Europe, eg the South East Eurpoe project of the Wilson Center, and they include Greece quite specifically.

<p>The issue of minorities in the Balkan or S.E.European region [which Greece considers to be synonymous] is absolutely caught up with political construction. This is basically because of the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, which de-emphasised ethnicity and created complex multiple identities, followed by a 19th-early 20th Century obsession with creating nation-states [see Mazower (2001), <b>The Balkans</b>, Phoenix Press, for an easy introduction to this history].</p>
<p>Thus, different ways of defining ethnicity, even using censuses or official counts, led [and still lead] to very different results. A theoretical analysis of this as a global phenomenon is given in <b>Census and Identity: The Politics of Race, Ethnicity and Language in National Censuses</b>, Kertzer &amp; Arel (eds), 2001, Cambridge UP. IN the Balkan region there is a lot of literature on this, but 2 examples available on the net concern the area known as Macedonia. One paper, by a Greek, shows different results from Greeks and Bulgarians using the same historical dataset <a href="http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/downloads/library/Michailidis98.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/downloads/library/Michailidis98.pdf" rel="nofollow"><b>The War of Statistics</b></a></p>
<p>Another, concerns the latest Macedonian [fyRoM,if you are Greek] Census results, and the massive controversy over how many Albanians were and should have been recorded <a href="http://www.boeckler.de/pdf/South_East_Europe_Review_2004_01_gaber2.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.boeckler.de/pdf/South_East_Europe_Review_2004_01_gaber2.pdf" rel="nofollow">Macedonian Census results - controversy or reality?</a></p>
<p>Basically, there are no certainties about ethnic identity in the Balkans. It is interesting to note, as well, that the only EU Balkan country -- Greece -- is also the only EU or Balkan country which since 1951 has failed to ask Census question concerning self-identified ethnicity, religion, native languages spoken or country of birth. This is because Greece does not accept any concept of minority status other than Muslims in Thraki, as laid down by the Treaty of Lausanne. There are even no proper data on the number of Greek Muslims in Thraki, despite three different minorities being classed as one official Minority. The clear result is that nobody knows anything for sure, and Greece can claim almost complete ethnic homogeneity: the history of the 20th century suggests a very different picture, however. --87.202.20.208 04:31, 26 October 2005 (UTC) Martin Baldwin-Edwards, <a href="http://www.mmo.gr" class="external text" title="http://www.mmo.gr" rel="nofollow">Mediterranean Migration Observatory, Athens</a></p>
<p>I agree with a some of your statements, but I think that the claim that Greece is the only country not to conduct a census since 1951 is misleading. You are comparing states that for fifty years had some of the most repressive Stalinist regimes to a state that had problems but the full influence and particpation of the west, and forgive te term free world. How many French or British journalists were in Albania until a dozen years ago? What was the expectation of privacy, reprisal etc of persons reporting identity in Bulgaria at that time? We do know there was pervasive official persecution of the Turkish minority by Sofia.</p>
<p>What do you think it was like for persons considering declaring declaring a Turkish or Greeke identity in Bulgaria in 1977? A Greek identity in Albania? Please do so research on the Roma census data from the censuses in the South East European coutnries in the 50's, 60s, 70s, 80s etc. See a problem?</p>
<p>Your tag line, <i>the history of the 20th century suggests a very different picture, however.</i> is to say the least, profoundly misleading. The nation state of Greece, as we know it today, is a entirely a 20th century creation, and most ironicaly considering your assertion, is in fact one created by the prevailing European and American views of ethnicity.</p>
<p>Moreover, the self same current standards of minority and ethnicty being discussed by some mean that the United States is 99% minorities...almost all of which are "prevented" from having "official recognition."<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveHM_92a9.html" title="User:DaveHM">DaveHM</a> 12:42, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>A response:</b> I am astonished that you find a detached, factual and independent view to be "misleading" on two counts: presumably you have a particular agenda to fulfil. To answwer your specific points: (1) The Balkan states were not Stalinist, in particular Yugoslavia was completely different. (2) Albania was unique, and completely closed to the outside world, It had also severed relations with the USSR and Yugoslavia. (3) As far as I am aware [and I will check with Bulgarian colleagues] the problems with the Turkish minority in Bulgaria occurred only AFTER the collapse of the communist regime, in 1989. HOwever, I will concede one point: recently, Bulgaria has decided [like Greece] to exclude minority identification in future censuses. (4) Greek identities in Albania were asserted, recorded in censuses and permitted throughout the communist period. Check the facts. (5) Roma have been the victims of massive discrimination in every Balkan country, and denied even an existence: Greece is no exception to that. So, what is your point? (6) The nation state of Greece is a 19th century creation, with the northern part of the territory achieved through the Balkan Wars and non-Greeks there either removed or forcibly assimilated. I cannot accept that Greek identity is shaped by European or American standards: it is premised on lineage, a supposed continuity with Ancient Greece, and there is no acceptance of new members to the society. In other words, it is the opposite of the American idea and has more in common with the German Volk. (7) In reality, it is your comments which are profoundly misleading. By introducing complexities which are not very pertinent, sowing seeds of doubt about broad statements [everything can have small detailed exceptions] you try to pretend that Greece is a typical European country, similar also to the USA. I have never heard anything so laughable! Martin Baldwin-Edwards--87.202.20.120 04:18, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>User Smolenski has deleted my edits and outside references to the 2001 Census and my own official report to the Greek state.

<p>This article is utter non-sense. Would somebody care to explain why Romania which was part of the Ottoman Empire for centuries is not considered to be Balkan, although Croatia is. Please, spare me the explanation that parts of Croatia were too, since the whole of Hungary, and parts of eastern Austria were too. Compared with Romania what on earth makes Croatia more Balkan or less Central-European?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>EXPLANATION TO YOU:</dd>
<dd>It is clear from the map that Croatia is on the Balkans and Romania is sometimes considered as a balkan state, and sometimes not. As far as Croatia is concernd, it's a typical balkan state (except for a small region north of Zagreb, which is more civilized ), and there's no big difference between Dalmatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Slavonia, Bosnia, etc..It's mentality, people, language..etc.=it's all the same=all BALKAN! That's the truth! It hurts you and those who think like you, but all offences will be returned to the offenders!</dd>

<dd>Well, only a small chunk of Romania lies to the south of the Kupa-Sava-Danube line and therefore geographically in the Balkans. A significantly bigger portion of Croatia is in the Balkans. Plus, in a geopolitical sense Croatia is generally considered to be part of the Balkans, while Romania isn't included in this as much. But this is all explained in the article, you only have to read. <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdolen1_2131.html" title="User:Edolen1">edolen1</a> 19:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your kind words Edolen1. Mind you I have read the article and couldn't help noticing that roughly 75 per cent of it deals with historical, cultural, political and other "non-geographical" aspects of what it "takes to belong to the region". Britannica clearly states that Romania (and, for that matter Moldova too) is in the Balkans. Apparently that would contradict your statement regarding the "Kupa-Sava-Danube line" as the northern border of the region. Furthermore, if we take into account non-geographical aspects of the issue, Romania is hardly more central-european or less Balkan than Croatia. That, I am sure you'll agree, applies to Slovenia too.</dd>

<p>The term Balkan began as the appelation of a mountain range in Bulgaria, that is its only geographical reference. They are still called that. In the late 19 century, the term began encompassing the regions in southeast Europe breaking away from the Ottoman empire. It became associated with the countries that emerged from what was 'Turkey in Europe' in the later half of the 19 century. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 18:07, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Aldux:</p>
<p>Invoking historical atlantes as source of historical knowledge is probably usual and somehow legitimate at a high-school or college level, but by no means on the level of higher education, which is supposed to be that of wikipedia.</p>
<p>There are lots of bad books. Not every printed material may be a source for wikipedia. With a few notable exceptions, historical atlantes are synthesis works aimed at transmitting basics of geo-politics to a large audience.</p>
<p>As for the topic itself, please keep in mind that no Romanian State did ever <b>belong</b> to the Ottoman Empire. Romanian principalities were vassal tributary states, but never were they Ottoman territory, like the territories southern Danube.</p>
<p>From every conceivable angle of view (international law, social, political, economical, cultural, religious, etc) there is a huge difference between a territory being an integral part of a state and a territory being vassal/tributary to that state.</p>
<p>Besides: bullheaded persistance is somehow typical for ignorants and stupids.</p>

<p>Don't you think this would be a good idea, it seems like most of the people are hanged up on the pejorative meaning of "Balkans" or "Balkanic". As for "Balkans" we can present the etymology of the word and have a short explanation that it refers to countries in Southeastern Europe but it is sometimes considered pejorative by some people. I think it's against Wikipedia's policy to have pejorative terms as a main page when there is a perfect term that's not considered offensive by anybody (as far as I know). -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 03:11, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the article it is stated that only the European part of Turkey (called Thrace) belongs to the Balkans. I'm a fraid that we have to edit it a bit cause Thrace was a province now split in Northern Thrace (which now belongs to Bulgaria), Western Thrace (which belongs to Greece) and Eastern Thrace (which belongs to Turkey). I checked "Thrace" on wiki and it mentions the same. So i'm gonna edit text here to match the things mentioned in "Thrace: <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sairin Lote (<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESairin_Lote_458b.html" title="User talk:Sairin Lote">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sairin_Lote_bf32.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sairin Lote">contribs</a>) 22:13, 13 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>To Ivan!!!</p>
<p>In Republika Srpska according to government information it lives around 1,4 millions. Of them around 89 % is serbs and that is documented. This means that there are around 1,3 million serbs in Bosnia. And in the federation it lives 2 350 000 and of them 17 % is croats. In RS 1 % of the population is croats which clearly shows that it lives around 400 000 croats in Bosnia.</p>
<p>As for bosniaks, since it lives 80 % in the Federation, this mean that only in the Federation it lives 1 880 000 bosniaks and add 150 000 bosniaks in Republika Srpska, you will get around 2 million bosniaks in Bosnia.</p>
<p>And what is 2 million divided with 3820 000 which is the current population of Bosnia? That is 52 % which makes Islam the principal religion in Bosnia. You WILL say this is only speculation and this isnt official but please, Ivan, tell me:</p>
<p>Is your estimates official? No, they arent! And since we already know the current population of RS (1 479 000) and FBIH (2,350 000) then we also can assume which people are in majority in Bosnia since bosniaks make up 80 % of the FBIH and arond 10 % of RS.</p>
<p>I hope you give me a good answer because if you revert again without refering to sources or give me a fully explanation without only writing "that is only speculations" since your estimates is as much speculations as my is, then I am going to see this as clearly vandalism.</p>
