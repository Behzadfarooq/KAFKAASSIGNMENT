<p>The lands of Balgonie were held by the Sibbalds from at least 1246. Probably in the 1360s, the Sibbalds built a barmkin, or fortified courtyard, with a <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_house.html" title="Tower house">tower house</a> at the north-west corner. The lands and the castle were left to a daughter, who married Sir Robert Lundie, who extended the castle in 1496, following his appointment as <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_High_Treasurer_2095.html" title="Lord High Treasurer">Lord High Treasurer</a> of Scotland. Sir Robert built a two-storey range of buildings to the east of the keep, enlarging the accommodation with a long hall and a <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar.html" title="Solar">solar</a>. This range incorporated an earlier corner tower and the 14th century chapel.<a href="../../../j/a/m/James_IV_of_Scotland_5dae.html" title="James IV of Scotland">James IV</a> visited Balgonie during the works, and ordered 20 shillings to be given to the masons.</p>

<p>In 1627 the castle was sold to the Boswells, who sold it on in 1635 to Sir <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Leslie%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leven_996e.html" title="Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven">Alexander Leslie</a>, a Scottish soldier who had fought for the Swedish army during the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Years%27_War_f03e.html" title="Thirty Years' War">Thirty Years' War</a> (1618-1648), rising to the rank of <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_Marshal_bdd7.html" title="Field Marshal">Field Marshal</a>, and who led the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanter.html" title="Covenanter">Covenanters</a> during the Scottish <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishops_Wars_ba8e.html" title="Bishops Wars">Bishops Wars</a>. Leslie was created <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Balgonie_a14b.html" title="Lord Balgonie">Lord Balgonie</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Leven_ed9d.html" title="Earl of Leven">Earl of Leven</a> in 1641, and finally retired in 1654. He carried out further improvement of his home, adding a two-storey building at the south-east corner of the courtyard. The initials FSAL and DAR, for Field Marshal Sir Alexander Leslie, and his wife Dame Agnes Renton, were found inscribed within the south-east block, suggesting that this was built prior to Leslie's elevation to the peerage. He also rebuilt the late 15th century north range with an extra storey, and laid out a park around the castle, remnants of which remain.</p>
<p>The next additions were carried out by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Leslie%2C_1st_Duke_of_Rothes_17d2.html" title="John Leslie, 1st Duke of Rothes">John Leslie, 7th Earl of Rothes</a>, who disputed the earldom of Leven with <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Melville%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Leven_0f6c.html" title="David Melville, 3rd Earl of Leven">David Melville</a> following the death of the second earl in 1664. Lord Rothes, with the aid of John Mylne Junior, the king's master mason, built a grand stair linking the keep and north range, where previously a wooden bridge stood. On his death in 1681 David Melville inherited Balgonie, along with the earldom of Leven. He too added a range of buildings in 1706, this time a three-storey section linking the north range with the south-east block. The work was completed by master mason Gilbert Smith.</p>

<p>In 1824 the castle was sold to James Balfour of <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whittingehame.html" title="Whittingehame">Whittingehame</a>, father of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Maitland_Balfour_8dce.html" title="James Maitland Balfour">James Maitland Balfour</a>, and grandfather of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Balfour_ff11.html" title="Arthur Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a>, who served as British Prime Minister from 1902-1905. He was unable to arrest the decay which was advancing, and in the mid nineteenth century the roofs were removed to avoid paying tax on the property. Much vandalism occurred in the 1960s, and it was not until 1971 that restoration of the castle, now owned by David Maxwell, began. Work continued through the 1970s and 1980s, aided by European funding, as part of European Architectural Heritage Year, in 1975. The keep and chapel have now been fully restored, and the castle is once again lived in by its current owner, Raymond Morris, self-styled Laird of Balgonie, and his family. The castle is open to the public, and the restored chapel and great hall can be hired for events such as weddings. The current owners have expressed their intent to continue the restoration of the entire building.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Plan of Balgonie Castle with approximate dates of construction.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The castle is still entered via the 15th century gatehouse. This is semi-ruinous above ground level, but a guardroom and prison can be seen within. The gate opens onto a courtyard, containing a well, around which the buildings are arranged.</p>
<p>The ground and first floors of the keep are vaulted, the first floor containing the hall, which unusually had no great fireplace. This would originally have been entered via a moveable timber stair, prior to the construction of the present stone stair. Above the hall are two further floors, each with a fireplace and connected by a turnpike stair. The keep is topped by a pitched roof with crow stepped gables. Outside, the parapet walk and cannon spouts are of 17th century origin, and contemporary with the enlarged windows. Some of the smaller trefoil-headed original windows survive.</p>
<p>In the basement of the north range is the vaulted chapel, although the remainder of the range, and the east buildings, are roofless. Walls and chimney stacks remain. The remains of earlier buildings within the courtyard were uncovered during excavations in 1978. It appears that these were demolished in the early 17th century to allow rebuilding.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond the castle walls, the extensive boundary walls of the deer park survive, although damaged in parts. Large mature trees remain from the 17th century landscaping.</p>

<p>Several hauntings have been reported within the castle. One spectre, nicknamed 'Green Jeanie', is said to be the ghost of one of the Lundie occupants. A 17th century soldier, a dog, and a hooded man have also been seen. A skeleton was found in the floor of the great hall, during works in 1912.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
