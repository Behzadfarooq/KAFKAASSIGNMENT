<p>was born at <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gran%C3%A1tula_de_Calatrava_e31f.html" title="Granátula de Calatrava">Granátula de Calatrava</a>, a village of the province of <a href="../../../c/i/u/Ciudad_Real_4415.html" title="Ciudad Real">Ciudad Real</a>. He was the ninth child of a carter, who wanted to make him a priest, but the lad at fifteen enlisted in a battalion of students to fight against the armies of <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>. In 1811 Espartero was appointed a lieutenant of engineers in <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadiz.html" title="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>, but having failed to pass his examination he entered a line regiment. In 1815 he went to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> as a captain under General <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morillo.html" title="Morillo">Morillo</a>, who had been made commander-in-chief to quell the risings of the colonies on the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Main_9a66.html" title="Spanish Main">Spanish Main</a>. For eight years Espartero distinguished himself in the struggle against the colonists. He was several times wounded, and was made major and colonel on the battlefields of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochabamba.html" title="Cochabamba">Cochabamba</a> and Sapachni. He had to surrender to <a href="../../../s/u/c/Sucre.html" title="Sucre">Sucre</a> at the final battle of Ayacucho, which put an end to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> rule. He returned to Spain, and, like most of his companions in arms, remained under a cloud for some time. He was sent to the garrison town of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logro%C3%B1o.html" title="Logroño">Logroño</a>, where he married the daughter of a rich landowner, Doña Jacinta Santa Cruz, who eventually survived him. Henceforth Logroño became the home of the most prominent of the Spanish political generals of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>.</p>

<p>Espartero became, in 1832, on the death of King <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_VII_7d68.html" title="Ferdinand VII">Ferdinand VII</a>, one of the most ardent defenders of the rights of his daughter, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabella_II_a39d.html" title="Isabella II">Isabella II</a>. On the outbreak of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlist_War_e2c3.html" title="Carlist War">Carlist War</a>, the government sent him to the front as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commandant.html" title="Commandant">commandant</a> of the province of <a href="../../../b/i/s/Biscay.html" title="Biscay">Biscay</a>, where he severely defeated the Carlists in many encounters. He was quickly promoted to a divisional command, and then made a lieutenant-general. At times he showed qualities as a <i>guerillero</i> quite equal to those of the Carlists, like <a href="../../../z/u/m/Zumalacarregui.html" title="Zumalacarregui">Zumalacarregui</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram%C3%B3n_Cabrera_3783.html" title="Ramón Cabrera">Ramón Cabrera</a>, by his daring marches and surprises. When he had to move large forces he was greatly superior to them as an organizer and strategist, and he never disgraced his successes by cruelty or needless severity. Twice he obliged the Carlists to raise the siege of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilbao.html" title="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> before he was appointed commander-in-chief of the northern army on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">17 September</a> <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a>, when the tide of war seemed to be setting in favor of the pretender in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Country_%28autonomous_community%29_ebd9.html" title="Basque Country (autonomous community)">Basque provinces</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navarre.html" title="Navarre">Navarre</a>, though <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infante_Carlos_of_Spain_ead1.html" title="Infante Carlos of Spain">Don Carlos</a> had lost his ablest lieutenant, the Basque Zumalacarregui.</p>

<p>His military duties at the head of the principal national army did not prevent Espartero from showing for the first time his political ambition. He displayed such radical and reforming inclinations that he laid the foundations of his popularity among the lower and middle classes, which lasted more than a quarter of a century, during which time the Progressists, Democrats and advanced Liberals always looked to him as a leader and adviser. In November 1836 he again forced the Carlists to raise the siege of Bilbao. His troops included the British legion under Sir <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Lacy_Evans_5953.html" title="De Lacy Evans">de Lacy Evans</a>. This success turned the tide of war against Don Carlos, who vainly attempted a raid towards <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>. Espartero was soon at his heels, and obliged him to hurry northwards, after several defeats. In 1839 Espartero carefully opened up negotiations with Maroto and the principal Carlist chiefs of the Basque provinces. These ended in their accepting his terms under the famous convention of Vergara, which secured the recognition of their ranks and titles for nearly 1,000 Carlist officers. Twenty thousand Carlist volunteers laid down their arms at Vergara; only the irreconcilables led by Cabrera held out for a while in the central provinces of Spain. Espartero soon, however, in 1840, stamped out the last embers of the rising, which had lasted seven years. He was styled <i>El pacificador de España</i>, was made a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandee.html" title="Grandee">grandee</a> of the first class, and received two <a href="../../../d/u/k/Dukedom.html" title="Dukedom">dukedoms</a>.</p>

<p>It was against this backdrop that Espartero's political opponents, the moderates, mobilised support to amend the progressive Constitution of 1837. In particular, the moderates' proposal to abolish democratically-elected local councils threatened to destroy the powerbase of the progressives. This threat was checked by the radical revolution of 1840, after which the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservatives</a> were sidelined and Espartero became the master of the destiny of Spain.</p>
<p>During the last three years of the war, Espartero, who had been elected a deputy, exercised from his distant headquarters such influence over Madrid politics that he twice hastened the fall of the cabinet, and obtained office for his own friends. At the close of the war the queen regent and her ministers attempted to elbow out Espartero and his followers, but a <i>pronunciamiento</i> ensued in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> and other large towns which culminated in the marshal's accepting the post of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister.html" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a>. He soon became virtually a <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a>, as Queen Christina took offence at his popularity and resigned, leaving the kingdom very soon afterwards. Directly the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortes_Generales_ce4c.html" title="Cortes Generales">Cortes</a> met and they elected Espartero regent by 179 votes to 103 over Arguelles, who was appointed guardian of the young queen.</p>
<p>Forcing the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regent.html" title="Regent">regent</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Christina_of_Bourbon-Two_Sicilies_3d8c.html" title="Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies">Maria Cristina</a>, into exile for her conspiracy with the moderates, Espartero himself became regent with the intention of remaining so until the future Queen <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabella_II_of_Spain_1911.html" title="Isabella II of Spain">Isabella II</a> came of age. Espartero's popular support enabled him to crush moderate military uprisings across Spain in 1841. Yet his ruthless execution of dozens of the conspirators, including many popular fellow war heroes like Diego de Leon, as well as his hasty and ungrateful dissolution of the radical <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/junta" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:junta">juntas</a></i> that had crushed the risings, marked the start of the decline in support for his regency.</p>
<p><a name="Rule_of_Espartero" id="Rule_of_Espartero"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldomero_Espartero%2C_Prince_of_Vergara_171c.html" title="Edit section: Rule of Espartero">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rule of Espartero</span></h2>
<p>For two years Espartero ruled Spain in accordance with his radical and conciliatory dispositions, giving special attention to the reorganization of the administration, taxation and finances, declaring all the estates of the church, congregations and religious orders to be national property, and suppressing the <i>diezma</i>, or tenths. He suppressed the Republican risings with as much severity as he did the military <i>pronunciamientos</i> of Generals Concha and Diego de Leon. The latter was shot in Madrid. Espartero crushed with much energy a revolutionary rising in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, but on his return to Madrid was so coldly welcomed that he perceived that his prestige was on the wane. An economic slump and rumours of a free-trade deal with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> provoked a popular uprising by workers and the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourgeoisie.html" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> of Barcelona in 1842. Espartero's ruthless bombardment of the city crushed this revolutionary threat. But a second uprising in 1843, combined with moderate conspiracies and military uprisings. The rebels declared Queen Isabella of age, and, led by General <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narvaez.html" title="Narvaez">Narvaez</a>, marched upon Madrid. Espartero, deeming resistance useless, embarked at Cadiz on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_30.html" title="July 30">30 July</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1843.html" title="1843">1843</a> for England, and lived quietly apart from politics until 1848, when a royal decree restored to him all his honors and his seat in the senate. Dubbed public enemy number one by the brutal forces of reaction, headed by the moderate General <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram%C3%B3n_Mar%C3%ADa_Narv%C3%A1ez_y_Campos%2C_Duke_of_Valencia_1b1d.html" title="Ramón María Narváez y Campos, Duke of Valencia">Ramón María Narváez y Campos, Duke of Valencia</a>, Espartero was unable to return to his estates in northern Spain until an <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty.html" title="Amnesty">amnesty</a> was decreed later in the <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840s.html" title="1840s">1840s</a>.</p>
<p>Although Espartero's regime (1840-1843) in reality had done little for Spain's poor, the anti-radical reaction of the moderates made the former regent a folk-hero amongst many of the workers. Therefore, it was logical that he should become head of the short-lived "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressive Biennium</a>" of 1854-1856. But, as <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> observed, the progressive <i>caudillo</i> was a man whose time had passed. The old marshal vainly endeavoured to keep his own Progressists within bounds in the Cortes of 1854-1856, and in the great towns, but their excessive demands for reforms and liberties played into the hands of a clerical and reactionary court and of the equally retrograde governing classes. The growing ambition of General <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopoldo_O%27Donnell%2C_Duke_of_Tetuan_a77e.html" title="Leopoldo O'Donnell, Duke of Tetuan">O'Donnell</a> constantly clashed with the views of Espartero, until the latter, in sheer disgust, resigned his premiership and left for Logroño, after warning the queen that a conflict was imminent between O'Donnell and the Cortes, backed by the Progressist militia. O'Donnell's <i>pronunciamiento</i> in 1856 put an end to the Cortes, and the militia was disarmed, after a sharp struggle in the streets of the capital. When Spanish political power swung once more back towards the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Moderates.html" title="Moderates">moderates</a> in 1856.</p>

<p>After 1856 Espartero resolutely declined to identify himself with active politics, though at every stage in the onward march of Spain towards more liberal and democratic institutions he was asked to take a leading part. He refused to allow his name to be brought forward as a candidate when the Cortes of 1868, after the Revolution, sought for a ruler. Espartero, strangely enough, adopted a laconic phrase when successive governments on their advent to power invariably addressed themselves to the venerable champion of liberal ideas. To all to the Revolution of 1868, the Constituent Cortes of 1869, King <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadeo_I_of_Spain_9109.html" title="Amadeo I of Spain">Amadeus</a>, the Federal Republic of 1873, the nameless government of Marshal <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serrano.html" title="Serrano">Serrano</a> in 1874, the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Bourbon_ce6b.html" title="House of Bourbon">Bourbon</a> restoration in 1875 he simply said: <i>Cumplase la voluntad nacional</i> (Let the national will be accomplished). King Amadeus made him prince of Vergara. The Restoration raised a statue to him near the gate of the Retiro Park in Madrid. Spaniards of all shades, except Carlists and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultramontane.html" title="Ultramontane">Ultramontanes</a>, paid homage to his memory when he died at his <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Rioja_%28autonomous_community%29_0f78.html" title="La Rioja (autonomous community)">La Rioja</a> residence on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">8 January</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a>. His tastes were singularly modest, his manners rather reserved, but always kind and considerate for humble folk. He was a typical Spanish soldier-politician, though he had more of the better traits of the soldier born and bred than of the arts of the statesman. His military instincts did not always make it easy for him to accommodate himself to courtiers and professional politicians.</p>
