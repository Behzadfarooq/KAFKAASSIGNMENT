<p>The city park was made manifest starting in 1835 when the newest breed of San Diego city officials from the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_government.html" title="Mexican government">Mexican government</a> took office. One of the first things the city officials did was select a tract of land to be used for recreational purposes, making the section of land within the 47,000 acres that is now Balboa Park one of the oldest sites in the United States dedicated to public recreational usage.</p>
<p>No further activity took place until 1845, when a survey was done by Henry D. Fitch to map the 47,000 acres. The Mexican government would never get to use this land for anything due to the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican-American_War_f1a1.html" title="Mexican-American War">Mexican-American War</a>, and in 1848 the park became property of the United States of America. In 1850, it became part of California with the creation of the state.</p>
<p>On February 15, 1868, a request was put forth to the city's Board of Trustees to take two 160-acre plots of land, and create a public park. This request was made by one of the trustees, <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephraim_Morse_c737.html" title="Ephraim Morse">E. W. Morse</a>, who along with real estate developer <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alonzo_Horton_d1ca.html" title="Alonzo Horton">Alonzo Horton</a> had selected a site just northeast of the growing urban center of "New Town" (now downtown San Diego) for the nascent park's location.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a resolution to set aside 1400 acres (6 km²) for a city park was approved by the city's Board of Trustees on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>.</p>
<p>Then in 1870, a new law was passed, an "act to insure the permanency of the park reservation." The bill stated that "these lands (lots by number) are to be held in trust forever by the municipal authorities of said city for the purpose of a park" (Christman 14). It was around this time that San Diego residents were acquiring a certain fondness for the park; this is illustrated by their strong desire to keep the park intact when in 1871, there was a documented conspiracy to disassemble and "grab" the park land (Christman 15). This <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28political%29.html" title="Conspiracy (political)">conspiracy</a>, political in nature, attempted to create a bill and speed it through the state legislature before anybody could do anything to stop it. The thwarting of this attempt was due largely in part to a San Diego resident who had somehow learned of the plan then immediately informed higher powers in <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento%2C_California_50bc.html" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento</a>. The conspiracy was leaked to the press thereby exposing the city officials involved. Immediately, other San Diegan officials got together and collected signatures supporting the current existence of the park. Their plea was successful.</p>

<p>For the first few decades of its existence, "City Park" remained mostly open space. Numerous proposals, some altruistic, some profit-driven, were brought forward for the development and use of the land during this time, but no comprehensive plan for development was adopted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was some building done. This included an <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphanage.html" title="Orphanage">orphanage</a> and women's shelter (later burned down), a high school (<a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_High_School_e921.html" title="San Diego High School">San Diego High School</a>) and several gardens maintained by various private groups. One of the most celebrated of these early usages was a <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nursery_%28horticulture%29.html" title="Nursery (horticulture)">nursery</a> owned and maintained by local <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horticulture.html" title="Horticulture">horticulturist</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botany.html" title="Botany">botanist</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Sessions_7415.html" title="Kate Sessions">Kate Sessions</a>, who is often referred to as "the mother of Balboa Park." Although owned by Sessions, by agreement with the city the nursery was open to the public, and Sessions donated trees and plants to the city every year for its beautification. Sessions is responsible for bringing in many of the different varieties of exotic plants in the park. Her work was so progressive that she was in fact the first woman awarded the Meyer Medal for "foreign plant importation" given to her by the American Genetic Association.</p>
<p>Other developments from this time include two reservoirs, an animal pound and a gunpowder magazine in the area now known as Florida Canyon.</p>
<p>The earliest recreational developments in the park were in the "Golden Hill Park" area off 25th street. The National Register listed rustic stone fountain designed by architect Henry Lord Gay is the oldest surviving designed feature in the park. Other attractions in the area included a children's park (probably the first in San Diego), walking trails, and a redwood bird aviary.</p>

<p>Much of the park's look and feel today is due to the development done for the 1915 <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama-California_Exposition_%281915%29_2e52.html" title="Panama-California Exposition (1915)">Panama-California Exposition</a>. The <a href="../../../w/o/r/World%27s_Fair_9a82.html" title="World's Fair">Exposition</a> was to celebrate the completion of the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_Canal_ac67.html" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>, set to open in 1915, and to tout San Diego as the first <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> port of call for vessels traveling north after passing through the canal. Planning began in 1909 and City Park was soon selected as the exposition site. The name Balboa Park was adopted in 1910. Groundbreaking began in 1911.</p>
<p>Colonel D.C. Collier, at the time often referred to as San Diego's greatest asset, was most responsible for the exposition's success. It was he who selected both the location of the city park and its architecture. Collier was tasked with steering the exposition in the proper direction, ensuring that every decision made reflected his vision of what the exposition will accomplish. Collier once stated "The purpose of the Panama-California Exposition is to illustrate the progress and possibility of the human race, not for the exposition only, but for a permanent contribution to the world's progress" (Christman 43).</p>
<p>It was decided that the buildings were to be done in Spanish Mission and Indian Pueblo styles. This was pure romanticism, as the architecture employed at the Exposition was never common in San Diego before. New York architect <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertram_Goodhue_a6a6.html" title="Bertram Goodhue">Bertram Goodhue</a> was chosen as supervisory architect. Goodhue was fascinated by Spanish Colonial architecture, and saw the exposition as an opportunity to create a fantasy city, richly ornamented with influences from throughout Spanish history with Muslim and Persian nuances. This was in contrast to most previous expositions, which had been done in <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassical_architecture.html" title="Neoclassical architecture">Neoclassical</a> style. The site selected for the exposition was on level ground. This ensured that if the city were to make expansions, it could do so easily.</p>
<p>On December 31, 1914 The Panama-California Exposition opened. Balboa Park was crammed full of spectators. All of the guards, workers, and supervisors were dressed in Spanish and Mexican military uniforms, and the entire park was filled with different and foreign plants. Yellow and red were the themed colors of the event and they were everywhere. Over 40,000 poinsettia flowers were used, all of them in full bloom. The event seemed successful in attracting national attention. Even Pennsylvania's <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Bell_20f8.html" title="Liberty Bell">Liberty Bell</a> made a brief three-day appearance. The attempt to put San Diego on the map had worked. The event was a success: over the next two years over 3.5 million visitors would attend and witness the hard-sought magnificence that was Balboa Park.</p>
