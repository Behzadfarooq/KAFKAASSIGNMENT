<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem_e263.html" title="Edit section: Succession">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Succession</span></h2>
<p>Baldwin was among the second generation of children born to the descendents of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Crusade_f9d6.html" title="First Crusade">original crusaders</a>. He was 13 years old when his father Fulk died, and the kingdom legally passed to his mother as the daughter of Baldwin II. Melisende had ruled with Fulk as a consort, and Baldwin was crowned co-ruler and heir to his mother. However, Melisende also appointed <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manasses_of_Hierges_e86f.html" title="Manasses of Hierges">Manasses of Hierges</a>, <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officers_of_the_Kingdom_of_Jerusalem_c3fe.html" title="Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem">constable of Jerusalem</a>, as an advisor and the two essentially excluded Baldwin from power.</p>
<p>With a woman and a child legally ruling Jerusalem, the political situation was somewhat tense; the northern crusader states increasingly looked to assert their own independence, and there was no king to lead an army to impose the suzerainty of Jerusalem as Baldwin II or Fulk had done. In the Muslim world, <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zengi.html" title="Zengi">Zengi</a> ruled northern <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> from the cities of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosul.html" title="Mosul">Mosul</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleppo.html" title="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, and desired to add <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> in the south to his control. According to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Tyre_c43c.html" title="William of Tyre">William of Tyre</a>, Fulk had not completely seen to the defense of the Crusader states in the north, and it was there that Zengi was most threatening. In <a href="../../../1/1/4/1144.html" title="1144">1144</a>, he <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Edessa_7015.html" title="Siege of Edessa">captured Edessa</a>, which was a shock to the Western world and led to call for a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Crusade_dfbe.html" title="Second Crusade">Second Crusade</a>.</p>
<p>This crusade took some time to reach Jerusalem, and in the meantime Zengi was <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassin.html" title="Assassin">assassinated</a> in <a href="../../../1/1/4/1146.html" title="1146">1146</a>. He was succeeded by his son <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nur_ad-Din_1ec9.html" title="Nur ad-Din">Nur ad-Din</a>, who was just as eager to bring Damascus under his control. To counter this, Jerusalem and Damascus had made an alliance for their mutual protection. However, in <a href="../../../1/1/4/1147.html" title="1147">1147</a> Nur ad-Din and <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27in_ad-Din_Unur_2d36.html" title="Mu'in ad-Din Unur">Mu'in ad-Din Unur</a>, the governor of Damascus, made an alliance against Jerusalem, as the kingdom had already broken the treaty by allying with one of Unur's rebellious vassals. Baldwin marched out from Jerusalem and was defeated outside <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosra.html" title="Bosra">Bosra</a>, although the former truce with Damascus was later restored.</p>
<p><a name="Second_Crusade" id="Second_Crusade"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem_e263.html" title="Edit section: Second Crusade">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second Crusade</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/4/1148.html" title="1148">1148</a> the crusade finally arrived in Jerusalem, led by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_VII_of_France_6da2.html" title="Louis VII of France">Louis VII of France</a>, his wife <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine_9952.html" title="Eleanor of Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conrad_III_of_Germany_a621.html" title="Conrad III of Germany">Conrad III of Germany</a>. Baldwin held a council at <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre_%28city%29.html" title="Acre (city)">Acre</a> in <a href="../../../1/1/4/1148.html" title="1148">1148</a>, but in-fighting and poor planning plagued the crusaders, and Conrad badly advised Baldwin to attack Damascus, despite the peace treaty. Baldwin, perhaps eager to impress the great magnates of Europe who had arrived in his kingdom, agreed to the plan, but the ensuing <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Damascus_03b8.html" title="Siege of Damascus">siege of Damascus</a> was a fiasco and ended in defeat after only four days. Damascus soon fell under Nur ad-Din's control, and the loss of a sympathetic Muslim neighbour was a diplomatic disaster from which no subsequent king of Jerusalem could recover.</p>
<p>By 1149 the crusaders had returned to Europe, leaving a weakened Jerusalem. Nur ad-Din took advantage of the crusader defeat to invade the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality_of_Antioch_0539.html" title="Principality of Antioch">Principality of Antioch</a> in the north, and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_of_Antioch_0946.html" title="Raymond of Antioch">Prince Raymond</a> was killed in the subsequent <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Inab_866f.html" title="Battle of Inab">Battle of Inab</a>. Baldwin III hurried north to take up the regency of the principality. Raymond's wife, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constance_of_Antioch_f07a.html" title="Constance of Antioch">Constance</a>, was Baldwin's cousin through his mother and heiress of Antioch by right of her father. Baldwin tried to marry her to an ally but with no success. Baldwin was unable to help defend <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbessel.html" title="Turbessel">Turbessel</a>, the last remnant of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Edessa_f57d.html" title="County of Edessa">county of Edessa</a>, and was forced to cede it to <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_emperor.html" title="Byzantine emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuel_I_Comnenus_fd09.html" title="Manuel I Comnenus">Manuel I Comnenus</a> in <a href="../../../1/1/5/1150.html" title="1150">1150</a>. In <a href="../../../1/1/5/1152.html" title="1152">1152</a> Baldwin and his mother were called to intervene in a dispute between Baldwin's aunt <a href="../../../h/o/d/Hodierna_of_Tripoli_d699.html" title="Hodierna of Tripoli">Hodierna of Tripoli</a> and her husband <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_II_of_Tripoli_ce42.html" title="Raymond II of Tripoli">Count Raymond II</a>. When the matter was settled, Hodierna was about to return to Jerusalem with them, when Raymond was murdered by the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashshashin.html" title="Hashshashin">Hashshashin</a>. Baldwin remained behind to settle the affairs of <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Tripoli_bc98.html" title="County of Tripoli">the County</a>, while Hodierna took up the regency for her young son <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_III_of_Tripoli_5154.html" title="Raymond III of Tripoli">Raymond III of Tripoli</a>. Now, Edessa had been lost and Antioch and Tripoli had no leaders; only Jerusalem had a true king, but even there a dispute was brewing.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem_e263.html" title="Edit section: Civil war">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Civil war</span></h2>
<p>By 1152 Baldwin had been of age to rule by himself for seven years, and he began to assert himself in political affairs. Though he had not previously expressed an interest in the administration of the country, he now demanded more authority. He and his mother had become increasingly estranged since 1150, and Baldwin blamed the constable Manasses for interfering with his legal succession. In early 1152 Baldwin demanded a second coronation from Patriarch Fulcher, separate from his mother. The patriarch refused and as a kind of self-coronation Baldwin paraded through the city streets with laurel wreaths on his head.</p>
<p>Baldwin and Melisende agreed to put the matter before the <i><a href="../../../h/a/u/Haute_Cour_of_Jerusalem_4b71.html" title="Haute Cour of Jerusalem">Haute Cour</a></i>, or royal council. The <i>Haute Cour</i> returned a decision that would divide the kingdom into two administrative districts. Baldwin would retain <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilee.html" title="Galilee">Galilee</a> in the north, including the cities of <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre_%28city%29.html" title="Acre (city)">Acre</a> and <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyre_%28Lebanon%29_aa4b.html" title="Tyre (Lebanon)">Tyre</a>, while Melisende held the richer <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaria.html" title="Samaria">Samaria</a>, including <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nablus.html" title="Nablus">Nablus</a> and Jerusalem itself. Supporting Melisende in the south were Manasses, and Baldwin's younger brother <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalric_I_of_Jerusalem_cc0c.html" title="Amalric I of Jerusalem">Amalric</a>, who held the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Jaffa_e091.html" title="County of Jaffa">County of Jaffa</a> within Melisende's jurisdiction. Neither Baldwin nor Melisende were pleased with the decision, as Baldwin wanted to rule the entire kingdom and realized it would divide the country's resources, but in order to prevent a civil war Melisende agreed to the compromise.</p>
<p>Within weeks of the division Baldwin launched an invasion of the south. Manasses was defeated at the castle of Mirabel and exiled, and Nablus fell quickly as well. To prevent further violence, Jerusalem opened its gates to Baldwin. Melisende and Amalric sought refuge in the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_David_5bff.html" title="Tower of David">Tower of David</a>. Throughout the siege the church negotiated with Baldwin. The peace that was settled allowed for Melisende to hold Nablus for life, with a solemn oath by Baldwin not to disturb her peace. Baldwin named his supporter <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humphrey_II_of_Toron_fbc3.html" title="Humphrey II of Toron">Humphrey II of Toron</a> as the new constable.</p>
<p>By 1154 mother and son were reconciled, as Baldwin was astute enough to realize his mother's expertise in statecraft. Though she was "retired", she maintained great influence in court and government affairs, acting as regent for Baldwin while he was on campaign.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem_e263.html" title="Edit section: Recovery">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recovery</span></h2>
<p>During the civil war, Nur ad-Din had been busy consolidating his control of Damascus following the death of Mu'in ad-Din. With Syria united under one ruler, Jerusalem now had to look to the south, towards <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, if it wanted to expand. Egypt was weakened by civil wars as well, after the succession of a series of young <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatimid.html" title="Fatimid">Fatimid</a> <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">caliphs</a>. Around 1150 Baldwin refortified <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza.html" title="Gaza">Gaza</a> to place some pressure on the nearby Egyptian outpost of <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascalon.html" title="Ascalon">Ascalon</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/1/5/1153.html" title="1153">1153</a> Baldwin successfully <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ascalon_%281153%29_de00.html" title="Battle of Ascalon (1153)">besieged and captured Ascalon</a> itself. This secured the border with Egypt, although it would later lead to aggressive campaigns against Jerusalem's southern border. Ascalon was added to Amalric's fief of Jaffa, creating the double County of Jaffa and Ascalon. In 1152 Baldwin also defeated an <a href="../../../o/r/t/Ortoqid.html" title="Ortoqid">Ortoqid</a> invasion of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/5/1156.html" title="1156">1156</a> Baldwin was forced to sign a treaty with Nur ad-Din. However, in the winter of <a href="../../../1/1/5/1157.html" title="1157">1157</a>–<a href="../../../1/1/5/1158.html" title="1158">1158</a> Baldwin led an expedition into Syria, where he besieged <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaizar.html" title="Shaizar">Shaizar</a> but was forced to withdraw when a dispute arose between <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thierry%2C_Count_of_Flanders_44c6.html" title="Thierry, Count of Flanders">Thierry, Count of Flanders</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raynald_of_Chatillon_304c.html" title="Raynald of Chatillon">Raynald of Chatillon</a>, the new husband of Constance of Antioch, both of whom wanted Shaizar for themselves. Baldwin was, however, able to capture <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harim.html" title="Harim">Harim</a>, a former territory of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antioch.html" title="Antioch">Antioch</a>, and in 1158 he defeated Nur ad-Din himself.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem_e263.html" title="Edit section: Byzantine alliance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Byzantine alliance</span></h2>
<p>Baldwin's modest recovery garnered him enough prestige to seek a wife from the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. In 1157 he sent Humphrey of Toron to negotiate with Emperor Manuel, and it was decided that Baldwin should marry <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodora_Comnena_a10d.html" title="Theodora Comnena">Theodora</a>, Manuel's niece. The alliance was more favourable to Byzantium than Jerusalem, as Baldwin was forced to recognize Byzantine suzerainty over Antioch, and if Theodora were to be widowed she would be provided the city of <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akko.html" title="Akko">Acre</a>. Though Theodora personified the Byzantine-Jerusalem alliance, she was not to exercise any authority outside of Acre. The marriage took place in September of 1158, when Baldwin was 28 years old and Theodora only 13.</p>
<p>Relations between Jerusalem and Byzantium improved and in <a href="../../../1/1/5/1159.html" title="1159">1159</a> Baldwin met with Manuel in Antioch. The two became friends, with Manuel adopting western clothes and customs and participating in a <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tournament_%28medieval%29.html" title="Tournament (medieval)">tournament</a> against Baldwin. Manuel personally attended to Baldwin when the king was thrown from his horse during the tournament. Later in 1159 Baldwin became regent of Antioch once more, after Raynald of Chatillon had been captured in battle. This offended Manuel, who considered Antioch imperial territory, and the emperor strengthened his ties to the principality in <a href="../../../1/1/6/1160.html" title="1160">1160</a> by marrying <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_of_Antioch_4767.html" title="Maria of Antioch">Princess Maria</a>, Baldwin's cousin. Baldwin himself suggested Manuel marry another cousin, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melisende_of_Tripoli_770d.html" title="Melisende of Tripoli">Melisende of Tripoli</a>, preferring not to see such a close relationship between Byzantium and Antioch.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem_e263.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>Queen Melisende died in <a href="../../../1/1/6/1161.html" title="1161">1161</a>, and Baldwin himself died in <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beirut.html" title="Beirut">Beirut</a> on February 10, 1162. It was rumoured that he had been poisoned in Antioch by pills given to him by his <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_Orthodox_Church_7abe.html" title="Syriac Orthodox Church">Syrian Orthodox</a> doctor. “As soon as the king had taken the pills,” says William of Tyre, “he was seized with a fever and <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysentery.html" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a> which developed into <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">consumption</a> from which he was never able to obtain relief or help.” On the way home Baldwin remained in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripoli%2C_Lebanon_6409.html" title="Tripoli, Lebanon">Tripoli</a> for a few months, and then continued to Beirut where he finally succumbed to his illness. As William says, “For eight successive days, while the funeral procession moved from Beirut to Jerusalem, lamentation was unrestrained and grief was renewed almost hourly.” Theodora, now queen-dowager, retired to Acre. She was still only 16 years old; their marriage was childless. Baldwin was succeeded by his brother, Amalric I.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem_e263.html" title="Edit section: Personal characteristics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal characteristics</span></h2>
<p>William of Tyre knew Baldwin personally and gives a lengthy description of the king:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"…He was taller than the average man, but his limbs were so well proportioned to his height that no feature seemed out of harmony with the whole. His features were comely and refined, his complexion florid, a proof of innate strength…His eyes were of medium size, rather prominent and sparkling. He had straight yellowish hair and wore a rather full beard on cheeks and chin. He was of somewhat full habit, although he could not be called fleshy like his brother or spare like his mother..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baldwin was well educated, well spoken, and exceptionally intelligent. Unlike his father he had an excellent memory. He spent much of his spare time reading <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a> and was knowledgeable in the <i>jus consuetudinarium</i> of the kingdom, later collected by lawyers like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Ibelin_%28jurist%29_b819.html" title="John of Ibelin (jurist)">John of Ibelin</a> and Philip of Novara as "the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assizes_of_Jerusalem_a3c7.html" title="Assizes of Jerusalem">assizes of Jerusalem</a>". He respected church property and did not burden them with taxes. He was friendly to people of all classes, and "voluntarily offered an opportunity of conversing with him to anyone who wished it or whom he casually met. If an audience was requested, he did not refuse it." As a young man he enjoyed dice and other games, and carried on affairs with married women, but as an adult he "became changed for the better", as William says, and remained faithful to Theodora. He was popular and respected by all of his subjects, and even the respect of his enemy Nur ad-Din, who said of Baldwin's death, "the Franks have lost such a prince that the world has not now his like."</p>
