<p>Are the Orioles really going to wear black PANTS with their black alternate jersey, as shown in the picture? Somehow I doubt this, and I think a new, ACCURATE picture should be put up. 152.119.108.116 19:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I vote definitely yes. This was a grass-roots campaign to show fan displeasure with the ownership. When the team is eventually sold to a new owner, fans will look back and remember that the original fan protest of 2006 was a stepping stone. There's another fan protest being planned for 2007, and I anticipate that these kinds of protests will continue every year until Angelos sells the team. So, I think it's an important piece of information to include in the article. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeeracuda_dd26.html" title="User:Beeracuda">Beeracuda</a> 15:44, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fans protesting a team's poor performance belongs in the "News of the Weird" category. If the Cubs fans held a similar protest, they would probably call upon Chicago's Finest to arrest the team for a century of impersonating a major league baseball club. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 08:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The history of the St. Louis Browns needs to be expanded upon.

<p>I'm not sure that "The 2006 Turnaround?" is a good header. The Orioles have spoken of "turnarounds" for years now, so this statement would be speculative at best. It's similar to how every year, sportscasters on DC-area radio and television stations say that the Redskins will surely win the Super Bowl; after a while, it really sounds like they're crying wolf. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 17:42, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>While it may certainly be fun to call Peter Angelos "inept", it is debatable whether it should be included in an article proposing to be fact. Besides, what defines inept anyway? As an owner he is responsible for generating profit, which by all accounts is precisely what he has been able to do.</p>
<p>It's not even debatable if he's inept or not, he is quite inept --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerclaw_45b8.html" title="User:Killerclaw">The General</a> 21:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looks like this article is falling into the familiar trap of reporting every single transaction and news event and bit offseason activity of the past few months. E.g., the sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The 2005 season will likely go down as the most controversial in the Orioles' history.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Will it really? I don't think so. Yeah, 2005 sucked for the O's but the most controversial in team history?! This is only here because it's so fresh in the memory. If this is still here in five years, it won't make sense to anyone. Remember, this is the franchise that started a season at 0-21!!!! 2005 can't possibly be considered more controversial than that. Try to keep recent events in perspective and remember that this article isn't called 2005 Baltimore Orioles, it's just "Baltimore Orioles". Individual trades aren't mentioned from 1976 so why should they be given so much attention in 2005? Just one baseball history buff's opinion... —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:22, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Consider the previous talk section about Jeromy Burnitz. Burnitz <b>had</b> his own paragraph here?! The trade that brought Frank Robinson to Baltimore and triggered two World Championships and four league pennants - that gets one sentnce. But crappy Burnitz (sorry, I'm a Mets fan so I have to preface with the word "crappy") gets his own paragraph?! —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:27, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you can think of a more controversial O's season than '05, I'd like to hear it. Consider: Rafael Palmeiro, weeks after getting his 3000th hit, gets busted for steroids, basically ruining his career, and then tries to implicate Miguel Tejada, the O's superstar. Sammy Sosa, who was already controversial when the O's acquired him, comes into town and stinks up the joint, and he and Tejada reportedly can't stand each other, ruining the clubhouse further. Sidney Ponson spends 10 days in jail for punching a judge, then gets not one but <i>two</i> DUIs, infuriating the O's so much that they try to void his contract. Steve Kline openly bashes his manager, Lee Mazzilli, who gets fired in August. And oh yes, the O's enter June in first place and then suffer the biggest collapse in baseball history (no team has ever dropped in winning percentage so drastically in one season), and fall into fourth place for the 7th time in 8 years.</p>
<p>I can't think of an O's season even <i>remotely</i> as controversial as '05. What was controversial about the 0-21 season? They just stunk. There was no controversy there.</p>

<p>The needs to be information about the fact that during the 1980s, the Orioles won the 1983 World Series, Earl Weaver left (Joe Altobelli was the manager for the 1983 team) and then returned shortly thereafter for a brief period. There was also, of course, the horrendous 1988 season (which saw Cal Ripken, Sr. get fired after six games and then Frank Robinson taking over) and the dramatic turnaround in 1989.<a href="../../../t/m/c/User%7ETMC1982_1023.html" title="User:TMC1982">User:TMC1982</a></p>

<dd>"It has been an Orioles tradition since 1980 to play John Denver's "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" after "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" during the seventh inning stretch. "</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There was a time where "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" was plade exclusively without playing "Take Me Out to the Ballgame". There was also a time where "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" was not played at all. And I believe that they have played other songs during the 7th inning stretch. At a recent game that I attended I believe they played a patriotic song followed by "Thank God....".</p>
<p>Perhaps we can clear this up with stating that Oriole Tradition includes playing "Thank God..." and make some reference to the fact that they stopped playing the song for a while but returned to the tradition?</p>
<dl>
<dd>True, it was at least a 5 year period in which country boy was not played, though i don't know the date but i think they stopped playing it when then moved to Camden Yards, or not long after, and was restarted in the years in which they were back in the playoffs. I know it was a big deal when it was stopped and when it started back up again, and i think the Angelos had something to do with why it was not played, something like he was not a fan of the song, but i cant say for sure. Anyway yeah if we can find the right information then i am all for clearing it up. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trácht ar</a> 06:05, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that on Sundays the patriotic song that they play is "God Bless America". I believe a lot of MLB teams have adopted Sunday as a day to play it. OsFan 20:15, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There was actually a time in the late 1980s when "Country Boy" was replaced by The Beatles' "Twist and Shout", which was routinely booed by traditionist fans.

<p>The opening section states that the Baltimore Orioles are one of the 'elite' teams in baseball. I'm sorry, but I know a heck of a lot about baseball and I would never consider putting them in the category of elite by any means. (For example: The New York Yankees have won more games against the Orioles/Browns than any other club- not very persuading.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Check some more facts then that and then we'll talk, they are indeed elite. Oh, an about your "Fact" WE ARE IN THEIR DIVISION, someone in their division has to have lost to them the most, it just makes sense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How can you prove that they are elite? I beleive that you are just a Baltimore fan who desires more respect for your team. The Minnesota Twins, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, and the Oakland Athletics are all certainly on the "same level" as the Orioles. This simple reason is also due to the fact that the Orioles are one of the original members of the American League like the forementioned teams... this makes them a classic team, not an "elite" team. If you want to know my definition of elite teams, they are the Yankees, Red Sox, Cardinals, Braves, Giants, and Dodgers. You can't have too many more elite teams than that... if the Orioles were elite, half, if not more than half, of teams in baseball would be.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That same argument can be made against your point. You include teams such as the Red Sox, Cardinals, Braves, Giants, and Dodgers. Each and every one of those teams has had extended periods of losing years, as well as their runs of successful years. The description of "elite" is very subjective, and probably doesn't deserve to be included in an encyclopedia. One can state facts, such as the number of World Series wins, or the number of overall wins in a franchise's history. Those facts are not subject to debate. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeeracuda_dd26.html" title="User:Beeracuda">Beeracuda</a> 15:59, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are we sure Elrod was "designated for assignment" as the article says? I've never heard this term applied to a coach before.

<dd>I believe you are correct. Perhaps this inaccuracy came about because Elrod's own article states that he was going to be "reassigned" within the organization after his bullpen coach contract was not renewed past the end of the 2005 season. He was to remain with the organization in a community relations capacity due to his immense popularity with O's fans. --<a href="../../../m/m/p/User%7EMmpartee_bbf8.html" title="User:Mmpartee">Mmpartee</a> 03:41, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did the retired numbers in a graphic version as I did for <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Louis_Cardinals_0b29.html" title="Saint Louis Cardinals">STL</a> and helped do with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">NYY</a> page.

This is done in a way that looks like it's displayed at the stadium, so you can see it was a bit more of a challenge given the unorthodox way this is done at Camden Yards. I tried my best, but had limited pictures to work from. If the numbers are too far off, perhaps one who has one could upload it and give a link on my talk page. I have pictures of 5 and 8, with 42 in the background. A picture could also be used in the article underneath, with an explaination of the Number Garden concept. It's quite interesting, and, should be mentioned here under retired numbers beside mention on the Camden Yards page.</p>
