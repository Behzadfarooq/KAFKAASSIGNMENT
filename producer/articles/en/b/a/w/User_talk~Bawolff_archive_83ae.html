<p>You felt this rare disease is being described in too technical terms. Frankly, when I wrote it I translated every technical term in brackets. There is not much more that can be done - it is terribly rare (it mainly occurs in Japanese men) and quite elusive. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 17:03, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGrye_3ca8.html" title="User:Grye">G-Rye</a> here. Sorry to bother you, but <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:MrMiscellanious" class="extiw" title="wikinews:User:MrMiscellanious">MrMiscellanious</a> blocked me for 6 months on wikinews. I learned this when I went to correct my crossing edits, &amp; back off etc, &amp; couldn't. I'm pretty sure my IP's blocked - I cannot make a user. I cannot IRC admins (etc) because it seems to be down, or I otherwise cannot get on.</p>
<p>I don't really care about Amgine on wikinews. I won't touch or use or edit wikinews, ever, with this experience.</p>
<p>I do care about MrMiscellanious' block. Irregardless of <i>why</i> I might care, the reason it cites [when I try to edit, &amp; it kicks me to the blocked screen] is wrong: <b>The reason given is this:</b> Impersonating another user on community-consensus poll. This is a static IP.</p>
<p>Whatever I may have done, I did <i>not</i> impersonate anyone. &amp; if/when I do something wrong, &amp; ralize/am made aware of it, I quickly correct it. I'm very open.</p>
<p>I cannot do anything, at all, in wikinews, that I know of, to effect this ban. I ask you, as an admin, what can I do?</p>

<p>Hi, I'm not sure where else to contact you since I'm now banned from making edits at Wikinews.</p>
<p>Mrmiscellanious banned me from wikinews in retribution for exercising my right to vote against a potential admin he supported <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Wikinews%3AAdministrators&amp;diff=237199&amp;oldid=237198" class="external text" title="http://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Wikinews%3AAdministrators&amp;diff=237199&amp;oldid=237198" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As my history of edits will show, I made no other edits or comments on Wikinews since that vote at all. I just voted, then was banned by Mrmiscellanious shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>If there was already clear consensus of a dire problem with me existing on Wikinews, why did Mrmiscellanious wait until after I made that vote (he didn't agree with) to ban me? I signed up some time ago and Mrmiscellanious (and others) observed me in the Water Cooler back in early February, but no ban was made against me (by Mrmiscellanious or anyone else) until I made that vote.</p>
<p>The timing of this ban is about power and control, not truly enforcing policy, consensus and making Wikinews a better place. I also fear that this form of intimidation could adversely affect other Wikinews contributers and influence their votes when they see what happens to those who vote in ways that Mrmiscellanious doesn't like. If contributers perceive their votes may exact revenge upon themselves, I'm sure less contributers will vote and make their voices heard. That seems to be the opposite effect of what a Wiki is supposed to be all about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm sorry to waste your time with this and take away from more important things like contributions, etc. but I'm hoping you can fix this so I can make positive contributions to Wikinews when time allows.</p>
<p>I have no intention to talk (argue, etc.) with Mrmiscellanious about this once I'm able to edit and vote again (or even if I'm not). I'll will just drop it and moo-ve on. If he attacks or bans me for revenge again, I'll just contact you and hopefully you can get him to chill out and focus on important issues at Wikinews.</p>
<p>As can be observed <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Talk:Flight_93_cockpit_recorder_played_in_Moussaoui_trial" class="external text" title="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Talk:Flight_93_cockpit_recorder_played_in_Moussaoui_trial" rel="nofollow">here</a> &amp; elsewhere throughout Wikinews, Mrmiscellanious is embroiled in enough conflict with others right now -- and I have no desire to distract him from all those other conflicts in order to confront him with the issue of banning me. He seems to have enough conflict with others on his plate. I'll just be glad to move on, vote and contribute positively to more important, positive Wikinews tasks.

<p>Amgine moved in quickly and has now blocked me from editing my talk page on wikinews.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the last few edits in the History. He was not letting me say I thought the Chinese govt. was fascist because it might offend some Chinese contributers. I changed the "bastard" part and he still wouldn't accept my edit and banned me.</p>
<p>Is is really against Wiki policy to say that you think the Chinese government is fascist on your own talk page? If so, things are getting very out of control at Wikinews. Check the last few edits and you'll see what I'm talking about. This is crazy. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowicide_13d7.html" title="User:Cowicide">Cowicide</a> 07:14, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Among other things, MrM says he doesn't agree with Homosexuality on his page... that will very well offend people. Shall we ban him if he doesn't remove the "offensive" text? For me to say that I think the Chinese govt. is fascist... that is my political opinion. I removed the "bastards" reference... therefore, it was only my political opinion beyond that point. Can you HONESTLY say that political opinion is NOT allowed on talk pages? If that's the case, you and Amgine had better start cleaning house and you both can start with MrM's talk page with his opinions that very clearly offend people somewhere.</p>
<p>I'm going to put the statement that I think the Chinese govt. is fascist on my talk page on Wikinews. Come after me if you TRULY think that political speech on individual talk pages are against the rules. Then please come after MrM for his opinion page thereafter.</p>

<dd>Its not that it may offend somebody somewhere, its that somebody complained. If you complained that mrm's opinions offend you than I could get him to kill thoose if you cared so much (and provided a good argument as to why you care). You can state the chinese thing in a way thats not offensive as well. (al la. I don't like the way the PRC is censoring the internet) and some people on wikinews do have similiar things written on their talk page. Its a little tiny thing. You shouldn't be so concerned. (or if you care that much you'll probally have better luck with a fork). <a href="../../../b/a/w/User%7EBawolff_b80e.html" title="User:Bawolff">Bawolff</a> 02:36, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm just tired of the hypocrisy from Amgine and MrM. It's ruining Wikinews, period. If those 2 guys disappeared from Wikinews, quality contributions/participation would skyrocket. I don't understand the fear some of you seem to have of them, Amgine should lose his admin status and MrM should be "permabanned" instead of this too little, too late one month (now only 2 week) ban he just got for his outrageous behavior with Karen (A behavior Amgine has also exhibited with other contributers). You know very well this is NOT the first time MrM has used his admin power for revenge, ego and agenda instead of for the greater good of Wikinews. You also know very well it won't be the last time until MrM is completely banned. It's incredible that MrM still has admin status at this point. He has massively damaged the project and thwarted participation. MrM makes the environment at Wikinews absolutely nasty. For the sake of Wikinews, these guys need to go and/or lose admin privs. I'm just thankful MrM will be gone for a month so everyone can see how much the general civility &amp; quality at Wikinews rises without him. Maybe then some more people will see the light and finally... finally... at least remove MrM's ridiculous admin status. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowicide_13d7.html" title="User:Cowicide">Cowicide</a> 18:56, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand your disagreements with mrm, (and to a point, agree with most of them), but fail to see your problem with Amgine. Sure s/he may have done some bad things, But the good things that s/he has done outways them vastly in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/a/w/User%7EBawolff_b80e.html" title="User:Bawolff">Bawolff</a> 20:19, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Amgine certainly does good things, but does NOT have the interpersonal skills and tact to be an admin. While I somewhat commend Amgine's recent reprimands of MrM.... it's too little, too late... overall, in the past, Amgine has been an enabler for MrM and that has absolutely ruined the spirit at Wikinews. Amgine's demeanor towards new contributers has also been nasty similar to (but not quite as venomous as) MrM.</p>
<p>They both have created a hostile environment with rampant hypocrisy for all to see. Wikinews would be better off with MrM gone entirely and Amgine focusing on projects instead of ego-trip power struggles. Contributership has been very low. If Amgine backed off (which is unlikely because of ego) and MrM disappeared, we both know contributership would blossom as the general good spirit increased. If you still fail to see my problem with Amgine... go take a look at Amgine's demeanor with contributers and compare it with your own. Would YOU want to be treated like that? You exhibit some of the best qualities in an admin, while I think Amgine exhibits some of the worst. And, MrM is just poison to the project, period.</p>
<p>Like I said, Amgine should focus on projects and leave interpersonal administration up to people that have much higher aptitude for such things. Mark my words, the Wikinews contributership and quality would improve drastically if that happened. I'd like to see more balanced views (from the middle, right &amp; left) on wikinews from MORE contributers from all walks of life... the current environment Amgine helps to create does NOT let that happen... it just repels far too many newbies who don't want to deal with a terse, insulting tone in their spare time. They just put up their arms and split. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowicide_13d7.html" title="User:Cowicide">Cowicide</a> 21:52, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thats certainly intreasting. Well I disagree with most of that, its intreasting to know what people think. I have never found Amgine to be rude or anything to any contributor, New or otherwise. I don't wish to comment on too much else as, I've already made alot of people mad at me, and wish to <i>tread lightly</i>.(people finnally stoped blocking eachother, but their certainly a little edgy) <a href="../../../b/a/w/User%7EBawolff_b80e.html" title="User:Bawolff">Bawolff</a> 04:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I could send you examples of Amgine's behavior (with others), but if you need to "tread lightly" that's fine. Anyway, I think you are a great admin and wish you well. Hopefully, Wikinews will "self-heal" over time and become a less hostile place as MrM and some others become too beleaguered to be nasty to other people eventually. Take care. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowicide_13d7.html" title="User:Cowicide">Cowicide</a> 15:37, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bawolff,<br />
Thank you very much for informing me of the user Goober-peas. I would prefer it if s/he did actually remove his statement.

I said because he was. He attacked my island, and stole the church, the st. francis monastery and the council house. He was a pirate with the royal consent, like many others british admirals. This is not a revenge or something like that, it is just the historic truth. I'm talking about San Miguel de La Palma, Canary Islands, Northwest Africa, Spanish Kingdom. Maybe I'm in a mistake, but I learned it at school. Very sorry if I have offende anyone and please excuse my horrible english grammar.
