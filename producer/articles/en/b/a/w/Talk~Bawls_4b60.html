<p>The first sentence of an article should summarize the most significant attributes of the article's subject. The original sentence was: "Bawls is an energy drink marketed mainly towards computer gaming enthusiasts and paintballers." Really, that's peripheral info about how the drink relates to society. About the drink <i>itself</i> though, the stuff <i>inside</i> the bottle, the most important identifier is the caffeine content. Which is why I changed the first sentence to its current form.</p>

<p>I just spoke to 2 different reps that work for CompUSA, and apparantly they stopped supplying BAWLS nationwide. &#160;:(</p>
<p>Contrary to what the acticle says, Bawls is not avalible in most stores that soft drinks are sold everywhere in the US. It is actually rather hard to find in many locations including Michigan. Here in Michigan, only a few stores that cater to the gaming crowd carry the drink.</p>

<p>Wisconsin has poor to no supply, also. CompUSA rarely has it in stock, LAN party locations may or may not have it, and it is generally hard to find.

<p>Add your locale, rate and keep this list alphabetical by country, then by region, and so on down the line, minimum resolution part of city if there is varience from one area of the city to another. Postal codes and nation &gt; state/provence/etc &gt; city will improve this greatly overall.</p>
<p>Encountered bawls, know it's dry, feel free to add, try to be as tight on the resolution as possible as I do intend to eventaully take this data and create a world map of bawls availability.</p>
<p>Please exclude online retailers in this demographic data. Most cover 1 or more continents and thus would harshly skew results. LAN Parties should also be excluded as they are events, and not suppliers able to provide regular supply.</p>

<dd>It is possible that the particular store or franchise orders it, so reports can vary, a system should probobly be developed to figure out if it's franchise or chain that carries it, CompUSA is a good one for 'chain' but like I noted earlier, places may not carry it even though their chain does. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIce_a282.html" title="User:Ice">Ice</a> 06:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In South Bend, IN, there is a large supply of Bawls in the regular bottles, although I have yet to see mints. I also found SnoBawls here yesterday, and my local LAN center is getting a machine. Maybe we should update the SnoBawls section, because it appears that it is out of the "beta" and is now being spread to smaller cities. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkSideMoon_9020.html" title="User:DarkSideMoon">DarkSideMoon</a> 22:53, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed a trend around my area with LANers saving the bawls bottles. I've seen it at larger LANs as well, such as the 800 man PDXlan.

<p>When I originally wrote this article, I had a 12 oz bottle in my hand, so I used that, recently another author changed the ammount to 10 oz in the section describing caffeine content, I prefere 12 but didn't see reason to change it back.

<dd>Checking out their website, (see FAQ: how many calories are in a bottle of Bawls?), it seems clear that they only sell 10 oz bottles. Anyway, I'm guessing the other editor changed the amount in his/her edit because originally the section stated that the amount <i>per 12 oz bottle</i> was such-and-such. I don't think the objection was to stating the amount of caffeine per 12 oz (even Bawls own website does that). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 12:21, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hrm, it's possible that they may have changed the size, but if you look at the original draft of the article, you'll see me quote from the bawls bottle I had in my cubard (see collecting under culture), a 12oz bottle claiming 80 mg of caffeine, as that was what I originally had. As there is new evidence, I think statement based on 10 oz would be valid as it does come directly from the Bawls web site, thus a trusted source in the matter. I'm not specifically against, just was confused.</dd>
<dd>Though by sidebar, I mean a listing of various Bawls products (Bawls, sugar free, mints, and SnoBawls) as there is now a large selection of bawls flavors, a sidebar can be justified.</dd>
<dd>Though I am wondering if dropping 12 oz is needed or if 12 oz exists still (and thus it's information would still be required) if 12 oz was discontinued, mention of it for historical reasons should be maintained I feel. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIce_a282.html" title="User:Ice">Ice</a> 12:35, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"A 10oz bottle of Bawls contains 67mg of caffeine, which occurs naturally in guarana and is 2.5 times stronger than the caffeine found in coffee, tea, or regular soft drinks. In comparison, an 8oz cup of coffee contains around 100-120mg depending on the method of brewing." I don't quite understand this statement. Does this mean that the caffeine found in Guarana is stronger then the caffeine found in coffee? This sounds like something that could use a citation, as I don't see any mention of that on the <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guarana.html" title="Guarana">guarana</a> page. --<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudzillah_6f34.html" title="User:Judzillah">Judzillah</a> 01:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I knew someone would ask sooner or later...:-) Anyway, this is a claim made by Bawls, but I haven't personally seen any evidence of this. It's also a sloppy statement, as what they really mean is that the mixture of stimulants they get from guarana is a potent blend of caffeine and other alkaloids (cf <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">caffeine</a> for an explanation of how in nature caffeine is often found with other stimulants). Presumably, the guarana caffeine blend is particularly stronger, 2.5 times stronger than the mixture from a coffee bean. Again, I don't know if this is really true. But it sounds like an interesting thing to research and find out. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 01:23, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that the current citation goes to Bawls' marketing pages. That is a horrible reference to chemical information. Claims that some caffeine is "stronger" than any other type of caffeine is pretty much just marketing bullsh*t. What they probably mean is the combination of alkaloids mentioned above by Chan-ho. (or they just wrote that to sound cool) Anyhow, the claim in its current form not at all NPOV and thus not suitable for Wikipedia. 88.112.194.137 21:55, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sadly, yeah, I did drag that statement over from the Bawls website when I was attempting to fact find initially, so I take the blame, but yes, looking at [<a href="http://wilstar.com/caffeine.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://wilstar.com/caffeine.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] which may or may not be a reliable source, I think Jolt and Red Bull beat Bawls per oz. so yeah, removing that claim won't be challenged. Guarana is said to be a healthier source of caffeine than the types used by cola companies, but I'd ask if anyone's found proof, or if I'd be pulling trivia out of lacks source land again. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIce_a282.html" title="User:Ice">Ice</a> 19:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>That link says nothing more that guarana contains a higher volume of caffeine than kola nut, and that bawls has caffeine in a certain quantity. It doesn't address the issue that the claim that the caffeine in Bawls is 2.5 times stronger than normal caffeine is untrue.</p>
<p>Besides, the discussion of this is irrelevant, because bawls doesn't use a guarana slurry or anything, it uses natural flavors derived from guarana and straight caffeine. Its bottle says as much. God bless the pure food and drug act.</p>
