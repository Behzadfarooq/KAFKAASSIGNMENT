<p>Hi. I've noticed that you're making use of political or religious <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">userboxes</a> on your user page. They can be a nifty way to share about one's personal preferences, but I realized, after a while, that they often detract from the real purpose of Wikipedia, that is, writing an encyclopedia. I'm inviting you to consider these words from <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, the site operator:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder if you might consider simply removing your political/religious/etc. userboxes and asking others to do the same. This seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project. They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion (which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn't go away), it will be better to simply change the culture, one person at a time. Will you help me?</dd>

<p>I have to admit, your logic utterly loses me.

<dd>I feel that the Punk'd reference is irrelevant because I do not consider appearances on such shows to be substantive information about the career of an actor/actress. Mentioning that Lindsay Lohan appeared on a TV show where celebrities have pranks pulled on them tells me nothing about Lohan's career or significance as an actress. It instead functions as nothing more than a subtle advertisement for Punk'd, which I believe is bad for the encyclopedia. It is possible that the Punk'd reference is significant in demonstrating her friendship with Kutcher and her later connection to Valderrama, but the re-write does not explain that in a manner that connects the two appearances. Until this is re-written to make the connection clear (which should make it relevant), I'm removing the reference altogether. -- <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackburner001_59e9.html" title="User:Backburner001">backburner001</a> 06:48, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I have to admit I'm a bit off-put by your insistence that information <b>that survived the PR and FAC processes</b> is irrelevant—"I do not consider" demonstrates this is your own opinion—and therefore must be <b>removed</b> until it suits you, as opposed to discussing the intended move first. To be honest, it's irrelevant how Lohan and Kutcher met and became friends; since <i>Punk'd</i> only targets celebrities, it only matters that Kutcher had determined Lohan's celebrity sufficient to <b>feature</b> her on the show, which is a relevant career milestone as it says, "Lindsay Lohan is officially a celebrity, according to <i>Punk'd</i>. (I still maintain that both her <i>Punk'd</i> appearance and the later cameo on <i>That 70s Show</i> are relevant for no more significant reason than they happened.) Therefore, I have restored—with another minor rewrite—a paragraph <b>that survived the PR and FAC processes</b>. In the future, may I ask that you please <b>discuss</b> concerns on data <b>before</b> purging it? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 15:40, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that you are off-put by my edits is not my problem. I am not aware of any Wikipedia guideline, which grants immunity to articles that have survived the PR and FAC processes. Though these articles might have survived those processes, they still might have the potential for improvement. If I see a problem in an article, regardless of what process it has survived, I will edit it in an attempt to improve it. Furthermore (if I remember correctly from my brief look at the PR and FAC done on this article), the Punk’d reference was only discussed as an example of a broader suggestion – it was never addressed specifically and you made no further comments on it. Correct me on this point, if I missed something.</dd>

<dd>Yes, this is my opinion. Yes, this reference must be removed until it suits me. My action in this respect is no different from anything you have done throughout this dispute. You think the Punk’d reference is relevant and therefore you will keep adding it because it suits you. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia anyone can edit. As a result of the nature of this encyclopedia, editors will sometimes disagree on particular edits. Furthermore, if an editor is determined to push his edit forward, the conflict will continue until that editor decides an edit suits him. If you aren’t prepared to deal with this kind of interaction, go start your own version of Wikipedia where you always have the last word. If not, then don’t point fingers at people for doing the very thing that is encouraged here.</dd>

<dd>I have already expressed that the Punk’d reference is not sufficient because the connection between the show and her later friendships/relationships is not explicit. The mere fact that they happened is not relevant enough to be included because it tells me nothing about her life or her career, aside from the fact that she was on a show that pulls pranks on celebrities. It is my opinion that biographical articles should highlight the important parts of a person’s life – not necessarily every appearance they made, but the ones that were significant to their success and notoriety.</dd>

<dd>Wrong answer. You have never attempted to <b>discuss</b> this; never once have you said anything such as, "I think this is irrelevant, let's work together to fix it." Instead, you simply remove the data and justify the move after the fact by saying, essentially, "I don't like it. Fix it, or I'll remove it again." <b>This does not constitute a discussion</b>— it is antagonistic, and my reverts are justified as they restore information that was already there prior to your removal.

<dd>The posting <b>is</b> neutral; "I don't like it. You fix it. If not, I'll keep removing it" paraphrases with an identical meaning your own words, "Yes, this reference must be removed until it suits me." (The meaning <b>is</b> identical because you apparently cannot say, "Let <b>us</b> fix it.") Even better, let's go straight to your <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackburner001_59e9.html" title="User:Backburner001">user page</a>, where one of your stated goals is to "[r]emove irrelevant/trivial content." Note that you don't suggest working together with other editors to "improve" content, but that you, alone, intend to <b>remove</b> it, based on your—and <b>only</b> your—criteria therefor. First, I cannot think of a purpose in simply deleting data unless its factuality is under dispute, or it is obviously false, or it clearly has no relevance to the subject (and this case is anything but clear). Should we "improve" data, as you claim? Absolutely. Reject it out of hand? Absolutely not. Second, did you even attempt to learn who the author was? Did you ever post a message on the talk page saying, give or take, "Why is this here? Is it relevant? Can it be removed if it's not?" No, you did not; <b>you took it upon yourself</b> to determine, "this is irrelevant, good-bye," click. Done. This violates the "working <b>together</b> to create an encyclopedia" spirit that is supposed to embody Wikipedia; it is arrogant, egocentric and unproductive. You wonder why I'm off-put? Because "let's fix this <b>together</b>" (seemingly) never even occurred to you. Naturally, I feel my reaction to your actions is perfectly justified—and, I would go so far as to say I've been far more <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> than many other editors would have been. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 00:05, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The posting is not neutral. You chose the parts of my responses that bolstered your image and slanted the description of the conflict in your favor. My description was neutral. It stated that there is a dispute and the nature of that dispute (whether content is relevant or not). Other Wikipedians who wish to comment on the matter have the intelligence to determine the rest when they read the content of our dispute on the Lohan talk page.</dd>

<dd>Contrary to the image you are attempting to paint, I have never suggested that we should not work together to improve the article. What you fail to see is that sometimes, removing content is part of that collaboration and improvement. I did my part – I removed content I felt was not significant and I made suggestions for improvement when I was asked for them. If you are interested in working together to fix this problem, do your part and improve the Punk’d reference or give me a legitimate reason for keeping the reference that was in there before. The above statements you made provided no good counter-arguments. Instead of focusing on the discussing the reference I removed, you decided to focus on the fact that the edit occurred and took great offense to it.</dd>

<dd>You are confrontational. Your idea of "working together" is, <b>paraphrased</b> (got it this time?), "I don't like it. I'm deleting it. <b>You</b> fix it." I have laid out the case for the information's inclusion (it happened, it received massive press, it demonstrates Lohan's celebrity status, etc.); your entire case is, <b>paraphrased</b> (I can keep this up...), "I don't care. I say it's irrelevant. Gone." If I worked with someone IRL whose idea of "working together" matched yours, his butt would be <b>fired</b>. You have forced me to respond in kind, so that's what I'm doing. I intend to stop your attempts to <b>vandalize</b> this article by purging it of <b>demonstrably relevant material</b> if it gets us both repeatedly blocked for <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> and/or banned from Wikipedia.

<dd>Agreed. I am, however, placing you on notice: Your professed "I did my part – I removed content ... (you) do your part and improve (it)" style of "working together" is the real-life equivalent of taking a co-worker's report, tossing a random page into the trash, telling them "I did my part, now you do yours and fix it" and then taking credit for "helping" to "improve" it. If you weren't fired, your actions would make you the most despised person in the office; they are antagonistic, confrontational and <b>wrong</b>. This is not about me; it's about equity, and your "work" on Wikipedia as a whole. I intend to keep an eye on your future edits to this and other pages until you've learned what "working together" really means. Yes—it's <b>your</b> turn to satisfy <b>me</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 13:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I came to Wikipedia fully expecting that not only you would scrutinize my edits, but that many others would scrutinize them as well. If you are trying to intimidate or scare me by placing me “on notice,” it won’t work. I’m already on notice, as are you, and as is everyone who edits this encyclopedia. It’s the nature of Wikipedia. Stop dramatizing the situation and stick to the discussion of the content being disputed.</dd>

<dd><i>My apologies for not getting to this earlier. Before I discuss the reference, I’d like to thank you for the way you chose to address this issue. I’ve run into the same disagreement with another editor about the same reference that has evolved into a rather unpleasant dispute. I agree – neither you nor I can make a final determination on the issue as the nature of Wikipedia demands that we reach some sort of agreement or compromise on these matters. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this issue with me in a calm and civil manner.</i></dd>

<p>On the one hand, this demonstrates that, indeed, you <b>have</b> changed, from "Until this is re-written to make the connection clear (which should make it relevant), I'm removing the reference altogether" (a direct quote from you) to "I agree – neither you nor I can make a final determination on the issue as the nature of Wikipedia demands that we reach some sort of agreement or compromise" (another direct quote from you). On the other hand, it demonstrates a clear willingness on your part to slap me from behind—<b>after</b> you'd called for a "truce"—you could not say "look at me, I can play nice, unlike that other editor" any more clearly if you'd actually used those (hypothetical) words.</p>
<p>Prior to this—but, still, after your call for a "truce"— you'd made this statement at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Talk%7ELindsay_Lohan_0325.html" title="Talk:Lindsay Lohan">Talk:Lindsay Lohan</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>My only concern is that our suggestions to make the reference relevant will not be taken seriously. How might we address this?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Given that a total of seven editors were contributing to the discussion, this was a direct slap to the five to whom you did not address this comment, not just to me.</p>
<p>The question that remains: Do you plan to stop talking out of both sides of your face and abide by the terms of your own "truce", or do you plan to continue taking not-so-subtle slaps at <b>the person who taught you the difference</b> between "bold" edits and "my way or the highway" edits?</p>

<dl>
<dd>I did not break the terms of my truce. The conditions of the truce were as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>“do not edit the description of this dispute on the <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_ART_747b.html" title="WP:RFC/ART">WP:RFC/ART</a>”</li>
<li>“both you and I stop discussing peripheral issues – such as who was wrong, who did this and that, etc”</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the first block of text you quoted, in which I thanked <a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a>, I did not discuss who was wrong in reference to the Lohan Punk’d dispute. I merely stated that a dispute exists and that it was unpleasant. You can read further into it, if that is how you choose to read it, but the text I wrote did not explain anything more.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In reference to your second quote, I still did not discuss who was wrong or who initiated an action in our previous discussion. I made a comment about a concern I have for the future of the content dispute and sought input on how to deal with the situation if it arose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You could make the argument that my second comment (about taking suggestions seriously) did not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> in you as an editor and you wouldn’t be incorrect. However, I believe I did enter this content dispute by assuming good faith in your editorial intentions. Furthermore, I believe your conduct since the beginning of this dispute gives me good reason to scrutinize your editorial intentions closely and not assume good faith anymore, at least for the duration of this current dispute (but, in accordance to the conditions of our truce, I won’t discuss the specifics of my reasoning until after the Lohan content dispute has ended).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, let’s get back to the Punk’d reference, shall we? -- <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackburner001_59e9.html" title="User:Backburner001">backburner001</a> 17:39, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You can stop the spin machine; yes, you did break the terms, to wit: "<b>I’ve run into the same disagreement with another editor about the same reference that has evolved into a rather unpleasant dispute</b> ... <b>I appreciate your willingness to discuss this issue with me in a calm and civil manner</b>" is a direct violation of "both you and I stop discussing peripheral issues – such as who was wrong, who did this and that, etc" as it slips the issue of <b>cooperation</b> into what is supposed to be <b>strictly</b> limited to <b>content</b>, per <b>your</b> condition. "My only concern is that our suggestions to make the reference relevant will not be taken seriously. How might we address this?" presents an identical violation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Further, the unwritten tag to "I appreciate your willingness to discuss this issue with me in a calm and civil manner" cannot be more obvious: "(unlike that other discussion)." This <b>is</b> an affront, and suggests that the two disputes were begun by you in the same manner. If this is your suggestion, that is not spin; it is an outright, bald-faced <b>lie</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Do not lecture me</b> on "good faith" when you exhibit nothing but bad faith and worse spin tactics. You want to get back to the <i>Punk'd</i> reference?

<dd>I still contend that I did not break the terms of the truce. I never posted any value judgment of your prior behavior after our truce agreement.

<dd>I, too, would prefer to reach a compromise; however, I have to mention that my opinion that "it's irrelevant how Lohan and Kutcher met and became friends; since Punk'd only targets celebrities, it only matters that Kutcher had determined Lohan's celebrity sufficient to feature her on the show" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lindsay_Lohan&amp;diff=40712191&amp;oldid=40680970" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lindsay_Lohan&amp;diff=40712191&amp;oldid=40680970" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) has not changed.

On the other hand, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> agreed with you (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lindsay_Lohan&amp;diff=41564491&amp;oldid=41558009" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lindsay_Lohan&amp;diff=41564491&amp;oldid=41558009" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) which, in terms of a discussion only, leaves a 2-2 count. If nothing else, this underscores a lack of consensus, which supports the promiment opinion: it could be <b>better</b>, but it shouldn't be <b>removed</b>. Thus, I believe it's fair to reiterate that, as I continue (and, I <b>do</b> continue) to look for ways to improve the reference, I will restore the data if it's deleted and, because <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindsay_Lohan_4008.html" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a> is a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html#Media" title="WP:FA">Featured article</a>, I will remove any "speculative" additions. Meantime, I just checked again, and I don't currently find <b>any</b> reference to Kutcher introducing Lohan and Valderrama. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 19:58, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I remember you stating your opinion that the issue of Lohan and Kutcher meeting is irrelevant. Although, I should first note that your re-statement of the Kutcher-Lohan connection is imprecise. Mentioning how Lohan and Kutcher became friends is not my concern; mentioning that Lohan was introduced to her ex-boyfriend through a friend was what I was trying to get at. That said, I was actually quite surprised when you expressed the above opinion, since it seems to me like the connection between Lohan and Valderrama is the only thing that gives Lohan's appearance on Punk'd any more significance beyond simply stating that she appeared on the show. I still don't understand how the appearance alone deems the reference relevant.</dd>

<dd>The reference tells us nothing significant about Lohan that we don't already know from the rest of the article. The reference tells us something about Punk'd, which makes it relevant if the article were discussing the Punk'd series. A <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_celebrities_who_have_appeared_on_Punk%27d_36e9.html" title="List of celebrities who have appeared on Punk'd">list of celebrities who have been Punk'd</a> already exists. If Wikipedia users want to find out whether or not she appeared on the Punk'd series, they can view this list. Why do we need an additional reference to Punk'd in the Lohan article itself? -- <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackburner001_59e9.html" title="User:Backburner001">backburner001</a> 15:47, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Using the introduction angle at all pushes the envelope of relevance, in my opinion, harder than does the <i>Punk'd</i> reference. As has been noted more than once, the appearance in Lohan's case "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALindsay_Lohan&amp;diff=41099102&amp;oldid=41029006" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALindsay_Lohan&amp;diff=41099102&amp;oldid=41029006" rel="nofollow">does demonstrate her achieving a particular level of celebrity</a>" in an episode that marked "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lindsay_Lohan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41149038" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lindsay_Lohan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41149038" rel="nofollow">a 'rite-of-passage' of sorts</a>". <b>That</b>, in a narrative explaining Lindsay's popular ascent, <b>is its relevance</b>, as it has been from the beginning.

<p>Please don't accuse me of vandalism. That's a highly inflammatory thing to say. Reverting me because you disagree is fine, but justifying your revert by calling it vandalism is just over the top. <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_steamer.html" title="Cleveland steamer">Cleveland steamer</a> has no reliable sources, and no one can be bothered to find any, if they exist. The reason I removed everything but one sentence is because that one sentence was all I believed to be true, and personal belief of veracity is all you have without reliable sources. Urban Dictionary and its ilk are not considered to be reliable. Also, I don't believe that these variations of the Cleveland steamer are anything but private jokes people have put in for fun. How do I know that something like the "Filipino Flipside" is real? I don't, because the article isn't sourced. Therefore, it needs to be removed. I removed the pop culture trivia because it's completely irrelevant and doesn't help in explaining the topic. If you really can't help reverting me, that's fine. If you just want to be rude and sling baseless accusations, I'd thank you to keep them to yourself. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G.

<p>Since you have consistently refused to assume good faith with regard to my actions, I'll just assume that you're a total crank who likes to call people names with no justification. If you'd reverted me and then explained that you think that there should be no editing of the article during the AfD, in spite of the fact that the template says that anyone can continue to edit, I probably would have been okay with that. Instead, you leave two messages on my talk page accusing me of vandalism and bad-faith even though I've explained why I made good edits. Apparently, you'd rather insult me than find reliable sources for these variations on the Cleveland steamer.

Slinging baseless accusations of vandalism is apparently just your special way of making a point and trying to get your way.

<dd>Now that I've had a chance to look at this citation format, I really like this style of creating footnotes. With this style, we should be able to move around text without having to re-organize or footnotes all the time. I'll start working on switching over to this style of footnote notation. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackburner001_59e9.html" title="User:Backburner001">backburner001</a> 21:01, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
