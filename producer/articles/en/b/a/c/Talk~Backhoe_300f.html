<p>I propose merging <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backhoe_fade.html" title="Backhoe fade">Backhoe fade</a> into the main backhoe article. "Backhoe fade" is a narrowly-used neologism. I do think it warrants a mention here, but not its own article. Rather than nominating it for deletion as I was originally going to do, I thought I would suggest a merge first. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 14:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/a/c/Backhoe_fade.html" title="Backhoe fade">Backhoe fade</a> was deleted yesterday as being non-notable, etc. Unfortunately, when the merge was suggested, no {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} banner was added to its page, so it was not obvious that a merge proposal was underway. I have managed to obtain the original page text and have extracted the minimal encyclopaedic content into a new section within <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backhoe.html" title="Backhoe">backhoe</a>. It seems to be a widely-used term in the industry, even if its etymology is 'humorous', and so is worth including here. A suitable cite has been found too.</p>
<p>The page <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backhoe_fade.html" title="Backhoe fade">backhoe fade</a> has been created afresh as a redirect to the new section, since it is linked from elsewhere within WP.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Talk%7EBackhoe_300f.html" title="Edit section: definitive etymology?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">definitive etymology?</span></h2>
<p>As the article says, "Similar attachments for [other vehicles] are still called backhoes even though they are mounted on the front. This is because the name refers to the action of the shovel, not its location on the vehicle; a backhoe digs by drawing earth backwards, rather than lifting it with a forward motion". And personally, I completely agree with this on both points, but I'd like to find some really definitive historical sources explaining how the term arose. (This is for my own curiosity, and perhaps for the Etymology section at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/backhoe" class="extiw" title="wikt:backhoe">wikt:backhoe</a>, not because I'm about to start slapping {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}} tags all over this article. But obviously anything I learn will be fodder for this article.)</p>
<p>My own hunch -- and this is what I'd really like to confirm, if it's true -- is that the term "backhoe" was coined in direct opposition to the older <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_shovel.html" title="Steam shovel">steam shovel</a>. If you look at a picture of a steam shovel, such as <a href="../../../s/h/o/Image%7EShovel1.jpg_567f.html" title="Image:Shovel1.jpg">this one</a> of ours, or <a href="http://www.clevelandwater.com/Historical/baldwin/reservoir/baldwin_resv_const_09.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.clevelandwater.com/Historical/baldwin/reservoir/baldwin_resv_const_09.htm" rel="nofollow">this cute one</a>, or <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Mulligan_and_His_Steam_Shovel_30ac.html" title="Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel">this classic one</a>, you can pretty clearly see that the digging bucket faces up, and that the machine digs by lifting up and away. A backhoe, on the other hand, as we know digs by pulling down and <b>back</b> towards the machine. The fact that you don't see steam shovels -- or anything else with that same, old up-and-away action -- any more makes me suspect that the pull-down-and-towards action has been found to be much more effective. (But it had to await the development of modern <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulics.html" title="Hydraulics">hydraulics</a>, because a cable-hauled backhoe wouldn't work nearly as well.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I suspect that the word "back" in the name "backhoe" was chosen specifically because of the back-towards-the-machine action, which was <b>back</b>wards from the way steam shovels worked. I suspect that the fact that backhoes are often mounted on the backs of tractors is a coincidence which had nothing to do with the term's coinage (though I could be wrong). But the web searches I've done to try to confirm these suspicions have come up dry.</p>
<p>If anyone can dig up any confirmation for any of this (and preferably more definitive than personal armchair speculation, which is all I've really been doing so far), I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>(I've raised the same question at <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_Science_39ae.html#Investigating_the_etymology_of_the_term_Backhoe" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk/Science">Wikipedia:Reference desk/Science</a>, and I'll be checking for answers at both places.) —<a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 00:25, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting discussion, I'm curious too. I have nothing to add though, except that another name for "excavator" is "trackhoe". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.112.143.42_f9a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.112.143.42">71.112.143.42</a> (talk) 02:26, 13 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>The most common backhoes, with a loader on the front, are often called <b>backhoe-loaders</b> Its still common to see tractors with smaller loaders and/or backhoes attached to them, but the common models used by cities and private contractors are pretty uniform in their specifications. I would suggest a specifications section, mentioning how they are all powered hydrologically, are four-wheel drive and have a bucket on the front with a capacity of one cubic yard. Also, perhaps something on usage. Backhoes are the most versatile machine used in construction, since they can dig small pipelines or foundations and load dump trucks efficiently. On any large job though, they are relegated to an all-purpose secondary role since they can't achieve the depth or width of an excavator or the loading speed of a front end loader. --troublefunk--</p>
