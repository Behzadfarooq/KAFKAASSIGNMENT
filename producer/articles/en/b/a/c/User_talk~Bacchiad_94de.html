<p>You keep annotating a link on the wiki-site about Pythagoras as a "modern contemporary occult interpretation". I feel that is not quite true. I assume you've read the link - It uses only ancient sources and archeological finds. Calling it "modern" is very misleading. It gives you the impression that "this link is only loosely connected to ancient Pythagoreanism". Why don't you annotate the other links as "modern contemporary interpretations"? I've visited those links as well, and they present little or no sources and hard evidence for what they say. In other words: they are less historical in their approach. ~August</p>
<p>It's the interpretation that's modern, not the sources. And hey, at least I'm not deleting it; I'm your friend here, August. If you'd like to annotate the other ones as well, be my guest. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 14:48, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Uhmm, okey. =) I might well be to quick on the defensive. Some masons tried to put the info in that article down, masons that happend to be driving forces behind those two other links on the Pythagoras-page! Soo ... I tend to be suspicious. Almost every single page on the internet that claims to deal with Pythagoreanism presents the pentagram as one point up and says it is an ancient sign for four elements plus spirit. That doctrine has nothing that backs it up, and as you can see on the coins niether does their direction of the pentagram as one point up. ~August</p>

<p>In case it's not obvious, "In <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>" is just a stock phrase we use to set context. As an encyclopedia of everything, it's very often the case that people connect via unexpected routes, for instance from obscure beetle genera that happen to have mythological names. It is possible to set context in other ways, but the "In XXX" gets you there with the fewest words, so it's hard to beat for reader efficiency, which is what you want in a reference work. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 07:09, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I noticed that you were removing some of the taxoboxes you earlier created in Greek myth. Unfortunately, you're doing this just as I'm working on a way to improve them. Check out <a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDidactohedron_Greek_myth_2467.html" title="User:Didactohedron/Greek myth">User:Didactohedron/Greek myth</a>. It's a three-tiered tree, of sorts; you should be able to figure it out. Right now I'm making taxoboxes just for the "gods" category; I'll get to the others later. I was planning on making all of the necessary changes to the actual boxes in the template namespace when I was finished making all of the boxes on my own page. Tell me what you think. - <a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDidactohedron_3d31.html" title="User:Didactohedron">Didactohedron</a> 17:35, Jul 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now that is some interesting stuff, sir. The extra tier is the really cool part. Also, don't worry too much about the deletions. I probably should have kept abstractions, but the god-specific ones were teh sux. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 17:50, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't suppose you still have them hidden away somewhere, though? Anything I could use to fill out the Gods category would be useful. At the moment, I've finished expanding that category for the time being, but it looks oddly biased towards particular "themed" gods. It seems to me as if the sections could be organized better, too. If you're still interested in the project, you're welcome to help me recategorize the "Gods" category, and fill out "Mortals" and "Sources" (I think I'm done with "Places"), if you like; you can do it on the page I made. - <a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDidactohedron_3d31.html" title="User:Didactohedron">Didactohedron</a> 18:14, Jul 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you thought about making a greater "world mythology" taxonomy tree? How about some of the mythical animals, like Pegasus and Hyppocampus? I think the taxonomy can improve as more people look at it. There's a book available that has the genealogy of the gods worked out: A Genealogical Chart of Greek Mythology by Harold Newman <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0807827908/ref=pd_bxgy_text_1/104-0624874-4255928?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;st=*" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0807827908/ref=pd_bxgy_text_1/104-0624874-4255928?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;st=*" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It's pricy, might see if a library has it if you're interested. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 20:32, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>My current thinking on boxes is that small is beautiful, both for the boxes themselves and for the hierarchies that underlie them. I think this makes sense from the point of view of both theory and presentation. Hence I like <a href="../../../r/o/m/Template%7ERoman_myth_fb70.html" title="Template:Roman myth">Template:Roman myth</a> (small topic), <a href="../../../g/r/e/Template%7EGreek_myth_%28Olympian%29_e8ba.html" title="Template:Greek myth (Olympian)">Template:Greek myth (Olympian)</a> and Template Greek myth (sea) (small sub-topics). Where a category is relatively discrete, link together articles and link back to the parent topics(s). Where it's not, do not harm. E.g. Should Minos go under "Theseus and the Minotaur Cycle", "Hades" (as a judge), "Early Greek Lawgivers", "Myths of Crete"? Big hierarchies break down: they make sense for small and natural groupings (e.g. the 13-15 Twelve Olympians) but they become nonsense when taken too far. I might try to flesh that out when I come down from this godawful caffeine high, but that's the thrust of my thinking.</p>
<p>In sum, let's make it easy on ourselves. Make the most obvious and easy-to-implement kinds of useful comparison possible (you suggested mythical monsters, which I think is a good idea) rather than building trees for their own sake. When we've played around in the sandbox a little we can evaluate the next step. So far I've got one negative comment on the box ("useless clutter") so we should be careful to grow them slowly and sensibly.</p>
<p>On the genealogy of the Greek gods book: I have to see it. Studying myth is pretty much useless without studying variants; and there are a lot of variants with Greece. It also matters where those variants come from. I'd have to see how it handles this, but my first reaction is extreme skepticism. -- <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 21:46, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the subject of monsters: See <a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDidactohedron_Greek_myth_2467.html#Creatures" title="User:Didactohedron/Greek myth">User:Didactohedron/Greek myth#Creatures</a>. I changed the fourth category in my reworked Greek taxobox tree from "sources" to "creatures", and made individual taxoboxes for several categories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You (Bacchiad) suggest going easy on tree-growing for its own sake; do you think that the way I've reworked the taxoboxes is useful? I'm definately going for a three-tiered tree structure, in order to make it as easy as possible for someone to get from one topic in Greek mythology to another without having a box containing every single topic on every single page. I was going to finish making the reworked taxoboxes on my page, and then implementing them on the real article pages, but I'm now having doubts. To make a good "tree" which would encompass the whole of Greek mythology, I'd have to answer a lot of daunting questions: What subjects are important enough to get their own boxes? Where do I put people associated with all sorts of myths (like Minos)? What happens to people like Heracles who are as important as anyone in the Trojan War, yet don't fit well into any nice category - should there be an "Other heroes" taxobox, or should "Heracles" appear alongside "Trojan War" in the second "teir" of the tree?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More importantly, if we did make a tree which perfectly captures the entirety of Greek myth as it is generally perceived- that is, the "consensus" mythology usually found in popularizations of Greek myths that don't go straight to the primary sources- would this be an aid or a hindrance to understanding? In the former case, I'd be willing to tackle the challenge involved in creating such a tree. The biggest question involved, IMHO, is whether the benefits of having a taxobox tree that lets users easily find whatever Greek mythological subject they might be interested in outweighs the disadvantage of having the tree reinforce the idea, which you rightfully deride, that Greek mythology is a monolithic body of stories, rather than a varied collection of often contradictory tales. -<a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDidactohedron_3d31.html" title="User:Didactohedron">Didactohedron</a> 01:26, Jul 23, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gods fit into discrete categories better than heroes. E.g. Orpheus is an Argonaut but he also has the whole Eurydice thing, not to mention being a legendary seer. The gods have a few overlaps, (Poseidon:sea and Olympian, Mnemosyne Titan and abstraction, etc.) but those are corner cases. I think a two-tiered version of your (really nicely designed) improved boxes can be deployed immediately for gods.</p>
<p>For creatures, I haven't devoted a lot of thought to them.</p>
<p>For places, I think Hades is the only one that the poets described in detail, except maybe for Hyperborea.</p>
<p>For heroes. I'm stumped for something unified. There are a couple of ad hoc things we could do, though, like "Twelve Labors of Heracles", "The House of Atreus" and "Trouble in Thebes". <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 02:17, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your new edits set me thinking. We do have to mention the Thera explosion in this context, even simply to say we can't assess it: vet my text. And I think that the difference between archaic dangers of sea travel and classical and medieval ones are less technological and historical than connected to human dangers like piracy. See my changes. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 23:02, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I liked the first sentence of your addition. I think it brings out much more strongly just exactly how much more anxiety-ridden sea-travel would have been.</p>
<p>On the second sentence, I'm not sure I would have pushed Thera specifically as strongly (I find it unlikely to have been remembered into classical times), <i>but</i> tsunamis did happen in the classical Mediterranean, so it does deserve some mention. I may muck around with the placement and/or phrasing a little later, but I'll leave it alone for now. Thanks — <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 00:43, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, tsunamis are not remembered: the myth and apotropaic ritual that they engender may survive for so long that new explanations for them eventually need to be found. And new perceptions of the wrath of gods may become part of the nature of those gods. I figure there must have been some serious adjustments after the explosion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I doubt Thera was a big deal for the historical is because there <i>were</i> town-destroying tsunamis within living memory. It's in Plutarch or Athenaeus somewhere. Someone forgot to sing the right hymn or something, and then <i>whammo</i>, the whole town's gone. I'll look it up when I get a chance.</dd>

<dd>I read <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Goddess_a19a.html" title="The White Goddess">The White Goddess</a> over the past couple weeks. I have to say that out of flaky pop-universalizing-mythology books, it's by far my favorite. Say what you will about his historical methods, but at least Graves pays attention to all-importance of the <i>poetic form</i> in which myth properly comes. That's more than you can say of many academically respectable scholars. (Burkert among them&#160;;). <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 05:55, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the thing that gets me about Graves' approach to Greek myth. It's not calling Heracles an oak-king, or Kronos a raven-god and saying that every oak- or raven-related figure is ipso facto identical. That's the kind of small time thing that one can let slide. What gets me - and here, I have to add, Graves was following the <i>scholarly consensus</i> of his day - is the idea that "chthonian religion" was some kind of old, weak and helpless thing constantly marginalized and put-upon by "Olympian religion".</dd>
<dd>I don't buy it. First off, the Greeks usually went to almost comically extreme lengths to conserve old cults. If they showed up somewhere and found an old grove of a tree-nymph, they didn't say, "hey, let's bulldoze it and put up a temple of Zeus!" Sure, they'd put a big shiny temple of Zeus next door to it. But you can bet that they offered the nymph a sacrifice every time before they offered Zeus one.</dd>
<dd>Like take Athena and Erechtheus on the acropolis in Athens. Okay, so Athena's an Olympian and yes, she has the bigger temple. But Erectheus - who was half snake and may have engaged in human sacrifice (how's that for pre-Olympian) - got the lion's share of the sacrifices, if archaeology is anything to go on. In the fifth century, the Athenians decided there just <i>wasn't enough chthonic action</i> going on on the Acropolis. So they set up a grotto to Pan and the nymphs, and a hero-shrine to Ion.</dd>
<dd>You pretty much couldn't have an altar to an Olympian without a chthonic shrine right nearby to back it up. The Olympian gods didn't smother the chthonic gods - they held onto them for dear life. Moreover, all of the real innovators in Greek religion - the Orphic poets, Pythagoras, the oracle-mongers, etc. - were busying themselves with (and even inventing) chthonic cults. The Olympian gods were the most hidebound, sclerotic and anemic part of Greek religion. Chthonic cults were constantly innovating and full of vitality.</dd>

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 29% for major edits and 30% for minor edits. (Based on the last 150 major and 150 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>.

<p>There are a lot of good things that bots can be used for. Why are you sicing yours on fellow editors? I don't like the culture of surveillance and conformity that you are promoting. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 17:08, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point. But conformity is not always bad. The absolute majority of people on Wikipedia coform, in the sence that the are not vandals, talk nicely to others, and in general, not surprisingly, all have the same desire, to make Wikipedia, and maybe the world a better place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Edit summaries are a good thing; they may be a burden to you, but help your fellow editors understand what you are up to (and that does matter). Besides, my bot contacts just a tiny fraction of Wikipedia editors, and never anybody more than once. But I do appreciate your comment. You can reply here if you would like to comment further, I will keep your talk page on my watchlist.

<p>Hi! good idea! I added Deleuze's critique. Maybe we could date more precisely the movement in the intro (60's? or better 50-70's? - I think 60's would be more appropriate, although Marcuse wrote his book in 1955, it goes around better with the social movements and it always take a few years for a book to take-off...). On a completely different topic, I'm having a hard-time with one (yes, only one) user on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_revisionism_%28negationism%29.html" title="Historical revisionism (negationism)">historical revisionism (negationism)</a> page. When I first looked at the page it was almost empty, and I thought Wikipedia definitely needed to take a clear stance on this kind of revisionism, lest it become a platform for them. So I added little by little subsections; each one have been fought by the other user. Right now, he insist on deleting the <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> and the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> examples, claiming they are "not representative enough" or whatever...

<p>Hercules is known to be borrowed from Etruscan Hercle and not directly from Greek Herakles because:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have early documentary evidence of the Etruscan form of the name, from mirrors and other art objects produced by the Etruscans. The development from the Greek seen in the form <i>Hercle</i> is consistent with other syncope seen in Etruscan versions of Greek names, e.g. <i>Menelaos</i> → <i>Menle</i>, <i>Apollo</i> → <i>Aplu</i>, <i>Achilleus</i> → <i>Achle</i>, <i>Klutaimestra</i> → <i>Clutmsta</i>.</li>
<li>At the date these objects were produced, the peoples of Latium had close and continuous contact with the Etruscans but not with the Greeks (the closest of whom lived in southern Italy, while the Latin-speakers were confined to a small area around Rome).</li>
<li>We know that the Latin-speakers were aware of the Etruscan form of the name and used it in oaths (e.g. <i>hercle</i>, <i>mehercle</i>).</li>
<li>The form of the name Hercules is easily explained by the Latin habit of inserting a vowel between a consonant and a following liquid or nasal in Etruscan loanwords, e.g. <i>Arnth</i> → <i>Arr<b>u</b>ns</i>, <i>Menrva</i> → <i>Min<b>e</b>rva</i>. It is, however, inconsistent with the typical Latin handling of words borrowed from Greek.</li>
<li>I didn't make this up: see <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2320512" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2320512" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>

As one of the anarcho-cap editors myself, I recognize that you aren't 'one of us,' and that makes it impressive to me the way you were able to give a succinct and fair statement of what our views are and what we think of the leading figures -- the two Friedmans, Rothbard, etc. -- whose writings have helped form them.

<p>Thanks for helping clean-up the quick entry I fired off regarding the Courtroom Workgroup. I understand your deletion of the words leading sentences for readability, but since the courtroom workgroup article is as much an explanation of the academic theory as explication of the theory's content. Barring any negative comment, I plan to add the cannonical concepts back to the article (in a more readable format).</p>
