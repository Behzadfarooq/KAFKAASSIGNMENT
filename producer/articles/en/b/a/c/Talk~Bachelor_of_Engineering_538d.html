<p>'Although some colleges award a Bachelor of Science degree to graduates of engineering study, a Bachelor of Engineering degree is typically given to students who take engineering courses as a majority of their course load'</p>

<p>I have not seen this be the case here in the US. All major universities I looked into offered <i>only</i> BS degrees in Engineering disciplines. Do other have experiences that might be of help?<br />
I think a {Disputed} or {Limitedgeographicscope} might be in order. Anyone concur?<br />

<p>I think that's normal in <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. If it is an engineering course, it is very rare to get BSc/BS. In <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, even there's no BEng but there's MEng. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Engineering_3942.html" title="Master of Engineering">Master of Engineering</a>, in most case, will be awarded only to graduates from 4-year engineering program (bachelor + master). May be this MEng is something like German's Diplom. But I'm not sure about it. -- <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBact_f1de.html" title="User:Bact">Bact</a> 19:06, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Cooper Union (New York, NY) is an ABET accredited school that awards Bachelor of Engineering degrees.

<p>I concur with Mike Graham. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and the majority of my classes were engineering, with just a sprinkling of humanities in there to save my GPA and maintain ABET status. Also, lets not forget the fact that there are some schools who call their degree B.S.E, like The University of Iowa and The University of Michigan. With respect to US Universities I see no difference between a BEng, B.S.E and a B.S.in (Respective Engineering). The only difference is in the name. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.130.131.169 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.130.131.169_4443.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.130.131.169">contribs</a>) 03:24, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Ok, I think this page really needs some sorting out. In engineering in particular, I think there are very different usages from coutry to country (or least geographical area to geographical area). Contrary to the comment above, for example, the UK <i>does</i> award BEng but also BSc; the distribution among Unis is pretty random. The MEng is not a five year course as mentioned in the article (unless it follows a foundation course of 1 year) and nor is it a (bachelor + master) in most Unis. Regrettably, there seem to be many different ways of constructing the Engineering hierarchy. Perhaps, then, for Wikipedia, we should have a Disambig page, with a list of the countries on it. However, there is alredy a page for <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer%27s_degree.html" title="Engineer's degree">Engineer's degrees</a> but these are of a flavour that doesn't really include bachelors or the UK masters. I think my vote is for a Disambiguation page which can also give a link to the <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer%27s_degree.html" title="Engineer's degree">Engineer's degree</a> page. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 18:36, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have found that in England you can do a BEng (3 years) or MEng (4 years). If you opt for the latter, but then decide to graduate in your 3rd year instead, you are awarded a BSc because you do not have sufficent engineering content. - TJ <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.205.8.2.html" title="User:137.205.8.2">137.205.8.2</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/7/User_talk%7E137.205.8.2.html" title="User talk:137.205.8.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.205.8.2_848e.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.205.8.2">contribs</a>) 20:53, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>I am at a school earning a BE. There are only about half a dozen schools in the US that offer BE's. I go to Stevens Institute of Technology. The article is a little confusing abou what it really is. It is a broad engineering curiculum. I need 156 credits to get my under grad, which breaks down to about 18-20 a semester. I take multiple classes in EE, CE, CmE, Navel Eng, Cmath, chem, physics, etc etc. The idea is that it makes a rounded engineer that can not depend on other engineers to fix problems. Good luck finding a school that offers them, its now a choice at stevens not manditory. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.81.191.125 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.81.191.125_f40e.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.81.191.125">contribs</a>) 03:54, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

-- Yeah, but there are also schools that offer BE's while still being specialized.

<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Marine Engineering-Mechanical option from SUNY Maritime College. My final credit total over the course of 4 years was 165 credits. I have to admit there are not many universities or colleges that offer a program quite like a BEng.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we should simply have one list of fields of study, with a heading along the lines of:</p>
<p><i>A Bachelor of Engineering will usually be undertaken in one of these fields:</i></p>
<p>The current separate lists, with one (vaguely) indicating it is for BEng in Germany and the other for BE in India has the potential to explode into a list of lists. For example, I could easily add the Australian list, which I believe includes both BE and BEng depending upon the university... --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAtholM_bb1f.html" title="User:AtholM">Athol Mullen</a> 07:41, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Bachelor of Engineering is abbreviated BE in Australia (possibly BEng in some cases) and is a four-year professional qualification leading to full membership of the Institution of Engineers, Australia. Most practicing professional engineers including myself do not pursue higher degrees in engineering.</p>
<p>In my opinion this page should be a summary of what a Bachelor of Engineering means in each country or part of the world, with a link to a new page for the degree in each of those regions. -- <a href="../../../f/d/a/User%7EFdac_4df6.html" title="User:Fdac">Fdac</a> 06:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
