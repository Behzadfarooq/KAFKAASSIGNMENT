<p>The only part of canada that a Honours degree requires an additional year of study is Ontario. In every other province a major, general or honours degree requires the same number of years of study i.e. 3 years in Quebec or 4 years in R.O.C. (Excluding Ontario. I would also like to note that in the US they do have honours degrees and the distinction is determined typically by completion of a theses in addition to extra course work in the major concentration and/or a higher min GPA, this is ture of Harvard but also McGill and UBC in Canada.

<dd>By the way, in German-speaking countries there is no tradition of Bachelor degrees, but at least in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> they were introduced by law some years ago.

<p>Should the UK degree classification system mention the percentages associated with each degree? They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>70%-100% First Class Honours (1st)[[]]</li>
<li>60%-69% Upper Second Class Honours (2:1)</li>
<li>50%-59% Lower Second Class Honours (2:2)</li>
<li>45%-49% Third Class Honours (3rd)</li>
<li>40%-44% Pass without honours</li>
<li>0%-39% Fail</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there is some variation between universities (mainly the Scottish ones), but the above system is generally used. Furthermore, we might have to explain to our American chums about the low sounding percentages (that a mark in the mid-sixties is actually very good and that marks above 75% are virtually unheard of).</p>
<p>I also think that this school be spun out into a seperate page (UK Bachelor Degree Honours System?), but it would need to be fuller than it is at present, including full details of the (Scottish) variations.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> these designations are almost invariably written with the terminal period. Also, some universities (most notably <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_dd6d.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a>) call their B.S. an S.B. instead (and similarly for <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degree.html" title="Master's degree">Master's degrees</a> with S.M. instead of M.S.). Curiously enough, the doctoral degree Sc.D. or D.Sc., although issued much less frequently by American universities, when it is issued is usally abbreviated with "Sc." rather than just "S." as is used for the lesser degrees. Finally, what's the relationship between this topic and the Diplomate designations I see in some European countries?</p>
<p>(As an aside, MIT probably has one of the most complex degree structures of any US university. In electrical engineering, for example, for increasing terms of study one may receive an S.B. [four years], an M.Eng. [five years], an S.M. [six or seven years], an E.E. [same], and any one of several flavors of doctorate. A former colleague of mine actually got most of those, although it took him the better part of fifteen years to do it, stopping for work along the way.) <a href="../../../1/8/2E/User%7E18.24.0.120.html" title="User:18.24.0.120">18.24.0.120</a> 01:50, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>(presumably, no one wants a B.L.A.)</i></p>
<p>Why not? Because "liberal arts" is not a valid, scholarly discipline? Or is this sort of a joke, that BLA would be pronounced "blah?" People want "B.S.," I don't see how that's any worse than "B.L.A."</p>
<p>In any case, because the degree title is in Latin, the adjective should (not must, but should) come after the noun it modifies. It's an <i>artis liberalis baccalaureate,</i> or a <i>baccalaureate artis liberalis,</i> not a <i>baccalaureate liberalis artis.</i> (Apologies for the inevitable Latin errors; it's been years since I've touched my copy of Wheelock's.)</p>
<p>I'm going to be bold and edit the B.L.A. remark out, as I can't really see any reason for it to be there.</p>

<p>Is it worth mentioning that in practice, these distinctions are largely irrelevant? If you have, say, a bachelor's in computer science, it makes absolutely no difference whether it's a BA, BS, or something else: employers don't care, your peers don't care, and many people might not even know which one it is unless they actually check their diploma. Which people earn is determined almost exclusively by which university they attended; at some, CS is a BA; at others, it's a BS. Which it is has very little correlation to curriculum or anything else besides tradition. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 08:53, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why are the Bachelor degrees in certain countries(The USA, Certain Canadian universities,etc)very broad and contain stuff like general education requirements&#160;? IMHO these are utterly lacking in specialisation, general education should be done with prior to entering an institution of higher learning Kristian Joensen 23:03, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think i's good that in the US (e.g. Princeton) and the UK they have a more liberal approach to education. Even in Scandinavia, the system is modular (even if in a different way). This gives students flexibility. In the EU there are concerns that, with the modular system, students will choose the easy modules, but it is actually harder, you end up having a more difficult degree. In some countries education is too specialised, and you get a degree that is very narrowly focussed - is that the virtue of specialisation? I also think that you only specialise at the Masters level (not to be cynical and say, only at the PhD). The first degree is for trying things out. Interdisciplinarity is as much important as specialisation and, upon entering University education, you face this dilemma, but I am not sure what is the answer.Also, the Humanities and the Social Sciences are different than the natural sciences, and disagreements usually come from the latter category. It is up to the universities to establish strict rules for interdisciplinary degrees, and this is where there is a difference from one uni to another and from one country to another. Besides, taking a few modules instead of many does not mean you do not specialise: the courses that you take are the same (applies only to Full Time degrees). Ultimately, there are always those people whi like specialising and the more liberal ones, it is all a matter of inclinations. Thanks.</p>
<p>I don't understand the relevence of North America in the title of the main peice of text relating to the majority of degrees in the English Speaking world. Most of these degrees (and at least the naming system) originate from England. This would be irrelevant to the article, so perhaps Western Degrees, European Style Degrees, International Standard Degrees, take your pick. North American is incredibly not just incredibly introspective, but it's incorrect.</p>

<p>Why relegate the B.Phil. degree to the bottom of the page? It is renowned and highly respected degree throughout the world, both as an undergraduate degree and a graduate degree. Scholars throughout the world hold it in extraordinarily high regard.</p>
<p>Wikipedians, shall we place it with the more recognisable Bachelor's degrees, rather than let it languish next to highly specialized, relatively obscure degrees (although legitimate degrees, obviously), at the bottom of the page?

<dd>As the holder of a B.Phil. myself, I agree broadly with the claim (though it has to be said that most B.Phil. degrees, especially the newer undergraduate ones, are no more world-renowned than any other degree). Still, the article is primarily about undergraduate degrees; moreover, it's not clear to me that they're ordered by value or prestige. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 08:59, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's somewhat specific to the university and the degree. Sometimes honours is an extra year and extra coursework in the first three years, sometimes honours is a one-year standalone program post-Bachelor, and sometimes it reflects the grade.

<p>Added a counter-example to the claim that almost all US universities offer 'cum laude' recognition.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hardly agree with that statement. At most US universities, one must obtain a 3.5 GPA (out of 4.0) to gain 'cum laude'. Out of nearly 1,000 graduating seniors, I was one of only 150 to obtain any honors of 'cum laude,' 'magna cum laude,' or 'summa cum laude' at my undergraduate institution. Only if there is grade inflation or a superior admissions program with normally weighted grades (no bell curve like at MIT) is there likely to be a majority of honors recipients.</dd>

<p>I'm wondering if we could add a link for the Bachelor of Dental Surgery to this list. I found this link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry#Dentistry_in_India" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry#Dentistry_in_India" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry#Dentistry_in_India</a></p>
<p>The B.D.S. is also conferred in China. I know this because i work with faculty members who were educated there and have this as one of their degrees. Earodrig 20:03, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This addition to a degree title (recorded under US usage, among "cum laude" etc) is unknown to me, a UK citizen, graduate, and adviser in a University. Further, <i>OED</i> does not explain it AT ALL, either with or without fullstops. Could someone explain, please - at least to me, and best, in the article. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacAuslan_a8a4.html" title="User:MacAuslan">MacAuslan</a> 14:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The blatant advertisement for UCTI in the Malaysia section has been removed. Wikipedia is not your college brochure.</p>
