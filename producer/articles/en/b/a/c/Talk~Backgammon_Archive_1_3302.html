<p>A couple of things that should be added/changed in my opinion:</p>
<p>Note that for a long time it has been, and remains, very popular in the Mediteranian and Middle East, often played publicically in bars and cafes - but tin the traditiona form without doubling cube.</p>
<p>Doubling cube was an innovation in the 1920's by American clubs The Cube increases the potential for large profit in money games, and also gives more weight for skill (because it adds the skill of accuratly judging your current chance of winning)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mid-East Popularity</span></h2>
<p>Mentioned the Middle Eastern popularity of the game, also that it is played in three main variants. These are all referred to as 'Tawila' in Arabic, with their own names for each variant so on this basis describing them as variants of backgammon seems more appopriate. Unfortunately I don't know whether these correspond to the Greek variants mentioned in the paragraph beneath my one, and I haven't yet played or found the rules of maghribiyya.</p>
<p>I also added in the British English names for the checkers/men and outfield/outer table at the beginning of the article. --<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> 6 July 2005 15:59 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old Article</span></h2>
<p>Shifted the old article here:</p>
<hr />
<p>The following was originnally from the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica. As such, it may not yet be properly adapted to Wikipedia (obsolete, typos, no accidental links, etc.). It is included as a stub of sorts to inspire you to fix these problems and modify it:</p>
<p>BACKGAMMON, a game played with draughtsmen and a special board, depending on the throw of dice. It is said to have been invented about the 10th century (Strutt). A similar game ‘(Ludus duodecim scriptorum, the “ twelve-line game “) was known to the Romans, and Plato (Republic, bk. x.) alludes to a game in. which dice were thrown and men were placed after due consideration. The etymology of the word “backgammon” is disputed; it is probably Saxon—baec, back, gamen, game; i.e. a game in which the players are liable to be sent back. Other derivations are, Dan. bakke, tray, gainmen, game (Wedgwood); and Welsh bach, little, cammaun, battle, (Henry). Chaucer alludes to a game of</p>
<p>tables,” played with three dice, in which “ men “ were moved from the opponent’s “tables,”~ the game (ludus A nglicorum) being described in the Harleian MSS. (1527). ‘The French name for backgammon is trictrac, imitative of the rattle of the dice.</p>
<p>Backgammon is played by two persons. The “board” (see diagram) is divided into four “ tables,” each table being marked with six “points” coloured differently. The inner and outer tables are separated from each other by a projecting bar. The board (in the ordinary form of the game) is furnished with fifteen white and fifteenblack men,” set “or arranged as in the diagram.</p>
<p>four was called “quatre “ (pronounced “cater”); the five, “cinque” (pronounced either “sank” or “sink”); and the six, “ six “ (size).</p>
<p>For the right to start each player throws one or two dice; the one who throws the higher number has the right of playing first; and he may either adopt the numbers thrown or he may throw again, using both dice.</p>
<p>The men are moved on from point to point, according to the throws of the dice made by ‘the players alternately. White moves from black’s inner table to black’s outer, and from this to white’s outer table, and so on to white’s inner table; and all black’s moves must be in the contrary direction. A player may move any of his men a number of points corresponding to the numbers thrown by him, provided the point to which the move</p>
<p>BLACK would bring him is</p>
<p>Black’s Home or Inner Table. Bfack’s Outer Table, not blocked by two</p>

White’s bar-point, throws five, six, he may move one of his men from the left-hand corner of the black’s inner table to the left-hand corner of black’s outer table for six; he may, again, move the same man five points farther on, when his move is completed; or he may move any other man five points. But white cannot move a man for five from the black’s ace-point, because the six-point in that table is blocked. Any part of the throw which cannot be moved is of no effect, but it is compulsory for a player to move the whole throw unless blocked. Thus if the men were differently placed, and white could move a six, and having done so could not move a five, his move is completed. If, however, by moving the five first, he can afterwards move a six, he must make the move in that manner.</p>
<p>When a player so moves as to place two men on the same point, he is said to “make a point.”</p>
<p>When there is only a single man on a point, it is called a” blot.” When a blot is left, the man there may be taken up (technically the blot may be “hit “) by the adversary if he throws a number which will enable him to place a man on that point. The man hit is placed on the bar, and has to begin again by entering the adversary’s home table again at the next throw should it result in a number that corresponds to an unblocked point. The points in the home tables count for this purpose as I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, beginning from the ace-point. A player is not allowed to move any other man while he has one to enter. It is, therefore, an advantage to have made all the points in your own board, so that your adversary, if you take a man up, cannot enter; and you can then continue throwing until a point is opened.</p>
<p>The game proceeds until one of the players gets all his men into his inner table or home. Then he begins to take his men off the board, or to bear them, i.e. to remove a man from any point that corresponds in number with his throw. If such ,a point is unoccupied, a move must be made, ii there is room for it, and a move may be taken, instead of bearing a man, at any time; but</p>
<p>when six is empty, if’six is thrown a man maybe borne from five and so on. If, after a player has commenced throwing off his men, he should be hit on a blot, he must enter on his adversary’s inner table and must bring the man taken up into his own inner table )efore he can bear further.</p>
<p>Whoever first takes off all his men wins the game:—a single ~ame (a “hit”) if his adversary has begun bearing; a double game (a” gammon “) if the adversary has not borne a man; and i triple game (a” backgammon “) if, at the time the winner bears us last man, his adversary, not having borne a man, has one in :he winner’s inner table, or has a man up. When a series of ~ames is played, the winner of a hit has the first throw in the ;ucceeding game; but if a gammon is won, the players each ;hrow a single die to determine the first move of the next game.</p>
<p>In order to play backgammon well, it is necessary to know all ;he chances on two dice and to apply them in various ways. The uumber of different throws that can be made is thirty-six. By :aking all the combinations of these throws which include given uumbers, it is easily discovered where blots may be left with the east probability of being hit. For example, to find the chance of )eing hit where a blot can only be taken up by an ace, the adversary nay throw two aces, or ace in combination with any other number ip to six, and he may throw each of these in two different ways, so :hat there are in all eleven ways in which an ace may be thrown. This, deducted from thirty-six (the total number of throws), leaves Lwenty-five; so that it i5 25 to II against being hit on an ace. It s very important to bear in mind the chance of being hit on any sumber. The following table gives the odds against being hit on my number within the reach of one or two dice:-—</p>
<p>It is 25 to II, or about 9 to 4, against being hit on I</p>
<p>,, 24 ,, 12, or 2 ,, I, ,, 2</p>
<p>22 ,, 14, or about 3 ,, 2, , ,, 3</p>
<p>21 ,, 15, or 7 ,, 5, ,, 4</p>
<p>,, 21 ,, 15, ,, 7 ,, 5, ,, 5</p>
<p>,, 19 ,, 17, ,, 93/4 ,, 83/4, ,, 6</p>
<p>,, 30 ,, 6, ,, 5 ,, I, ,, 7</p>
<p>,, 30 ,, 6, ,, 5 ,, I, ,, 8</p>
<p>31 ,, 5, or about 6 ,, I, ,, 9</p>
<p>‘ 33 ,, 3, or II ,, I, ,, 10</p>
<p>,, 34 ,, 2,,, 17 ,, I, ,, II</p>
<p>33 ,, 3, ,, II ,, I, ,, 12</p>
<p>The table shows that if a blot must be left within the reach of ~ne die, the nearer it is left to the adversary’s man the less probeDility there is of its being hit. Also, ‘that it is long odds against Jeing hit on a blot which is only to be reached with double dice, fnd that, in that case (on any number from 7 to II), the farther off :he blot is, the less chance there is of its being hit.</p>
<p>The table assumes that the board is open for every possible throw. If part of the throw is blocked by an intervening point being held by idverse men, the chance of being hit is less.</p>
<p>Two principles, then, have to be considered in moving the men :— (i) To make points where there is’ the best chance of obstructing the opponent. (2) When obliged to leave blots, to choose the position in which they are least likely to be hit.</p>
<p>The best points to secure.are the five-point in your own inner Lable and the five-point in your adversary’s inner table. The next best is your own bar-point; and the next best the four in your own inner table.</p>
<p>The best move for some throws at the commencement of a game is as follows :—Aces (the best of all throws), move two on your barpoint and two on your five-point. This throw is often given to inferior players by way of odds.</p>
<p>Ace, trey: make the five-point in your inner table.</p>
<p>Ace, six: make your bar-point.</p>
<p>Deuces: move two on the four-point in your inner table, and two on the trey-point in your opponent’s inner table.</p>
<p>Deuce, four: make the four-point in your own table.</p>
<p>Threes: play two on the five-point in your inner table, and two on the four-point of your adversary’s inner table, or make your bar-</p>
<p>point. -</p>
<p>Trey, five: make the trey-point in your own table.</p>
<p>Trey, six: bring a man from your adversary’s ace-point as far as he will go.</p>
<p>Fours: move on two on the five-point in your adversary’s inner table, and two from the five in his outer table.</p>
<p>Four, five and four, six: carry a man from your adversary’s acepoint as far as he will go.</p>
<p>Fives: move two men from the five in your adversary’s outer table to the trey-point in your inner table. ‘ -</p>
<p>Five, six: move a man from your adversary’s ace-point as far as he will go.</p>
<p>Sixes (the second-best throw): move two on your adversary’s bar-point and two on your own bar-point.</p>
<p>In carrying the men home carry the most distant man to your adversary’s bar-point, to the six-point in your outer table, and then to the six-point in your inner table. By following this rule as nearly</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Max five on a prong</span></h2>
<p>No mention of rule of only allowing five on a prong at the end of each turn. Could this be clarified please? 80.255.219.52 10:32, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no mention of the rule, because there is no such rule. You can have all fifteen checkers on the same point if you want to and the rolls work out that way. Most people play an opening 6-5 from the 24-point to the 13-point, making 6 checkers on a point right from the start. It isn't all that uncommon to see ten checkers piled up on someone's 1-point when they have checkers stuck behind a prime and have to play little rolls that tear up their home board. Anyway, maybe a rules clarification is necessary simply because some house rules differ from the standard of tournament and international play. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 19:45, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The rule of having only 5 men on a point is a known variation, however, it is usually only observed by Egyptians. The International Rules for Backgammon have no such rule.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have also used this rule having been taught it, but hae found that it is not normally played or specified in sets for the reasons above. However, I have found that once people adopt it, they agree that the resulting games are more interesting with such a restriction. I have entered a non POV entry to the article. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDainamo_f808.html" title="User:Dainamo">Dainamo</a> 11:09, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Backgammon is the oldest known recorded game in history !</span></h2>
<p>It is not correct to say that Backgammon is the oldest known recorded game in history. Backgammon is an old tables game as other ones are (Tabula for example).</p>
<p>You should say "tables games" (all games played in a same board than Backgammon) are very ancient. Senet and Game of Ur aren't played in the same board and cannot be compared to Backgammon.</p>
<p>It's like to say football is the oldest sport in the history. No of course it's just a ball game and ball games are very ancient.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you saying that there are other non-board games older than it (how do we know they existed?) or are you saying that we cannot know what game was played on the board, or are you simply claiming that it's not true? <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gadykozma</a> 19:14, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I only say that we cannot know what game was played on the board (except Tabula)and that Backgammon is just one of those games amid a long list of other ones. And Senet, game of Ur, Pachisi ... were not played on the same board than Tabula.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's all what I want to say ! In the same way, Bridge is not the oldest game but card games are very old (not so old than tables games) !</p>
<dl>
<dd>Backgammon is at least 5,000 years old:</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What was the first champion-level backgammon program?</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd><i>Beginning in the late 1980s, creators of backgammon-playing software began to have success with a neural network approach. TD-Gammon, developed by Dr. Gerald Tesauro of IBM, was the first computer program to play at or near the expert level. This program's neural network was trained using Temporal Difference learning applied to data generated from self-play.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought the first champion-level backgammon program was BKG 9.8 by <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Berliner_71dc.html" title="Hans Berliner">Hans Berliner</a>, which used some principles of <a href="../../../f/u/z/Fuzzy_logic.html" title="Fuzzy logic">fuzzy logic</a>. It was finished in 1979, long before the "late 1980s", but it defeated then current champion <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luigi_Villa_fa3c.html" title="Luigi Villa">Luigi Villa</a>, 7-1. It was comparable to Deep Blue against Kasparov. Granted, according to Berliner, Villa made better moves more often, so BKG's victory is owed at least partly to luck, but BKG didn't make any gross errors, certainly no more and no worse than many highly skilled players. - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 20:05, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Frozen after capturing?</span></h2>
<p>When I was taught the game originally as a child, the piece that captured another playerrs blot was prevented from moving again (frozen) on the same go. For example if a 3 and 4 were thrown and the piece captured on 4 it could not use the other 3. I have not seen any refernece to this rule (which made some interesting game play such a sometimes forcing a capturing piece to be left vunerable unless another could cover it) but I doubt it came from nowhere. Has anyone el;se hear of this? <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDainamo_f808.html" title="User:Dainamo">Dainamo</a> 14:53, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the Iranian version of the game this rule exists, but it only applies to hitting a piece within your own home board. One variation on this rule allows this hitting piece to move again, but only if it ends its turn exposed. Hitting pieces in other parts of the board is done as in the "standard" version of the game. Now that I mention this, I should put it in the article at some point. MisterBigH 6:56, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, yes, it's the way my grandma plays it... You are basically not allowed to hit and run to safety in your home.

<p>I've done some edits on this article's page. I found this "variant" and added it to that section. I don't see the difference between it and regular backgammon.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Starting Positions</span></h2>
<p>The article states, "Each player begins with two checkers on his 24-point, three checkers on his 8-point, and five checkers each on his 13-point and his 6-point." Is this correct? I thought it was five checkers on the 24-point, two checkers on the 13-point, five on the 7-point and three on the 5-point. (Basically like the picture at the top of the page, except that the three brown checkers at the upper left should be moved one position to the right.) Can someone confirm?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I (<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdevel_47f4.html" title="User:Bdevel">Bdevel</a>) was the user who uploaded the picture of the board with the pieces in the wrong spot. I have uploaded a new picture with them in the write spot.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In fact, to remove any ambiguity, ideally the article should show a graphical representation of the starting positions, as well as the direction in which each player's checkers move. Thoughts? -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 18:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article is correct, although I can see how confusion about which side of the board the tracks connect on could spawn local variants.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, that reminds me to ask about the starting position of Nackgammon. As the article reads now, Nackgammon <i>adds</i> two checkers for a total of 17 for each player. It seems like that would be a radical change resulting in every game being primed due to the large number of checkers; not very fun. Yet when I was introduced to Nackgammon, it merely <i>moved back</i> two checkers on each side, so that each side still had only 15 checkers total. I believe the checkers were moved back from the two heavy points. Can anyone confirm this?

<dd>I figured out my mistake: I was assuming, looking at the first picture in the article, that white's home board was at the bottom left, so the white checkers move clockwise and thus the point at the top left is the 24-point, when in fact white's checkers move anticlockwise, with the 24-point at the top right, correct? I think the article could definitely use some improvement on this though. As it stands, the initial setup and direction of play isn't very clear. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 18:36, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What do you think would be a more accurate way of putting it?

<dd>Unless we have a good source showing that backgammon, or igo, are older than an other or the oldest I would keep is among the oldest board games played today, as you put it. It may be impossible to know which is the oldest game played today. I have done a slight modification of the conflicting sentence, it is now "Backgammon is one of the oldest board games played today." instead of "Backgammon is one of the oldest known recorded game." The old sentence sounded a bit awkward anyhow. --<a href="../../../a/_/s/User%7EA_Sunshade_Lust_fec1.html" title="User:A Sunshade Lust">A Sunshade Lust</a> 14:18, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry to post anonymously here im still sorting everything out. I would just like to make a point or 2 in relations to backgammoned.net.</dd>
<dd>1. Backgammoned.net is not owned by Gammonempire.</dd>
<dd>2. We are trying to list good articles and provide some valuable information.</dd>
<dd>3. We are new and posted the link anonymously not too spam.sorry therefore but if you are going to make statements about ownership of site(s) please be accurate.</dd>
<dd>4. Yes we mirrored a copy of wikipedia in acordance with guidelines because it was good information for our visitors.</dd>

<dd>Lastly me and a group of friends are truly trying to build a decent backgammon site also we are translating all our articles into different languages for people's benefit. Our site is a work in progress but if the majority opinion is that we dont offer any value to potential backgammon players then dont place our link. I can always be reached at jerry@backgammoned.net for any questions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.134.207.23 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.134.207.23.html" title="User talk:82.134.207.23">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.134.207.23_4447.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.134.207.23">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>As I noted with backgammon.org, I'm not particularly concerned with who owns the site. Mirroring a wikipedia article is fine; just be sure to check <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> to make sure the right notices are in place. I hope that y'all are successful in putting together a good site, but as I said before, I'm just not sure it offers much <i>right now</i> compared to the other links we have, which cover the topic in extensive detail.

<p>I think adding this article to <a href="../../../b/o/a/Category%7EBoard_games_eda0.html" title="Category:Board games">Category:Board games</a> is redundant, as <a href="../../../b/a/c/Category%7EBackgammon_cc9c.html" title="Category:Backgammon">Category:Backgammon</a> is already listed there. A user visiting Category:Board games will see Category:Backgammon easily, and <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backgammon.html" title="Backgammon">Backgammon</a> is space-sortkeyed to the top of that category. Is there another reason that Backgammon should be listed in Category:Board games? <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 05:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, aside from one editor thinking it should and reverting at least three editors who want to properly categorize it. It is appropriate for the article for Backgammon to be listed in the same category as the category for Backgammon because of the "topic article rule" <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_Categories_and_subcategories_2168.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization/Categories and subcategories">Wikipedia:Categorization/Categories and subcategories</a>, however, that category should be <a href="../../../t/a/b/Category%7ETables_games_db95.html" title="Category:Tables games">Category:Tables games</a> which is described as "Tables is a generic name given to a class of board games similar to Backgammon". Listing it in board games is inappropriate given the direct subcategorization of Tables games AND the categorization of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Category%7EBackgammon_cc9c.html" title="Category:Backgammon">Category:Backgammon</a> -- which it should be obvious to everyone else is the category that people will look for this article. Much of the Board games categorization is problematic and will only get worse if taken to the (il)logical conclusion of listing this article in <a href="../../../t/a/b/Category%7ETabletop_games_f824.html" title="Category:Tabletop games">Category:Tabletop_games</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/m/Category%7EGames_ee1c.html" title="Category:Games">Category:Games</a>. If the editor wants to eliminate the Tables games category then there is a process for that, but listing this article in any category it can fit in is absurd and counter to the categorization guidelines. Again, the proper categorization is for the backgammon category and article to both be listed in Tables games. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 05:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand the concerns about excessive duplication of categories, and I think they're valid. I'm not sure what to do in this case, because <a href="../../../t/a/b/Category%7ETables_games_db95.html" title="Category:Tables games">Category:Tables games</a> almost certainly doesn't help anyone using categories to navigate when they're looking in <a href="../../../b/o/a/Category%7EBoard_games_eda0.html" title="Category:Board games">Category:Board games</a> for articles on Backgammon. Since the overwhelmingly predominant discussion of tables games today is as ancestors, relatives, or variants, but with the primary focus on backgammon, perhaps the best categorization would be to make Category:Tables a subcategory of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Category%7EBackgammon_cc9c.html" title="Category:Backgammon">Category:Backgammon</a>, and put Category:Backgammon in Category:Board games. This solves the navigation problem and avoids duplication.

<dd>This certainly would solve everything, but I'm totally unfamiliar with what "tables games" are or meant to be. If <a href="../../../t/a/b/Category%7ETables_games_db95.html" title="Category:Tables games">Category:Tables games</a> can at all plausibly be made a subcategory of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Category%7EBackgammon_cc9c.html" title="Category:Backgammon">Category:Backgammon</a> that would solve everything... as would simply renaming <a href="../../../t/a/b/Category%7ETables_games_db95.html" title="Category:Tables games">Category:Tables games</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/c/Category%7EBackgammon_cc9c.html" title="Category:Backgammon">Category:Backgammon</a>, but again I don't know how related or unrelated those other articles are to "backgammon" as opposed to tables games. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 06:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s>Tables games are, in short, games played on a backgammon board. A few centures ago the term referred to pretty much any board game (including, e.g., chess and draughts), but today I would say that "tables game" and "backgammon variant" are essentially interchangeable. I'm not sure if there is a sufficient distinction between a backgammon category and a tables category to have both. But I don't think this should be decided on my assessment alone. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 07:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>
<dd>A comment left today at the talk page of the Backgammon variant article has changed my mind. I think it would be a misnomer to use backgammon as the supercategory for a lot of games that can't legitimately be described as backgammon variants. I merged the variants article into <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tables_%28board_game%29.html" title="Tables (board game)">Tables (board game)</a>, and I think the proper categorization is Board games-&gt;Tables (board game)-&gt;Backgammon (cat)-&gt;Backgammon (article). <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 13:50, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The criteria for external links isn't clear, for example - the added value link of www.play65.us, Live web-based backgammon game, rules and tournaments, was deleted 5 minutes upon writing while affiliate sites of the game remain in the main page for months... where is the logic?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The logic starts with deleting links crudely dropped like you did with "Online Internet Backgammon" anchor text. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 09:09, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The external links section is meant to include sites which offer a significant amount of <i>information</i> about the game over what the article offers. The affiliate status of sites listed here is not a significant consideration. The links at this article should point to resources with information about backgammon.

<dd>It's fine. The chess article has even a separate page (sub-page) for the sample game. Several pages do similarly (eg keys to become a good player, strategies and tactics etc.). As long as the main article is not largely created for instructions or the like, it is fine. I think what is important is the <b>main purpose</b> of the article or section. The sample game is here to help readers to understand more about backgammon (eg gameplay, the flow of the game) by illustrations. It is fine and great. However if someone makes up a whole page focussing on teaching readers like how to play the game, how to win the game etc., it is not fine.--<a href="../../../w/a/i/User%7EWai_Wai_0f76.html" title="User:Wai Wai">Wai Wai</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/i/User_talk%7EWai_Wai_272c.html" title="User talk:Wai Wai">talk</a>) 11:07, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Sample chess game has a {{tone}} at the top right now, and I'd have to say I agree with the tag. It's difficult to write <i>subjective</i> commentary on a game while still remaining <i><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a></i>, and the value of a sample backgammon game depends almost entirely on subjective commentary — otherwise it's just going to be a list of forced moves and rollout results, which would be pretty boring and not very useful. I'm also concerned that a sample game could never avoid being <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 20:11, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm not going to say we should make a whole page just for that. I would like to point out is the <b>main purpose</b> of that secton. If it is to enrich people's understanding about the topic, it is fine. Normally information in an article may have overlapping uses or purposes, but it should be the main purposess is important. Take the case of <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_trading.html" title="Day trading">day trading</a> into account, there is a section which states about keys of being a good daytrader. If you take this out of the context, it is like an instruction or a guide and is not suitable for Wikipedia. If you look further, its main purpose is to explain the characterisitics of a successful day trader (so readers will know more what a successful day trader is about). There is no really step-by-step guide on how to daytrade. Anyway, it is up to you t decide if this secton will benefit the readers (but I think you have made up your mind)--<a href="../../../w/a/i/User%7EWai_Wai_0f76.html" title="User:Wai Wai">Wai Wai</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/i/User_talk%7EWai_Wai_272c.html" title="User talk:Wai Wai">talk</a>) 08:10, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
