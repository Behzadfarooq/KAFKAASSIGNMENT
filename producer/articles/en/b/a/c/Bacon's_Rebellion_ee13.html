<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacon%27s_Rebellion_ee13.html" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot</span></h2>
<p>By the end of the seventeenth century in the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_Bay_70ed.html" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake</a>, the elite farmers on the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> coast, called the "<a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidewater_region_of_Virginia_630c.html" title="Tidewater region of Virginia">tidewater</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentry.html" title="Gentry">gentry</a>," owned much of the best farmland in the area and exercised a level of political power disproportionate to their numbers, to the discontent of the majority of the population, who were small farmers, indentured servants, and slaves. Small farmers, being unable to afford the best lands, were drawn to the backcountry lands that were vulnerable to <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">American Indian</a> attacks. Backcountry farmers also had difficulty transporting their goods to markets. <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">Taxes</a> were high, especially on <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> after 1660. The <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Virginia_7937.html" title="Governor of Virginia">colonial governor</a> of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Berkeley_9cdc.html" title="William Berkeley">Sir William Berkeley</a>, had levied a new tax for the construction of defense forts, but there was widespread complaint about governmental corruption and the uselessness of the forts.</p>
<p>Bacon had broad support among the colonists and demanded a commission to raise a militia and fight the Indians. After much political haggling, Bacon was granted the commission and led a campaign against some of the Indians of the frontier. After returning to Jamestown, conflicts arose between Bacon and Berkeley, and their followers. The so-called Baconites overpowered the Berkeley faction and the governor then fled to the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Shore_35e0.html" title="Eastern Shore">Eastern Shore</a>. Bacon's followers ravaged the capital for three months, destroying the symbols of the aristocratic gentry and seizing property. A volunteer army was raised, somewhat in the image of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Model_Army_f4c0.html" title="New Model Army">New Model Army</a> of the recent <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>. The Baconites plundered Tidewater estates whose owners refused to join them. Few Virginians were able to remain neutral.</p>
<p>A revolutionary government was established, echoing in many ways the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_England_2192.html" title="Commonwealth of England">Commonwealth of England</a>, which had ended only 16 years earlier. Bacon died on October 26, 1676, succumbing to the "bloody flux" or dysentery. The rebellion continued without his leadership until several well-armed London-based merchant ships arrived in Virginia, loyal to Berkeley. These were trading ships whose captains were not aware of the rebellion until they arrived. A fleet of the Royal Navy set sail for Virginia upon hearing of the rebellion, but would not arrive until several months after the merchant ships. With these merchant ships, their cannon, and their crews, Berkeley was able to put down the rebellion. In the aftermath, before the arrival of the Royal Navy, Berkeley tried and executed many rebels in what began to resemble a reign of terror. When the Royal Navy and Royal Commissioners arrived, Berkeley's revenge campaign was halted and mass pardons were issued. A significant number of rebels fled to the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albemarle_Settlements_91b5.html" title="Albemarle Settlements">Albemarle Settlements</a> of North Carolina.</p>
<p><a name="Causes" id="Causes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacon%27s_Rebellion_ee13.html" title="Edit section: Causes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Causes</span></h2>
<p>Nathaniel Bacon's Rebellion can be attributed to several causes, all of which led to unrest in the Virginia colony. Economic problems, such as declining tobacco prices, growing commercial competition from Maryland and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolinas.html" title="Carolinas">Carolinas</a>, an increasingly restricted English market, and the rising prices from English manufactured goods (<a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercantilism.html" title="Mercantilism">mercantilism</a>) caused problems for the Virginians. There were many problems caused by weather. Several <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_disaster.html" title="Natural disaster">natural disasters</a>, including <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hailstorm.html" title="Hailstorm">hailstorms</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floods.html" title="Floods">floods</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drought.html" title="Drought">drought</a>, and <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane.html" title="Hurricane">hurricanes</a> rocked the colony in the course of a year. In addition, Virginia had become a haven for both <a href="../../../r/o/u/Roundhead.html" title="Roundhead">Roundheads</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalier.html" title="Cavalier">Cavaliers</a> during the English Civil War. In some ways, Bacon's Rebellion was an echo of the English Civil War. The revolutionary government established by the Baconites had clear ties to the republican Commonwealth of England.</p>
<p>In July 1675, a raid by the Doeg group of American Indians on the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a> of Thomas Mathew, located in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Neck_f665.html" title="Northern Neck">Northern Neck</a> section of Virginia near the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potomac_River_3eff.html" title="Potomac River">Potomac River</a> occurred. Several of the Doegs were killed in the raid, which began in a dispute over the nonpayment of some items Mathews had apparently obtained from the tribe. The situation became critical when, in a retaliatory strike by the colonists, they attacked the wrong tribe, the powerful <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susquehannock.html" title="Susquehannock">Susquehannocks</a>, which caused large-scale Indian raids to begin.</p>
<p>Berkeley ordered an investigation into the reasons for the attacks, during which he pleaded for restraint on all sides, but many Virginians claimed that Berkeley had monopolized the Indian trade and was making large profits from the Indians, and so found his call for restraint insincere. Nathaniel Bacon, disregarded the Governor's direct orders by seizing some friendly <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appomattox.html" title="Appomattox">Appomattox</a> natives on a charge of stealing <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maize.html" title="Maize">corn</a>; he was reprimanded and his fellow farmers were aggrieved at this seemingly one-sided action. In attempting to find a compromise, the governor called what was known as the <b>Long Assembly</b> which declared war on all the "bad Indians" by setting up a strong defensive zone around the state. In order to do this, higher taxes were raised, to the disgust of the frontiersmen, who were already overtaxed. There was a strong feeling among the middle and lower classes that "favored traders" were allowed to trade with the Indians at the expense of regular traders who had dealt with the Indians for Generations.</p>
<p>In all of this, Bacon came out as leader of those most in opposition to the policies being pursued by Berkeley, and he became the elected "<a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">general</a>" of a group of local volunteer Indian fighters, having promised to bear the cost of the campaigns. During the campaign against the Indians, the governor nonetheless declared Bacon as a rebel.</p>
<p><a name="Bacon_and_the_House_of_Burgesses" id="Bacon_and_the_House_of_Burgesses"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacon%27s_Rebellion_ee13.html" title="Edit section: Bacon and the House of Burgesses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bacon and the House of Burgesses</span></h2>
<p>Bacon and his men continued to launch attacks on the tribes. Since Bacon's forces outnumbered Berkeley's, the governor was forced into agreeing to issue a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pardon.html" title="Pardon">pardon</a> if Bacon turned himself in, to be then sent to England for trial before King <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II of England</a>. Many of the members of the House of Burgesses were sympathetic to Bacon's cause, which led to his being elected as a member of the House.</p>
<p>Bacon, by virtue of this election, attended the important <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_6fbc.html" title="Legislative Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> of June 1676, at which time he was made to apologize for his previous actions. Berkeley immediately pardoned Bacon and allowed him to take his seat in the assembly. By this time, Bacon and his followers were pushing for more than defense against the Indians. They were demanding major reforms to the colonial government. Matters came to a head when, during a debate on the Indian situation, Bacon and his men surrounded the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_State_Capitol_8226.html" title="Virginia State Capitol">capitol building</a> in <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamestown%2C_Virginia_0455.html" title="Jamestown, Virginia">Jamestown</a>, and forced the Governor to give in to Bacon's demands for campaigns against the Indians without government interference. This concession, too, was short-lived, and, when Berkeley reneged on the commission, the rebels took over Jamestown, if only for a brief period, between July 30 (when Bacon issued his <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_the_People_of_Virginia_b4ca.html" title="Declaration of the People of Virginia">Declaration of the People of Virginia</a>) and September 1676.</p>
<p>When Berkeley returned to recapture the town, aided by well-armed London-based merchant ships, Bacon burned it to the ground. For a short period of time Nathaniel Bacon was in charge of Virginia. But his success quickly ended. On October 26th, 1676, Bacon abruptly died of the "Bloodie Flux" and "Lousey Disease" (body lice). It is thought that his soldiers burned his body because it was never found. Some of the rebels were executed or had their property confiscated. After the Royal Navy and Royal Commissioners arrived, the rebels were allowed to express their grievances and mass pardons were issued. The commissioners realized that the majority of Virginians had supported the rebellion. For the colony of Virginia to survive, compromises had to be made. Berkeley himself was relieved of the governorship by the Royal Commissioners. He died in England on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">July 9</a>, 1677.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacon%27s_Rebellion_ee13.html" title="Edit section: Effects of the Rebellion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Effects of the Rebellion</span></h2>
<p>Bacon's Rebellion was the result of discontent among backcountry farmers who had taken the law into their own hands in the face of governmental corruption and oppression. Many if not most Virginians were debtors. Borrowing on the strength of paper money was stopped by the British Government, leading to more discontent against the merchant classes. A large portion of the supporters of the rebellion were indentured servants and slaves, who made up a majority of Virginia's population.</p>
<p>Historian Helen Hill Miller has pointed out that one of the most important reforms made during Bacon's government was the recognition of the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_to_bear_arms.html" title="Right to bear arms">right to bear arms</a>, so that the common man could defend himself from hostile Indians, but also so that he may oppose a despotic regime. After Berkeley's resumption of power, this right was one of the first he repealed. Miller suggests it was Bacon's Rebellion that may have served as one of the major motivations for later colonists' intense appreciation of the right to bear arms. Historian Stephen Saunders Webb goes so far as to suggest that Bacon's Rebellion was a revolution, with roots in the English Civil War and with consequences including the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>.</p>
<p>It was largely the slaves, servants, and poor farmers, many of whom were former indentured servants, who rebelled. Before the rebellion, African slaves were relatively rare in Virginia, mainly due to their expense and the lack of slave traders bringing Africans to Virginia. Many Africans were brought as indentured servants, becoming free after serving their term of labor. While indentured servants from Europe continued to play a role in Virginia after the rebellion, African slave imports grew rapidly and new laws made slavery lifelong and passed on to one's children, creating a racially-based class system with Africans at the bottom and even the poorest European indentured servants above. This effectively broke the common interests that had been shared between the poor English and the Africans of Virginia during Bacon's Rebellion.</p>
<p>The rebellion strengthened the existing ties between Virginia south of the James River and the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albemarle_Settlements_91b5.html" title="Albemarle Settlements">Albemarle Settlements</a> in present-day <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, while simultaneously creating a long-lasting animosity between the two colonies' governments. The Albemarle region offered refuge for rebels in the immediate aftermath. In the longer term, North Carolina offered an alternative to colonists disenchanted with Virginia.</p>
