<p>I remember seeing this movie when it was out in theatres and I liked it and thought it had a good plot, but I asked someone else who saw it and they thought it was like watching a re-run of the first Back to the future, the whole plot with them going back to 1955 to undo what the old Biff did, what do you think? After hearing that, I thought, Yes, they could have spent more time in 2015, I thought that was the most interesting part and that they should have focused more on it.</p>
<p>I wouldn't agree with that. Act one was set in 2015, act two was set in 1985A and act three was set in 1955 but from a different perspective. Template:Steve 17:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This doesn't really seem to be a plot hole to me. It could be explained away by saying that Doc wanted to get to Marty as soon as possible since he knew he would get in the car wreck with the Rolls-Royce the next day, and once he had arrived in 1985, he was justifiably paranoid about somebody seeing the time machine and thus wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstewart_4c12.html" title="User:Istewart">istewart</a> 07:43, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also why did Doc say, "Damn I'm late!" in 2015 before he left Marty. He was in a time machine...</p>

<p>'*Considering the nature of the first half of the second film, Marty preventing his son being arrested and thrown into jail; everything beyond that point could likely be considered a paradox.</p>
<p>Had Marty not needed to fix future history so his kids didn't get arrested, he and Doc wouldn't have needed to go into the future which would allow 2015 Biff Tannen the opporunity to steal the Delorean and the almanac. If he never stole the book and the car, Doc and Marty would never have had to travel back to 1955 to collect the book and the delorean would never have been struck by lightning, sending Doc back to 1885 and the end result would have nullified the two sequels.'</p>
<p>I realise this can technically count as 'original research'... but is there any way this can be formatted so it could actually work in the goof section as I believe there is a point.</p>
<p>Just so nobody has to ask, I authored that piece but didn't post it as I wanted to see if it could be appropriate to Wiki standards<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingpin1055_d40b.html" title="User:Kingpin1055">Kingpin1055</a> 23:19, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see what you are saying, but the paradox you describe is only relevant if the changed event happened in the past, thus altering the mindset in the present of those that changed it. Since the event they changed was in the future, it's plausible that they changed it and still had a memory of the original events happening, causing no paradox. My opinion, anyway. <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcflytrap_3656.html" title="User:Mcflytrap">Mcflytrap</a> 20:51, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Something that always bothered me as a kid that I didn't see addressed here. For a brief time at the end of part 1 there are two Marty's in 1985. One heads back to 1955. Then in part 2, the other heads to 2015. So from 1985 to 2015 there aren't any Marty's left. Who was it that had kids and grew old?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I always thought that when Marty returned to 1985 at the end of Part I, he returned the day <b>after</b> he initially left. I could be wrong, have to rewatch it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that's part of the problem started by the second film. But if you had to look at it within the context of the trilogy, I'd say 2015 Marty is almost the same one who nearly got involved in the car accident in 1985.</dd>

<p>But the whole 'future isn't fixed' thing comes into play...<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingpin1055_d40b.html" title="User:Kingpin1055">Kingpin1055</a> 10:48, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You do have a point, but since time travel isn't possible at the moment, we'll never really know how it works. Technically, if I were to travel to the future right now, would there be a me that lived during that time I skipped? You can say yes because I would have eventually travelled back to the present and lived the rest of my life, or you can say no like you mentioned above. Time travel movies always have these weird situations that no one can really say if its an error or not. <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcflytrap_3656.html" title="User:Mcflytrap">Mcflytrap</a> 20:54, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added to the trivia section, the scene where you see Clint Eastwood use the metal sheet, and Biff watches it. My guess is that its The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but can someone verify this for me. --Fullforce 23:40, 18 October 2006 (UTC)-</p>

<dd>More importantly, Fox's role was simply much more important to the film. He was the star, and Glover was a supporting player.<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymondluxuryacht_dffe.html" title="User:Raymondluxuryacht">Raymondluxuryacht</a> 08:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I sought out this article to learn the name of the actress that plays Marty's and Jennifer's daughter in 2015, but to no avail. Is that 'Marlene McFly', played by Michael Fox? <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruceHallman_9787.html" title="User:BruceHallman">BruceHallman</a> 23:58, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>69.41.106.114 02:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)"Upon arriving in 2015 and landing in the alleyway, Doc tells Marty the rain will end in 5 seconds, he then says, "Too bad the postal service isn't as reliable", luckily for him they are quite reliable having held a letter for 70 years and delivering it at such a strange hour."</p>
<p>Where it commends the postal service being reliable, that is incorrect. First, the postal service he talked about being unreliable was in the future, as the letter was delivered in 1955. And second, the letter was delivered by western union in 1955, not the postal service.</p>

<p>in the last trivia entry, it says:</p>
<ul>
<li>When Doc and Marty go back to 1955, there are 4 DeLoreans at that particular time, the one from the first time travel, the one old Biff used to get back from 2015, the one Doc and Marty have and the one stored in a mine, which appears in Back To The Future Part III.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think there would only be three, because the one that doc stored in the mine doesnt get there until doc goes into the past. right now, i'm changing the number to three. i will gladly change if back if someone can come up with a better explanation on how the fourth one got there. 19:56, 8 March 2007 <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_mitten_man_0c85.html" title="User:The mitten man">The mitten man</a></p>
