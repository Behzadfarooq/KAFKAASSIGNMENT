<p>I am a little confused here. It seems that there are different definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jargon-file style: a word interpreted as an acronym, though it was not originally intended.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>word-like acronym: an acronym that interpreted as a word has some (funny) meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of the jargon-file style are: acme, mung.</p>
<p>Examples of word-like acronym: basic, mad, atlas (an experiment at Cern).</p>
<p>This article initially had the jargon-file definition (the only one I knew), and somehow it has now switched to that other meaning (that I had never called "backronym"), while still having parts that imply the first meaning. What's going on? Where did you see that called "backronym"? - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordi_Burguet_Castell_5ff0.html" title="User:Jordi Burguet Castell">jbc</a> May 28 09:15 UTC 2003</p>
<dl>
<dd>The entry on apronym seems to describe the latter style, where the acronym was created first (as in <i>USA PATRIOT</i>) and the words that it would stand for were chosen second. So perhaps that's where references to the second definition should be moved. -- <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArteitle_8e78.html" title="User:Arteitle">Arteitle</a> 09:34 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Upon closer inspection, it looks like apronyms are meant as lighthearted jokes, though they're created in the same way as the "word-like acronym" style you mentioned. -- <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArteitle_8e78.html" title="User:Arteitle">Arteitle</a> 09:38 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd say that an apronym can be either jocular or quite serious. The ones at apronyms.com are largely jocular, but "USA PATRIOT" is a serious apronym if you ask me. So I'd be all for moving it and the others that aren't really backronyms so much as apronyms to apronym. In fact, I think I'll investigate into a means of doing such, if it's conveniently possible. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffTL_9c74.html" title="User:JeffTL">JeffTL</a> 16:27 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Essentially, it seems to me that apronymns are wordplay (i.e. they are deliberately designed to reflect the world they form), while backronyms actually stand for something in the real world (i.e., they abbreviate something else). Which isn't to say that the two categories can't overlap, as in "USA PATRIOT". But the Algebra I "FOIL" (first, outer, inner, last) would be a backronym, but not a apronym (because it has nothing to do with foils), and the SADDAM (Savage Arab Dictator, Dangerous And Murderous), while, although it may be true and an apronym, is not a backronym because nobody would ever use "SADDAM" to abbreviate "Savage.... Murderous" in real life. Does anybody else also parse the two this way? <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 17:53, 23 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I'd call "FOIL" a <a href="../../../m/n/e/Mnemonic.html" title="Mnemonic">mnemonic</a>, rather than a backronym, since "first, outer, inner, last" in some combination was known first, and the acronym was derived from that so as to be a memorable word, but as you pointed out, not an "appropriate" one (since algebra and "foil" aren't related). I'd call "SADDAM" a backronym, since it was formed "backwards", as wordplay, starting with the name "Saddam" and thinking up words that it could potentially stand for. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArteitle_8e78.html" title="User:Arteitle">Arteitle</a> 23:50, Mar 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>So why were BASIC, ZIP, USA PATRIOT removed from the list of backronyms? So far as I can tell, they are... - <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 06:44, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to the definition currently included, BASIC and USA PATRIOT are most definitely <i>not</i> backronyms - they are simply acronyms designed to spell out an appropriate existing term. In fact, this is closer to the definition currently listed under apronym (although that article then wrongly suggests that BASIC is a backronym, when as far as I know it was always officially an acronym).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I notice that you've taken out the link to apronym, calling it an "invented word" - in what way is 'backronym' not invented? Surely both are <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologisms</a> intended to mean slightly different things (by the way, both get just over 10000 hits on a Google search). While a large amount of clarification is clearly needed, the overlap surely necessitates <i>more</i> cross-referencing between the two articles, not less.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Either</b> we decide on a definition for each, describe it more fully than either does at the moment, and add a prominent note on the occasional intrerchangability - eg: apronym=any acronym whose meaning as a word is apt to its meaning as a phrase (eg. BASIC); backronym=specifically those acronyms [and they would normally be apronyms] that expand terms <i>not intended as acronyms</i> (which are often humourous, like Fix Or Repair Daily). <b>Or</b> we decide that there is no clear seperation between the two words, and cover them in one article with the other as a redirect. I will wait and see if anyone has any strong feelings on the matter before acting.</dd>

<dd>Ok, let me comment on <i>apronym</i>. The entry in wikipedia was created by <i>202.89.128.87</i>, who also included the reference to it in this article. Nothing wrong with that. But, have you seen the apronym article? It's like just a big propaganda for <a href="http://www.apronyms.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.apronyms.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apronyms.com/</a>&#160;! And there, they define it as <i>a special kind of acronym where the initials spell out a word or phrase relevant to the expanded version</i>, which is indeed very common for acronyms (not big deal, I can invent acronym-like things too). Sure, both <i>backronym</i> and <i>apronym</i> are neologisms, but I do have heard about backronyms before, and they are quite different from acronyms to deserve their name (imho), but I've never heard of apronyms and there is a guy with a web site (making money/fame from it?) "inventing" this word and having the entry in wikipedia like a neon panel to the website... I dunno, made me suspicious/reticent.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, if I am the only one with this feeling or it's a common word or anything, I am not against including a reference to it here (more the contrary). I am just worried of including crap, but surely I may be wrong. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordi_Burguet_Castell_5ff0.html" title="User:Jordi Burguet Castell">jbc</a> 20:34, Jan 13 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your reticence, jbc - certainly the article needs rewriting to eliminate the advertising-like stance. In fact, a more thorough investigation of those Google results shows that <i>apronym</i> has only a handful of distinct hits, whereas <i>backronym</i> seems genuinely well-established. Perhaps the whole article could be deleted in favour of mentions under <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronym</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backronym.html" title="Backronym">backronym</a> - or is it worth keeping as a stub? Certainly, it has a subtly different meaning to <i>backronym</i>, but is it too new to be worthy of mention? - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 22:11, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Here's how I see the difference: An <i>apronym</i> is an acronym designed to spell something out, and fitting that "something." -- e.g. "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism" intentionally was designed to spell "USA Patriot" and refers to...well..the Patriot Act. Apronyms are common for proper nouns of organizations, laws, etc. They are (as demonstrated at the one website, where I must disclaim I have some contributions) also relatively common as a form of wordplay. A backronym is an unintended prepresentation, often similar to what can be called an apronym, for lack of a better specific term. An example of a backronym is "Beginners' Allpurpose Symbolic Instruction Code" for the BASIC programming language. The pop-culture belief is that the name of said language is an apronym; rather, it is closer to a backronym, as it was retroactively created as a believed apronymic exansion -- apronymic because "Beginners' Allpurpose Symbolic Instruction Code" does indeed describe Basic, which is often written in all capitals (suggesting an acronym of some sort). There is a clear difference between an "apropos acronym" and a "back-formed acronym." <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffTL_9c74.html" title="User:JeffTL">Jeff Anonymous</a> 04:23, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just for the record, I we should all stop using BASIC as an example, because it is very much unclear whether it <i>was</i> originally intended as an acronym. More generally, the problem is that the humourous <i>apronyms</i> on the website are of course also <i>backronyms</i> (since they are taking existing terms and turning them into acronyms); and, indeed, most <i>backronyms</i> are also <i>apronyms</i> (since if it's not an appropriate expansion of the term, in what sense can it have the same meaning?). So we could perhaps define an apronym as any acronym that forms a word appropriate to its meaning; and a backronym as any acronym (or <a href="../../../i/n/i/Initialism.html" title="Initialism">initialism</a>, for those who insist) that was created from an existing term that was not originally created as one - and then note that most examples of one are also examples of the other. - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 12:37, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those seem to be the best definitions. If the acronym is a real word and the expansion is appropriate to that, it is an apronym. If it is <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a>, it is a backronym (which, as an <i>ex post facto</i> acronym, can be an apronym). <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffTL_9c74.html" title="User:JeffTL">Jeff Anonymous</a> 18:36, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. These definitions sound good to me. So to restate them, an apronym (apropos acronym) is a multiword term or name (such as for a law, agency, etc.) with words deliberately chosen so that the resulting acronym will spell out something apropriate (e.g. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_act.html" title="Patriot act">USA PATRIOT</a>), while a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backronym.html" title="Backronym">backronym</a> is a (usually humorous, usually unofficial) set of words derived after-the-fact by interpreting something that wasn't originally an acronym as one (e.g. FORD = Fix Or Repair Daily). However, this definition disagrees with most of the examples given at apronym right now, and with the definition there (which refers to coining thousands of apronyms as wordplay). --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArteitle_8e78.html" title="User:Arteitle">Arteitle</a> 22:26, Mar 20, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Your example of FORD would be an apronym of the humorous type, as the person who wrote it must have had a broken-down Ford. Backronym implies linguistic back fomation, as noted at Jargon File. If something seriously becomes acronymic after the fact, such as BASIC basically has (It is the canonical example because it is the best known example), to the point that everyone believes it is an acronym, is is a backronym by means of reification. Most are also apronyms -- a case of overlapping sets. An apronym can be thought of as any acronym appropriate to the expansion, often jocular but they can also be serious. A point could be made that most of the apronyms.com collection are backronyms by certain definitions (albeit not a definition of a reified acronym, which seems to be the current accepted definition). Noone actually believes that AA batteries stand for "Always Alkaline," but if that became believed in a widespread way it would be a clear backronym, despite its origins as a humoristic apronymic expansion. Not all apronyms are backronyms, and not all backronyms are apronyms. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffTL_9c74.html" title="User:JeffTL">Jeff Anonymous</a> 06:31, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

backronym n. [portmanteau of back + acronym] A word interpreted as an acronym that was not originally so intended. Examples are given under BASIC, recursive acronym (Cygnus), Acme, and mung. Discovering backronyms is a common form of wordplay among hackers.<br />
As well as this there are about twenty other in Yahoo Search alone which all read the same. My contention was that we can do better than copying articles from other websites and can create our own.

<p>It seems to me that there ought to be some distinction between genuine or official backronyms (such as <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl.html" title="Perl">Perl</a>) and those that are just invented for humorous purposes. I don't know if there's another term for joke-acronyms like Fix Or Repair Daily, Need Another Seven Astronauts, etc. or if there's even a reliable way to differentiate them from those which may have originally been jokes, but were adopted in some official capacity. For whatever reason, I don't think that words which <i>were</i> originally acronyms (including most of the ones in this article) should qualify as backronyms. At the very least, there should be some separation in the article between "true" backronyms (expansions that were not acronyms in their original formulation) and alternative-acronym backronyms (all the rest).

<p>I've reworded the intro and split the acronyms up into (as near as I can tell) non-acronyms and re-interpreted acronyms. It strikes me that a great many of these are the kind of thing you'd expect to get in one of those lame "funny acronyms" emails from your friends, chain-forwarded throughout the internet, rather than encyclopedic material. This list would be gigantic, if it included every "Found On Road Dead", well-known and obscure, of the backronymical lexicon. It's tricky separating the lame from the interesting.

<dd>Most of these are just jokes. One possibility would be to segregate out all the mere jokes, while giving more prominence to backronyms like the one for Arby's that had some significance in the real world.

<p><i>"Many people confuse acronyms and backronyms, like DVD for example"</i></p>
<p>Aren't backronyms also acronyms? But not all acronyms are backronyms. I don't see how backronyms become not acronyms.</p>
<p>I think a more accurate phrase would be, "Many people don't recognize backronyms because they aren't aware that the original acronym has been redefined."</p>

<p>I think the word "longer" is ambiguous. Does it mean the new words chosen have to be greater in length than the original acronym's words?</p>

<p>Maybe something like: "In othe words, only after the acronym was first created did people realize the words in the acronym were inappropriate, leading them to redefine the words while keeping the resulting acronym the same."</p>

<p>This article is somewhat ambiguous. The first definition is: "A backronym is the phenomenon that the short word exists first and is then expanded to a phrase." this definition is fine, and makes sense... but is later countered. here: "Some backronyms are back-formed by replacing one word in an acronym with another, when the original meaning is deemed obsolete or inaccurate." according to the first definition, it's not possible for that to be a backronym, as it had an original meaning, lest it be suggesting that the original meaning was lost or forgotten, which could easily be the case, as with dvd... but then we must bring up the purpose of the acronym in general: is it created to replace the word? anyways, i think it would be more accurate to say "A back-formed backronym is formed when the original meaning becomes obsolete or inaccurate, and as such must be changed..." or something like that. it seems to me that there is a lot of redundance and blurry lines in the acronym community, because even under that definition (or rather change of subject) it's still inaccurate in reference to the first definition. conceivably there are only rare instances (as phenomenon are) in which a true or pure backronym exists, those being when letters are used as symbols, much like the SOS example. the only other example i can think of is qwerty, though that doesn't work because there's no words attached to it (yet), only an object or idea.</p>
<p>much of the rest of the article also contains descriptions of "backronyms" which are contradictory to the first definition. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamer.redeemer_80f7.html" title="User:Dreamer.redeemer">Dreamer.redeemer</a> 01:19, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The definition does seem to only address word-&gt;acronym expansion and not reengineered acronyms. Unless a better term can be established for reengineering acronyms I think the definition should be modified to include them. These two sources of letter sequences for backronyms are compatible and not really relevant to the concept being addressed: the reverse-engineering of an acronym from a sequence of letters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>perhaps a better definition would be: "Backronym is a type of acronym that begins as a sequence of characters, from which the constituent words are derived. The word "backronym" is a portmanteau of back and acronym, and was coined in 1983."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It may help to start off with a description of the two sources of backronyms (acronyms and non-acronyms) as well as the two major types: Positive/neutral (often replacing obsolete or undesirable constituent words) and negative ( satire/prejorative). Special attention should be paid to the negative type as a common form of cultural criticism</dd>

<dd>Not so, "Spam" should not be called "specially prepared assorted meats". Originally Spam was the proprietary name of a "type of tinned cooked meat consisting chiefly of pork" (20th Century Words, Oxford University Press, 1999). "Specially prepared assorted meats" nowadays are types of meat, very often for cultural or religious reasons, consumed by members of our Minorities, prepared differently and often consisting of different types of meat than those consumed by members of the Majority in the country. The name does not seem to have had a particular backronymic origin at the time, although (again) according to "20th Century Words" was "probably a conflation of 'spiced ham' ". <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 00:06, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe there was a competition to name it and some woman came up with "Spiced Ham" thing. (I'll look it up when I get home). I just find it ironic because if you check the ingredients you'll find Spam has no spices in it, just salt and various other chemicals. Doesn't stop me being one of the sickos that eats it.

<p>This article is muddled, unclear, and extremely poorly written. The overlap with "apronym" is ludicrous. We could slice this article by about 90%.</p>
<p>Let's keep it short and sweet. And let us distinguish between backronym and apronym properly (in the respective articles, of course):</p>
<ul>
<li>A <b><a href="../../../b/a/c/Backronym.html" title="Backronym">backronym</a></b> is back-formed from a pre-existing word or phrase. (e.g. tip = "to insure [sic] promptness", Fiat = "Fix it again, Tony")</li>
<li>An <b>apronym</b> is an acronym <i>specifically contrived</i> to reflect the expanded phrase. (e.g. <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act_9b8d.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not the same things, but we <i>can</i> mention, if we must, that "backronym" is sometimes used to mean apronym. And we may include a <i>few</i> examples in each article. We don't have to include every single backronym ever contrived, just a small handful of the best-known ones ("tip", "Fiat"). Unless someone can show good evidence why I shouldn't, I'm going to re-write the article in a couple days. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaggaga_12ad.html" title="User:Raggaga">Raggaga</a> 02:06, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So you're saying that any rewrite would be biased, and that therefore NPOV is not achievable? This makes no sense. If the article is too long, inconsistent, and has excessive less-than-funny examples (with which I think most would agree) then it should be rewritten.

<p>"A backronym or bacronym is a type of acronym that begins as an ordinary word, and is later interpreted as an acronym"</p>
<p>Way too many examples in this article fail this initial definition from the first line of the article. The way I read the definition, backronym means words that are, or were originally, words in and of themselves, and then came to stand for something else, as an acronym. For instance, <i>ram</i> becoming <i>RAM</i>, or <i>pearl</i> becoming <i>PERL</i> (although, to my mind, the differnt spelling makes this a borderline or special case). GI, SOS, and whatever else you want to mention, don't fit this bill, as they have never been "ordinary words". They are acronyms, or strings of letters, to which other meanings have adhered. If anything, they are examples of acronyms becoming ordinary words. Yet, these words are still listed in the article as "pure backronyms".</p>
<p>As it stands this article is a bit of a joke. Few people use <i>backronym</i> in everyday language, and it seems more an example of geek-speak. The phemonenom is legitimate, but the article needs to stick to a clear definition of the phenomenom (the first sentence seems clear to me) and then give valid examples of it. --<a href="../../../i/a/c/User%7EIacobus_67ac.html" title="User:Iacobus">Iacobus</a> 04:23, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right I believe. I cleaned this shi up without really looking at it, but I do believe you are correct. Perhaps all the incorrect ones that actually are real like SOS and RIP could be moved to acronyms (sub) incorrect or something...

<dd>Originally reading the article it didn't hit me as a big deal, but on re-reading it seems the apronyms section is really one of the problems here - an apronum doesn't fit the backronym definition listed at the top of the article, since (for example) ACLU is originally an acronym and not an 'ordinary word'. Also, note that the apronym mention of <i>PCMCIA</i> may require revision as the original definition of the acronym was different, so it may be best to remove that example.

<dd>I agree. Digital Versatile Disc was the original name of the technology, as it was designed from the ground-up to support a wide range of applications (esp computer), not just video formats. It was later supplanted by "Digital Video Disc" because its adoption in the mainstream was spurred by film media as a replacement for VHS and LaserDisc. I am changing the caption, if anyone disagrees please provide evidence that "Digital Video Disc" was the original name that the acronym was based on.24.6.99.30 20:20, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be a problem in the "False" section of the article here:<br />
<br />
".......The band's founders (Angus and Malcolm Young) saw the letters on the back of a sewing machine[30]; they thought that a name associated with electricity suited their energetic style. (Oddly enough it was also British slang for bisexuals, used much like the term "switch-hitter")<br />
Slayer (Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot). <i>Brothers further claims that this phrase is inscribed in the vinyl of the 'Show No Mercy' LP.[31]"</i><br />
<br />
Who is this "Brothers?" (We find out by checking the note in reference / note 30, but to mention "Brothers" in the article - all of a sudden - is odd: it infers we should be familair with this "Brothers" before we check the notes)<br />

<dd>If you are going to India, which at the time the acronym was supposedly formed, would have been, as the Jewel of the Empire, a common destination for posh people. This explanation makes sense if you assume that the term originated in Britain, from where most people would have been travelling to the East, via Gibraltar and Suez, not the West. The problem lies not in the understanding that he first class cabins would have been on the predominantly northern side of the ship, but which way the ship would have been travelling on each leg of the journey.</dd>

<li>1. Both PC Magazine and several other RS's list non-acronyms that have been turned into backronyms (expanded into phrases not fitting the original abbreviation)</li>
<li>2. The WordSpy site lists the oldest reference, from 1971, and it clearly fits into the "Pure" category. In the 1971 reference, the word was "SCOPERS" and turned into the phrase "Students Concentrating On the Palatable Extremities of the Reciprocal Sex". This is an existing word that is used as an acronym.</li>
<li>3. I can find no definition of backgronym that indicates that it originates from an <i>abbreviation</i> or <i>initialism</i> -- always from a <i>word</i>.</li>
<li>4. As <i>acronyms</i> and <i>initialiism</i> have become more commonplace, their label as such is often confounded.</li>

<dd>Shock! Horror! We seem to have got a bit of a conundrum here, Otheus, and I somehow have been involved. The word is, to say the least a fairly recent coinage, judging by the number of dictionaries carrying the word. To start with, Google has over 14,000 references to "anacronym" and just 200 to "anachronym". <a href="../../../o/n/e/OneLook_cfce.html" title="OneLook">OneLook</a> Online Dictionary shows anacronym four times two of which are of Wikipedia and Wiktionary respectively, none for anachronym. None of the British English dictionaries I own have either anacronym or anachronym, all of them were published in the late nineties. As I see it, it seems to be very much "computerese" and/or "bloggese". So, where do we go from here? I think we should be consistent and use "anacronym" throughout. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 00:38, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
