<dd>Hmm, as a traveler and hiker, I find there is a significant difference wilderness backpacking and traveling. If simplification is desired, I believe backpacking (travel) would best be combined with the travel or tourism pages, leaving the wilderness backpacking intact.

<p>Currently this article has three tags: {{NPOV}}, {{cleanup-date|November 2005}}, and {{Not verified}}. But try ignoring them for the time being and read the text. That's what I have just done, and I'm asking myself what it is that is so awful about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The text does not contain any spelling mistakes, typos, or grammatical errors.</li>
<li>It gives a nice overview of the subject. The only POV thing about it may be that it creates the impression that "(a) all backpackers are poor and have a passion for the 'exotic' (b) people in the US don't backpack because they don't have reciprocal work agreements" (as one commentator put it). Personally, I think a reference to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter_Rail_cbb6.html" title="Inter Rail">Inter Rail</a> should be included.</li>
<li>"Not verified"? The article has four internal and six external links.</li>
<li>Apart from the above, there is no discussion about any shortcomings on this talk page.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to make a few minor changes. If no one adds any comments here, I'll remove the tags afterwards. <font color="green"><a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">&lt;K</a><a href="../../../k/f/_/User_talk%7EKF_e975.html" title="User talk:KF">F&gt;</a></font> 10:27, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I competely disagree. The article is written with biased language, and should be heavily edited. It's not that I don't agree with you, I just think that an encyclopedia article should be more objective.

<p>Lets bring this up to featured article status. The only problem I see that we might run into is the lack of real "sources" on this topic. It's not AFAIK somthing that's been studied much (although it should be).</p>
<p>One thing that could help would be a really good history section. My knowledge there is pretty sketchy other than what's on the page. Anyone know how this backpacking developed as a <i>culture</i>? --<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECircuitloss_5a3b.html" title="User:Circuitloss">circuitloss</a> 00:53, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find the "Backpacker Stereotypes" section and the stuff about "Shoestring King" rather unencyclopedic. I don't think this stuff is particularly characteristic of backpacking, I've never come across any of this and I've travelled extensively all across Asia. As for the "conquering" stuff, this can be said about young people in general, I never got the sense that backpackers in particular take "pride" in scoring.</p>
<p>Needless to say none of this stuff is sourced. This means special care should be taken to make sure we are indeed representing backpacking culture, rather than just some individual's own backpacking experience.--128.139.226.36 13:15, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Backpackers also tend to be very sexually active individuals as their often twenty-something age, single status, and co-ed friendly atmosphere makes romantic relationships between backpacker-to-backpacker or backpacker-to-local fairly common. For many males in particular, it is a source of pride or accomplishment to have casual relations with at least one person from each country they visit, in addition to "conquering" the many nationalities that reside within the backpacker hostels themselves.</p>

<p>I added the parts about Americans and our lesser backpacking culture relative to other Western countries. My statements about American travel habits are from living in the United States my entire life, my own travel experiences (Europe and Australia), and all of the other Americans I have known throughout my life.</p>
<p>As for my own personal experience, in hostels, I rarely encountered Americans (although in Europe you do encounter some US college students). For instance, in Australia, there was not an American in sight at the hostels where I stayed. But at the nice hotels, they were like American colonies. And the same usually goes for Europe as well.</p>
<p>I know from personal experience that Americans avoid backpacking because it does not provide our normal level of material comfort. For instance, whenever I've asked Americans why they do not stay at hostels, they always think they are not clean enough and do not provide enough privacy. In addition, I was shocked to see travellers scraping by on little money by eating Ramen noodles for two meals a day for weeks at a time.</p>
<p>As for anti-Americanism among backpackers, these statements are directly from my and my friends' backpacking experiences. It is extremely annoying and has caused many American travellers I have met to avoid the backpackers, including myself. And the broken record false American passport statistic...you can't even try to refute what they're saying because they're usually completely irrational in their logic. It's textbook anti-Americanism (similar to racism or anti-semitism), which is why I included a link to the excellent and fair entry on Anti-Americanism.</p>
<p>I've included this on Wikipedia because I think it's very important for backpackers to know why they do not see many American backpackers. Maybe I'm being selfish because I want to reduce the frequency of being told the urban legend US passport statistic. --Phil 3/24/06</p>

<b>Americans and Anti-Americanism have nothing to do with "backpacking!"</b> Let's not drag this article into an easily avoided swamp of contrversy and NPOV quicksand. The <i>criticism</i> section should be about criticisms of <i>backpacking</i> as a form of <i>travel</i> not a debate over whether young Europeans are anti-American. This is the same as the irrelevant passages on sex, do not confuse the demographics of a culture with the beliefs of a culture! Please add criticisms of backpacking in general, as a philosophy, not vaguely worded and unverifiable speculations about the politics of certain demographic groups. --<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECircuitloss_5a3b.html" title="User:Circuitloss">circuitloss</a> 02:09, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the kind of addition we don't need: <i>"it is not atypical for an American backpacker to be angrily confronted at least once a week by a fellow backpacker who usually has never been to the US yelling at them about how a supposedly small proportion of Americans that have passports"</i> It is totally irrelevant to the core topic. Claims that anything happens "once a week" or involves "yelling" or that a demographic group has "never been to the US" are unencyclopedic and NPOV hyperbole without even the pretense of being neutral to the subject.

<p><b>Americans and Anti-Americanism has EVERYTHING to do with "backpacking!"</b> I'm an American (and Democratic party activist), I know many other Americans who have backpacked, and almost everybody has been harassed. I had tons of conversations with people this weekend about the topic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a criticism of young Europeans, this is a criticism of backpacking. My and other Americans' backpacking experience is of being harassed for being American...be it by young Europeans, Canadians, or whatever. Are you even American? Probably not. --Phil</dd>
</dl>
<p>Phil, I really understand what you're trying to say, and I DO agree with you about the underlying details, but I don't think that the topic of whether Americans are harassed or not is appropriate to this article. It should be a sub-section in the Anti-American article about <i>Anti-americanism and travel.</i> BTW, I am an American, and I've spent more than 16 weeks backpacking in Western and Eastern Europe, Thailand and Japan, and I've never experienced anything like what you've described. However, this is <i>totally besides the point</i>, because personal experiences <i>(mine and yours)</i> do not qualify as a "source" under wikipedia policy. Please see WikiPolicy:<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a>. And even beyond THAT, even if you could find research to back up your claims, you'd have to convince the majority of us that Anti-Americanism is somehow a fundamental part of backpacker culture or philosophy. Now you've decided to reinforce your claims by <i><b>quoting yourself</b></i> in the current revision of the article! Please read Wikipedia policy and guidelines to bring yourself up to speed on what is and is not admissible. Start with the internal link I posted above, and lets have a discussion about whether this is appropriate or not. Also try <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, especially "Wikipedia is not a soapbox." Phil, I'm not coming down hard on you to single you out or even to claim that what you say is wrong, but only because I can easily see this article descending into a revert war between Americans who feel harassed (like yourself) and Canadians and Europeans who think the article is biased against them. We shouldn't have to go there. --<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECircuitloss_5a3b.html" title="User:Circuitloss">circuitloss</a> 23:54, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's try economics. If there was a strong demand, then there would be many hostels. Corporations are designed to maximize the value to shareholder. How? By obtaining profits.

I've showed a lot of people the comment here from an editor about not ever experiencing anti-Americanism while backpacking. We've all laughed so hard because it's such a regular part of the backpacking experience, unless I guess if you have dreads and where pachuli (sp?).

<p>Ok, I'm going to try and put this the nicest way possible. Anecdotal evidence is not allowed on Wikipedia. Just because you had some experiences in Australia or because you asked around doesn't mean you can add a section that says Americans don't backpack. All I ask for is some citations or statistics. What you say might be true, but 1) you don't back them up, and 2) your experiences don't match mine. How about my evidence that I've met Americans in Costa Rica, India, in 12 countries in Europe, Japan, China, Thailand, Mongolia. Doesn't that count for something. Sometimes they even outnumber the Aussies. But hey, I could be wrong. But then again, so could you. I'll try not to do too much edits. But this article is horrible. about 25% of the article is about Americans and Backpacking. You've got to be kidding me. All I ask for is some objectivity. --jabin1979</p>

<p>"In a more humorous point of view, others say if Americans traveled anywhere near as close as Australians or Britons do it would be downright impossible to get a hostel bed in many popular areas."</p>
<p>You've got to be kidding me. This is not encyclopedic. This article needs a major overhaul. It needs to be written from a NPOV. Backpackers sometimes erroneously think that they're part of this little club and it's the only way to live, and it really shows in this article.</p>

<p>Jabin, thanks for your edits. You've helped to clean up the section some. I still think that the "Americans and Backpacking" section should be totally cut. I don't see how its relevant to backpacking as a travel philosophy. It should be discussed in an article on "Americans and Travel" or something similar. For the record, we've had two kinds of POV debates on this article. One saying that Americans don't backpack, and the other claiming that all backpackers are anti-American. As far as I'm concerned, no specific nationality should be mentioned at all. This article is about a <i>philosophy</i> of travel, not the demographics of travel. --<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECircuitloss_5a3b.html" title="User:Circuitloss">circuitloss</a> 00:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Americans and Backpacking</b> has been moved to Backpacking (United States). Let's keep the discussion of demographics and politics in a separate article. I think this will increase the usability of the parent article for readers. Thanks. I did this for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a large amount of information in the section on Americans and Backpacking. I feel that it is POV to have such a section dominate an article on backpacking.</li>
<li>The already existing article Backpacking (United States) was almost content-free.</li>
<li>This cleaner "summary-style" is used on other Wiki articles that become content-heavy in one paticular section.</li>
<li>I feel that forking the articles makes for a cleaner, more readable layout.</li>

I'm a European backpacker myself (been on the road for 2+ years), and it's always been my understanding that the one major reason there's so few backpackers from the USA is that unlike the governments of nearly all European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in south-east Asia, the American government has not signed any of the reciprocal working holiday visa treaties that form the basis for such a large part of the backpacking experience (afaik there's only a very limited number of similar visas available for Americans through organizations like BUNAC and IEP; and these have a lengthy application process, while getting a 'regular' WHV is a process of literally minutes). Europeans do a 'round the world trip - and halfway through they spend a significant amount of time in Australia or New Zealand working and replenishing their funds. Likewise, backpackers from those two countries work in Europe. Canada _has_ the same reciprocal treaties, and so there's many more Canadians doing the same than there are Americans. Given the contested nature of this section, and the fact that I don't have any references for the lack of treaty-signing, I'll refrain from editing, but perhaps someone who can dig up some verification can do so for me. 80.60.87.115 02:29, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why is there an Americans and Backpacking section at all? It makes the article look more like a space for airing pet theories and personal gripes, and also has little to do with the topic. If anything should be said about the reasons for the prevalence or otherwise of backpacking from country to country, then surely (better cited) examination of why it is so prevalent in Australia and New Zealand would be more relevant?--LemmonJelly 11:41, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It has been removed multiple times. Looks like it was put back in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Backpacking_%28travel%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74575095" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Backpacking_%28travel%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74575095" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It had previously been moved to Backpacking (United States), which no longer exists (rightfully so). I will remove the section entirely.

<p>This article needs work, especially the criticism section. Much of that reads like a personal essay from someone opposed to backpacking. Notable published sources need to be cited for any supposed criticisms. A Wikipedia editor can't simply write his/her opinion in the third person as "some people think this or that." 69.29.130.202 22:54, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can tell you backpacking (around asia at least) that there are backpackers of many races although they do tend to be nationals of western countries and developed asian countries.</p>

<p>This page frequents use of phrases like "the majority of" and "most backpackers", without having references that substantiate these generalizations. While accepted generalizations I suppose are permissable, statements like "a majority of backpackers bring high resolution digital cameras" is not, unless it has a study or some form of expert reference. I'm not confident enough in my own revision abilities to clean this page up, but I feel someone ought to at least simplify it to the point where it can be built up from there. May I also suggest that much of the random bickering on this talk page be blanked? <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukeOfSquirrels_7443.html" title="User:DukeOfSquirrels">DukeOfSquirrels</a> 23:01, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps it's time that someone start again on this article? It's a mess. It's too long for a subject that is really only needs two to three paragraphs to describe.
