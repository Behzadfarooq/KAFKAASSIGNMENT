<p>The <b>Bacta War</b> (7 <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dates_in_Star_Wars_530b.html" title="Dates in Star Wars">ABY</a>) is a small, albeit important, fictional conflict in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Expanded Universe</a>, described in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Stackpole_bfc5.html" title="Michael Stackpole">Michael Stackpole</a>'s <i><a href="../../../x/-/w/Star_Wars%7E_X-wing_%28series%29_7e61.html" title="Star Wars: X-wing (series)">X-Wing</a></i> series of <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> novels, most notably <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bacta_War_%28novel%29_6f3b.html" title="The Bacta War (novel)">The Bacta War</a></i>. The Bacta War resulted in the capture of the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacta.html" title="Bacta">bacta</a>-producing planet of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28T-V%29_b9a6.html#Thyferra" title="List of Star Wars planets (T-V)">Thyferra</a>, and its subsequent retake by elements of the former <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue_Squadron_a24d.html" title="Rogue Squadron">Rogue Squadron</a>, including <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedge_Antilles_6f70.html" title="Wedge Antilles">Wedge Antilles</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corran_Horn_bd1c.html" title="Corran Horn">Corran Horn</a>.</p>

<p>The Bacta War began after <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coruscant.html" title="Coruscant">Coruscant</a>'s fall to the <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Alliance_d8fe.html" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a>, and the flight of the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Empire_%28Star_Wars%29_ca1b.html" title="Galactic Empire (Star Wars)">Empire</a>'s leader, <a href="../../../y/s/a/Ysanne_Isard_a129.html" title="Ysanne Isard">Ysanne Isard</a>, from the planet in her <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html" title="Star Destroyer">Super Star Destroyer</a> <i><a href="../../../l/u/s/Lusankya.html" title="Lusankya">Lusankya</a></i>. Isard had intentionally released a crippling virus, the <a href="../../../k/r/y/Krytos_virus.html" title="Krytos virus">Krytos virus</a>, that only attacked non-human species. She knew that conquering <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28T-V%29_b9a6.html#Thyferra" title="List of Star Wars planets (T-V)">Thyferra</a> would allow her to control the galaxy's supply of life-saving <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacta.html" title="Bacta">bacta</a>. She took a fleet, with the <i>Lusankya</i> as the flagship, to Thyferra, where (not coincidentally) the Xucphra corporation had just initiated a planetwide coup, leaving them in control, with competing corporation Zaltin in disarray. Isard was quickly installed as Xucphra's <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Operating_Officer_2a90.html" title="Chief Operating Officer">Chief Operating Officer</a>, placing her in ultimate control of the Galaxy's bacta supply, despite being—technically—nothing more than a new employee of the company. Former Moff <a href="../../../f/l/i/Fliry_Vorru_6084.html" title="Fliry Vorru">Fliry Vorru</a> was also hired as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Financial_Officer_f9fb.html" title="Chief Financial Officer">Chief Financial Officer</a>, with Rogue Squadron mole <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erisi_Dlarit_ad54.html" title="Erisi Dlarit">Erisi Dlarit</a> taking a leadership position in the newly-formed Thyferran Home Defense Corps.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue_Squadron_a24d.html" title="Rogue Squadron">Rogue Squadron</a> saw the necessity of taking Thyferra from Isard's power. <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corran_Horn_bd1c.html" title="Corran Horn">Corran Horn</a> also had a more personal mission: while imprisoned on the <i>Lusankya</i>, he had promised a fellow prisoner, the famous <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Alliance_d8fe.html" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel</a> general <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_Rebel_characters_879c.html#Dodonna.2C_Jan" title="List of minor Star Wars Rebel characters">Jan Dodonna</a>, that he would free Jan and the other prisoners. Seeing as how the <i>Lusankya</i> now orbited Thyferra, it seemed only natural to kill two birds with one stone: free the prisoners <i>and</i> take Thyferra from the Empire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_803b.html" title="New Republic (Star Wars)">New Republic</a> refused to authorize such a mission, believing <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warlord_Zsinj_5bc0.html" title="Warlord Zsinj">Warlord Zsinj</a> to be a greater threat. They were also unable to countenance military action against a planet that had suffered nothing more offensive than a shuffling of one corporation's upper management. As a result, Corran Horn resigned his commission; the rest of the squadron, including leader <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedge_Antilles_6f70.html" title="Wedge Antilles">Wedge Antilles</a>, followed suit. The only exception was <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_characters_e9a0.html#Cracken.2C_Pash" title="List of minor Star Wars characters">Pash Cracken</a>, who returned to his old <a href="../../../a/-/w/A-wing.html" title="A-wing">A-wing</a> unit as a captain. While Cracken wanted to join the Rogues, Wedge asked Cracken to remain where he was (Cracken's father was the head of New Republic Intelligence, and Wedge knew no one would believe the Rogues had truly gone rogue had Pash gone with them).</p>
<p>After resigning from the New Republic, the Rogues were required to leave their headquarters facilities. A number of private citizens offered them offices and places to live, but the Rogues began searching for their own base for security reasons. Meanwhile, Captain Cracken had been ordered to destroy a space station orbiting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28W-Z%29_ab59.html#Yag.27Dhul" title="List of Star Wars planets (W-Z)">Yag'Dhul</a>, which was once controlled by Warlord Zsinj. Ironically, the Rogues had attacked the station in an earlier mission in order to steal badly needed bacta from Zsinj. Cracken offered the station to the Rogues, who accepted, and forged reports indicating the station had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Since the New Republic relied on Rogue Squadron as a symbol of their military might, it quickly formed a new, official, Rogue Squadron of their own. This new squadron was outfitted with new equipment, and all of the Rogues' <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-wing.html" title="X-wing">X-wings</a> and other equipment were declared broken surplus and offered for sale ("broken" because they were all missing PL-1s, the New Republic military designation for "pilot"). Tycho managed to scoop them up, and the Rogues' technical staff, catching wind of the transaction, resigned and came with the equipment. While this was going on, Wedge Antilles, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corran_Horn_bd1c.html" title="Corran Horn">Corran Horn</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirax_Terrik_d543.html" title="Mirax Terrik">Mirax Terrik</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Rebel_characters_in_Star_Wars_d665.html#Qrygg.2C_Ooryl" title="List of minor Rebel characters in Star Wars">Ooryl Qrygg</a> located several caches of X-wing parts and weapons across the galaxy. As a result, the squadron had all their fighters and plenty of parts as well. For funds, <a href="../../../t/y/c/Tycho_Celchu_7799.html" title="Tycho Celchu">Tycho Celchu</a> donated his ample bank accounts to the efforts, which had been used in an attempt to frame him as an Imperial spy. They also sold the remaining <a href="../../../z/-/9/Z-95_Headhunter_b7c5.html" title="Z-95 Headhunter">Z-95 Headhunters</a> used to take Coruscant, now historical treasures due to their part in galactic history. Through <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirax_Terrik_d543.html" title="Mirax Terrik">Mirax Terrik</a>'s father, the smuggler <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booster_Terrik_b9a7.html" title="Booster Terrik">Booster Terrik</a>, and <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talon_Karrde_fdb3.html" title="Talon Karrde">Talon Karrde</a>, the squadron was able to purchase the rest of the equipment needed to attack Thyferra. Finally, they were augmented by a full squadron of <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twi%27lek.html" title="Twi'lek">Twi'lek</a> pilots and their custom-made <i>Chir'daki</i> fighters (a <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Fighter_13f3.html" title="TIE Fighter">TIE Fighter</a> cockpit supplemented by X-Wing S-foils, engines and laser cannons).</p>
<p>With the help of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_Rebel_characters_879c.html#Loro.2C_Elscol" title="List of minor Star Wars Rebel characters">Elscol Loro</a> and Sixtus Quin, Rogue Squadron managed to form an alliance with the Ashern, a Vratix resistance group, and the remanants of the Zaltin corporation. These groups performed many terrorist and insurgent attacks, including sneaking into the Dlarit family's estate and Erisi's father's clothes off in front of a camera. Meanwhile, in space, Rogue squadron performed numerous hit-and-run attacks against Thyferran bacta convoys and refineries. They used the stolen bacta to finance their war, as well as donating much of it to the New Republic to help fight the Krytos virus. Isard, meanwhile, struck back by attempting to ambush Rogue Squadron twice and completely annihilating a colony on Halanit, which had accepted stolen bacta from Rogue Squadron.</p>
<p>Through "hit-and-hype" raids, attrition and careful planning, the Rogues were able to whittle down down Isard's fleet of Star Destroyers. Her smaller <i>Victory</i>-class ship, the <i>Corruptor</i>, was destroyed in a botched ambush at <a href="../../../a/l/d/Alderaan.html" title="Alderaan">Alderaan</a>, in which Captain Ait Convarion's TIE squadrons (piloted solely by members of the fledgling Thyferran military) and then his ship were overwhelmed by the Rogues' superior piloting, coordination and salvos of proton torpedoes. Next, Antilles bribed Captain Sair Yonka of the <i>Imperator</i>-class <i>Avarice</i> to defect. Finally, the <i>Lusankya</i> herself was drawn out, with Isard's remaining <i>Imperator</i>-class, the <i>Virulence</i>, as bodyguard, when Antilles arranged for the location of their Yag'Dhul space station to be leaked to Thyferra. There, Booster bluffed <i>Lusankya</i> captain Joak Drysso into abandoning the <i>Virulence</i> and returning to Thyferra, where Antilles, the Rogues, a small fleet of freighters, and Yonka's newly renamed <i>Freedom</i> were waiting.</p>
<p>The <i>Corruptor</i> was destroyed by having a single X-Wing fighter (Wedge's, Tycho's, Corran's) pass missile telemetry to the other two squadrons, whose torpedoes and missiles were thus co-ordinated into a deadly, shield-overwhelming barrage(This was facilitated by the fact that Isard's entire fighter-pilot pool were, with very few exceptions, barely out of training.), to augment this action against the <i>Lusankya</i>, Wedge and Booster fitted their freighter fleet with missile launchers, resulting in a peak salvo of <i>eighty</i> rounds hitting the Super Star Destroyer at once. (The launchers' aiming sensors, no longer needed, were eventually incorporated into Booster's bluff at Yag'Dhul.) In a bit of luck, Pash Cracken's entire A-Wing unit, three squadrons, stumbled upon Booster's standoff with the <i>Virulence</i>; commanding officer Varscha surrendered her ship, and Terrik and Cracken immediately set out to join the brawl at Thyferra. Between these forces and Captain Drysso's budding <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalomania.html" title="Megalomania">megalomania</a>, the <i>Lusankya</i> was eventually overwhelmed and surrendered to Wedge Antilles.</p>
<p>On the ground, Quin, Loro and Iella Wesiri led an attack force consisting of Vratix rebels and security forces from the Zaltin Corporation on Xucphra corporate headquarters. Though their forces succeeded in apprehending Vorru, Isard escaped the planet in an upgraded <i>Lambda</i>-class shuttle, with Dlarit's Elite Squadron escorting. Elements of Rogue Squadron, specifically Corran Horn, Tycho Celchu and their wingmen (Gand Ooryl Qyrgg and Twi'lek <a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawara_Ven_3258.html" title="Nawara Ven">Nawara Ven</a>, respectively) were detailed to intercept it. Horn personally dealt with Dlarit, and (with a contribution of proton torpedoes from Celchu) successfully destroyed Isard's shuttle as well. (It would be some years before anyone discovered that Isard had not in fact been aboard the shuttle at all.)</p>
<p>After the battle, the Rogues discovered that their resignations had been "accidentally" misfiled, making their work an official New Republic <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_phrases_used_by_English_speakers_609c.html#Words_and_phrases" title="List of French phrases used by English speakers">fait accompli</a></i> mission. The Rogues were then given the option to rejoin the New Republic as an official unit again, an offer they all accepted. Their first mission would be to work up leads regarding the <i>Lusankya</i> prisoners, who, as it turned out, had been transferred to other locations some months ago. (This turned out to be a blessing in disguise: the prison section of the ship suffered a hull breach during the fighting.) Booster Terrik, who refused to surrender ownership of the <i>Virulence</i> to Airen Cracken and the New Republic, was helped to a compromise by Corran and Talon Karrde: he was allowed to keep the <i>Virulence</i>, renamed the <i><a href="../../../e/r/r/Errant_Venture_f92c.html" title="Errant Venture">Errant Venture</a></i>, and turn it into a mobile trading post, but it was stripped of most of its weapons. Finally, Wedge, in his capacity as the <i>Lusankya</i>'s acting captain (a position that would eventually become permanent), married Corran and Mirax.</p>
