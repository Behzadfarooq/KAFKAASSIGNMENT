<p>Howie and AJ bass guitar?? since when?? All they ever do is suck cock! I'm a BSB fan and I have seen them performing in concerts, BSB don't play instruments except I have said above. Nick guitar sometimes (only 2 songs), drums??? do you mean to say 1 song in 10 years??? please let's get serious, Brian in his solo concerts, Howie and AJ bass guitar...at their home.</p>
<p>EDIT: IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH: There was a tour years ago where they "kicked their band off their instruments and played a song" and Brian played guitar when he sung his song "That's What She Said." Never seen them in concert, but I know this is true.</p>

<dd>^^ Response to the above paragraphs. On their tour before millenium, during Quit Playing Games (With My Heart) the boys did take over the stage. And during concerts many of the boys, during songs when they didn't have many vocals, would play an instrument. They've all played instruments during concerts.</dd>

<p>I'm a BSB fan, but I'm objective I don't think necessary to say Brian plays guitar in the line up, cuz he still never haven't played in the BSB concerts. He have learned to play kinda the guitar recently and he have performanced with it just in his solo tour "Welcome Home" in the US Backstreet Boys ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE A VOCAL MALE GROUP. Sometimes Kevin have played piano in any song, sometimes Nick have played the acoustic or electric guitar (above all in the last tour), and drums...but that were years ago in a song. Other thing, I would put in the Nick Carter bio he knows play guitar, drums, etc. Not in the line-up. AJ can play bass guitar at home but not in the BSB performances.</p>
<p>Music genre...I have put "Organic Pop" since "Never Gone". The instrumentation (played by others) now is organic, live drums, live guitars, live bass...strings, etc. Before, they used to sing more over samplers, keyboards, synthetizers, electric drum beats...although there were guitars in the ballads, and real instruments too. "Never gone" can be considered a Organic Vocal Pop album, and it has Pop Rock songs, not for that that's Coldplay cuz they are Indie Pop/Rock Brit Music. The next BSB album is gonna follow with the Never Gone sound but there will be more Europop and R&amp;B like in the beginning.</p>
<p>The previous sound of the group (Backstreet Boys-Black &amp; Blue) were Pop, but we have to be more specific. BSB are a Pop band but a R&amp;B-Pop one. Teen Pop could be considered so, it's a sound Urban Pop. I would put Urban Pop.Keep on eyes on this: BSB have harmonic R&amp;B influences. They are really influenced by Boyz II Men, their mainly one. BSB aren't A1, not Westlife, not A-Teens, not Euro-Pop-dance and islands melodic Pop, they have recorded R&amp;B songs, like "I'll never break your heart", "All I have to give", "Set adrift on memory bliss (R&amp;B cover), "Just to be close, "Yes, I will", "No one else come close", "Like a child"...all of they Motown songs.</p>
<p>The line up I would say: Lead singers: Brian, AJ and Nick</p>
<p>Background singers: (sometimes they take the lead vocals) -Howie and Kevin. Kevin usually sings bass vocals and Howie falsetto vocals</p>

<p>The line "They suck horribly." is pushing it on the POV. These types of statements are always hard to keep netural, but I think that the majority of the intended audience for their work would disagree with this statement, thus making it inappropriatly positive.</p>
<p>I wrote that line (in anon days) to leaven a previous, stronger POV. But yes, it is both debatable and unnecessary, so here it goes... <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 06:59, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;The Backstreet Boys gave 8 performances at the 2000 Grammy awards.</p>
<p>I think this is a misleading statement. What are these '8 performances' attributed to? Because it sounds like each song in the medley they performed is being counted as a performance... which I would argue is not a correct assessment. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 20:24, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

RESPONSE::: I believe it's not a correct assessmnent. I know the boys performed a tribute to male groups (a medley), Show me the meaning of being lonely, and performed with Elton John. So 3 performances would be more correct.

<p>More trivia: &gt;&gt;Backstreet Boys hold the record for being the World's Biggest Money Maker for Concerts and Album Sales since their debut in 1997 to 2005 with US$534 million according to Jive records and as ranked by Celender Magazine.</p>
<p>Is it the World's biggest money maker? if it's international, why would they start from the 1997 US debut and not the 1995 international debut. Seems like an odd statistic. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 22:06, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;The Backstreet Boys have been ranked #22 on the <i>Top 500 Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years</i> list in 2005.</p>

<p>Unless sources for the trivia statements are given, they will be deleted. Some of them are really unbelievable, like 1 million tickets sold during 24 hours (close to impossible physically). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 15:42, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No it is possible cause N'Sync also sold almost 1 million tickets on the 1st day of their NSA tour</p>
<p><br />
-- Very possible. They said it on MTV News at the time and I have that recorded. It's on VCR, so, I couldn't post this here. But many websites like lauch.com or Billboard.com posted this news at the time. Could somebody try and find this in their archives?</p>
<p>And it's physically possible because most part of those tickets were reserved beforehand on internet pre-sales.</p>

<p>At the end of this article, I found this list of "similar artists" to Backstreet Boys.</p>
<p>Bryan Adams<br />
Kelly Clarkson<br />
Aly &amp; AJ<br />
Hilary Duff<br />
Simple Plan<br />
Maroon 5<br />
Matchbox 20<br />
Coldplay<br />
Rob Thomas<br />
Savage Garden<br /></p>
<p>I understand the usefulness of such a list as adding to the resources Wikipedia can provide, but some of these artists are a bit of a stretch in my opinion, <i>especially</i> Coldplay. I mean, yes, Incomplete is basically a rip-off of Clocks, and maybe the entirety of their newest album continued to coast on Coldplay's success with a similar musical style, but does the rest of their back catalogue really bear much similarity to Coldplay's? I'd question some of the other bands on this list as well (Simple Plan for sure), but I haven't listened to enough of them.</p>

<p>I changed from Pop Rock to Teen Pop that is their style (also AMG reports it). Pop Rock is wrong, because Pop Rock = REM, Smiths, earlier Radiohead etc. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 87.10.183.248 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_87.10.183.248_5855.html" title="Special:Contributions/87.10.183.248">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>"The third international single "I Still" debuted at #1 on the Japan International Singles Chart with 2,182 copies sold, making the first ever international single to enter at #1 on the chart in Japanese history" - This doesn't make sense to me. 2,000 copies of a single cannot reach #1 in Japan. Oricon (Japanese Billboard)'s lowest debut at #1 for a single is around 25k. If it's talking about the International Singles Chart then it doesn't make sense either since the chart is only composed of international artists anyways. That's like saying artist "A" is the first ever country artist to debut #1 on the Country Albums Chart. --Nikitashot 8:06, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
