<p>"There are approximately 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells in the human body"</p>
<p>That doesn't make sense. What's the differnce between the two? The general public thinks of bacteria as seperate from the human body, and not a part of it. My brain is telling me there's more muscle, bone and organs than bacteria.</p>
<p>If it does make sense and I'm missing it, maybe it could be clarified.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is by cell number not volume. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 19:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, to clarify eukaryotic cells are around 100 times larger than prokaryotes. Now considering this is only diameter, their volume is going to be around 100^3, i.e. one million times smaller than ours, and their mass around the same figure. With this in mind, the mass of bacterial cells, assuming similar density to human cells, will be around 1 part per 100,000, which would translate to around 1 gram of bacteria or less per human being. It doesn't sound like much now, but when you consider that there are 100 trillion cells in the human body, there are quite a few bacteria in that gram or so. See <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria_in_the_human_body.html" title="Bacteria in the human body">bacteria in the human body</a> for more on the subject. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001</a> 20:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I doubt your calculations. The article states that bacteria are 1/10 the size of eukariotic cells. That gives a volume ratio of 1/1000 not 1/100,000,000. See my comment below... - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankH_ef3c.html" title="User:FrankH">FrankH</a> 22:13, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see. So it's on a "number of" basis rather than a mass basis. Bacteria are smaller than normal human cells. Thanks, it does make sense now.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I doubted this statement at first, but then thought along these lines:: The article also states that the size of the typical bacteria is about 1/10 the size of a typically eukariaotic cell. Taking this as a linear dimension means the volume of the bacterial cell is 1/1000th the volume of a eukariotic cell. Since our bodies are made of eukariotic cells, the statement that there are 10 times more bacterial cells than the human cells in a body means that the total volume of the bacterial cells is 1/100th the volume of all the human cells. Thus in a 200 lb man, the bacteria would weigh about 2 lbs (assuming the density of the bacterial cells and human cells are about the same). This does seem like a reasonable weight for all the bacteria in the gut and on the skin - at least to me. Does anyone else think saying something like this in the article would be helpful or not? My other question is, are there many bacteria in the body that are not in the gut or on the skin? I don't think so, but I don't know. Any experts? I understand that when there is an active bacterial disease, they can be in other tissues, so my question is about a healthy human... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankH_ef3c.html" title="User:FrankH">FrankH</a> 20:55, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know for size, but here is an excerpt from <i>Infection, The Uninvited Universe, 2006</i> on number: "Though we don't often notice it, every human is mostly bacteria. In an average human body...only about 10% of cells are what we call "human" cells. The rest--the vast majority, about 90%--are bacteria." To get a prospective on weight, it goes on to say "...and our feces, by dry weight, are 50%-60% bacteria."--Elgringo18 01:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi all. I have started to prepare a comprehensive rewrite of the entry Bacteria. I am a microbiologist so I have some some background for the job. If others are interested in collaboration on this task I would be open to that. Leave a message here or on my Talk page.</p>
<p>I propose the following table of contents:</p>
<p>1. Identification and Classification</p>
<p>2. Cell structure</p>
<p>3. Metabolism</p>
<p>4. Reproduction</p>
<p>5. Growth and culture</p>
<p>6. Movement</p>
<p>7. Bacteria and Human Health</p>
<p>8. Bacteria and the Environment</p>
<p>9. Industrial uses of Bacteria</p>
<p>10.See also</p>
<p>11.Sources</p>
<p>12.Further reading</p>
<p>I intend on keeping much of the current content but rearranging it and adding to it considerably. I have read all of the other comments on the page and am considering many of the suggestions.</p>

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaroonus_b03c.html" title="User:Azaroonus">Azaroonus</a>. While the current article is deficient in places, a complete rewrite (which you suggest up top) probably isn't necessary. Your suggestion to use as much text as possible from the extant version is a good one and probably the best way to go (especially in terms of saving you effort). By all means alter the article structure if you've got a better layout for it. Something about the evolutionary history of bacteria would be good. Also, I presume the current "history" section will be squeezed into Human Health of something in your new plan? If you're planning on adding references, I'd advise checking out the best way to do this - there are several, but some good templates exist for adding stuff like journal entries. Cheers, --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumbago_5505.html" title="User:Plumbago">Plumbago</a> 15:50, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Lets's call it a comprehensive rewrite then&#160;:-) Yes, it is best to keep the content that exists and at a first look I think that most of the current content should stay. Most of the topics that should be covered are covered, the major problem with the article is that it is disorganised and unclear.</p>
<p>Your comment about the history section: don't you think that the short history section that is currently in the article does belongs in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microbiology.html" title="Microbiology">Microbiology</a>? <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria.html" title="Bacteria">Bacteria</a> is the organism, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microbiology.html" title="Microbiology">Microbiology</a> is the study of them and there is already a history article here. --<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaroonus_b03c.html" title="User:Azaroonus">Azaroonus</a> 18:12, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A very fair point. It probably would be a better place. Evolutionary history, now that's different. Cheers, --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumbago_5505.html" title="User:Plumbago">Plumbago</a> 21:46, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmmm. I like it. I will have to see what I can dig up about that. It would be interesting to add some things about when Bacteria evolved, hypotheses based on molecular clocks and perhaps fossil records. Could also discuss the theories of when they broke from Archaea and Eukarya and the chloroplast/mitochondria symbiosis from Bacteria. Not my main field but I will give it a try.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaroonus_b03c.html" title="User:Azaroonus">Azaroonus</a> 13:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p><i>Bacteria were formerly classified in the kingdom Monera, but are now given their own domain.</i></p>
<p>As far as I know,Archaea are still counted as bacteria, the term being a structural rather than phylogenetic one; the domain is called <i>Eu</i>bacteria on the tree of life and elsewhere. Also, isn't the five kingdom system still prevalent among biologists, despite its fairly clear inadequacies?</p>
<hr />
<p>Viewing Bacteria as the super-domain over EuBacteria and Archaebacteria is outmoded and has been superceded by the view that Archaea actually have much more in common with Eukaryota than had been thought. See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html</a> for more information. Note also that the <a href="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/life.html" class="external text" title="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/life.html" rel="nofollow">tree of life</a> has shifted to the three domain view, although they do use the term Eubacteria. Note also that all of the alternative high level taxonomies presented on the tree of life site show Archaea as closer to Eukaryota than to Bacteria.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. So why do we still have a separate article on <a href="../../../e/u/b/Eubacteria.html" title="Eubacteria">Eubacteria</a>? I vote that we merge the contents of that article with this one. We then should delete the contents of that article and redirect it to here. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>It is definitely true that most biology texts still have the five kingdom view and that many biologists who don't work in systematics will still reiterate when asked. If they review the current literature, most convert quickly to the three domain view (in my limited experience observing this process). -- TedDunning</p>
<p>Reviewing the current literature shows a lot of implicit assumption of the three-domain system, but not a lot of evidence for the phylogenetic hypothesis it entails. In particular Mayr and other opponents argue that the Eubacteria are paraphyletic, and while this view does not have wide support, I haven't found any arguments for their monophyly (except based on Woese's original progenote hypothesis, which he has since disavowed). If someone more familiar with the subject could add these, I would be very grateful.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, here in central Europe, the view that I have found to be prevalent is to refer to Eubacteria, and Archaea.</dd>

<p>Bacteria's is more a general term when the talker doesnt want to distinguish too much. I think the article should reflect the current opinion about the phylum as well. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.108.103.172_0c8c.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.108.103.172">80.108.103.172</a> (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.108.103.172.html" title="User talk:80.108.103.172">talk</a>) 02:40, 20 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Living things</i> shouldn't point to <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three-domain_system.html" title="Three-domain system">three-domain system</a>, since one is a group and the other is a particular classification of that group, which is not universal.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>On that, the Bacteria may be treated as one of six (or more) kingdoms instead of as a domain. I got the general impression from talk pages that we were planning to use this system, but that doesn't necessarily mean we were planning to abandon domains. How should we rank this group?</li>

<li><i>Living things</i> is not a standard taxon, at least not in formal schemes, and is definitely never given a rank like <i>Global Realm</i>. It should not appear as such in the taxobox. What, if anything, should replace it? If nothing, what becomes of the <i>Scientific Classification</i> subbox for top-level groups?</li>
</ul>
<p>I substantially agree with what you-all have said. But I felt the need to indicate an overall category in some way to give relevance to <i>domain</i>, so that's what I came up with. Any better alternatives are welcome! I strongly feel that we should retain the three-domain system, and that it's much more cladistically correct. I also feel that the taxoboxes should reflect cladistics as much as possible, though it's not always easy. The reason I pointed "living things" the the "Three-domain system" was to point people to an explanation of the organization, since I know a lot of people still aren't familiar with this. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJaknouse_342b.html" title="User:Jaknouse">jaknouse</a> 15:54 Apr 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I changed it a bit so that it conforms to the convention already established in the other Kingdom articles. I've also never heard of "Global realm" being part of any scientific classification system and it does not make much sense to link to <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organism.html" title="Organism">organism</a> there - of course we are taking about organisms. It is best to link that on the first line of the article - not in the taxobox which gives the impression that "Global realm" is an actual classification. The current taxobox also much more clearly illustrates the relationship between the Kingdom and Domain - there was no link to the Kingdom classification before (NOTE: I know that the three domain system and the 6-kingdom system are really two different classification systems <i>but</i> it would be a mistake not to capitalize on the actual compatibility between the two systems - at least at the Kingdom/Domain interface). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 21:32 10 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree, I think listing both domain and kingdom is a mistake. Modern classifications generally don't use both in discussing these groups, and those that do may not recognise a single kingdom in each prokaryotic domain. It removes the main point of the three domains, which you will remember were originally intended as replacements for the kingdoms. I don't think the very small amount of compatability we gain by conflating the two systems is worth it. If we want to use three domains, let's use three domains, and if we want to use six kingdoms, let's use six kingdoms. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh</a></p>

<dd>We could easily get away with removing the domain classification from the eukaryotic kingdoms but the problem here is that bacteria and archea are both kingdoms <i>and</i> domains. That said if anything were removed from here it should be the domain classification since it never really has caught-on in any way comparable to the way multiple kingdom systems have. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<p>I disagree entirely. The Archaea were first introduced by Woese as the third domain of life, and they are generally ranked accordingly. Systems which treat them as a kingdom are derivative, less common, and less recognizable, while systems which treat them as both are less prevalent still. Moreover, some sources divide them into several kingdoms, such as the <a href="http://tolweb.org" class="external text" title="http://tolweb.org" rel="nofollow">tree of life</a>. There is more support for a kingdom Bacteria, but this may be taken to include the Archaea, as is done by Cavalier-Smith, while the domain is unambiguous.</p>
<p>In general, I think the three-domain system is far better known than any of the multi-kingdom systems after Whittaker. There is a good reason these groups were being listed as domains: that is the way people think of them and are use to dealing with them. I think we should go with this, treating the eukaryotes in terms of kingdoms and the prokaryotes in terms of domains, instead of trying to force a less natural synthesis. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>We are using Whittaker with a slight modification by splitting Monera into Bacteria and Archea in order to make this system compatible with the main thrust behind the three domain system (Karl Woese of U of Illinois first proposed the 6-kingdom system before the 3-domain system was proposed if I recall though - but it was proposed to overcome the same major problems). I can't say I've worked much with Archea but I have worked a bit with bacteria and have always treated them as a kingdom, not a domain. I was taught the 5-kingdom system with the caveat that Monera is a poor excuse for a kingdom since it represents two very different branches of life (this is far worse than the "superkingdom" nature of Protista). Thus the split.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>IMO there is no harm done mentioning both classification systems in all the kingdom taxoboxes. It is also my understanding the the domain classification system is subdivided into KPOCFGS just as the 6-kingdom system is (except with one level above kingdom). So why does the kingdom stuff need to be removed from the prokaryotic domains? Just because there is only one accepted kingdom in each of the domains doesn't mean that we should not report this. We do it all the time with lower-level taxoboxes where a family only has one extant genus. --mav</dd>
</dl>
<p>Woese certainly proposed three domains first. It's a little confusing because at some point he was calling them kingdoms, but throughout Bacteria and Archaea were ranked on par with the eukaryotes. That's why the Archaea are referred to everywhere as the third domain or kingdom of life. Based on his approach to microbial diversity, I would be surprised if he had ever proposed the six-kingdom system.</p>
<p>Do the prokaryotic domains each contain a single kingdom? They may be given as both domains and kingdoms in different systems, but that is not the same thing - e.g. the rotifers may be taken to be a class, but as a phylum they have three classes. Most sources don't seem to mention kingdoms for the prokaryotic domains, and those that do don't necessarily have one for each. The <a href="http://tolweb.org" class="external text" title="http://tolweb.org" rel="nofollow">tre of life</a> is a fairly notable source, and it casually mentions the "kingdom Crenarchaeota". Many of the pages on <i><a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanoarchaeum.html" title="Nanoarchaeum">Nanoarchaeum</a></i> did the same. In short, I don't think it's fair to say that what you are proposing is just reporting the classification system as it stands.</p>
<p>Treating the bacteria as a kingdom is a common practice, but as I said, this is mostly thanks to systems that do not separate out the archaea. I would argue that the three-domain system, not the six-kingdom system, is the most familiar of these. And at the moment, the <i>de facto</i> standard that wikipedia has been using is the former, treating Bacteria as a domain rather than a kingdom. So we don't need comptability with the latter, and if we intend to switch towards it, we should have a good reason.</p>
<p>All in all, then, I think listing kingdoms provides no information about relationships and provides misleading information about ranks, for the sole purpose of gaining compatability with a less common system that we don't need to follow. I don't understand why you think they're a good idea. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh</a></p>

<dd>"Woese certainly proposed three domains first." Not according to Campbell 5th Edition, page 499 (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-80531957-3</a>), which reads; "Archeabacteria and eubacteria diverged so early in the history of life that many researchers, led by Carl Woese of the University of Illinois, first proposed a six-kingdom system: two prokaryotic kingdoms along with the four eukaryotic kingdoms." Page 495 also says in figure 24.10 when referring to a representation of the 3-domain system "This scheme assigns even more significance to the ancient evolutionary split between eubacteria and archeabacteria by using a superkingdom taxon called the domain. The phylogenetic rationale for this solution is discussed in Chapter 25 [above cite]. The domain Eukarya consists of the four kingdoms of Eukaryotic organisms." So this is the only reference I could find that hints at what the next taxon down from domain would be (in this case the text seems to imply that "kingdom" is the next level down).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The major issue I have with the 3-domain scheme is that I have yet to see any proposed taxonomy for this system below the top-level. If "kingdom" is <i>not</i> part of this system then that would make a total mess of the taxonomy of Eukarya because that leaves us with hundreds of phyla and divisions just below the top level. But if this system does have kingdoms only for Eukarya and not the other domains then I find such a system logically inconsistent. Actually the more I think about it the more I'm convinced that the 3-domain system isn't really about forming a useful taxonomy down to the species level and therefore doesn't really have a place in a taxobox (which is <i>all</i> about taxonomy). But I still do find the domain information interesting and wish it could stay. At the very least this info needs to be in the prose of the article - its inclusion in the taxobox has always been optional since it isn't really part of the 6-kingdom system. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 19:40 11 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, my mistake. Archaebacteria was originally a kingdom, which Woese renamed Archaea when he promoted it to a domain. In that same revision, he also treated the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota as kingdoms. In other works I have seen these further divided down to species, but generally on the assumption that they are phyla. The same is done with the Bacteria, which I don't think Woese gave kingdoms for. In both cases the kingdoms are skipped in at least some newer treatments.</p>
<p>But I don't think it's fair to say that the kingdoms are absent from the system, or that it's not about classifying organisms down to the species level. The problem is that the kingdoms aren't a stable part of the classification, because the relationships between the different groups aren't clear enough to introduce any that aren't redundant, and so tend to be ignored. It's very much like the protists: the domain is clear, the low-level groups are clear, but the stuff inbetween is uncertain and so tends not to be assigned a full and proper taxonomy. In such cases, I think the best thing for the taxoboxes to do is omit the confused ranks.</p>
<p>These pages have been treating the bacterial and archaean phyla as direct subgroups of the domains because, as far as I can tell, the most recent classifications of bacteria and archaea do the same. This is mirrored on some of the subgroups, and it seems to work well enough - at least I don't think it has caused anyone much confusion, especially if they are familiar with the concept of the domains. I don't see any reason we need to use kingdoms where most workers don't, but if they are that important to you, I would prefer the six-kingdom system to this weird hybrid. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>OK. Upon further reflection I think you are right and that we should omit the taxons which are confused (such as the kingdom taxon for bacteria and archea - although a look at the cladistics of these domains seems to indicate to me that 3 kingdoms/next-level-down-taxon exist for archaea and 5 for bacteria - but the last thing I want to do is to go down the splitting route). In short we should stick to the taxons we are sure of. In this case the 3-domain system seems to make more sense for the prokaryotes so lets use that. In time I'm sure biology will work out the specifics of just how many kingdoms are in each domain. But not today. --mav</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks, mav. I'm not sure that having <i>Kingdom: uncertain</i> in the placement box doesn't suggest there would only be one, but beyond that it's a good solution. Just out of curiosity, what would the five bacterial kingdoms be? Most of the phylogenies I've seen have been too messy to permit such an easy split. --Josh</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not totally satisfied with the "Kingdom: uncertain" bit either. But then the whole situation with the taxonomy of the prokaryotes is not satisfying. Eventually some explanation in the text about this is warrented. I was mistaken about the bacteria kingdom bit (I was looking at a simplified cladogram that only focused on the top five bacteria groups; spirochetes, chlamydias, gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria and proteobacteria); there are in fact about 12 bacterial groups according to Campbell and I really am not qualified to say whether or not they would be phyla or kingdoms. --mav</dd>

<hr />
<p><i>Until very recently it was believed that Bacteria were one of the earliest forms of life to develop, and that more developed organisms developed from them. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, however, three <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> scientists proposed that the simplicity of bacteria was not a product of their primitivness, but rather indicated the sophistication of their development. Bacteria lack much of the duplication and unecessary genetic structure found in other organisms, however, it is now known that this duplicated structure was almost certainly essential for early life to evolve. Bacteria rather than being primitve are, in fact, a stremlined creature that has dropped the unecessary genetic baggage of the past and are probably more recent developments that bulkier protazoa. This simplicty allowed bacteria to survive in a much wider array of locations than other more complex organisms that could not properly duplicate themselves in adverse surroundings. Most important was the ability of bacteria to survive and replicate in much higher temperatures than other organisms which has lead to vast bacteria populations below the Earth's surface.</i></p>
<p>I have an extremely difficult time believing this is anything like the mainstream view. It might be possible that the first organisms must have had more complicated genetic mechanisms might be, but I'm not sure how would be sure. And the idea that bacteria are more recent than protozoa is in direct contradiction with current thinking, which suggests that protozoa originated through endosymbiotic events involving bacteria. I'm going to temporarily remove this from the article, but leave it here in case someone more qualified feels they can NPOV it.</p>

<p>The beginning of the article states that bacteria are the most 'abundant' form of life.

<p>Bacteria are about 1/2 of living tissue by mass, and more than 100.00% by number of living organisms. Of course, we need references. The author below knows something, obviously.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that this was, until quite recently, the conventional wisdom. But recent discoveries have expanded the range of conditions in which we expect to find bacteria. This includes much of the crust that was assumed to be considered uninhabited rock and superheated water. (Effectively, the biosphere is a few miles thicker than we realized, and most of that is inhabited by bacteria and archaea.) I get the impression that most people who think about these things would now agree that prokaryote biomass outweighs eukaryote biomass. But I've only seen a couple calculations and none treat archaea and bacteria differently. I also get the impression that we are constantly revising the limits of bacterial growth, but we have a pretty good grasp of where the plants are.</dd>
<dd>But I agree that 'abundant' is open to interpretation and should maybe be replaced with something more specific and also backed with a citation. <a href="../../../j/m/e/User%7EJmeppley_379f.html" title="User:Jmeppley">Jmeppley</a> 18:51, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Don't forget the atmosphere and space. Perhaps I'll put 'space' as supposed for now as it is still under investigation. There is certainly bacteria that lives primarily in the atmosphere. It is possible some of those escape and continue to live in space (not propogate, they most likely lay dormant for an undisclosed amount of time (even millions\billions of years)) then under the right circumstances start to propogate and mutate once favorable conditions are encountered.</p>
<p>I should also point out -What a small entry for something such as Bacteria-. These things are essential to all life on earth (including the nessessary interactions inside our own bodies needed to sustain ourselves). The oxygen based bacteria had a large influence on oxygen breathing organism today (such as ourselves). If other forms of bacteria turned out to have dominated early on, our world may not have been oxygen based. Methane based bacteria did almost dominate over oxygen based bacteria.</p>
<p>Q: But did the bacteria help create the oxygen (in sybiosis with plants?). Where would have all the methane come from?</p>

<p>This is difficult to answer for sure, largely because the status of bacterial taxonomy is constantly changing, including thoughts about the identities and relationships between the major groups. All in all there are approximately 8000 bacterial species formally recognized but this is a HUGE understatement of the total bacterial diveristy in existence - the problem is there is no universally accepted species concept for prokaryotes making for difficulties in classification. There are huge numbers of sub-specific strains known but almost all are not formally classified. The other problem is that most microbiologists will say that only 1% of all microbes can currently be isolated in pure culture meaning that the current picture of microbial diversity is unreliable. I've seen reviews that suggest that there are ~40 main groups of bacteria of which we can study about 20 and maybe 10 in any sort of breadth. I agree that the taxonomy of bacteria pages should be reworked (perhaps using gene trees generated using e.g. the ribosomal database project or ARB software) but this will take time and perhaps more-than-layman's expertise. As it stands now it's hard to tell what links lead to what information. <a href="../../../j/l/k/User%7EJlk3_2421.html" title="User:Jlk3">Jlk3</a> 00:16, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The naming of Bacteria is a closed case. A citation from a book that is more than 10 years old:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>To avoid the perception that all prokaryotes are closely related (which they are not), the terms Bacteria and Archaea have replaced eubacteria and archaebacteria</i>... Biology of Microorganisms 7th ed, Brock, 1994</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree though that a short article that explains that eubacteria is an old name for Bacteria and maybe a link to Bacteria AND an article that describes the nomenclature system.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaroonus_b03c.html" title="User:Azaroonus">Azaroonus</a> 12:58, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that would be helpful. Could we add something like this to near the top of this article as well: "The kingdom Bacteria was formerly known as <b>Eubacteria</b> to distinguish from <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaea.html" title="Archaea">Archaea</a>, formerly known as <i>Archaebacteria</i>. The new names were adopted in year X to emphasize that there was no close relationship between them." (And use your book as an inline citation.) That would clarify the situation for those of us who studied biology before the names were changed, which certainly was recent enough that people are apt to run into the old nomenclature. <a href="../../../r/i/g/User%7ERigadoun_9ecb.html" title="User:Rigadoun">Rigadoun</a> <a href="../../../r/i/g/User_talk%7ERigadoun_bf8a.html" title="User talk:Rigadoun">(talk)</a> 16:04, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anonymous: I understand how a domains work, I even understand why they're around, but as a modern biologist I take offense to you telling me the are no kingdoms. I do regualarly use kingdoms, I just place domains one step higher. Plants and Animals are certainly in the same domain, and so are protists, but are we not all separated by the less than arbitrary classification of kingdom. If the domain 'Eubacteria' contains only the kingdom of 'Monera,' does the redundant classification void the kingdom specification!? If you were to read the question that I responded to, it asked about 'kingdom', even though a question on domain would have been poignent, my responding question was appropriate<a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdenosine_0f27.html" title="User:Adenosine">Adenosine</a> | <i><a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdenosine_1860.html" title="User talk:Adenosine">Talk</a></i> 08:30, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So you can perhaps see why they might be assuming you weren't a biologist. Anyway, kingdoms (at least for distinguishing life's major branches) are a bit <i>passe</i>, but from what I've been able to gather from WP (being, now, many years removed from my original degree) it's still a very fluid subject, with a few competing high-level systems. It does look like Kingdom Monera has had its day though - putting together bacterial groups as unrelated as the (eu)bacteria and archae, while separating groups as closely related as the eukaryotes is well past its sell-by date. Retaining the other kingdoms (much like the name "bacteria") makes sense from a practical point of view, but it does then require higher order organisation. Hence domains.

<dd>Well, sorry for spliting the comment (it was very unclear). The Protist slip on my part was just a stupid mistake. I did mean monera from the start, I hoped no one would catch me correcting myself. I agree with you <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumbago_5505.html" title="User:Plumbago">Plumbago</a>; you struck my point on the head, and you did it much more polietly, and concisely. As someone who is a biologist by training and profession (even if I may not seem it) I just wanted to lend my vote that if kingdoms aren't used by everyone, they are certainly used by me and people I know. WP's coverage on this is very sparse. I tried to re educate myself on this subject and I found only contradictions, ambiguities, and confusion.

<p>No worries!! I think it is great we share ideas and our interest in the topic, we should not bother being offended by one another&#160;:-) I, too, was guilty of imprecison in my wording because above when I said "modern classification system used by biologists" I should have written microbiologists or maybe even bacteriologists because, as you point out, many biologists (read: those that study eukaryotes) seem to use kingdoms in their classification. But this article is about Bacteria so what system do Bacteriologists prefer?</p>
<p>The three domain system is prefered by microbiologists because is based on molecular taxonomy, specifically 16S/18S rRNA gene comparison, while the 5 kingdom system is rooted in phenotypic characteristics. In my opinion, it is phentypic v. molecular that the major difference - the names are just related to the basis of the classifiaction system used. The reason that microbiologists, particularly microbial ecologists, prefer a molecular taxonomy system is that phenotypic classification does not work very well to classify microbial diversity. Bacteria (and Archaea for that matter) do not have the diversity of structures that even unicellular Eukarya have and therefore phenotypic classification has been based on traits like the ability to metabolise certain substrates etc. Hence for years that thought the <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>Burkolderia</i> were the same bug (Gram negative rod, similar physiology), only to find out that they were each in a different <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phylum.html" title="Phylum">Phylum</a> (Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, respectively). Imagine mistaking a human for a jellyfish&#160;;-) Physiological traits in bacteria have not just been inherited vertically but also horizontally meaning that evolutionarily unrelated species can share similar traits that evolutionarily closely-related species do not. These difficulties can be overcome with molecular taxonomy... thus microbiology gained a systematic way of categorising organisms.</p>
<p>This system has been adopted by may eukaryotic biologists, but as far as I understand (not being a eukaryotic biologist) the phenotypic classification is so applicable to understanding eukaryotic evolution, that molecular classification is used to add sensitivity to the existing groupings, which are still strongly rooted in phenotypic classification. In Bacteriology phenotypic traits are used to add sensitivity to the evolutionary groups determined by molecular classification. For this reason, I think that molecular taxonomy and three-domain system of classification should also be the main system used in the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria.html" title="Bacteria">Bacteria</a> article. We of course need to discuss the phenotypic classification system, indeed this is still used in many labs particularly in clinical microbiology, and is still important. Ideally we need to nunt down some references to support these assertions, such that it is less POV and more <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> if this is to get into the article itself. --<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaroonus_b03c.html" title="User:Azaroonus">Azaroonus</a> 18:29, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All sounds great. I would love to see a standardized taxonomy system for all organisms on wikipedia, bacteria or not. You can see what Wikispecies uses [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. Would this be a suitable system for bacteria &amp; archaea AND plant, animals etc.????? <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdenosine_0f27.html" title="User:Adenosine">Adenosine</a> | <i><a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdenosine_1860.html" title="User talk:Adenosine">Talk</a></i> 22:25, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is not a simple topic and there is no uniform system. Is Wikipedia is the right place to develop a standardised nomenclature system for biology? I guess that it is a our role to figure out which systems are in use in the field and present these.</p>
<p>The system that you link to is the Linnaean (or 5 kingdom) system. Yes, domains are present in that table in Section 1 as a grouping above Kingdom, fine for Eukaryotes because 4 kingdoms are under Eukarya but how do you fit the Bacteria and Archaea into the Kindom Monera? It also says Domains are... <i>not accepted by all biologists</i> <i>.</i> I read this to mean that many biologists disagree that Domains are compatible with this system. The existence of the Domains is not really in question because they are a nomenclature from another valid system. Again the problem with using the system hat you suggest is that it is based on phenotype:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Kingdom</b>: Animalia (with eukaryotic cells having cell membrane but lacking cell wall, multicellular, heterotrophic) "from section 2 of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bacterial classification cannot alone rely on such phenotypic classification alone because it makes classification very difficult. Hence the molecular classification and that is three-domain. It does not make the others wrong, just not useful for microbiology. I have been looking around a bit. Bergey's Manual of Sytematic Bacteriology uses the three-domains in thier "Taxanomic Outline of Prokaryotes" the other ranks being: phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. They write "The rank of Kingdom is not used to prevent conflicts with the Botanical Code where some overlap exists" The Judicial Commission of the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (<a href="http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/50/6/2239.pdf" class="external text" title="http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/50/6/2239.pdf" rel="nofollow">Meeting procedings</a>) put out the "The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes" which are the guidelines used by bacterial taxonomists. I am trying to read this and figure out the system that they use. --<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaroonus_b03c.html" title="User:Azaroonus">Azaroonus</a> 09:05, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

&gt; All bacteria reproduce through asexual reproduction (binary fission) which results in cell division. Two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that facilitate the dispersal of the newly-formed daughter cells. <i><b>Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxococcus and arial hyphae formation by Streptomyces.</b></i> Whoever wrote it, it must be a joke, too many letters for a typo.</p>

<p>There is a fair bit of discussion here on the Talk: Bacteria page and I have tried to incorporate the comments that I have read here.

The intro also outlines the most important of the areas that I think should be the focus in the article.</p>
<p>After all of the discussion about nomenclature of Bacteria I have added the short paragraph on this subject. No doubt the article should contain a more comprehensive section covering these issues in the body text.</p>

<p>The history of bacteriology section is not really specific to bacteria, rather than microbiology. There might be good reason for a separate "bacterial diseases" article--I am thinking of the textbooks with this all put in a second part.</p>
<p>Perhaps the metabolism section should be fuller, with a table. Most readers of this won't know any biochemistry. Since these distinctions are so critical to the overall understanding, it might be best to give each of them a subsection, and not rely on the taxobox. I think there are to many refs. At this general level it should rarely be necessary to refer to a primary article rather than a review, except for the very latest developments. I'm partic. bothered by 23, 26, 27*,33, 36, 46, 48, 57, 63, 69, 73, 80, 86, 88, 89*, 93* * indicates ones that i feel most strongly about.

<p>As of 2/Dec2006 this article is 82kb in size. I think we simply can't fit anything more in here without removing material at the same time. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimVickers_d98e.html" title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 18:25, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The 82k limit is a suggestion and could be argued that an article of such central significance might exceed this guideline. It is important that we do not leave out important content because of old drafts that contain less important information. I also think that there are things that could be removed. The most important parts of the article are outlined in the introduction as I said on the FAC page. Over the description of what a bacterium is, the article should cover: Signifcance to health and Ecological significance. Please give me a chance to make the additions that I am proposing without deleting them. And then once that is on the table we have something to discuss.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaroonus_b03c.html" title="User:Azaroonus">Azaroonus</a> 18:42, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, go right ahead. This "old draft" is all yours to improve! <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimVickers_d98e.html" title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 19:09, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you can see my suggested changes do not increase the size of the article but use the text contained in the relationships section. As I have said before I think that these "Significance" sections are critical to the article. If you want deletion candidates let's consider: history section (see my comments on the FAC page), and the movement and parts of growth (eg. dicsussion of k/r strategists etc.)which are a bit too technical I think and could be reduced to a link to the other articles. Currently putting together some text for the environment section. There are two main points to add here: that most environmental bacteria cannot be cultured and that bacteria are essential to global nutrient cycles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think your changes neither add to the clarity nor informativeness of the article. The text is now poorly-integrated and lacks a clear, logical structure. For example:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The majority of the text in the Environment section deals with hydrogen transfer between symbiotic anerobes, but the environmental significance of this is not explained.</li>
<li>Commensal bacteria are now in Human health, but have no bearing on human health, as they are commensal.</li>
<li>The beginning of the human health section is now a set of unrelated facts with no overall message.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the article was better before these changes. However, this is just my opinion. I will therefore not revert this change, but will add a note on the FAC page with links to the two versions and ask which people prefer. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimVickers_d98e.html" title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 21:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I can see the point with your comments regarding the details of the section there and these issues can be fixed (especially the Environment section, i made note of the things still to be added in the above paragraph). I will make a couple of points on the FAC page about my changes but I would prefer that this was not a "showdown". --<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaroonus_b03c.html" title="User:Azaroonus">Azaroonus</a> 21:33, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This isn't a showdown and I would not usually make such a fuss over re-arranging an article.

<dd>I think you are right that the average reader may want a more human-centic approach to this subject. I've therefore reverted to the original but moved the section you created to a new page called <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria_and_human_health.html" title="Bacteria and human health">Bacteria and human health</a>. I put a link to this at the top of the Pathogens section. I hope this compromise works OK, as it will give the general reader a place to go for the more disease-based approach which was lacking in the original. Perhaps we can follow a similar approach with environmental significance? We could create a new page on bacteria in the environment or Significance of bacteria to the environment and a link to further information as in the other 2 sections? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimVickers_d98e.html" title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 00:21, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point, I was only considering fatal diseases, I suppose if you count something like spots caused by minor staph skin infections as diseases, they will be almost universal. For fatal diseases, <a href="http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/statistics/gbdwhoregionmortality2002.xls" class="external text" title="http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/statistics/gbdwhoregionmortality2002.xls" rel="nofollow">WHO mortailty data</a> TB is the most common bacterial infectious disease. Although in total, diarrhoeal diseases kill slightly more people, they are a large set of conditions most commonly caused by viruses. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=15353966&amp;query_hl=6&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=15353966&amp;query_hl=6&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" rel="nofollow">ref</a> I'll add this WHO data as a reference. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimVickers_d98e.html" title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 18:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good job getting the WHO data. Adding fatal certainly makes it better, but I'm still not entirely convinced that TB is the leading bacterial cause of fatality. TB is easily the leading bacterial killer in adults, but relatively few children die from TB, with more from diarrhoeal (which is split between multiple species and also viruses, I agree) and respiratory diseases (mostly staph). Looking at the spreadsheet, respiratory infections aside from TB kill twice as many people as TB (with an inverse distribution curve, with the young and old being killed). Off the top of my head, staph probably constitutes around half of respiratory infectious deaths, more in the elderly and the young in third world countries. From the data in the spreadsheet we can't tell, because they don't break it down into pathogen, but I would be hesitant to make the claim that TB is the biggest killer without such data (a claim that is not made in the TB article). <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 19:23, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since TB can also be classified as a respiratory infection, I re-worded to state that respiratory infections are most common, with TB as a leading example.

<dd>The stat is true by cell number, not true by mass/weight, because bacterial cells are so very much smaller than human cells.

<dd>Actually, "germs" are usually defined as "pathogenic microorganisms" -- very small organisms that can cause disease. Since "microorganism" includes <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fungi.html" title="Fungi">fungi</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protozoa.html" title="Protozoa">protozoans</a>, "germs" can't just redirect to <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria.html" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoTolo_8040.html" title="User:MarcoTolo">MarcoTolo</a> 22:46, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
