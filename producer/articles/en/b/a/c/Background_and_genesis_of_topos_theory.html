	    <p>This page gives some very general background to the mathematical idea of <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topos.html" title="Topos">topos</a>. This is an aspect of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category_theory.html" title="Category theory">category theory</a>, and has a reputation for being abstruse. The level of abstraction involved cannot be reduced beyond a certain point; but on the other hand context can be given. This is partly in terms of historical development, but also to some extent an explanation of differing attitudes to category theory.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, the foundations of <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_geometry.html" title="Algebraic geometry">algebraic geometry</a> were being rewritten; and it is here that the origins of the <b>topos</b> concept are to be found. At that time the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weil_conjectures.html" title="Weil conjectures">Weil conjectures</a> were an outstanding motivation to research. As we now know, the route towards their proof, and other advances, lay in the construction of <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/a/%C3%89tale_cohomology.html" title="Étale cohomology">étale cohomology</a>.</p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, it can be said that algebraic geometry had been wrestling with two problems, for a long time. The first was to do with its <i><b>points</b></i>: back in the days of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Projective_geometry.html" title="Projective geometry">projective geometry</a> it was clear that the absence of 'enough' points on an <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_variety.html" title="Algebraic variety">algebraic variety</a> was a barrier to having a good geometric theory (in which it was somewhat like a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact.html" title="Compact">compact</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifold.html" title="Manifold">manifold</a>). There was also the difficulty, that was clear as soon as <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topology.html" title="Topology">topology</a> took form in the first half of the twentieth century, that the topology of algebraic varieties had 'too few' open sets.</p>
<p>The question of points was close to resolution by <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>; Grothendieck took a sweeping step (appealing to the <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yoneda_lemma.html" title="Yoneda lemma">Yoneda lemma</a>) that disposed of it — naturally at a cost, that every variety or more general <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/Scheme_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Scheme (mathematics)">scheme</a></i> should become a <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functor.html" title="Functor">functor</a>. It wasn't possible to <i>add</i> open sets, though. The way forward was otherwise.</p>
<p>The topos definition first appeared somewhat obliquely, in or about <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>. General problems of so-called '<a href="../../../d/e/s/Descent_%28category_theory%29.html" title="Descent (category theory)">descent</a>' in algebraic geometry were considered, at the same period when the <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_group.html" title="Fundamental group">fundamental group</a> was generalised to the algebraic geometry setting (as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-finite_group.html" title="Pro-finite group">pro-finite group</a>). In the light of later work (c. 1970), 'descent' is part of the theory of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comonad.html" title="Comonad">comonads</a>; here we can see one way in which the Grothendieck school bifurcates in its approach from the 'pure' category theorists, a theme that is important for the understanding of how the topos concept was later treated.</p>
<p>There was perhaps a more direct route available: the <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abelian_category.html" title="Abelian category">abelian category</a> concept had been introduced by Grothendieck in his foundational work on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homological_algebra.html" title="Homological algebra">homological algebra</a>, to unify categories of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheaf_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Sheaf (mathematics)">sheaves</a> of abelian groups, and of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Module_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Module (mathematics)">modules</a>. An abelian category is supposed to be closed under certain category-theoretic operations — by using this kind of definition one can focus entirely on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structure_%28category_theory%29.html" title="Structure (category theory)">structure</a>, saying nothing at all about the nature of the objects involved. This type of definition traces back, in one line, to the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lattice_%28order%29.html" title="Lattice (order)">lattice</a> concept of the 1930s. It was a possible question to pose, around <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, about a similar purely category-theoretic characterisation, of categories of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheaf_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Sheaf (mathematics)">sheaves</a> of <i>sets</i>, the case of sheaves of abelian groups having been subsumed by Grothendieck's work (the <i>Tohoku</i> paper).</p>
<p>Such a definition of a topos was eventually given five years later, around <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, by Grothendieck and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Louis_Verdier_a932.html" title="Jean-Louis Verdier">Verdier</a> (see Verdier's Bourbaki seminar <i>Analysis Situs</i>). The characterisation was by means of categories 'with enough <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colimit.html" title="Colimit">colimits</a>', and applied to what is now called a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grothendieck_topos.html" title="Grothendieck topos">Grothendieck topos</a>. The theory rounded itself out, by establishing that a Grothendieck topos was a category of sheaves, where now the word <i>sheaf</i> had acquired an extended meaning with respect to the idea of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grothendieck_topology.html" title="Grothendieck topology">Grothendieck topology</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of a Grothendieck topology (also known as a <i>site</i>) has been characterised by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tate_977d.html" title="John Tate">John Tate</a> as a bold pun on the two senses of <a href="../../../r/i/e/Riemann_surface.html" title="Riemann surface">Riemann surface</a>. Technically speaking it enabled the construction of the sought-after étale cohomology (as well as other refined theories such as <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_cohomology.html" title="Flat cohomology">flat cohomology</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystalline_cohomology.html" title="Crystalline cohomology">crystalline cohomology</a>). At this point — about <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> — the developments powered by algebraic geometry had largely run their course. The 'open set' discussion had effectively been summed up in the conclusion that varieties had a rich enough <i>site</i> of open sets in <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramification.html" title="Ramification">unramified</a> covers of their (ordinary) <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zariski_topology.html" title="Zariski topology">Zariski-open sets</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Background_and_genesis_of_topos_theory.html" title="Edit section: From pure category theory to categorical logic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">From pure category theory to categorical logic</span></h3>
<p>The current definition of <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topos.html" title="Topos">topos</a> goes back to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lawvere_088f.html" title="William Lawvere">William Lawvere</a> and Myles Tierney. While the timing follows closely on from that described above, as a matter of history, the attitude is different, and the definition is more inclusive. That is, there are examples of <b>toposes</b> that are not a <b>Grothendieck topos</b>. What is more, these may be of interest for a number of logical disciplines.</p>
<p>Lawvere and Tierney's definition picks out the central role in topos theory of the <b><a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-object_classifier.html" title="Sub-object classifier">sub-object classifier</a></b>. In the usual category of sets, this is the two-element set of Boolean truth-values, <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>. It is almost tautologous to say that the subsets of a given set <i>X</i> are <i>the same as</i> (just as good as) the functions on <i>X</i> to any such given two-element set: fix the 'first' element and make a subset <i>Y</i> correspond to the function sending <i>Y</i> there and its complement in <i>X</i> to the other element.</p>
<p>Now sub-object classifiers can be found in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheaf_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Sheaf (mathematics)">sheaf</a> theory. Still tautologously, though certainly more abstractly, for a <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topological_space.html" title="Topological space">topological space</a> <i>X</i> there is a direct description of a sheaf on <i>X</i> that plays the role with respect to all sheaves of sets on <i>X</i>. Its set of sections over an open set <i>U</i> of <i>X</i> is just the set of open subsets of <i>U</i>. The <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheaf_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Sheaf (mathematics)">space associated with a sheaf</a> it is more difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Lawvere and Tierney therefore formulated <b>axioms for a topos</b> that assumed a sub-object classifier, and some limit conditions (to make a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartesian-closed_category.html" title="Cartesian-closed category">cartesian-closed category</a>, at least). For a while this notion of topos was called 'elementary topos'.</p>
<p>Once the idea of a connection with logic was formulated, there were several developments 'testing' the new theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>models of set theory corresponding to proofs of the independence of the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axiom_of_choice.html" title="Axiom of choice">axiom of choice</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuum_hypothesis.html" title="Continuum hypothesis">continuum hypothesis</a> by Cohen's method of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forcing_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Forcing (mathematics)">forcing</a> .</li>
<li>recognition of the connection with <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kripke_semantics.html" title="Kripke semantics">Kripke semantics</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuitionistic_logic.html" title="Intuitionistic logic">intuitionistic</a> <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_quantifier.html" title="Existential quantifier">existential quantifier</a></li>
<li>combining these, discussion of the intuitionistic theory of real numbers, by sheaf models.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Background_and_genesis_of_topos_theory.html" title="Edit section: Position of topos theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Position of topos theory</span></h3>
<p>There was some irony that in the pushing through of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hilbert_de68.html" title="David Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>'s long-range programme a natural home for <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuitionistic_logic.html" title="Intuitionistic logic">intuitionistic logic</a>'s central ideas was found: Hilbert had detested, not even cordially, the school of <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._E._J._Brouwer_4f70.html" title="L. E. J. Brouwer">L. E. J. Brouwer</a>. Existence as 'local' existence in the sheaf-theoretic sense, now going by the name of <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kripke-Joyal_semantics_9eb5.html" title="Kripke-Joyal semantics">Kripke-Joyal semantics</a>, is a good match. On the other hand Brouwer's long efforts on 'species', as he called the intuitionistic theory of reals, are presumably in some way subsumed and deprived of status beyond the historical. There is a theory of the real numbers in each topos, and so no one master intuitionist theory.</p>
<p>The later work on <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/a/%C3%89tale_cohomology.html" title="Étale cohomology">étale cohomology</a> has tended to suggest that the full, general topos theory isn't required. On the other hand, other sites are used, and the Grothendieck topos has taken its place within homological algebra.</p>
<p>The Lawvere programme was to write higher-order logic in terms of category theory. That this can be done cleanly is shown by the book treatment by Lambek and Scott. What results is essentially an intuitionistic (i.e. constructivist) theory, its content being clarified by the existence of a <i>free topos</i>. That is a set theory, in a broad sense, but also something belonging to the realm of pure <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syntax.html" title="Syntax">syntax</a>. The structure on its sub-object classifier is that of a <a href="../../../h/e/y/Heyting_algebra.html" title="Heyting algebra">Heyting algebra</a>. To get a more classical set theory one needs that to be upgraded to a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a>, a return to the case of two Boolean truth-values. In that book, the talk is about constructivist mathematics; but in fact this can be read as foundational <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a> (which is not mentioned). If one wants to discuss set-theoretic operations, such as the formation of the image (range) of a function, a topos is guaranteed to be able to express this, entirely constructively.</p>
<p>It also produced a more accessible spin-off in <a href="../../../p/o/i/Pointless_topology.html" title="Pointless topology">pointless topology</a>, where the <i>locale</i> concept isolates some of more accessible insights found by treating <i>topos</i> as a significant development of <i>topological space</i>. The slogan is 'points come later': this brings discussion full circle on this page. The point of view is written up in Peter Johnstone's <i>Stone Spaces</i>, which has been called by a leader in the field of computer science 'a treatise on <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extensionality.html" title="Extensionality">extensionality</a>'. The extensional is treated in mathematics as ambient - it is not something about which mathematicians really expect to have a theory. Perhaps this is why topos theory has been treated as an oddity; it goes beyond what the traditionally geometric way of thinking allows. The needs of thoroughly intensional theories such as untyped <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_calculus.html" title="Lambda calculus">lambda calculus</a> have been met in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denotational_semantics.html" title="Denotational semantics">denotational semantics</a>. Topos theory has long <i><b>looked</b></i> like a possible 'master theory' in this area.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Background_and_genesis_of_topos_theory.html" title="Edit section: Summary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h3>
<p>The <b>topos</b> concept arose in algebraic geometry, as a consequence of combining the concept of <i>sheaf</i> and <i>closure under categorical operations</i>. It plays a certain definite role in cohomology theories.</p>
<p>The subsequent developments associated with logic are more interdisciplinary. They include examples drawing on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homotopy_theory.html" title="Homotopy theory">homotopy theory</a> (classifying toposes). They involve links between category theory and mathematical logic, and also (as a high-level, organisational discussion) between category theory and theoretical computer science based on <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_theory.html" title="Type theory">type theory</a>. Granted the general view of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saunders_Mac_Lane_74e8.html" title="Saunders Mac Lane">Saunders Mac Lane</a> about <i>ubiquity</i> of concepts, this gives them a definite status. A 'killer application' is <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/a/%C3%89tale_cohomology.html" title="Étale cohomology">étale cohomology</a>.</p>
