<p>just curious if this is good enough to be in the article, there are many articles and sites that reveal the oddity of the song "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" Backmasked, would the song qualify as a good enough song to be backmasked</p>

<p>I have never heard about Darkthrone using backmasking, it makes me even more skeptical due to the fact that they are so overtly anti-christian they don't need to use backmasked messages and also the fact that they use so little production and are against production as a whole that even the process of backmasking is too technical for them. I would like someone to get a decent source/sound sample or I'm going to delete the reference. I'm not going to be reversing my copys of the album just to find out. Even if its true I don't think it is necessary to be included in this artical due to the previously stated anti-christian views of the band. --<a href="../../../x/d/i/User%7EXdiabolicalx_68c5.html" title="User:Xdiabolicalx">Xdiabolicalx</a> 01:30, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the links, I can hear it now. Does simply reversing the voice count as back masking though?

<dd>Yes, it does count as backmasking. That's basically what Zeppelin was accused of. One of the reasons why I don't think the Zeppelin accusations are true is that the "voices" are so hard to hear - if they wanted kids to hear messages in their songs, why would they make them so hard to hear? <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font></a><font color="lime">α</font><a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudacity_d3f0.html" title="User talk:Audacity"><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 01:04, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section's still not right. 1. I think attention should be drawn to the fact that satanic themes are a large part of Cradle of Filth's image and general lyrical content, as with many other similar bands, and that backmasking 'satanic messages' into their songs is a creative extension of these themes. 2. One should not categorize a backmasked message as 'clearly deliberately satanic' unless one is certain(ie. some citation please). How can you be sure these messages weren't parodies? They may have been executed in a serious tone, but how can you determine the reasoning behind their inclusion in a song? Best to put these under 'alleged satanic messages', as you'll never know for sure without confirmation from the artists themselves. 3. What happened to artistic license anyway? Music is a fiction, and should not be seen as a declaration of the artist's beliefs or opinions. If I write a novel about a murderer, does that mean I advocate murder? Does it make <i>me</i> a murderer? 86.129.54.139 06:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>My research started when I was looking up meanings for certain songs, like Hotel California (The Eagles), and then I looked up Stairway to Heaven. At the start, they're talking about a prostitute, but I wanted to see if there were a story to the song, like what Pink Floyd had done with his most famous album "The Wall." I was looking around on the Internet about backmasking, and I had seen some rumors floating around, and so I had done some experimenting. Though they may not have meant for the lyrics to come out the way they did backwards (which would be very, very hard to do by accident, as I had tried doing the vocals myself to see what would show up, and I could only hear the word "Satan." The backwards section is in the lyrics "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May Queen. Yes there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run; there's still time to change the road you're on." Play it backwards and you really can hear about "sweet Satan." I made an mp3 section of that part, then I had reversed the part and saved it, and you can hear it, you have to listen to hear the beginning, but the lyrics are there. You can download the forwards section at <a href="http://rapidshare.de/files/23589828/Forwards.rar.html" class="external free" title="http://rapidshare.de/files/23589828/Forwards.rar.html" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.de/files/23589828/Forwards.rar.html</a> and download the reverse section at <a href="http://rapidshare.de/files/23589879/Backwards.rar.html" class="external free" title="http://rapidshare.de/files/23589879/Backwards.rar.html" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.de/files/23589879/Backwards.rar.html</a>. If you have any questions on what I have printed, please contact me at aaronarmstrong13@hotmail.com. And I am not ranting on about Satanic messages. This is what backmasking had for Zeppelin's song. Though Robert Plant claims to have written the lyrics "next to an open fire" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven</a>), the track still speaks volumes backwards.</p>

<dd>It is worth noting that, given a randomly generated series of syllables spoken in a variety of accents, a two-syllable pair that can be liberally interpreted as "Satan" is very easy to generate.

<p>The whole idea that running a message backwards would be comprehensible on even a subconsious level is a little difficult for me to get.

I think that the failure of the Judas Priest lawsuit indicates that there is no hard evidence of that effect. <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font></a><font color="lime">α</font><a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudacity_d3f0.html" title="User talk:Audacity"><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 16:14, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's no science backing that people can perceive the message backwards; however, certainly some artists, (Tally Hall) have deliberately added backmasking to songs, obviously for artistic effect and not for the intention of subconscious control. If the backmasking is obvious enough, people can easily tell that the track IS backmasked, though they won't be able to understand what it means.</p>

<dd>Thanks for responding. I guess, to rephrase my confusion, I have little more to express than my own awe that someone "thought of" this idea in the first place; to me, it's like saying that a message printed on the reverse side of an <a href="../../../o/p/a/Opaque.html" title="Opaque">opaque</a> sheet of paper will have a subliminal effect, because it seems humans are just as capable of reading that as they are of "listening backwards." --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenoxus_9f29.html" title="User:Lenoxus">Lenoxus</a>

<dd>While not wanting to give too much credibility to the subconscious influence theory, I wonder - why wouldn't a transparent or translucent piece of paper be a better metaphor? <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font><font color="lime">α</font><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 20:12, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Indeed, it would. What still makes a "wall" for me (hence the "opacity") is the element of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a>. After all, it's not that hard to train yourself to read something backwards, even at the exact same rate as one reads forward, because the direction of reading is naturally arbitrary. But to "listen backwards" would require the memorization not only of phonetic sounds in addition to a kind of intrinsic understanding of the fact that imperfect articulation/recording means that a "perfect reverse" isn't the same as the "real thing", and varies considerably from one speaker/accent/etc to the next. --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenoxus_9f29.html" title="User:Lenoxus">Lenoxus</a> 04:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'm taking out the part about John Lennon being "Under the influence of Cannabis" because it's retarded. Anybody who's actually smoked pot knows that it isn't some kind of freaky psychedelic mind-altering trip or something. So stating anything about somebody doing something "Under the influence of cannabis" is stupid. If you wanted to say that he was stoned and he thought it sounded cool, that's fine. But "Under the influence" makes it sound like there's some major perception altering going on when there isn't. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.214.139.81 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.139.81_81c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.139.81">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>That they are "entirely coincidental" is not true. If you read the article, there is a clear divide between the alleged messages — which I am pretty sure are coincidence, but which NPOV prevents us from classifying as such — and the deliberate messages, which should all be real backmasking. If you go to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_backmasked_messages.html" title="List of backmasked messages">List of backmasked messages</a>, you can hear /sat"Satan Spawn, the Caco-Daemon" backwards, and it's clearly intentional.

As for "Hell Awaits", I don't remember if I've listened to it myself, but it is cited in sites like <a href="http://www.slayerized.com/band/didyouknow.html" class="external text" title="http://www.slayerized.com/band/didyouknow.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, which clearly have no "conservative" agenda. <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font><font color="blue">α</font><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 00:13, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough, but unless admitted by the recording artist in question, or by the label representing them, there is no actual proof that they <i>are</i> clearly intentional; they could easily be <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_positives.html" title="False positives">false positives</a>. Anyway, the sites the citations link to seem to be unofficial and are merely pointing out the perceived words in the backmasking – not <i>proving</i> they were intentional at all. To say they are clearly intentional without confirmation from a reliable source does tip the neutrality a bit. <a href="../../../r/u/b/User%7ERubberkeith_a716.html" title="User:Rubberkeith">Rubberkeith</a> 09:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I admit that the sources don't necessarily confirm the artists' intention to create a backwards message. But I'm certain that "Dinner at Deviant's Palace" and "Satan Spawn, the Caco-Daemon" are not false positives. The messages are gibberish forwards, and it is not plausible that a band would include random gibberish in a song that would somehow turn into a clearly audible message when played backwards. Here's a quote from <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_cul5.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_cul5.htm" rel="nofollow">a good source</a>:</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>[Intentional backward masking] can only be done intentionally -- by design. It first appeared in the late 1960s as a result of an accidental tape mixing error by John Lennon in the Beatles' song "Rain." He liked it and left it in. It is easy to recognize: when the music is played normally, one hears a passage that sounds like gibberish -- vaguely word-like, as if it is in a foreign language. Played backwards, clear, understandable phrase or sentence is heard.</p>

<dd>So though the particular sites may only confirm the existence of a clear message, we can assume that any clear message is deliberate backmasking. <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font><font color="blue">α</font><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 18:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Replying to request for third opinion). This article is filled with poor sources and very poor use of sources. For example, the statement about John Lennon being high on cannabis is a very poor use of sources. They say no such thing in reference to the song it is connected with in the article. It is mentioned for the song "Rain", but someone's Geocities site is not a reliable source. The "Satanic message" section is very problematic. Its sources are a fan site, an obviously biased site that promotes some "fringe" (to be polite) ideas<a href="http://www.ccsg.it/VerNas.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccsg.it/VerNas.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, the Angelfire page of a small internet group and a Usenet FAQ. These are hardly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. This article needs serious work.

<dd>This opinion is inline with section 15 (<i>Sentence reading "Other artists accused of backmasking" needs sources/citations</i>), where two other editors besides myself expressed reservations about sources not meeting <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and section 16 (<i>POV &amp; OR tags</i>) where <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> placed an original research and POV tags.</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Vassyana. The underlying problem is that there is little scholarly material on deliberate backmasking (in contrast, a fair amount has been written about the alleged backmasking involved in the Judas Priest and other controversies), which leads to a dilemma between ignoring various interesting and relevant messages which are out there, or using less-than-superb references to document these messages. I have generally taken the second approach, because, "If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore them." Anyway, see if the new sources for the Lennon and Satanic sections meet your approval. <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font><font color="blue">α</font><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 04:02, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There are a great many books and news articles that have been written over the years about this topic. There is <i>no need</i> for unreliable internet sources. I'd suggest tagging the article and purging information that cannot be sourced within a week. If sources can be found at a later date, the history preserves the information for reference. Wikipedia aims to provide a reliable encyclopedia. This cannot be done with articles heavily reliant on improper sources. Try <a href="http://books.google.com" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google Books</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a> to get you started.

<dd>There is certainly some published work dealing with actual messages, but I would be willing to bet that no book describes the Slayer message. They seem to focus on the same messages, from the same time periods. So I'm not sure if I agree that there's no need for unreliable (in some ways, at least) internet sources. But you are certainly right that a good book would beef up the article. <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font><font color="blue">α</font><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 20:37, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rating an article in the B Class is to help those editors working on the creation of the Wikipedia's first CD-ROM release. Articles of Mid to Top importance, for example, would probably include most of the topics found in the one-volume 51,000 article <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Encyclopedia_b1be.html" title="Columbia Encyclopedia">Columbia Encyclopedia</a>. I sincerely doubt this article should rated so high. Another example of WP:OWN. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 02:26, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you objecting to the B-class, the Mid importance, or both? For the B-class, I do believe that the article has "a majority of the material needed for a completed article", and is useful to many readers. I don't believe the article needs to be expanded, so it's not a Start-class article. In terms of the class, I believe that most people have heard of backwards messages in records, as just about everyone I've asked about the subject has known about something, whether it be the Stairway to Heaven message or the Judas Priest trial. <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font><font color="blue">α</font><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 02:32, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I agree. My guess is that Dean Corbin gets messages about backmasking, investigates, and posts the results. So the site qualifies as a "self-published source", and is not reliable according to Wikipedia:Attribution. And yet, Corbin is reliable; his analysis has been correct in every instance I have checked out. So I don't see why we must treat the site as unreliable when it is actually reliable. Again, "If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore them". <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font><font color="blue">α</font><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 04:28, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Backmasking is often used to censor words and phrases deemed as inappropriate on radio edits and edited album releases.[citation needed] This practice is most often applied in rap music. One particularly common example involves the word "shit" being backmasked to sound like "ish". As a result, "ish" has become a euphemism for "shit". An example of backmasking used as censorship is on the album, "Better Dayz" by 2pac, where all profanity, drug references, violence, and even names of certain rappers are backmasked.</p>
<p>ill try to find a citation for this as i think it is important then can be added to the main article -- <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupreme_euphanasia_b91f.html" title="User:Supreme euphanasia">Supreme euphanasia</a> 07:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
