<p>Historically, law students used to study both <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_law_%28legal_system%29.html" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a>. Today, this is much less common. However, a few institutions, such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff_University_a727.html" title="Cardiff University">Cardiff University</a>'s Department of Canon (Ecclesiastical) Law and <a href="../../../m/c/g/McGill_University_08fe.html" title="McGill University">McGill University</a>'s and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Ottawa_588d.html" title="University of Ottawa">University of Ottawa</a>'s combined programme, continue to offer alternatives to the common law.</p>
<p><a name="Common_law_countries_generally" id="Common_law_countries_generally"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Laws_a1d1.html" title="Edit section: Common law countries generally">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Common law countries generally</span></h3>
<p>In most common law countries (with the exception of Canada and the U.S.), the Bachelor of Laws programme is generally entered directly after completion of secondary school, but some universities in Britain and Australia also offer the programme as an accelerated (shorter duration), second-entry programme for the LL.B following completion of a previous undergraduate degree.</p>
<p><a name="Canada" id="Canada"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Laws_a1d1.html" title="Edit section: Canada">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Canada</span></h3>
<p>Canada has a dual system of laws. In the province of Quebec, a system of civil law is used. At the federal level, as well as in every province or territory except Quebec, a system of common law is used. Because of this, there are two Canadian law degrees available.</p>
<p>The programme of study for the common law LL.B is generally a second-entry degree programme. While the degree awarded is at the first-degree level and admission may be granted to applicants with two or three years of undergraduate studies towards a degree, in practice the programme generally requires completion of a previous undergraduate degree before registration in that programme. In fact, almost all admitted law students hold at least a bachelor level degree, and a significant number hold a graduate level degree as well.</p>
<p>The common law programme is three years in length. At that time, the graduate holds a Bachelor of Laws degree, but cannot practice law yet. In order to practice law, the graduate must then be licensed by the Law Society of the province where he/she wishes to practice law. (See <b>Becoming a Lawyer</b> below.) Those law graduates wishing to become law professors instead of lawyers would have to obtain a more advanced law degree such as the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Laws_bfe5.html" title="Master of Laws">Master of Laws</a> (LL.M) or the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Laws_c7ae.html" title="Doctor of Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> (LL.D, S.J.D. or D. JUR) at a law school offering programmes leading to such degrees.</p>
<p>The civil law programme in Canada is three years in length. The programme of study for the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law_afde.html" title="Bachelor of Civil Law">first degree in Quebec civil law</a> (called LL.B, B.C.L. or LL.L) is a first-entry degree programme. Like other first-entry university programmes in Quebec it requires a <a href="../../../c/e/g/CEGEP_3a45.html" title="CEGEP">CEGEP</a> diploma for entry.</p>
<p>Law schools that offer civil law B.C.L. or LL.L degrees include McGill University and the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>Because of Canada's dual system of laws, some law schools offer joint or dual degrees of common law and civil law. McGill University and the University of Ottawa are two law schools which offer such degrees.</p>
<p>The law degree offered by McGill University is a mandatory joint common law LL.B / Quebec civil law B.C.L. degree. The programme is four years in length. Admission to that programme is a first-entry programme in the case of Quebec students (as the CEGEP diploma is required) while it is a second-entry programme in the case of students from other provinces (since two years of university studies is required - effectively one extra year of studies more than for a CEGEP diploma). The University of Ottawa offers a civil law degree (LL.L) on its own.</p>
<p>A number of Canadian law schools offer students the opportunity to earn, besides their three-year first degrees in common law, programs in common law for holders of baccalaureate degrees in Quebec civil law enabling those individuals to earn the LL.B in common law in two or three semesters, depending on the offering university's program. Similarly, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Ottawa_588d.html" title="University of Ottawa">University of Ottawa</a> offers, besides its three year LL.L program in Quebec civil law, a one year LL.L program in Quebec civil law for holders of an LL.B or J.D. degree in common law from a Canadian law school.</p>
<p>Additionally, some Canadian universities with <i>common law</i> law schools have an arrangement with a Canadian university with a <i>Quebec civil law law school</i> enabling students to obtain the home school's law degree in three years and the exchange school's law degree in the fourth year.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the LL.B degree (or its equivalent), graduates are generally qualified to apply for membership of the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28law%29.html" title="Bar (law)">bar</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_society.html" title="Law society">law society</a>. The membership eligibility bestowed may be subject to completion of professional exams. A student may have to gain a further qualification at postgraduate level, for example the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_Practice_Course_2a84.html" title="Legal Practice Course">Legal Practice Course</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_vocational_course.html" title="Bar vocational course">Bar Vocational Course</a> in England and Wales or the <a href="../../../p/c/l/PCLL_756a.html" title="PCLL">PCLL</a> in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, LL.B graduates are required to undertake a one year articled clerkship or the Legal Practice Course (Commonly Practical Legal Training or PLT) before applying for registration as a <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitor.html" title="Solicitor">solicitor</a>. Membership of the Bar is restricted to Barristers, and is attained through the successful completion of an exam and a nine-month period of tutelage (the reading period) under a senior Barrister.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the lawyer licensing process usually requires the law graduate to 1.) take further classroom law courses, taught by the law society itself, and pass a set of written examinations, commonly referred to as <b>bar exams</b>, related to the taken courses and 2.) complete articled clerkship commonly known as <b>articling</b>. Although the vast majority of law graduates fulfill the articled clerkship requirement by articling (i.e. working and learning) in a law firm, a government's legal department, a business corporation's (in house) legal department, a community legal clinic or some other type of non-profit organization involved in legal work, a small minority of law graduates (with exceptional academic records) satisfy the articled clerkship requirement by undergoing what is commonly called <b>clerkship</b> with a specific courthouse and under the supervision of a judge instead of working in a more "lawyer-type environment" under the supervision of a lawyer called a <b>"principal"</b>. In either articling or clerkship, there is the expectation that the law graduate will work in a variety of legal fields and be exposed to the harsh realities of legal practice that are absent from law school's academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the Province of Ontario, for example, the licensing process for the Law Society of Upper Canada (Ontario's governing law society) consists of three mandatory components: The Skills and Professional Responsibility Program with assignments and assessments, Licensing Examinations (a Barrister Licensing Examination and a Solicitor Licensing Examination), and a 10-month Articling term.<a href="http://mrc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/licensingprocess/index.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://mrc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/licensingprocess/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>At the conclusion of the licensing process, the law graduate is "called to the bar" whereby he/she signs his/her name in the rolls of solicitors and swears lawyer-related oaths in a formal ceremony where he/she must appear in a complete barrister's gown and bow before judges of the local superior court and benchers of the licensing law society. After the call ceremony, he/she can designate him/herself as a "solicitor and barrister", and can practice law in the province in which he/she is licensed. In the Province of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, licensed lawyers are automatically permitted to practice the powers of a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notary_Public_1259.html" title="Notary Public">Notary Public</a>. In Ontario and other provinces, a licensed lawyer requires further licensing from another authority, such as the provincial attorney general, before he/she can work in a Notary Public capacity.</p>
<p>Although not required by the licensing process, many 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> year law students work in law firms during the summer off-school season to earn extra money and to guarantee themselves an articling position (with the same law firms) upon their graduation from law school, because there is always fierce competition for articling positions, especially for those in large law firms offering attractive remuneration and prestige, and a law graduate cannot become a licensed lawyer in Canada if he/she has not gone through articled clerkship.</p>

This program entails three years of full-time study. The advantage of Combined Law over Graduate Law is one year less of university study. The Sydney LLB enables graduates to practise in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Many graduates go on to successfully practise in the United Kingdom and Canada, owing to their background in Common Law . Graduates can also practise in Civil Law countries provided they meet any additional criteria required by the particular jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In Pakistan, a person going for a LLB degree should have a bachelor's degree. Most law students choose to obtain a two year bachelor degree before enrolling for a LLB degree in a law college. The LLB itself is a three year programme.In Punjab, a five year joint BA/LLB degree is being offered by law colleges.</p>
<p>After obtaining a LLB degree, a person wishing to practise has to intimate the concerned Bar Council that he is undergoing a six month training period under the supervision of a High Court lawyer with ten year standing. After he completes the pupillage, he will be asked to take a written test and undergo a viva-voce exam.</p>

<p>Some universities in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> offer variations of this degree, such as the LL.B (Europe), which generally take four years to complete and include a wider range of topics as well as some degree of specialisation.</p>
<p>Various universities in the United Kingdom and Australia will allow a degree that combines study with a non-law discipline. For example, some universities in the United Kingdom offer a combined study of law and history leading to a B.A. degree that is accepted by the law society and Inns of Court as equivalent to an LL.B</p>
<p>The University of London External Programme in Laws (LL.B.) has been awarding its law degree via <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distance_learning.html" title="Distance learning">distance learning</a> since 1858. The LL.B. awarded by the University of London External Programme is of the same standard and quality irrespective of the mode or manner of learning.</p>

<p>Foreign law graduates seeking admission to the bar in the United States may find their LL.B law degree fulfils core admission requirements and allows them to take the bar exam.

<p>Recently many universities in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> have introduced LL.B degrees as part of the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bologna_process.html" title="Bologna process">Bologna process</a>.The LL.B is a three or four year basic law degree.Some students pursue the LL.M after pursuing the LL.B. The LL.B in Germany covers all classes which are also required for the First State Exam.A credit point system is used for the LL.B degree. In order to obtain the LL.B students have to pass more exams and thus collect more points than needed for the First State Exam. By obtaining the LL.B, a student is automatically qualified to sit for the First State Exam. It is expected that the First State Exam will be completely replaced by the LL.B by 2010. The LL.B is a cornerstone to the future of law practice in Germany.</p>
<p>In Malta, the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree, offered by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Malta_4f12.html" title="University of Malta">University of Malta</a>, is an undergraduate degree that of itself is not sufficient for admission into any of the legal professions.</p>

<p>There are also conversion courses available for non-law graduates, available as an alternative to the full-length LL.B. degree course. One such example of a conversion course in England and Wales is the GDL (Graduate Diploma in Law), which takes one year to complete. The Scottish alternative to this is the accelerated LL.B, where graduates from another discipline can complete the LL.B in two years.</p>
