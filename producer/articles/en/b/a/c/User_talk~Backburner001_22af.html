<p>Not a problem about the citations. I have no problem with listing off where this info came from. However, things like the history of the franchise were taken from writeups on the team's own website, which is already listed down in the External Links section. Putting the same site there again under a "reference" section seems a little redundant. I never actually copy any data verbatim, which is why I don't have a direct reference, I tend to just glean the important details and make up my own paragraphs.</p>
<p>Also, things like the records for each season, and which teams were in the playoffs, are undisputed and are widely available from many sources. I'm not sure what type of citation, if any, would be needed for that.</p>
<p>For whatever it's worth, on this particular page, a couple of us in WikiProject Baseball have tried to get the "current roster" removed and replaced with a link to the team's page. The same couple users seem to insist on changing the page manually every two or three days when they make a player move, which is not the idea. So if you can be of any help with that....</p>
<p>I've done quite a number of the other teams in the Eastern League in a similar format, so if you'd like to browse the others and see what else you think needs cited, I wouldn't mind. Let me know. <a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakern74_d8cc.html" title="User:Dakern74">Dakern74</a> 03:14, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reply. It seems like a number of editors opt to accept the External Links section as a method of citation, but I'm a bit weary. I don't know if there has been any discussion on this, but I would much rather see a source removed from External Links and added to a Reference section if indeed the source was used in the article. It makes the use of the reference explicit, whereas listing a source in External Links does not necessarily tell the reader that the source was used in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm also not sure what kind of citation would be needed for undisputed content, except to say that I would be inclined to cite the source that is considered the most reliable and is the most up to date. I see no harm in sourcing undisputed content since it is the citation itself that will let unfamiliar readers know that the content is not disputed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Can you provide a link to the discussion about the link to the current roster? I'll try to be of help in that area and with other articles as time permits. -- <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackburner001_59e9.html" title="User:Backburner001">backburner001</a> 15:15, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's another person named <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWin777_43a0.html" title="User:Win777">User:Win777</a> who was involved in that. You can check his talk page. I kinda gave up the fight since I'm not an admin or anything. But if you look at the history, they do add/remove new players about every two days. As for the "factual" things like records, some of the teams have it on their own sites, but I also have the media guides for my two local teams in Connecticut. And they have pages back through the years where they list off the final standings for the whole league. So it seems odd to cite another team's media guide in an article about what <i>this</i> team did 10 years ago.</dd>

<dd>What about a dual label for the section, like "external links / references"?... some of this (playoffs) also comes from the league website, and that could have some interest to followers of the team also. <a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakern74_d8cc.html" title="User:Dakern74">Dakern74</a> 15:44, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've viewed to discussion on <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWin777_43a0.html" title="User:Win777">Win777's talk page</a>, deleted the roster in the article, and left a comment on the Aeros talk page. I agree that the roster doesn't belong in the article. Hopefully, this will help either keep the roster off the article or at least jumpstart discussion about it if it gets added back.</dd>

<dd>I agree; citing references from another team's media guide does look somewhat awkward. However, I am inclined to still favor it for the purpose of demonstrating that the article is sourced. However, I certainly don't think it would be a bad idea to see if those stats can be cited from less-awkward looking source.</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure if there is consensus on Wikipedia about dual labels for one "External links/References" section. I do think some articles use it, but I don't know if there has been any discussion on the practice. I'm inclined to prefer two seperate sections as they lend themselves to different uses and are clearer when viewed seperately. But that's more of a stylistic preference on my part. The most important thing right now is making sure the article is sourced appropriately. -- <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackburner001_59e9.html" title="User:Backburner001">backburner001</a> 14:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I replaced because many high school articles have theirs as a bit of pride-the songs, I understand and even agree with the removal-the alma mater, no. If you want to do that, I suggest that you start removing every alma mater from every article for the sake of consistency.-<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornandsoccer_43ac.html" title="User:Hornandsoccer">Hornandsoccer</a> 22:44, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it's consistency you are worried about, I think you should note that I also removed the fight song and alma mater from the article of St. Ignatius' chief rival, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Edward_High_School_%28Lakewood%2C_Ohio%29_8f9b.html" title="St. Edward High School (Lakewood, Ohio)">St. Edward High School (Lakewood, Ohio)</a>.

<dl>
<dd>When I deleted the alma mater from those two high school articles, I cited a sub-section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as my rationale for the deletion. There is no specific point that prohibits the deletion of school songs, but I think deleting the alma maters adheres to the spirit of not creating an indiscriminate collection of information. Every high school has an alma mater and just having one does not make a high school notable. It would be different, of course, if the school's alma mater had some notable history or controversy behind it that would easily identify its notability to the school (ex: a controversy over the wording of the song, etc). But, even then, it seems highly doubtful that adding the lyrics of the song would be appropriate. I would instead focus the article on the history or controversy itself instead of the lyrics.</dd>

<dd>Yes, other school articles may still have the lyrics to their alma maters. But that hardly justifies keeping it. I highly doubt you would allow blatant vandalism to remain in one article just because you've found it unaddressed in another.

<dd>What I'm saying is that if you delete the alma mater from one article, you may as well go about deleting them all for consistency.-<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornandsoccer_43ac.html" title="User:Hornandsoccer">Hornandsoccer</a> 17:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know that this topic hasn't been discussed in a while, but I would to revive it for just a minute. In response, after having spent more time on Wikipedia, is that there actually is an interesting story with the alma mater. An Ignatius grad, Jack T. Hearns '37 wrote the alma mater when he was band director (mid 1950's, I think), but Xavier copied it. I'm still working on citing that, but I think that fits your qualifications to keep it. In retrospect, I apologize for being harsh with the whole 'delete 'em everywhere' attitude. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornandsoccer_43ac.html" title="User:Hornandsoccer">Hornandsoccer</a><a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHornandsoccer_80b4.html" title="User talk:Hornandsoccer"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 22:50, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
