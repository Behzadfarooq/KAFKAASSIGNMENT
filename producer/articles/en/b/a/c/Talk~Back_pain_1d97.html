<dd>Someone deleted two external links that I added to this page on April 19 . I want to say that I found them as very interesting resources. The first one talks about the back pain risk scale and shows people what to do to prevent it. The second one leads to a page with some very useful exercises. I think that practicing a correct exercises routine people with back pain can find a very helpful way to relieve it. If someone wants to remove my content again I would love to be asked before because I consider top quality the content added on this page and my intention is to keep people well informed about this illness.</dd>

<p>--Changed Dr. Sarno text-- My understanding is that Dr. Sarno's beliefs and approach to treatment are not widely practiced or supported in the medical community, so I changed the text that represented those as statements of fact and referenced and article that presents an alternative view in the debate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You should sign your talk posts with four tildes as stated in the wikipedia rules, but thanks also for the new reference on <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Sarno_9533.html" title="Dr. Sarno">Dr. Sarno</a>. And, the number of physicians subscribing to Dr. Sarno's approach is steadily increasing, frequently because he has cured their own back pain, as with Dr. Marc Sopher, Dr. Scott Brady, Dr. David Schechter, or Dr. Andrea Leonard-Segal among others. His latest book, <i>The Divided Mind: The Epidemic of Mindbody Disorders</i>, 2006, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060851783" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060851783" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> includes chapters by six other physicians. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalphyde_c73c.html" title="User:Ralphyde">Ralphyde</a> 09:42, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe that this article is clearer without specific reference to the qualifications of Dr. Sarno--a reference to his theory is sufficient. The establishment of Dr. Sarno's theories by peer-reviewed citation might justify their inclusion to what is intended to be the most general treatment of the subject. Ghostoroy 19:29, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To remove all references to the pioneering and highly successful work of <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Sarno_9533.html" title="Dr. Sarno">Dr. Sarno</a> and his followers from a discussion of back pain would be like removing all references to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freud.html" title="Freud">Freud</a> in a discussion of psychology. Dr. Sarno, who is still seeing patients at age 83, has perhaps the best record for relieving back pain of any medical practioner in the world, having totally healed tens of thousands of patients in person and through his four books on the subject. He believes that 90% of back pain is stress related <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tension_myositis_syndrome.html" title="Tension myositis syndrome">tension myositis syndrome</a> and has a 90% cure rate for those who accept this diagnosis. <a href="http://www.wholehealthmd.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?type=AWHN_News&amp;tier=3&amp;id=7F2A6797C49E454DB0E9DF1EB33AF1AB" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wholehealthmd.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?type=AWHN_News&amp;tier=3&amp;id=7F2A6797C49E454DB0E9DF1EB33AF1AB" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> He continues as a Professor of Clinical Rehabilitation Medicine at the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_School_of_Medicine_5cd2.html" title="New York University School of Medicine">New York University School of Medicine</a> and attending physician at their <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_A._Rusk_Institute_of_Rehabilitation_Medicine_8591.html" title="Howard A. Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine">Howard A. Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine</a>. He's been a practicing physician since 1950, and developed his successful techniques through long experience with thousands of chronic back pain sufferers for whom conventional medical approaches weren't working. I suggest that doubters read some of the hundreds of reviews of his pioneering books at Amazon.com, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446392308" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446392308" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and watch the 20/20 segment <a href="http://www.goodnewsbroadcast.com/sarno2020.ram" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goodnewsbroadcast.com/sarno2020.ram" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> about his work. Back pain sufferers need to know of this highly successful alternative to surgery and drugs. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalphyde_c73c.html" title="User:Ralphyde">Ralphyde</a> 17:43, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The efficacy of Dr. Sarno's methods has not been established to the degree that Dr. Freud's has in psychology, nor is Dr. Sarno's name presently a "household name" with which the study of back pain will always be associated. His theory may deserve inclusion in this article--it survives my edit--but the listing of Dr. Sarno's qualifications upsets its balance: these topics can be treated in the linked article on the theory itself. Further, the passage in question belongs in the "causes" section and not in the introductory material. Changes concerning Dr. Sarno have been reverted several times in the history of this article, is compromise possible? Ghostoroy 20:39, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Listen, Ghostoroy, it's not considered good Wikiquette to just remove a cited paragraph without discussion, and you have done that three times now in one day. Why are you so intent on removing all references to Dr. Sarno? What is your interest in 'back pain' if I may ask?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that a person going to a reference like Wikipedia to find out about back pain, is in all likelihood a person suffering from back pain, and some back pain can be extremely painful and debilitating. Shouldn't that person be able to find out the alternative treatments that work, especially those with the best results? Dr. Sarno's long experience working with back pain patients has given him an especially successful treatment which people need to know about so they can end their suffering before they resort to surgery, which is much less successful, and frequently leads to "failed back syndrome," where the pain continues after the surgery because a TMS diagnosis wasn't considered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The medical-industrial complex, which focuses on surgery and drugs and has a $50 billion business going, hasn't been enthusiastic about adopting Dr. Sarno's approach because they have been taught since Descartes' bargain with the Pope to treat the body as a machine and look for physical causes for physical symptoms. The ones who have finally adopted Dr. Sarno's very successful approach have been for the most part those he has actually cured of their own chronic back pain with his mindbody treatment. These include Dr. Marc Sopher, Dr. David Schechter, Dr. Scott Brady, and Dr. Andrea Leonard-Segal among others. Have you checked out those references I gave you above? Please continue the discussion if you like rather than deleting cited material. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalphyde_c73c.html" title="User:Ralphyde">Ralphyde</a> 04:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed some text from this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Stairs are also a contributing factor because small muscles at the knee are overworked by the stereotyped repetitive motion. (As opposed to going up or down a real hill involves much more varied muscle movements). Note that it is now never recommended that anyone walk or run down stairs for exercise, ever, only up! "Paradoxical movements" in which muscles lower weights can be very effective exercise because they work the muscles harder, but this means that going down stairs is simply too much strain on a few isolated muscles, and an invitation to athletic injury. (We'd all be healthier, and have better backs, if the escalators in subway systems took us down, and let us walk up the stairs. Fewer tumbles would result, too, as paradoxical motion is less easily controlled.)" - <b>this was removed as it was about the knees and stairs, not about the back.</b></li>

<p>I am relatively new to wikipedia and so I hope I have not made too many mistakes, but I found myself compelled to change this page because it lacked vital information about back pain (such as underlying conditions that cause it and a range of typical treatment alternatives) and presented incorrect information (such as routine advice to use inversion therapy for back pain, which has not been proven in the medical literature to have beneficial results), and was poorly structured - more of a treatise to a specific belief about how to treat back pain than a balanced overview of back pain.</p>
<p>I have not had time to put all revelant information in and to find all the right references but will try to do that later. I hope this draft is a useful one that now can be continually edited by all to be a more useful resource.</p>

<p>Added back link to spine-health.com - this site is referenced in the text of the article (#2), but has hundreds of pages of articles on the topic, which cannot be included on this page, but should be linked to for people who want to read more about a topic, such as degenerative discs or herniated discs.

<p>There are a number of unsupported recommendations on this page. I added the references to TENS, which are not favorable.

<p>I am not an expert in this field but I'm pretty sure that some people or organizations are doing research on back pain besides the good people at Cochrane.

<p>Hi. I believe this article would benefit if there was a section describing what people could/should do when first suffering a back injury. Should people lie down? Take a bath?
