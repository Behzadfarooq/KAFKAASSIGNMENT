<p>Hey, you seem to be active in articles relating to War of the Worlds, so I was wondering if <a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETripods.jpg_5a35.html" title="Image:Tripods.jpg">this</a> screenshot from the movie could be used on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martian_Tripod_d1d0.html" title="Martian Tripod">Martian Tripod</a> article or in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Worlds_%282005_movie%29_1a03.html" title="War of the Worlds (2005 movie)">War of the Worlds (2005 movie)</a> article. You can't really see them that good, but its better than nothing I guess and doesn't really give away anything. If you go to the repected talk pages, I said the same thing, but it would probably be a while before anyone noticed.

<dd>That shot would be appropriate. I think it's gotten to the point where it's no longer a huge spoiler about what the tripods look like. I've seen more images of the them now coming from the popular sites, recent TV adverts, and in magazines. I think something like that would be no big deal.</dd>

<p>Since you added the category "Friday the 13th actors" to the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erin_Gray_5398.html" title="Erin Gray">Erin Gray</a> article, could you add a line mentioning which film she's in?

<dd>Added mention. I was attempted to connect it to her <i>Buck Rogers</i> following by elaborating on the behind-the-scenes drooling of the filmmakers where she acknowledges her <a href="../../../m/i/l/MILF_ca39.html" title="MILF">MILF</a> status and even went as far as spelling it out. I refrained because I kind of felt like I would pervert the article a little.

<p>While I have no problem with you renaming the <i>War of the Worlds</i> television series article from [[War of the Worlds (television)]] to <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Worlds_%28TV_series%29_f1de.html" title="War of the Worlds (TV series)">War of the Worlds (TV series)</a> (although I miss the former title as I'd gotten so used to it), I <i>was</i> upset that you didn't bother to adjust even one of the 40-plus links that directed to the article.

<dd>There is no technical reason to adjust any <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">single-redirects</a> when an article name is changed. I made sure that there were no double-redirects and that is sufficient.

<p>Well, I got your messages and would just like to say: I'm not totally against the series, but the connection between it and the 1953 film should be severed. The film had a satisfying ending, and I don't know why the series couldn't just be introducing a totally different invasion. The aliens in the film were from Mars; the ones in the series are from a place called Mor-Tax. There shouldn't be any connection between the two adaptations. I would also like to say that the series is not a better adaptation of the book (the novel didn't have aliens possessing people, and the series doesn't use war machines). I also found it ironic that, following the abominable connection between the film and series, the aliens were burning forests in the film and then getting mad at humans for doing the same thing in the series. Anyway, the series was good, but, like I've said before, it should have no connection with the series. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpionman_ba8b.html" title="User:Scorpionman">Scorpionman</a> 19:34, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've commented on some of your edits on the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">fan fiction</a> article's Talk page. I've been amenable if not very grateful to most, but I felt the need to give a good tweak to the edit of the "Reviewing" section, to make sure it sounded NPOV. I've given in - flames do happen, so we might as well address it - but I'm hoping I've been able to put it in a good context now. What do you think? <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 03:27, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term "mass murderer" and "serial killer" kind of both describe him. I'm probably going to remove both on the grounds that he's fictional. To explain, he's a serial killer because he doesn't do it all at one time, though he certainly mass kills people in each movie. Also, the films actually refer to him as such. But, mass murderer can include a length of time in one spot, which he also does. But he has ventured out of Crystal Lake. That is why I think I'm going to remove it, unless I can get a quote from a creator saying something to the effect of one of them. Hopefully my two books will be here by next week. If you look on the page, you can see that I started a gallery for his "mask". Clothes seem to be less "interpretive of the Director" than a change in the mask. I think each mask design has been about what the Director wanted, and I wanted to address that and include a gallery of the more major changes to the mask. Kind of like what the did with <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padme_Amidala_fa95.html" title="Padme Amidala">Padme Amidala</a>'s page and her dress, though they had more context than this would. I could use some help finding some more sources for the characteristics. If you look, there are 3 "fact" tags where it talks about him being a "morality defender", and I wanted to find 3 more reliable sources to verify this. Also, I'm going to need help on the "Pop. culture" references. It can only be things that are verifiable (IMDb doesn't count, because it doesn't say where it gets things), or things that are obvious, and by obvious I mean someone in South Park wearing a Jason mask and carrying a machete. Otherwise, we need verifiable sources to confirm a lot of those "pop references" that are on the page already. Overall, what did you think of the page so far? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 20:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate help, and if you are wary about something, I say just bring it up on the talk page of the sandbox. As for the "list of pop culture". If you have a list of verified, cited pop culture references, I can turn it into prose. We don't need everything, just the most notable ones (and we can weed those out on the talk page), and then just provide an external link to the whole list. I can see him being a "spree killer", but again, I think we have a problem of defining a character by ourselfs, when we are not experts in that field. It may be wise to leave it out completely, and just refer to him as a murderer or something. Don't look at the page as if it's even close to finished, I tend to work rather chaotically, and just jot down the basic principles I want and then go back and smooth through it. The Lead will be the very last thing I do. The "literature" section is bare at the moment because I'm working off just the plots from each book. I can't discuss how some expand the continuity, and how some are just their own thing because I haven't read them. They are also on my list of books to buy from Amazon, but I'm more interested in getting the out-of-universe content from the two non-fiction books that I bought, than explaining the expansion of his history in literature. Your suggestion about the "look of Jason" is what I was going to go for in the "Design" section. I'm hoping the books have good interviews with the SFX creators so that I can talk about how they went about changing him. I think his facial look is most important. If you look at part 1 and 4, you can see that he looks quite similar, just older, and that is probably attributed to the fact that Tom Savini did the make-up for Jason on those films. Also, you can see I have one image already in that section of Tom putting on make-up, and if I can, I think I may opt to have a gallery of his facial changes (as opposed to the mask). As for the "early life of Jason", if you are talking about how he became deformed, well Victor Miller addressed why he was deformed, but other than that I'm not sure what you are asking. The "reception" section is something I'm toying with. I am wondering if I can find maybe reviews about the character, like from his early appearances, to something from maybe AFI (though I don't think he's ever been on their lists but you get the idea). But please, come to the talk page with any suggestions or questions you have about something you think is wrong or poorly placed. I already have another editor working on the Freddy article in another sandbox. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 15:55, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been reading one of the books (Making Friday the 13th) and I think that by the time I get through both books, and finish the Jason article, I'll have enough information to go through EACH of the films and add production information, casting, filming, just about everything we need to makek them atleast GA status. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a>
<dl>
<dd>No, I didn't think you were ignoring me. I'm just as busy as yourself. As a matter of fact, I have an ASL exam this afternoon. As for the article, there are a lot of things that are borderline when it comes to adding them (i.e. "spree killer"). So far, I've gotten through the entire section about the first film, in the Making Friday the 13th book. Lots of good stuff for the film article, and for the Pamela Voorhees article. I found a few things about Jason, but this author didn't go into detail about what went into his design specifically. There was a brief bit about using the plaster molding and stuff, and some things that Ari did himself. I did get where Jason Voorhees received his name (which was cool). I think I'm going to get more from the sequel sections, since they focus more on Jason himself. That "in universe" thing you want, since it's from the books, would best be suited in the "literature" section. If you have the book, I'd need you to fill out the "cite book" template for me, making sure you include the page number that it is mentioned, and tell me what to say. Even Jabba the Hutt's literature section goes into a little detail about how he is described in a particular book, and that's something that is kind of important. I don't have the novelizations yet, so if you do then I'd need your help with that. What are your thoughts on this "userbox" you suggested? Oh, anything else you what to take a stab at you can write it up in the talk page of the sandbox and we can discuss it there (if you like). This way if we both like it, then we can fine tune it there and just insert when ready. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 12:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds like an awesome idea for a userbox. If you create it, or need help, let me know. I'd definitely want to get that box. Right now, I say cite Part VI. If it's mentioned earlier we can fix the citation and change the wording after the fact. If you aren't sure what to use, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_templates_28d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation templates">Wikipedia:Citation templates</a> has the "book" one to fill in. Just fill it out, and give me some prose on the information so that I can include it. I'm going to buy the novelizations last, since those are less important to an encyclopedia than is the characterization by the creators (I say plural, because apparently, it was a combination of Victor, Ron, and Tom), and other out of universe stuff. Oh, no worries about the plot. I've seen far worse things done to it. Like, the plot for Wrong Turn 2 was plagarized from IMDb.com. A lot of the plots need work, so any help is always appreciated, and if something is amiss then there are plenty of editors that will adjust. I'm at school right now, so any messages to me might be delayed in response. Let me know what's going on with the userbox when you get started, and with that Part VI citation for the deformity. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 13:28, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
