<p>The above is not confirmed - anybody else have this who wants to confirm it? (Otherwise I'll have a better look at my DVDs and confirm it).</p>
<p>So it seems the same as the 2002 R2 UK DVD, except with corrected Widescreen and Enhanced MJF interview, and the fourth disc which looks awesome.

<dd>Incorrect. There were plans for a fourth and a fifth movie, but they were cancelled at the last minute due to Michael J' Fox's illness.

<dd>No, Doc hadn't been struck by lightning yet, so there were only three. Time was altered once Doc was accidentally sent back in time. --<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynamite_XI_c221.html" title="User:Dynamite XI">Dynamite Eleven</a> 01:38, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Original comment:) "Given the trilogy's logic for altering time, there wasn't one hidden in the Delgado Mine at that time, as the 1985 Doc hadn't been struck by lightning yet"</p>
<p>I don't agree with that original comment. In the first movie, in 1955, there is only one DeLorean, the others didn't exist yet to the time travelers, but at the end of the third movie, according to the universe, they did exist. The second movie makes it two and three; now three exist on that date, to the time travelers. There weren't two and three (for the time travelers) before they went back and made it two and three; if you watch the first movie, you don't see the 'second' Marty, Doc, or Biff at all, no matter how closely you look. They don't exist yet, from the time travelers point of view! But, at the end of the series (and that's a crucial point), they do.</p>
<p>So, there wasn't a fourth DeLorean (for the time travelers) before Doc 2015 went back, but after he did go back, there was four, with that last 4th existing before, during, and after the critical events of that day, even though there were only three sets of time travelers on that day (two Marty's and two Doc's, with a third trip making two Biffs). The 4th DeLorean did not phase into existence in the mine when the 2015 Doc evaporated according to the universe, it only phased in when Doc-2015 evaporated according to the time travelers. From the universe's point of view, at the end of the series (again, the crucial point), it was there all along, just like the other three were there 'all along' but only phased in for the time travelers when they traveled there. So, while there were only three sets of time travelers on that day, there were actually four DeLoreans. Sorry this comment is so long!</p>
<p>Oh, and someone please reword that 'fourth dimension' sentence to sound better, possibly including the Doc quote from movie 2 about how that day is crucial 'or maybe just coincidence'.</p>
<p>Just think, if someone went back to that day, after the events of the third movie, there would be four DeLoreans there, plus whatever you used to get to that day. That makes it four to me. I've since edited the article to four again. --Thortok2000 (not a Wiki user yet)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand what you're saying, the fourth DeLorean was in the mine all along by the end of BTTFII. Good arguement! But from the viewpoint of the viewing audience, there were three at that one point, the most at any (present) time. I undid your edit to reflect that fact. --<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynamite_XI_c221.html" title="User:Dynamite XI">Dynamite Eleven</a> 04:51, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Are they not the same character? A recent change suggested they are not. I assumed this was an in-joke, (a pretty obvious one, at that) similar to "Goldie Wilson" going from a lowly janitor in 1995 to be mayor in 1985. They removed the portion of the trivia mentioning this, and one other reference to it, stating they're not the same person. I reverted the change, but I am opening this up for discussion. Is there any source that says they in fact are not? It's a pretty safe bet, especially 1) in a movie riddled with similar in-jokes ("Twin Pines"--&gt;"Lone Pine") and 2) "Red" is not exactly a common name, especially in a movie (to use two different characters with the same name in movies is practically unheard of). Please discuss. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 18:21, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently they're not the same character, MJF was just improvising when he called the bum "Red". The ages would not fit, see these discussions <a href="http://www.bttf.com/forums/showpost.php?p=176921&amp;postcount=5" class="external text" title="http://www.bttf.com/forums/showpost.php?p=176921&amp;postcount=5" rel="nofollow">1</a> and <a href="http://www.bttf.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17705" class="external text" title="http://www.bttf.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17705" rel="nofollow">2</a>. It has been suggested the bum is the mayor's son and even that temporal displacement may have delayed Red's aging. It may be worth including as a common misconception.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrelljon_4297.html" title="User:Darrelljon">Darrelljon</a> 21:35, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's a good idea. It should at least be mentioned, since it's obviously a common misconception. Damn, I had no idea this was not an original joke. I have the DVD; maybe I'll watch the commentary for Part II to see what they say before I make any changes.
<dl>
<dd>It would be nice if something could be added to the article to indicate that this is just a common misconception since it seems that people continually add it to the page (obviously without reading the discussion here).Merc 2k 04:22, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added a summary of the above discussion to the "Other relevant notes" section:</p>
<p>"It is a common misconception that Mayor Red Thomas of 1955 and Red the Bum of 1985 were meant to be the same character. According to Bob Gale's commentary on the Back to the Future DVD set, the name of the bum was ad-libbed by Michael J. Fox. Gale also commented that the photo of the mayor in 1955 on the side of the campaign van was that of set decorator Hal Gausman, whereas the bum was played by George "Buck" Flower."</p>

<p>The statement which reads "In the end of Part I, Biff tries to weasel out of putting a second coat of wax on Marty's 4x4." is incorrect. Biff tries to weasel out of putting a second coat of wax on the father's (George McFly's) BMW, not Marty's Toyota - which has already been waxed and is in the garage. When confronted about the second coat of wax, Biff relents and apologizes to George while admitting that he is just starting the second coat (on the car, not the truck). -Costner M</p>

This doesn't seem to make sense to me, since the trilogy usually (if not always) seems to go with the "rule" that an event must occur in the movies' storylines before it affects the future. Is there an official source for this note (e.g. DVD commentary)? If not, perhaps the original wording of this note should be restored?--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregRM_a6b8.html" title="User:GregRM">GregRM</a> 16:57, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I recently listened to the commentary on the DVDs and I don't recall any mention of this (firing in 1955 being the reason he cannot fire in 1985). I don't think this makes any sense either. In that timeline Doc had not sent Marty back to 1885 in 1955 so he would not have fired the pistol. I think it's more likely that the gun was jammed or he had forgot to load it before the Libyans arrived.--Merc 2k 16:03 22 August 2006.</p>

<dd>I reworded it. After looking at it again, though, I am wondering if there is there any evidence that it is the same gun? It seems unusual that it would go from being painted in 1955 to unpainted in 1985.--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregRM_a6b8.html" title="User:GregRM">GregRM</a> 22:37, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b>, would prefer the naming convention here, even though most of the articles in this category seem to use "trilogy" instead of "(film series)." The convention seems more appropriate.

<p>The article states</p>
<p>"In Part I 1985 and 1955, George offers to go over a report with Biff, but Biff tells him "not too early, I sleep in". By opposition, Buford wants to duel Marty at 7 AM, because "I do my killing before breakfast". "</p>
<p>That is a bad analogy because in the film Biff states he sleeps in on Saturdays, whereas the duel at 7am takes place on a monday so it's not certain weather buford does or does not sleep in on Saturdays.</p>

<p>From the trivia section:</p>
<p>"In the extended deleted scene of "Dad's Home" for Part II, Marty Jr complains about how he can only watch two shows on his goggles, instead of six. 2015 Marty responds by stating that when he was Marty Jr's age, if wanted to watch two shows at once, he had to put two sets next to each other. This is a reference to the scene in Part I, when Lorraine asks Marty if he has a television set. When Marty answers that he has two of them, Stella insists that nobody has two television sets."</p>
<p>Is this really a reference to Part I? I'd think Marty's response about needing two TVs to watch two programs was just a joke. What does everyone else think?Merc 2k 03:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it ties in nicely - because, while the idea of owning two TV sets sounded preposturous in 1955, the idea of watching two shows on the same TV sounds preposterous in 1985. 75.129.139.187 22:06, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe it's just the wording of it that bothers me. Perhaps it should say "This could be a refernce to the scene in Part I..." instead since it now seems to imply that it is the only thing it can be. Merc 2k 06:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No matter how you look at it, it is in no way a reference. At best it is an allusion.</li>

<p>In the first film, the 1955 Doctor Brown scoffs at the notion that Ronald Reagan is president in 1985, saying, "And I suppose Jane Wyman is First Lady." In 1955, Reagan and Wyman had been divorced for seven years and Reagan had been married to Nancy Davis for three years. This is a somewhat facile attempt at a joke but of course is not actually a historical error because the film doesn't say that Reagan was still married to Wyman in 1955. If you want to look for more subtext I suppose you could say that Doctor Brown had no interest in show business and didn't keep track of celebrities' marriages.</p>

<p>I recently created a separate article about themes throughout the trilogy to make this article an appropriate size, however, the themes article has been nominated for deletion, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Back_to_the_Future_themes_8ab1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Back to the Future themes">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Back to the Future themes</a>.

<p>Why didn't Doc use some other fuel to replace the missing gasoline? I can think of at least four possibilities:</p>
<p>1, Alcohol. Cars can use alcohol as a replacement for gasoline.</p>
<p>2, Kerosene - Kerosene is used as jet fuel, and was used as lamp fuel in 1885.</p>
<p>3. Vegetable oil - many people are currently using recycled oil from deep fryers to power their cars. Why couldn't Doc do the same?</p>
<p>4. Tree sap. Some trees produce a sap that can be used as a replacement for gasoline. Doc should have known about this.</p>
<p><br />
Another possibility - Once Doc discovered the leak, he could have sent a letter to the 1955 version of himself (at the point where he is about to send Marty back to 1885) stating the problem, and telling him to place a can of gasoline in the trunk of the Delorean, along with the necessary parts to repair the fuel line.</p>
<p>Either way, problem solved.</p>
