<p>Just for the reassurance of anybody who happens upon one of the dodgy websites I found while writing this: the article here is right - "B" is "B flat" and "H" is "B natural", not the other way round.</p>

<p>On another note, I found a webpage which said there were works by Rheinberger and Karg-Elert based on BACH, and Grove says that Rimsky-Korsakov and (if I remember correctly) D'Indy used it. Anybody happen to know what those works are? I'm sure there are lots of other examples as well, I just mention these ones because the composers are pretty well known, and I'd be interested to find out myself. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<dd>Great article, Cam! Was it Schubert or Schumann who wrote a piece in which the bassline spells out "WEDDING" in German? -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a> 10:12 Mar 12, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks tarq, it was fun writing it. "WEDDING" is a new one on me. Definitely sounds more like Schumann than Schubert, but I don't know, really. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>What I remember my piano teacher telling me was that he wanted to propose, but his potential future father in law was not keen. So he wrote a piece with that bassline, and sent it to her so she got the message. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a> 16:55 Mar 12, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then I'm pretty sure it can't be Schubert. I may be wrong, but I don't think he ever planned to marry. Schumann on the other hand married Clara Wieck, who was a pianist (so this would make sense) and, if I remember correctly, whose father wasn't too keen on the pair getting together. So it sounds like him. I think I have a Schumann biog lying around the place somewhere, I'll see if I can find anything about it in there. Must say though, I don't know how you'd spell out WEDDING in German - isn't the German word Hochzeit? How do you make a Z or a T or an O or an I? That said, Ravel once spelled out Haydn's name in a piece, so anything's possible... --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes I found an oddball page about people spelling things out in music. You had to stretch the rules or invent your own in many cases. btw I changed hommage to homage, hope this is correct, if not just beat me up.&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">Nevilley</a> 19:15 Mar 16, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been thinking about starting an article on things spelled out in music, just for fun, but I can't think of a good title for it. You're right about "homage" by the way - two Ms in French, just the one in English (god knows why). And I looked in that Schumann biog for mention of WEDDING, but nothing was forthcoming (he spells something out in <i>Carnaval</i> though, ASCH, if I remember correctly - can't remember why). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<dd>Camembert, Could the German word in question be "Ehe" (marriage) rather than "Hochzeit", "Trauung", "Heirat" or "Verm√§hlung" (wedding)? It's certainly an easier "spell" -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 19:50 Mar 16, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Possibly, although the sequence of notes "EBE" probably wouldn't be very recognisable unless bashed out quite a lot. Then again, I suppose they'd stand out in A flat major or something - yes, it's a possibility. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<p>The Schumann thing probably is in relation to his "Myrten", Opus 25, a cycle of <b>26</b> songs that apparently is ordered in some alphabetically-coded manner. The song cycle was a wedding gift to his wife Clara. It's not clear if the "alphabet" relates to the music or the lyrics, but perhaps someone else can clarify. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 09:37 Mar 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll see if I can find a score for that cycle and have a look. I'm not too sure what it all has to do with BACH, but I'm curious&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>Do we really need this in the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In many pieces, while the exact notes B-A-C-H are not played, a transposition of the motif is used (a note sequence with the same intervals: down a semitone, up a minor third, down a semitone).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I mean, if the motif has been transposed, it's not the Bach motif any more, is it? It's the FEGGes motif or whatever. Also, what are these "several other pieces" by Bach that use the BACH motif? It would be good to list them here if possible. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, found one of them, the <i>Vom Himmel Hoch</i> canonic variations, BWV 769 (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Art_of_Fugue_8866.html" title="Talk:The Art of Fugue">talk:The Art of Fugue</a>). It'd still be good to have a list if anyone can provide. (On reflection, incidentally, I don't really mind that sentence I've quoted above.) --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>the very end of contrapunctus 4 quotes the BACH motif (a bit subtly, in the tenor). one of the fugues of the WTC has a theme of the same "shape" as the BACH motif, but that may be coincidence. (possibly F# minor or C# minor of WTC1?) also there is of course BWV 898! (apparently a "doubtful" work but still deserves mention.)</p>

<p>Is it worth mentioning Douglas Hofstadter, who devoted some attention to this phenomenon in <i>G√∂del, Escher, Bach</i>? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 13:21, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would think so. Supposedly, Bach fell ill and died almost immediately after writing it in. I assume this story has factual backing, and it would be nice to see it on <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bach.html" title="Bach">Bach's</a> page and/or this one. -<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMescalineBanana_b0db.html" title="User:MescalineBanana">MescalineBanana</a> 06:17, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I admire your question, but do not have an answer. <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_notation.html" title="Musical notation">Musical notation</a> is silent on the matter. <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_signature_names_and_translations.html" title="Key signature names and translations">Key signature names and translations</a> tells us about the names used in other languages, but gives no history of why they are different in some cases.

<dd>There's no reason to assume, though, that every country would use the same conventions as are used in English.

<p>Carl Nielsen has composed at least one longer work with a motif spelling the surname of a fellow Danish composer: (Niels) G-A-D-E.

<dd>Liner notes often contain fascinating tidbits, but I've never heard about this one.
