<p>The term <i>Backpacker murders</i> specifically refers to the seven murders for which Ivan Milat was convicted. There is some speculation that Milat may have committed up to thirty more killings but this has never been determined.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">20 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> Ken Seily and Keith Caldwell discovered a partially decaying <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeleton.html" title="Skeleton">skeleton</a> while <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orienteering.html" title="Orienteering">orienteering</a> in the Belanglo State Forest. The following day, police constables Roger Gough and Suzanne Roberts discovered a second body 30 <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metre.html" title="Metre">metres</a> from the first. Early media reports suggested that the bodies were of missing <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters, who had disappeared from the inner <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> suburb of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_Cross%2C_New_South_Wales_05f3.html" title="Kings Cross, New South Wales">Kings Cross</a> the previous April. However, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> couple Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied had also disappeared from the Kings Cross area sometime after <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> and Simone Schmidl, also from Germany, had been reported missing for more than a year. It was equally possible that the bodies were of young <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victorian</a> couple Deborah Everist and James Gibson, who had been missing since leaving <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankston%2C_Victoria_1a9e.html" title="Frankston, Victoria">Frankston</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. Police quickly confirmed, however, that the bodies were those of Clarke and Walters. Both had been violently stabbed and Clarke had also been shot several times in the head. In spite of an intense search of the forest over the following five days, no further evidence or bodies were found by police. Investigators categorically ruled out the possibility of further discoveries within Belanglo State Forest.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacker_murders.html" title="Edit section: Fifth, sixth and seventh discoveries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fifth, sixth and seventh discoveries</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">1 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> a skull was found in a clearing in the forest by police sergeant Jeff Trichter. The skull was later identified as that of Simone Schmidl from <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>, Germany. She had been last seen hitch hiking on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20.html" title="January 20">January 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>. Oddly, clothing found at the scene was not Schmidl's, but matched that of another missing backpacker, Anja Habschied. Simone Schmidl was found to have died from numerous stab wounds to the upper torso.</p>
<p>The bodies of Habschied and her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer were found on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">3 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> in shallow graves 50 metres apart. Like the other victims, they had been either shot or stabbed, or both, and sexually molested.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacker_murders.html" title="Edit section: Search for the identity of the serial killer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Search for the identity of the serial killer</span></h3>
<p>While aspects of each murder were similar, each murder had been committed somewhat differently. The killer had evidently spent considerable time with the victims both during and after murdering them, as campsites were discovered close to the location of each body and shell casings of the same calibre were also identified at each site. However, no victim had been slain the same way. Joanne Walters and Simone Schmidl, for example, had been stabbed whereas Caroline Clarke had been shot numerous times in the head and stabbed <i>post mortem</i>. Anja Habscheid had been decapitated and other victims showed signs of strangulation and severe beatings. Speculation arose that the crimes were the work of several killers, at least two, and Ivan Milat's sworn statement had suggested anywhere up to seven people were involved.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_13.html" title="November 13">13 November</a>, police received a call from Paul Onions in Britain. Onions had been backpacking in Australia several years before and had accepted a ride south out of Sydney from a man known only as "Bill" on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>. South of the town of <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mittagong%2C_New_South_Wales_249a.html" title="Mittagong, New South Wales">Mittagong, New South Wales</a>, Bill pulled a gun on Onions who managed to escape, flag down passing motorist Joanne Berry and report the assault to local police. Onions' statement was backed up by one from Berry, who also contacted the investigation, along with the girlfriend of a man who worked with Ivan Milat, who thought he should be questioned over the case.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacker_murders.html" title="Edit section: Milat becomes suspect and eventually found guilty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Milat becomes suspect and eventually found guilty</span></h3>
<p>Milat very quickly became a suspect. Police learned he had served prison time and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> had been charged with the abduction of two women and the rape of one of them, although the charges were later dropped. It was also learned that both he and his brother Richard worked together on road gangs along the highway between Sydney and Melbourne, that he owned a property in the vicinity of Belanglo and had sold a Nissan Patrol four-wheel drive vehicle shortly after the discovery of the bodies of Clarke and Walters. Acquaintances also told police about Milat's obsession with weapons. When the connection between Onions and the Belanglo murders was finally made, Onions was asked to fly to Australia to help with the investigation.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">13 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Paul Onions positively identified Ivan Milat as the man who had picked him up and attempted to tie up and possibly shoot him.</p>
<p>Milat was arrested on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">May 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> at his home south of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campbelltown%2C_New_South_Wales_6b64.html" title="Campbelltown, New South Wales">Campbelltown, New South Wales</a> after a 50-strong army of police surrounded the premises. Homes belonging to his brothers Richard, Alex, Walter and Bill were also searched at the same time by over 300 police. The search of Ivan Milat's home revealed a cache of weapons that included rifles, hunting knives, swords, automatic pistols and a home-made silencer, plus clothing, camping equipment and cameras belonging to several of his victims.</p>
<p>Milat's trial lasted fifteen weeks. His defence argued that in spite of the amount of evidence, there was no proof Ivan Milat was guilty and attempted to shift the blame to other members of his family, particularly Richard.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_27.html" title="July 27">27 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, a jury found Ivan Milat guilty of the murders. He was also convicted of the attempted assault and robbery of Paul Onions, for which he received six years' <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jail.html" title="Jail">jail</a>. For the killings of Caroline Clarke, Joanne Walters, Simone Schmidl, Anja Habschied, Gabor Neugebauer, James Gibson and Deborah Everist, Milat was given seven life sentences. On his first day in Maitland Prison, he was beaten by another inmate. Almost a year later, he made an escape attempt alongside convicted drug dealer and former Sydney councillor George Savvas. Savvas was found hanged in his cell the next day and Milat was transferred to the maximum-security super prison in <a href="../../../g/o/u/Goulburn%2C_New_South_Wales_90e2.html" title="Goulburn, New South Wales">Goulburn, New South Wales</a> where he remains, protesting his innocence, to date.</p>
