<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacolod_Tay_Tung_High_School_2972.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Sometime in 1934, the Kuo-Min-Tang (Bacolod Chapter), the Negros Occidental Chamber of Commerce, and the Fil-Sino Organization, joined in establishing a Chinese school in Bacolod City. Chinese parents and community leaders had long felt the need for an educational institution where the children of the Chinese community could learn not only the rudiments of English studies, but also the arts and culture of the land of their ancestors.</p>
<p>The office of the Kuo-Min-Tang at Smith Street served as the first location of the school. Mr. UY KONG HAN was the first Principal of 17 enrolled students. Due to financial instability during the early years, there was a time when the school was forced to close its operation.</p>
<p>Five years later, in 1939, the organizers were able to raise funds with which to buy a 2,645 square lot at Luzuriaga Street. Here, the school building, library and other school facilities were constructed. With improved school facilities, more students enrolled under the Principalship of Mr. CHUAY CHAY CHONG. Unfortunately, when the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> broke out in the latter part of 1941, the school operation was suspended.</p>
<p>After the war in 1945, the school resumed operation with Mr. KHO SIAK HI, the principal of Silay Puey Ching School, as concurrent Tay Tung school Principal. Due to poor health, he was forced to resign and the school Supervisor, Mr. SHIM CHI KONG was elevated to the position of Principal. In the summer of 1950, the high school curriculum was added to the school offering.</p>
<p>In 1951, a two-hectare lot in Libertad Street, the present site of the school, was acquired. A concrete building was erected through the joint efforts of the Bacolod Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Grocery Stores Association, Sugar Planters Association, Hardware Stores Association, Textile Stores Association, Department Stores Association, Sari-Sari Stores Association, Negros Occidental Rice and Corn Dealers Association, Bakery Stores Association, and other donors The resignation of Mr. ROBERT YU in 1953 paved the way for the promotion of the Supervisor Mr. YAO E. CHING, to the position of Principal. Under his strict guidance and supervision, school documents and records were kept systematically. When he resigned the following year, Professor JEN TAI who served for only a year, succeeded him.</p>
<p>On April 5, 1955, a great conflagration destroyed several commercial stores and residential houses in Bacolod City, incurring huge financial losses to many supporters of the school. As a result, financial support to the school decreased, thereby causing an irregular payment of compensation to the faculty members and other school personnel. But through the donations received from many Chinese sympathizers from all over the Philippines, Tay Tung High School was able to resume a smooth operation and even up to the present accepts more indigent students who request for tuition privileges.</p>
<p>Mr. SHIM CHI KONG was the Principal for the next six school years, 1955-1961. It was during his administration that the school first offered 6 years Chinese studies in the Secondary level; 3 years Senior high. The same year when the school was also finally recognized by the Department of Education under the Bureau of Private Schools. More reference books and laboratory equipment for Physics and Chemistry were brought from <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> in the summer of 1958. With great effort, the Board of Trustees constructed in 1959, the two- storey building at the left wing of the school, covering an area approximately 600 square meters. The first floor was for the elementary classrooms, while the second floor was made into a dormitory for boys and girls.</p>
<p>Mr. SHIM CHI KONG resigned in 1961 and was replaced by Mr. CUA SIOK PO. However, due to the pressure of work in and out of school, he resigned and Mr. ONG BI CHEONG took over as Principal. During the term of Mr. Ong Bi Cheong another building at the right wing was built. After five years, in 1968, he resigned. He was succeeded by Mr. YU AN SUN, the first Tay Tung alumnus to serve as Principal. He also served concurrently as a member of the Board of Trustees. His loyalty and love for his Alma Mater made him render his services for free during his two-year term as Principal.</p>
<p>In 1970, Mr. BENITO MESINA was installed as Principal. He served for four years, after which, Mr. YU AN SUN, returned to head the school. Less than two years later, Dr. WILLIAM HSIEH acted as principal for only 1 year. After him, the Board of Trustees hired Miss LUZ V. NAVARRA , a newly retired public school Supervisor, for a three-year term. Without a Principal, the Academic Affairs Committee, composed of five members, managed the affairs of the school with Miss Navarra for the school years 1976-1979. The committee, with yearly alternating chairpersons, namely, Mr. ALFONSO LUIS TAN and Mr. JOSE GO, continued to administer the school operation for another school year, with an Executive secretary Miss LEU LITA L. CU, an alumna. After that, Miss LEU LITA L. CU was appointed Principal for five years until 1986 when Mrs. ERLINDA T. LEONARDO took over as Principal up to 1996.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Leonardo, Mrs. Emelita Chen (deceased), a 1997 alumna, was named Principal and up to her time she served with the vision and commitment of creating significant changes and improvements in the development and management of knowledge through education and technology in a cosmopolitan environmental.</p>
<p>After that, comes Mrs. DY KIAN BEE, who is an alumna, Chairman of the Academic Affairs Committee of the school and Member of the Board of Trustees whose primary thrust is to make Bacolod Tay Tung High School educational program more relevant and effective in meeting the needs of the learners. She also sees to it that the curricular and co- curricular activities of the learners are extensive so as to equip them with a more functional knowledge and skills in a friendly school system. With the Chiao Kuang Educational Center, the new Pre-School Building, the Home Economics, the renovations of offices and classrooms, and, training of educators, it is believed that the teaching-learning conditions will improve and excellence will be reached. This is Mrs. Dy Kian Bee's paradigm of success for Bacolod Tay Tung School studentry as also inspired by the Board of Trustees headed by Mr. Andres Valencia, benefactors, and the community of educators.</p>
