<p>I just reorganized and reworded most of the article. I took out these two excerpts because I shouldn't find reliable sources for them:</p>
<p>"Notably, Bacon is not the most linkable actor. That honour (as of <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>) goes to <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Steiger_6ab7.html" title="Rod Steiger">Rod Steiger</a>. The average Steiger number in the acting community is 2.679. By contrast, the average Bacon number is 2.955."</p>
<p>"Using one of the actors with the highest known finite Bacon number (8), <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Rufus_Shafter_cf3f.html" title="William Rufus Shafter">William Rufus Shafter</a> as the centre of the acting universe instead of Bacon, we can find two actors with a Rufus Shafter number of 15."</p>
<p>If anyone can provide proof for either of these, please put them back.</p>
<hr />
<p>The entire cast of the 2004 film <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primer.html" title="Primer">Primer</a> no longer have have infinite Bacon numbers - "Samantha Thomson was in World Without Waves (2001) with ..."</p>
<hr />
<p>I agree with Tolo - Kevin Bacon isn't famous because of the game - it's famous because of him. I have edited the opening sentence to reflect this.<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETellkel_8065.html" title="User:Tellkel">Tellkel</a> 23:25, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Forgive me, but is Kevin Bacon <i>only</i> famous because of this Trivia (as the page currently says)? Personally, I doubt it. Possibly reword? Tolo 08:42, Sep 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I was just wondering... What is the significance of the Bacon number? Does it only have to do with the game "Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon", or is there some other application for it? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefamouseccles_063a.html" title="User:Thefamouseccles">thefamouseccles</a> 08:02 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>"we can find two actors with a Rufus Shafter number of 15." Nice, but I don't see the connection to the Bacon Number. Is the article trying to say that using Rufus Shafter numbers, we can find people with a higher finite number?</p>
<p>"By contrast, the average Bacon number is 2.943." How can the average be around 3000 with 8 being the highest finite number known?</p>

<p>Can someone reword/explain what is written bellow. "record largest finite bacon number by year"? What does that mean? Why is 1998 "all 7s"? but 1997 is just 7? A bacon number of 7?</p>
<p>Actors with record largest finite Bacon number by year Year Record 1996 7 1997 7 1998 all 7s 1999 8 2000 all 8s Dec 2000 9, 10 Jul 2003 all 8s</p>
<p>(Quoting the article) "Relaxing the definition of Bacon number to include crew, however, yields an Bacon number of 3 for Erdős. N is a number had original music by Mark Adler, who also provided music for The Rat Pack, which co-starred Joe Mantegna, who appeared with Bacon in Queens Logic."<br />
I still don't see how this connects Paul Erdős to Kevin Bacon. Someone needs to connect Erdős to Adler. Jxyama 18:27, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'd suggest William Rufus Shafter has a Bacon Number of 7:</p>

<p>2 Joseph Wheeler - General Wheeler and Secretary of War Alger at Camp Wikoff - Russell Alexander Alger</p>

<p>4 William McKinley - Fifty Years Before Your Eyes - Charles Chaplin</p>

<p>The page has been edited to indicate that Christopher Reeve, not Rod Steiger, is the best center in IMDb - a claim also appearing on the page for <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon_9a1e.html" title="Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>. I assume this information comes from IMDbPro, which calculates Bacon numbers and perhaps similar statistics for other actors. Can anyone verify that Reeve currently has the lowest number? This seems odd, since he doesn't even make the top 1000 best centers on the Oracle of Bacon list <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/center_list.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/center_list.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --Ben Zimmer 19:03, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was unable to confirm the info using IMDb, IMDbPro, Google. So I've removed it for now. IMDbPro does not appear to compute data concerning "centers", only the standard Bacon number. Because of this, I find the claim that the info was on IMDb somewhat suspect. I also removed the IMDbPro link, as I couldn't see anything relevant to the article that wasn't already available (freely) from the Oracle of Bacon site. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 01:16, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find it hard to believe Rod Steiger is better connected than Christopher Lee. My understanding was that Lee is the best connected actor (he would anecdotally appear to have appeared in more films, in a greater variety of roles with more actors from both European and American cinema).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not about being better connected. It's about being connected to more people who are connected to more people who are better connected. At present, Lee and Steiger are at about the same point, with Dennis Hopper slightly ahead of them in the number one spot. I typed in the top 20 of their out of date top 1000 list, and Hopper was the clear winner. You can type any name in yourself to see, though I imagine it will continue to change over time.

<dd>I think the best thing is to just to name the top center on the list of best centers and note the date of the list. I'm sure they will update the list sometime. Doing your own research and <i>posting on your blog so as to cite it</i>, is heavily frowned upon. But it might be ok to just say the information was retrieved on such and such date; in principle, it should be verifiable as the UVA people, I'm sure, keep good records. That might be a little controversial though. Probably, even then, the only thing you can really say is that Steiger is behind Hopper on such-and-such date. BTW, it seems a lot of good stuff, like this stuff about centers, has been removed from the article. It doesn't seem to me that's an improvement. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 02:22, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
