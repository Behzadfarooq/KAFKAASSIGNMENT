<p><b>Backpacking</b> is a term used to denote a form of low-cost independent international travel, differentiating it from other forms of <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism.html" title="Tourism">tourism</a> notably by the following typical attributes: minimal budget use, longer duration traveling, use of public transport and multipliable destinations/countries. The origin of the name comes from the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpack.html" title="Backpack">backpacks</a> that budget travelers generally carry in the interests of mobility and flexibility.</p>
<p>Many commentators see backpacking as descriptive, not only of low-cost travel, but of the culture and philosophy often associated with it, especially <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_citizen.html" title="World citizen">anti or trans-nationalism</a> as well as a romanticization of <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanderlust.html" title="Wanderlust">wanderlust</a> and a desire for "authentic" contact with local culture.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacking_%28travel%29.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The term backpacking is said to have originated in the early 1970s with the advent of low-cost jet airplane fares. During this era it became common for young <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_World_97bb.html" title="Western World">Westerners</a>, to follow the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie_trail.html" title="Hippie trail">hippie trail</a> into <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. This period also gave birth to the first budget guidebooks (see <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonely_Planet_3095.html" title="Lonely Planet">Tony and Maureen Wheeler</a>) and began to change the way that many people looked at the possibilities and opportunities of travel.</p>
<p>More recently, backpacking has become something of a <a href="../../../r/i/t/Rite_of_passage.html" title="Rite of passage">rite of passage</a> in the popular culture of some countries, most notably <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, where after finishing high school, university or a period in the army they take several months to two year's break in Europe (some of whom work in this region), Asia or the Americas. This can be put down to the light population and geographic isolation of these two countries from much of the world's population and history, the fact that Australia and New Zealand are both affluent English-speaking countries where the majority of their citizens can afford overseas travel, and that both countries have a tradition of students attending university in the home city rather than moving away for college. A substantial amount of young adults from <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> also undertake long-term backpacking trips, particularly after they finish their mandatory military service. Travel of a backpacking nature is also extremely popular with Northern Europeans, particularly the Dutch and British, and with small sections of North Americans and the Japanese.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Low-cost options are popular: such as sharing lifts, budget flights, rail/bus passes (or if the backpacking trip is circumglobal, a relatively cheap round-the-world air ticket which permits numerous stops), <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_hostel.html" title="Youth hostel">youth hostels</a>, free <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospitality_services.html" title="Hospitality services">hospitality services</a> and buying food at local stores abroad instead of going to <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurants</a>.</p>
<p>Hostels and other budget accommodations in the 'developed' world tend to be communal to some degree, and thus backpacker culture is often highly social and emphasizes the camaraderie of communal life, such as the shared kitchens common in many hostels. When backpackers stay in one place for a while, they often seek a house-share with numerous other backpackers and are likely to share a room to keep the costs down. In the 'developing' world accommodation is normally found in cheap hotels, pensions or guesthouses.</p>
<p>The common language of backpackers is overwhelmingly <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> in varying levels of fluency while <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> is arguably the second most common language encountered due to the large presence of backpackers from Germany or Switzerland. (However, German-speakers will usually only speak German informally amongst one another, and will otherwise speak English in most other situations). For experienced backpackers who wish to traverse the globe, a moderate spoken ability in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> is considered very beneficial due to the large number of countries and geographic area where these languages are spoken and English is not widely understood. Both are the official and primary languages of over fifteen countries each.</p>
<p>Britons, Australians, Canadians and Germans typically form among the most common backpacker nationalities in the world, in addition to Israelis, Americans, New Zealanders and numerous other Western European nations such as Switzerland or The Netherlands. Backpackers from <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> are very common in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, where there is little or no language barriers and the cost of travel and living expenses is often very favorable for the Spanish. The same is true of French in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Africa_e6b4.html" title="West Africa">West Africa</a>. Per head of population, Australia is thought to have the highest representation of backpackers, although there is no data available to demonstrate this empirically.</p>
<p>The relatively small numbers of Americans who partake in backpacking has long been a source of debate and even some confusion among other nationalities, who find it unusual that citizens of the worlds most populous Caucasian and English-speaking majority nation may be encountered far less frequently than residents of culturally similar nations such as Canada or Australia, who have similar levels of financial affluence but populations vastly smaller than the United States. Great diversity in landscapes, cityscapes, cultures, ethnic groups, climatic zones, and simply the sheer size of the United States are common citations as to why Americans may not feel the need to holiday or travel abroad as much as other smaller and relatively uniform nations. However, travel of a backpacking nature is arguably growing in popularity among US citizens as well.</p>
<p>Backpacker culture is perhaps typified by the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonely_Planet_3095.html" title="Lonely Planet">Lonely Planet</a> (Australian) series of guidebooks, which caters to budget travelers both in its regular guides as well as, more specifically, the "On a Shoestring" regional compilations. The <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_Guide_173a.html" title="Rough Guide">Rough Guide</a> (UK) and <a href="../../../l/e/t/Let%27s_Go_Travel_Guides_a692.html" title="Let's Go Travel Guides">Let's Go</a> (USA) series of guidebooks are also popular. In France, the traditional backpacker's guidebook is the <i>Guide du routard</i>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, backpackers do not travel with expensive electronic equipment such as <a href="../../../l/a/p/Laptop_computer.html" title="Laptop computer">laptop computers</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_digital_assistant.html" title="Personal digital assistant">PDAs</a> due to concerns about theft, damage, and additional luggage weight. However, the desire to stay connected coupled with trends in lightweight electronics have given rise to the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flashpacking.html" title="Flashpacking">flashpacking</a> trend.</p>
<p>Some backpackers take a high resolution <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_camera.html" title="Digital camera">digital camera</a> on their travels to remember encounters with new friends and to immortalize themselves in front of key tourist attractions and beautiful scenery. An <a href="../../../m/p/3/MP3_Player_5602.html" title="MP3 Player">MP3 Player</a> is also another compact electronic companion with a growing number of backpackers, who chiefly listen to music to alleviate the boredom of waiting for trains or buses or the journey itself. Blogging from various Internet cafes around the world is also a growing phenomenon, offering a more convenient way to relay information to interested friends and family at home.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacking_%28travel%29.html" title="Edit section: Age of Backpackers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Age of Backpackers</span></h3>
<p>Backpackers can be of any age to theoretically be part of the backpacker scene and subculture; however, the vast majority of budget travelers are clearly in their 20s. Patrons at most youth hostels are rarely under 18 (some even mandate a minimum age of 18) while guests over 30 constitute a minority. The 'stereotypical' backpacker is often envisioned as a senior college student or recent college graduate about 20 to 25 years of age with no dependents (spouse, children, etc.), therefore making it relatively easy to put typical daily responsibilities on temporary hiatus to go traveling for up to many months at a time. Depending on the part of the world people backpack through, the median age can vary slightly. Australia, Europe, and North America are known for generally having quite youthful travellers, while more 'difficult' continents and regions such as South America or the Middle East attract slightly older and generally more experienced travellers.</p>

<p>Rolf Potts writes in his book <a href="http://vagabonding.net/excerpt/" class="external text" title="http://vagabonding.net/excerpt/" rel="nofollow"><i>Vagabonding</i></a> about what he sees as the myths that surround conventional travel:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Of all the outrageous throwaway lines one hears in movies, there is one that stands out for me. It doesn't come from a madcap comedy, an esoteric science-fiction flick, or a special-effects-laden action thriller. It comes from Oliver Stone's Wall Street, when the Charlie Sheen character — a promising big shot in the stock market — is telling his girlfriend about his dreams.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I think if I can make a bundle of cash before I'm thirty and get out of this racket," he says, "I'll be able to ride my motorcycle across China."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>When I first saw this scene on video a few years ago, I nearly fell out of my seat in astonishment. After all, Charlie Sheen or anyone else could work for eight months as a toilet cleaner and have enough money to ride a motorcycle across China. Even if they didn't yet have their own motorcycle, another couple months of scrubbing toilets would earn them enough to buy one when they got to China.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>For many, this sums up the allure of backpacking, promising an "exotic" or "adventurous" experience that is also deemed "authentic," that is, an experience that, because it is self-planned and directed, does not fit within the typical Western-style <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacation.html" title="Vacation">vacation</a> or travel industry.</p>
<p>This desire to experience "authentic" travel may be a reaction to the commercialization of the travel industry. Many backpackers express disdain towards “packaged” travel experiences including <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruise_ships.html" title="Cruise ships">cruise ships</a> and guided or bus tours which typically consist of a large number of tourists led by a guide. In contrast, backpacker philosophy encourages self-reliance and individuality, like overcoming the language barrier without the help of a translator or making all of one's own travel arrangements (to present two examples). <a href="http://www.artoftravel.com/01people.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.artoftravel.com/01people.htm" rel="nofollow">John Gregory</a> sums up this philosophy as:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Those spending big bucks for guided travel get peace-of-mind in return. They are guaranteed no worries, no hassles, an experience as close as possible to being home, without being home. They get an hour and fifteen minutes for the guaranteed-open museum, then a two-hour sightseeing ride that catches all the picture-postcard highlights. They break for lunch at a "recommended" restaurant, where the food is reasonable and ordering is easy. And as the next bus pulls in they re-board theirs to repeat the routine, ending with an easy check-in at a reasonable hotel, populated with plenty of other tourists, pretty much like themselves.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>While all travel is good for the human spirit, budget backpacking is unparalleled for meeting people and experiencing worlds on their own intimate terms. There are many travelers who have the resources for pampered-class but choose to strap on a backpack and see the world via the seat-of-their-pants, because they know it's the best way to experience cultures and interact with local people</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the United States among many other Western countries, this backlash against the large-scale commercial travel industry as expressed in the philosophy of backpacking has made some inroads into mainstream culture, such as in the popular travel guide writer <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Steves_5cb8.html" title="Rick Steves">Rick Steves</a> who, like Tony and Maureen Wheeler of <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonely_Planet_3095.html" title="Lonely Planet">Lonely Planet</a>, spun his experiences as a backpacker in the 1970s into a successful guidebook series.</p>
<p>In addition to notions of authenticity, some backpackers value the sense of freedom and independence in this mode of travel. Especially on extended trips, there is often only a rough itinerary, which can be changed at will. If a backpacker does not like a place, she can move on. If she likes it, she is free to stay and kick back for a while. Travel directions may change when a backpacker meets other independent travelers and learns about destinations she had not considered before or joins up with new friends. The semblance of "gypsy" life has its own romantic allure.</p>
<p>Of course, while backpack travel is carefree in this respect, it is more complicated in that backpackers have to plan everything and deal with all adversities themselves. There is no cruise director taking care of them. However, some backpackers also view this as a positive: It is a challenge and adventure, and the sometimes intense problem-solving in unfamiliar surroundings helps to hone their life skills.</p>

<p>Many backpackers gain temporary work (usually low-paid, unskilled, casual, and sometimes in violation of local labor laws) in the countries they visit. For instance, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>'s pubs are well known for the number of Australian bartenders working in them; "Irish pubs" around the world hire Irish backpackers. In <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, fruit picking is a popular job among backpackers, although it can be physically demanding. Although while staying in one place for a long duration, say while working and living in semi-permanent accommodation it could be questioned whether you are still backpacking in the form of the adjective.</p>
<p>Backpackers are also commonly employed by hostels, where English-language proficiency and familiarity with hostel operations are considered assets. Hostels around the world are increasing their revenue by inaugurating work and travel programs, where hostelers can work for accommodation by performing basic hostel upkeep and operational duties.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacking_%28travel%29.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h3>
<p>Backpacker philosophy is sometimes criticized for being hypocritical. Some travelers have been known to forego finding "authentic" contact with a culture, and instead congregate only with other travelers in international hostels or guesthouses.</p>
<p>In addition, backpackers are sometimes blamed for the commercialization of the destinations they travel to. By definition, any “undiscovered paradise” cannot remain pristine under the demand of thousands of visitors. This can often lead to the overuse of certain natural and cultural resources, a vice backpacking shares with other forms of <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism.html" title="Tourism">tourism</a>. A notable example of this phenomenon is <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Bay_38bf.html" title="Byron Bay">Byron Bay</a> in Australia, which was a largely quiet backpacker town in the 1970s and is now considered one of the most popular destinations in the 2000s with a bias for <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppies.html" title="Yuppies">yuppies</a>. This is sometimes said to actually pervert the backpacking culture itself: while backpackers seek genuineness and "authentic" cultural interactions, thus often looking for places with as few other foreigners as possible, they very often tend to meet in so-called "backpacker paradises" - places where all backpackers meet and that, eventually, end-up being modern-day "hippie-resorts". Examples include San Pedro de Atacama, a formerly isolated village in Chile and now a town dependent on tourism, and the island of <a href="../../../k/o/_/Ko_Pha_Ngan_5726.html" title="Ko Pha Ngan">Ko Pha Ngan</a> in Thailand. This phenomenon is perhaps not unlike the phenomenon of gentrification that happens in urban ecologies.</p>
<p>A third layer of criticism is economic. Backpackers’ pursuit of “cheap” travel destinations is only possible through the imbalance of living costs between Western and developing nations. Thus, backpacking can be seen as an inherently exploitative activity that benefits from the poverty of destination countries. <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolivia.html" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambodia.html" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> are notable examples of very inexpensive countries which backpackers visit and have the ability to stay comfortably for months even on a relatively small budget. A more recent example includes the collapse of the peso currency in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> in the early 2000s, which quickly made that country a very attractive destination for budget backpackers. However, backpackers, involved as they are in an inherently pragmatic project, rarely give this concern any more thought than it deserves. The idea that the passing of money from the more affluent to the less affluent is "exploitative" is not as compelling as it may have been in decades past. A more plausible economic criticism, from the point of view of the local economy, is that backpackers do not spend as much money as packaged or luxury tourists.</p>
<p>An additional criticism is a perception of language arrogance by many backpackers, particularly those from largely monolingual English-speaking countries such as Australia. While having a common language is a defining feature of backpacking, monolingual backpackers (who overwhelmingly speak English) are sometimes accused of being too arrogant with their use of English while abroad. A common citation is the assumption that youthful people in many countries around the world are now proficient in English or that English-speaking help will not be difficult to find, as opposed to learning and speaking the local language at even just a basic level out of self-interest or respect. See <a href="#Language_Barrier" title="">#Language Barrier</a>.</p>

<p>In their defense, some backpackers say that budget travel pumps money into the economies of <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_e346.html" title="Third World">Third World</a> countries, increasing their standard of living and creating jobs, and doing this in a way that is inherently more egalitarian than mainstream tour companies, who often operate with minimal contact with third party vendors or average citizens. Backpacking in comparison, frequently makes use of local food vendors, merchants and accommodations, and thus does more to benefit the local economy. The lower cost to the budget-conscious young Western tourist and the increased patronage to local merchants actually makes the economics of backpacking a win-win situation in many cases.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Backpackers are accused of traveling to exotic places only to associate with other backpackers. That perception is probably correct but requires some explanation. Generally backpackers are from developed countries, speak fluent <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> (even if from a non-English speaking country). When these backpackers arrive in developing countries they congregate at the hostels and guesthouses in the center of town where they tend to not blend in. In these areas the best <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> speakers among the locals tend to be <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tout.html" title="Tout">touts</a> who will prey upon the backpackers to visit the factories that they "own", to buy jewels to smuggle back and resell in their home countries, to purchase their services as a "guide" and to undertake illegal activities such as <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug.html" title="Drug">drug</a> use.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Most backpackers would like to interact with locals, but have a hard time fending off the touts, as bargaining and negotiating hassle are key factors of backpacking in parts of the world. Locals with the intent of approaching a backpacker are generally not as aggressive as the touts. Backpackers would consider it obtrusive to approach a local in English and ask to join the local in their home for dinner for instance. The inability to travel beyond the areas covered by public transportation further strain the situation.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>It is worth noting that there is a notable difference between backpacking travel in the developed world, typically Australia, New Zealand, North America and Europe where hostel are commonly used, than in the developing world, typically South and South-East Asia, Africa and Latin America. In such developing nations travel is cheaper, but often harder. Equally where backpacking is popular, whole industries have established to tend to the needs of backpackers offering services to make their lives easier (laundry, visa applications, train tickets) and goods from 'home' countries not commonly available such as Falafel for Israelis, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marmite.html" title="Marmite">Marmite</a>/<a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegemite.html" title="Vegemite">vegemite</a> for British/Australian. Plus bars/restaurants showing sporting events from 'back home' and bootleg copies of movies. Well know examples of such places would be the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaosan_Road_c0ce.html" title="Khaosan Road">Khaosan Road</a> in Bangkok, <a href="../../../a/n/j/Anjuna.html" title="Anjuna">Anjuna</a> in Goa and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antigua.html" title="Antigua">Antigua</a> in Guatemala. In backpacker hot-spots, many bars and restaurants are set up primary for backpackers with few locals (Or even expatriates) patronizing them - this again fosters the social aspect of backpacking travel.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Classically, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> is a very common backpacker destination because of the availability of public transport and the large number of hostels and other budget accommodations, not to mention the immense sense of history and culture which permeates from this region. However, since the fall of the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Wall_24be.html" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> and the dissolution of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> states, <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> has become a rapidly growing destination for budget travelers. Originally this meant cities such as <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, but more recently <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenia.html" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a>, and the Baltic Republics have become a popular stops on the backpacking circuit</p>
<p>Long-term backpacker destinations are places in the developing world with low costs of living such as <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa.html" title="Goa">Goa</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>), <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essaouira.html" title="Essaouira">Essaouira</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>), or <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>'s East Coast, which is also colloquially known as the 'Goon Trail', is also a very popular destination for many backpackers, and particularly for those who enjoy non-stop beaches and party atmospheres. <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> is quickly becoming a hot-spot for backpackers, who are drawn to the continent by the often favorable exchange rates and unique culture and beauty. <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machu_Picchu_a695.html" title="Machu Picchu">Machu Picchu</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patagonia.html" title="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>, the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Frontier_3290.html" title="Triple Frontier">Triple Frontier</a> and the cities of <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_Janeiro_d5c5.html" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Paz_080e.html" title="La Paz">La Paz</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/s/Cusco.html" title="Cusco">Cusco</a> are often the highlights for travelers to this continent and see the most 'traffic'.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, certain destinations are so popular on the backpacking circuit that some cities house "backpacker ghettos," whole districts where large numbers of travellers congregate to find cheap accommodation, street food, and share travel information. The most famous of these is the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaosan_Road_c0ce.html" title="Khaosan Road">Khaosan Road</a> area of downtown <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>.</p>
<p>It is true to say that most backpacking follows established routes with terms such as the '<a href="../../../g/r/i/Gringo.html" title="Gringo">gringo</a> trail' in Latin America and the 'Banana Pancake' or trail' in Southeast Asia used. These routes and popular countries generally focus on three factors. And finally round the world air travel routing and airline hubs. It is easy to argue that Thailand's huge popularity is in no small measure a result of (its ease of travel and natural beauty aside) the fact it is an obvious stop-off between Europe and Australia. Consider the Philippines which has no overland connections, is not a major stop-off and holds similar attributes to Thailand is far less popular. The same is true of Eastern Europe's and Central America's proximity to affluent Western Europe and North America. Africa and notably, West Africa see relativity few backpackers since including them in a round-the-world ticket is difficult and expensive.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacking_%28travel%29.html" title="Edit section: Avoided">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Avoided</span></h3>
<p>While largely a matter of nationality, personal taste and the current political situation, some generalizations can be made about the destinations many backpackers avoid. For example, a fair number of backpackers, like many other tourists, avoid countries where there is a perceived danger of terrorism, food poisoning or hassle in the way of getting a visa or repeatedly being accosted to purchase goods/services. Some countries, wising up to what's good for their travel economy, have tried to address these issues. Morocco, which at some point had one of the worst reputations in this regard, is reported to have clamped down on hustling and touting aimed at foreign travelers. In Asia and Eastern Europe visa regulations are being greatly relaxed encourage more travelers. In Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan huge efforts are made to safe-guard travelers from terrorism and countries such as Syria and Iran, while holding terrible reputations abroad are welcoming of backpackers (once issued with a visa).</p>
<p><a name="High_Costs" id="High_Costs"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacking_%28travel%29.html" title="Edit section: High Costs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">High Costs</span></h4>
<p>Regions with a high cost of living, such as <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> for example, are avoided by many long-term backpackers because of the expense. Other destinations have high costs for transportation, such as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polynesia.html" title="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>, and are also avoided by the majority of backpackers. This rule applies to a lesser degree to many destinations in Western Europe, where costs are generally high enough to discourage extensive (three months and longer) budget travel, particularly when the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">Euro</a> is trading very strong. Travel to popular but extremely expensive cities such as <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> or <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> is generally limited to just several days, and backpackers tend to try and fit as much daily sight-seeing as possible in such locations.</p>
<p><a name="Infrastructure" id="Infrastructure"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacking_%28travel%29.html" title="Edit section: Infrastructure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Infrastructure</span></h4>
<p>While not an absolute, countries without developed infrastructure, especially in the form of public transportation, are more difficult for backpackers to travel in because of the serious limits on mobility. This includes many African countries and the greater part of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>.</p>
<p>Some travellers also avoid the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> for similar reasons, because of the general lack of public transport, the expense of renting a car and the lack of hostels in many destinations, which are largely relegated only to the most major cities, the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> Coast, parts of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a>, and parts of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. Hostels in the United States are also generally expensive in comparison to many other countries, often between $US20-30 per night. This has given the United States a reputation for being relatively 'unfriendly' towards backpacking culture even though it is a highly desirable, varied, and generally safe country to be explored for foreign backpackers. The prevalence of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motel.html" title="Motel">motel</a> chains, catering primarily to private motorists, may contribute to the relatively small number of backpacker hostels in the USA. These same problems are also present to an extent in parts of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, where the centrally-located provinces generally have few options for backpackers.</p>
<p>People who wish to travel the United States extensively and as cheaply as possible often decide to purchase an economical <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van.html" title="Van">van</a> with improvised bedding within the vehicle. Even this option is becoming increasingly expensive however, as oil prices in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a> remain stubbornly high. This lifestyle also may discourage many solo backpackers, as they must pay many bills entirely by themselves and establish few social connections.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacking_%28travel%29.html" title="Edit section: Instability">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Instability</span></h4>
<p>While the desire to travel at low cost and the desire to travel with convenience and security are often at odds, some countries are generally avoided by backpackers because of the general political instability. In the most extreme cases, such as <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> opportunities for travel may be severely curtailed or an outright impossibility. Other areas are avoided by many backpackers because of the perceived general hostility of the political climate, including some parts of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and parts of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Africa_dbbc.html" title="Central Africa">Central Africa</a>.</p>
<p>These are generalizations made by the majority of the community and are disputed by many others (<a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> being a recent example of debate), especially travelers drawn to “dangerous” destinations.</p>

<p>Some countries are largely avoided by backpackers due to a substantially increased risk of being kidnapped or mugged of their possessions, to the point where the benefits of travel may not compensate for their dangers. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombia.html" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> in South America is a notable example, which has the unfortunate reputation of having one of the highest number of kidnappings per capita in the world. Many other South American cities, such as Rio de Janeiro, <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_23d2.html" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lima.html" title="Lima">Lima</a>, also have high crime rates. Moreover, African cities such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nairobi.html" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a> are also discouraged on the backpacker circuit due to their high crime rates and perceived danger of visiting.</p>
<p>Generally a backpacker will keep his main funds and important documents in the hostel or guesthouse room or safe to minimize damage if robbed or lost during the day. Backpackers are thus most vulnerable when traveling between locations when they are carrying all their belongings and items most often go missing on public transport or at bus/train stations. Traveling by day will always minimize this risk as does being careful and/or in a group. It seems backpackers universally trust other backpackers based on the logic that someone wouldn't come all the way from <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> (or <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, etc.) just to steal from other tourists (although the wisdom of this logic is drawn into question due to the desperate financial woes often encountered by poorly planned backpackers). On the whole dangers while backpacking, when put in perspective and if using common sense are not overly great (certainly lower than that of the dangers of road traffic accidents, in many parts of the world), but unfortunately some travelers are either over confident, don't exercise common sense or (the minority) unlucky and fall victim to some annoyance.</p>
<p>Health is another issue of concern for backpackers with sometimes poor health facilities away from urban hubs and prevalence of diseases such as in some regions, malaria. More common, however are minor ailments like sun burn, diarrhea or food poisoning, which seems to be an unfortunate caveat of third world travel.</p>

<p>Many backpackers try to avoid crowds of other (ordinary) tourists. The first rule is to avoid traditional package holiday destinations such as <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benidorm.html" title="Benidorm">Benidorm</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canc%C3%BAn.html" title="Cancún">Cancún</a> because it goes against the backpacker's image.

<p>While a matter of personal taste, willingness to learn foreign languages, and other stipulations, countries where the English language is not widely understood or holds little sway in everyday life can or cannot be seen as a hindrance for independent travel. This may include a significant part of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, many parts of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>, and more rural areas of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asia_cb20.html" title="East Asia">East Asia</a>.
