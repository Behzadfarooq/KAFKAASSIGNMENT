	    <p>I have a stupid question, why do the bacardi bottles say Puerto Rican Rum when all the article talks about is its Cuban heritage? Why don't they explined its new Puerto Rican heritage just like it touched a tad on the Spanish heritage, before Mr Bacardi started the business in Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p>Uh, can someone please vouch for the sentence that says the company came under the leadership of Mr. Ron Bacardi? I think this might be a misunderstanding, since "Ron Bacardi" means "Bacardi Rum" in Spanish. I actually went to the factory in Puerto Rico, heard no mention of a guy named Ron Bacardi, and watched my friend make this very mistake.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seriously just means "Bacardi Rum", people. "Ron" is Spanish for "Rum". Can someone please check on this?</dd>

<p>OK. Thanks for the explanation. Far be it for me, a humble newbie, to try to disrupt the culture that's already established. I was hoping to get a pointer to a longer debate on this issue as I'm sure others before me have hashed this out already. I must say, at first blush, I heartily disagree with this policy. In fact, I find it somewhat absurd. I've never been a fan of any site anywhere that feels other sites need permission to link to their site. The Internet is all about links. It's not my fault that a given browser decides to save me the trouble of clicking a link by rendering a link graphic inline for me. In this vein, I hope it would not be disallowed to simply place a link (that didn't render inline) to a site. I.e. an external link. That would _really_ be stretching a point.</p>
<p>At any rate, it strikes me as a very sad thing that we can't link to graphics. The growing 'pedia will be a dreary place indeed without any art.</p>
<p>I don't claim to fully understand copyright law. I'm not a lawyer. I am an IT Director so I do appreciate concepts such as intellectual property rights and such. I don't want anyone to lose potential revenue. But it seems to me that if you put a graphic (or any material) on a public website, then there's no foul in someone else linking to the site. That's the whole _point_ of the Internet. No?</p>
<p>Finally, again let me stress, I'm in no way trying to impose my sensibility on this community. I am the newbie. I was "boldly editing" and boldly re-editing. And I will now stop. I will never link to a graphic again. But I wanted to add my thoughts to the debate (which I do hope is raging somewhere around here though I haven't found it yet). Ultimately the decision needs to be made by the owner of the hardware equipment which hosts wikipedia (the server(s)). Legally, I believe it to be true that only he/they has legal control of the content here (not withstanding any sort of GNU public license or other quasi-legal instruments.) I haven't quite determined who runs the show here. I suspect it's a Mr. L. Sanger. (?)</p>
<p>Know that I did try to learn what the policy on this subject was. I read thouroughly the Wikipedia Policy, Etiquette, Faux Pas, and Rules documents. Couldn't find any mention of this subject. It seems to me that it needs a big red warning somewhere if this is so taboo.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening. I'll go back to editing now. So many typos and grammar errors.... so little time.&#160;:)</p>
<hr />
<p>It's misleading to say that it's community consensus. It's foremost a legal conclusion. The courts (at least in the US) have ruled that making such links may be considered copyright violation. It's illegal. It's an annoying decision, because, as you say, you're just making a link. But such as it is.</p>
<p>External links are fine.</p>
<p>There is, however, a non-copyright decision as well, which is that Wikipedia is intended to be a self-contained work, and including outside images defeats that purpose.</p>

<p>The article somehow misses to mention that today's Bacardi Rum has little to do with the original drink produced in Cuba. The original product is now known as <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana_Club_fa98.html" title="Havana Club">Havana Club</a> which features a completly different (and IMHO <i>much</i> better) taste than Bacardi. The article also fails to mention the Bacardi company's attempt to steal the name and reputation of the latter rum by selling their own re-labeled as "Havana Club" in the US. In fact, the article doesn't even mention the name "Havana Club" at all AFAICS, despite the great focus on the pre-US history of Bacardi Rum. So seriously, even communist bashing is violating the NPOV. -- <a href="../../../m/u/d/User%7EMudd1_ce55.html" title="User:Mudd1">Mudd1</a> 08:00, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is there any link between todays Cuban-made Havana Club and Bacardi ? Before 1959, the name was never Bacardi's. Havana Club is made in Santa Cruz del Norte - what rum used to be made there ?

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Talk%7EBacardi_b2fc.html" title="Edit section: communist rant">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">communist rant</span></h2>
<p>Why does this article allow Ospina's communist rant unquestioned? The propaganda tactics used in this article are very obvious.</p>
<p>Example: The RECE (Cuban Representation in Exile) also receives funding from Bacardi family members. Activists for the RECE include Luis Posada Carriles, a terrorist involved in the bombing of Cubana Flight 455 in which 77 people died.</p>
<p>It's like saying: Mercedes-Benz automobiles are made in Germany, the same country that produced the Nazis. The Nazis killed millions of innocent people. World War II, which the Nazis started, led to the establishment of Israel. The establishment of Israel is at the crux of the conflict against Islamic terrorism today. Islamic terrorists caused 9/11. 9/11 prompted U.S. and Coalition forces to invade Iraq. Iraq caused the Democrats to win the Congress.</p>
<p>Actually, the comparison in the article is far worse because the RECE and Carriles share only a casual relationship, and Carriles has merely been accused by Castro and other unaccountable dictators of involvment in Cubana Flight 455. Carriles denies involvement. .....</p>
<p><br />
With respect, it's hardly a 'communist' rant - the statements made in the article are nothing like your comments - as any level minded person would realise (the example might have been better with VW's btw, which were made under the nazis...). He hasn't 'merely' been accused - there is good documented evidence about Carriles' links and involvement in said organisations and activities.</p>
<p>Update- for example - see this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban-American_National_Foundation" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban-American_National_Foundation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban-American_National_Foundation</a> - where Carriles admits to taking CANF money for terrorist activities.</p>

<p>I'm removing the recent addition about Ian Williams, which was completely false, stating that Bacardi had first developed his rum in Jamaica. When asked by Democracy Now if Bacardi's origins are in Jamaica, Ian Williams immediately says no. His claim is that a Jamaican moved to Cuba to distill rum, and that "it looks like" (meaning he's not sure) Facundo Bacardi might have acquired his distillery and used the same still (and nothing even suggests the still wasn't built in Cuba). There isn't a single claim anywhere on the web that the Bacardi line was created anywhere other than Cuba, not sure why this was taken so out of context.</p>
