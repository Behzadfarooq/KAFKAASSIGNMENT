<p>All people listed are not famous in the true sense. Surely better not to have one than to randomly pick some people. A famous alumni section should be reserved for blue plaque or public figure level people not advertising. Smoke pond 11:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the word "Famous" may be wrong so I have changed it to "Notable", however other schools and colleges have alumni sections on their wikipedia entry e.g. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kings_of_Wessex_School_4cf3.html" title="The Kings of Wessex School">The Kings of Wessex School</a>. I think you were wrong to delete the entry for Chris Cox and have reinstated it. I don't see why someone who has an entry on Wikipedia (you don't have an entry on wikipedia unless you are notable) shouldn't have their entry linked to from their old school. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesy_mike_0575.html" title="User:Cheesy mike">Cheesy Mike</a> 12:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Smoke pond - you seem to have something against Chris Cox and have deleted him again without reason. I think he is just as notable as the other alumni and have therefore reinstated him. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesy_mike_0575.html" title="User:Cheesy mike">Cheesy mike</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECheesy_mike_bc72.html" title="User talk:Cheesy mike">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cheesy_mike_9e61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cheesy mike">contribs</a>) 08:49, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I agree with you change to Notable and have updated the page as this change was actioned, but have removed Chris Cox again, and am inclined to do the same for the other two entries except the MP. If someone has an entry on Wikipedia this doesn't mean they are notable. You need to look at the edit history on the persons page in question if you are unsure. If you do that with Chris Cox's page you will see it's started and following entries are mainly by a review website listed as for 'Bristol &amp; Beyond'- not what you might call notable. Furthermore, the edit page is full with comments removing large chunks for reasons of self promotion and advertising. Personal Wikipedia pages need to be viewed with caution.</p>
<p><br />
Notable in literary terms is defined as ‘an important or famous person’ so I think it if fair that people included on this list should be important and or famous.</p>
<p>I refer to my original point - If everyone who has received that level of success is now referred to 'Notable' the page would be filled with hundreds of entries. From the school leavers that I am still aware of back when I left the school I could link to at least 15 people who have similar and in some cases far greater achievements, are in the public eye and have a very obvious online profile. (I will leave the designer and author for now as I have not had time to read about them but my first impression is the author in particular does not fall into this category). I am not trying to be harsh, only fair to all the success emanating from the school. Smoke pond 08:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cheesy mike - you didn't allow me to post in the talk section before reinstating. Please see above. I have nothing against Chris Cox!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>An after thought: at random I clicked on another schools wikipedia page [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechen_Cliff_School" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechen_Cliff_School" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. Please note the type of people included in the notable persons list. 81.179.39.11 09:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are some pretty obscure people in that notable alumni list. One could argue that they are just as obscure/notable (depending on your opinion) as Chris Cox. It looks to me like a valid reason to reinstate him. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesy_mike_0575.html" title="User:Cheesy mike">Cheesy Mike</a> 11:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would say all but Adam Campbell and Alan Doughty (who do seem obscure and I would argue against their inclusion if the school mattered to me), are people of note on that list. They are careers and people of note. I repeat, a show in Edinburgh and appearing on Radio 1 doesn't count as notable. This is a link to an advert of a person at the start of a potentially notable career. It devalues the list if everyone is included when they become a performer. I think the other list identifies, with the two I have mentioned excluded of course, what this list should represent. I don't want to have to type each name and then the achievement, but it you were to compare the other list with the Backwell School one would start to look very silly. I think we leave Chris Cox out until he becomes notable, which it seems he has great potential to. Or we leave him in and start to fill the list with people who have the potential to be of note in the future.</p>
<p>The question also stands do you then remove the author as again, this is not of note, he writes music bios. If you write books are you of note? I don’t think so. If you write best selling books are you of note? Yes, I think this is more like it. If you write a book with is recognised as being good, then are you of note? Yes. In this way I am on the side of not including him either. Smoke pond 12:49, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
