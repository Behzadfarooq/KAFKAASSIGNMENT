<p>The page got started in the right direction, but has severely slipped in quality. There are missing reference, deleted sourced data, and unreferenced information.</p>
<p>The first thing which needs to be done is that it should be made consistent and then the missing references need to be retrieved. It also needs to be watched by somebody.</p>
<p>This page has the potential for a Good Article and even better, but the main concern is that too many items are added unreferenced and it needs constant cleanup and watching until it has left the Top 20 or so. If it is kept clean and if the lost references are retrieved, it mainly requires some copyediting and then it can go for a Good Article / Peer Review and ultimately Featured Article. The whole problem is that somebody with experience needs to clean it and keep it clean. The currently rating is negative, but it has a lot of potential and it is a potential Featured Article. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittenKlub_4f17.html" title="User:KittenKlub">KittenKlub</a> 20:16, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As of today, June 16, Christina has no official cover for "Back to Basics" The cover that is being posted is unnofficial and was created by a fan over at www.christinamultimedia.com please stop reposting it until an official cover is released. thank you. visit Christina Multimedia for more info on the subject</p>

<p>Is the tracklisting accurate? I remember hearing Christina say that there's 23 tracks including interludes, on the <b>Making the Video: "Ain't No Other Man"</b> episode. Does anyone know what tracks are included? Ain't No Other Man, Thank You, I Got Trouble, Candyman, Save Me From Myself, Naughty Nasty Boy-for sure because these tracks were posted on her website (before it was changed)</p>
<p>The following tracklist is found on the Press Area for Sony/BMG Website, wich means it is most likely true. Note that it is still not 100% confirmed. The last track on CD 2 is supposed to be an Enhanced CD ROM part</p>

10 Enhanced CD<br /></p>
<p>This is the one posted over at Christina Multimedia, it looks pretty decent, it has 23 tracks incluiding the Enhanced part, plus it says its from BMG (who owns RCA) so you think we should post this one as 'subject to change'? --Xionel 07:22, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I heard that the enhanced CD part is actually a documentary about "Back to Basics," which goes behind the scenes with Christina in the studio and everything...</p>

<p>The article says that "Tell Me" will be Christina's next single off the album, which features P. Diddy. Well, that single isn't listed on the track listing. I think whoever wrote it got confused. I heard that P. Diddy is going to release his last album "PD5" and that he was thinking about releasing either a single with Christina Aguilera or a single that featured Nicole from the Pussycat Dolls. Maybe "Tell Me" is the Diddy track and not Christina's...</p>
<p><br />
Yes, in fact "Tell Me" appears to be Diddy's 2nd single of his new album "Press Play". It was mentioned recently on TRL.--Xionel 07:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just found a praising review From Back To Basics by Tammy LaGorce in Amazon. com which explains accurately (but somewhat subjectively) the reasons why the album seems to be quite an artistical achievement from Christina. It would be biased to put it, since the album has not come out yet and no other reviews have been written, but when the album DOES come out (despite the leakage) you may find in Amazon a place to start an objective and precise review. Just in case you end up using some of it in the final cut, I'll post it right here:</p>
<p>Back to Basics, Christina Aguilera's first disc in four years, refines and clarifies the--let's call it "sexy"--aura surrounding this platinum firebrand. Now 26 and married, the best belter in a class that counts Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears on its roll call has turned her attention to love songs: the supercharged and ubiquitous first single "Ain't No Other Man," for one, and the hushed stunner "Save Me from Myself" for another. That doesn't mean she's foresworn being nasty, though. Dive deep into this set, past the gorgeous crackle that frames the old-school jazz-, blues-, and soul-inspired tracks on the first disc, and you'll reach a playful and familiar raunch; "Candyman" celebrates a "one-stop shop" who "makes the panties drop" to a boogie-woogie beat, and "Nasty Naughty Boy" sends out a heated, big-beated invitation to "sip on my champagne/Cause I'm gonna give you a little taste/Of the sugar below my waist." Thoughtful listeners should snap out of their fascination with Xtina's undiminished yet newly un-tramp-like sexuality, though, because what they'll really want to focus on throughout these 22 tracks is the honest-to-God artistry. While the rock producer Linda Perry helps disc two pop in interesting and unexpected ways (check the muffled blues number "I Got Trouble" and "Mercy on Me," an obvious nod to Fiona Apple), DJ Premier, a mainstay on Jay-Z and Nas projects, pipes a batch of aural high-fives into the nostalgia-bitten first disc (the deep-down funk of "Back in the Day," the strut-strut early hip-hop sound of "Still Dirrty"). Their nudges aside, though, Back to Basics is all Aguilera's baby--she executive-produced, and she's found herself artistically. Nobody would argue, in fact, if she swiveled around the chorus to "Ain't No Other Man," written for her husband, and aimed it at herself: "You got soul, you got class/You got style, you're bada--." --Tammy La Gorce</p>
<p>I'm truly hopin' Mr. Erlewine does the review of Xtina's album for allmusic.com since he's an objective reviewer that gives solid credit to his claims. Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Details about the Pepsi campaign and the track with P.Diddy should be discussed in the main Christina Aguilera page and not in the "Back to Basics" page since the relation to the album is minimal. I understand that it should be stated that "Here to Stay" is being used to promote Pepsi, but the details about Elissa and Rain don't have anything to do with "Back to Basics". Neither does "Tell Me", since it's not on Christina's album.--Xionel 07:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I agree. The information is entirely irrelevant to the topic of this article. I'll move them to the artist page.</p>

<p>I have removed a short paragraph about Christina's upcoming album sales, and her supposed competition with the new Jessica Simpson album. It is extremely biased in the fact that whatever shall happen with both of their respective sales shall just be proven when the album comes out. Whoever added that in, kept referring to the fact that Jessica and Christina will be equal in album sales and that is not a proven fact.

<p>Yep, A&amp;R:Ron Fair</p>
<p>Yes, Ron Fair is only listed as A&amp;R on this one, but that's rather unusual as he no longer works for RCA Records; according to HDD, he was recently promoted from president of A&amp;M to chairman of Geffen--both within the Interscope Geffen A&amp;M group of Universal Music, not Sony BMG. <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clive_Davis_5826.html" title="Clive Davis">Clive Davis</a> likely did more actual A&amp;R work on this album than Ron Fair did. --RBBrittain 01:17, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been reading a lot of reviews on "Back to Basics". Rolling Stone gave it 3 out of 5 stars, All Music Guide gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars. I don't know how to do this, but could someone add the ratings on the album info chart on the right??</p>

<p><br />
How can this be???</p>
<p>u just have to check media traffic on 25 aug(next friday)to see the first week sales, though it has sold 140,000 in Australia, though i think it sold only 70,000 because i think they double it in australia caus its a double album</p>
<p>Anyway, how could it have sold 91,000??it already sold like 180,000 in US even though it only got released 2days ago!</p>
<p>Plus who has been putting up that B2B has one no.1 in Uk and US the new charts aren't even up yet?</p>
<p>And B2B doesn't debuted in Germany yet!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Now Back to Basics debuted in Germany...its written on christinaaguilera.de</p>
<p><br />
Has it been released in all European countries? Because i can see in the list of releases only a few of them and not Greece&#160;:( --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronisgr_5b31.html" title="User:Chronisgr">Chronisgr</a> 08:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to make things clear, "Back to Basics" will not get double certification. According to <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a> certificaiton criteria, in order for a multi-disc album to get double certification, it must exceed 100 minutes; "Back to Basics" is only about 75 minutes, therefore, it will not be double certified and will be counted as a single album. People have been saying that the album sales are doubled.</p>
<p>(Not same comment) Absolutely correct in the US (unsure about Australia as mentioned above). My MP3 rips (from a legal copy using EAC and LAME 3.97b2 with -V 2 --vbr-new) add up to only 78:54 in Windows Media Player 10, 0:01 less than the article states and only 1:05 greater than the single-disc <i>Stripped</i>; my rip of <i>Stripped</i> (same settings) takes up more hard-drive space than both discs combined. --RBBrittain 00:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC) (Revised) --RBBrittain 01:13, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>but in the song she said "this is FOR you", so it could mean 'for you' scott storch. just beause some newspaper said it is meant to be somthing doesnt make it true, newspapers get things wrong, or lie on purpose, they do that to have more shocking headlines and sell more papers, until christina actually says so herself what the 'f' stands for, nothing is really a reliable source, and where esactly did the newspaper get this info from......? some uncredited source no doubt....*rolls eyes*</p>
<p>im not saying that it doesnt mean 'fuck you' i think its meant to be an innuendo type thing, or somthing that could be taken either way, its like in candyman when she sings "he's a one stop shop, with a real big....*gasp*" it could be taken in THAT way...but she still doesnt say the word, but its obvious what it could rhyme with, but its isnt official that its meant to mean that, until christina says so herself, so what if the newspaper is old/started a long time ago? (yes, i did look at the article), does it make it any more truthful than any other newspaper?, no newspaper is 100% factually correct, especially when it comes to articles about people in the entertainment buisness. just because some newspaper worker who has no connection with the artist says when an initial in a song stands for, it deosnt make it any truer, how do THEY know what it means?, just because somthing in in an article doenst make it true.....81.1.112.20 23:31, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>as we do not know what the f stands for, i think we should say it could stand for either "for/fuck u scott storch" as there is no proof that it is either, it could stand for any f-word really.....there is no more FACTUAL evidence that makes one right and one wrong, so i think both ways should be mentioned</p>

<p>Since I couldn't find an official Russian album chart (actually I could find only single charts) I asked a Russian friend and he just replied and as far as he knows there is no official chart since MTV Russia doesn't mention or broadcast it either and he has been looking for one as well.

<p>Is it important to keep mentioning that over and over again?</p>
<p>Back to Basics is a double-disc album. The first disc is a throwback album with elements of old blues and jazz with a modern day twist. The first disc is also more "beat-driven"</p>
<p>Aguilera has described her newest album as an urban soul record combining elements of 1920s, '30s and '40s blues and jazz with modern day influences.[2]</p>
<p>The album features what Aguilera describes as "a throwback to the 20s, 30s, and 40s-style jazz, blues, and feel-good soul music, but with a modern twist."[2]</p>

Hey everyone...I created this because it looks so much more organized but user named "Extraordinary Machine" keeps changing it back where it looks confusing. Also "Thank you" is written by Aguilera, Martin, DioGuardi, Sheyne, Frank, Kipner and NOT Aguilera and Perry. Just wondering why it keeps getting changed back. I also did this for Christina Aguilera and Stripped albums (no ones changed that one). So please explain why? Thank you. (P.S. a lot of album track listings are like this) <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tamara4006 (<a href="../../../t/a/m/User_talk%7ETamara4006_cd2d.html" title="User talk:Tamara4006">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tamara4006_b8c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tamara4006">contribs</a>) 06:14, 8 September 2006.</small></p>

<dd>The supposedly "confusing" format I keep reverting to is in compliance with the guidelines at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Albums_7646.html#Track_listing_2" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Albums">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums#Track_listing_2</a>, under which all album articles fall. Wikipedia also suggests against inappropriate use of tables in articles; see <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wikipedia%7EWhen_to_use_tables_1b0e.html" title="Wikipedia:When to use tables">Wikipedia:When to use tables</a>. If you'd like to suggest changes to the current guidelines then please do so at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Albums_a2c7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Albums">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Albums</a>, but I'm sure many users would oppose such changes because hundreds (possibly even thousands) of album articles use this format. I didn't realise you changed the songwriters and apologise for undoing that; however, it would have been useful if, instead of reverting without an edit summary, you had explained why you kept converting the track listing to a table. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 18:15, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh...okay...thanks for explaining it....I'm new to this and I dont understand most the rules and whatnot so I probably wont be contributing anything else. But thanks for explaining it and being nice about it.

<dd>Did you even read the page? Because it <b>clearly</b> says that a table is allowed and that it is a <b>GUIDELINE</b>. A table is perfectly fine!

<dd>From the guideline: "Using a table is recommended in more complicated situations" It does not say that a table is not allowed and besides that it is a GUIDELINE and not a rule. So instead of undoing other people's work, you might read a page first. Maybe we can actually improve quality instead of locking pages for a stupid word and not updating it for a week. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittenKlub_4f17.html" title="User:KittenKlub">KittenKlub</a> 19:59, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'Candyman' has been confirmed as the third single off of Christina Aguilera's album 'Back To Basics.' There had been much confusion over what would be the third single and a lot of rumors were spread. Some said that 'Heart' was going to be the third single, which would be included on the re-release of 'Back To Basics.' There is no re-release of the album as it is already a two-disc set, and 'Heart' is just the name for the Japanese version of 'Hurt' Christina's second single. Slow Down Baby and others were also rumored to be the third single, which one will probably end up being the fourth single, but were just crazed fans wanting there favorite song to be picked as the third single. On New Years Eve in Times Square in 2006, Christina performed <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candyman.html" title="Candyman">Candyman</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter.html" title="Fighter">Fighter</a>, a song from her second studio album, later confirming 'Candyman' as the third single. The song will be released in January of 2007, but has already started climbing the charts, without even being released. It has peaked at #5 on the bubbling under hot 100 chart, and has already entered the Hot 100 in other countries. The song is expected to be a big success as it hasn't even been released, and is already climbing charts. In all, it has been confirmed that <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candyman.html" title="Candyman">Candyman</a> is the third single off of the album to be released in January.</p>

<p>Why you removed the chart trajectories for this album? well, wikipedia is for something that is not temporary.., and chart trajectories is something permanent, its a very interesting thing to study or just checking out how well does this album performed. Especially with the sales of it. It wont be changed, it is something for sure, like the second week of the album on the chart which was at #3, will it be changed to #200 or back to #1&#160;?? NO . put it back..</p>

<p>This is just way too much. Not only should these images <i>not</i> appear anywhere but on the articles for the singles, but they are way too huge and all of the information shown here should already be in the individual articles for the singles.
