<p>Is "beach cricket" really the most common term? I've always heard it referred to as "backyard cricket", although that may just be an Australianism. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaneKing_3c2a.html" title="User:ShaneKing">ShaneKing</a> 05:07, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Both are common. I mostly hear <i>beach cricket</i>, although I live 100 kilometres from the nearest beach. Beach cricket is, I think, the more general term. It would be good to make a redirect here from <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backyard_cricket.html" title="Backyard cricket">backyard cricket</a>. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 06:07, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've never heard "beach cricket", before I saw this article. To me, and all my Australian friends (from many places around the nation), it is "backyard cricket". Squizz. 23:49, 22 Aug 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd have to agree, backyard would be the more apposite term --I like pants 07:22, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh! And I thought Beach Cricket was the kind of cricket they played in the movie <i>The Beach</i> wearing beach clothing - what a disappointment. I've played so much of backyard cricket I could tell a few more rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three leg out - If the ball touches your leg thrice - you are out. To discourage intentionally using the leg to block the wickets. Misused by cunning bowlers to hit the leg.</li>
<li>There is another one where you can not run more than 5 runs in case the ball is momentarily lost. Happens a lot if you are not playing in a field.</li>
<li>Then there is the one where there is a 2 run boundary in addition to a 4 run one. This is used when there is some sort of structure in the ground which is closer than the 4 run boundary is.</li>
<li>Cricket without stumps - it is strange it actually works, but the batsman's waist is the marker. If the ball passes the batsman within two bricks/stones (about as wide as actual stumps) and below the batsman's waist he is out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, we use the 2-run boundary all the time in my school, as the building is quite close to where we used to play. I've also played cricket without stumps. Admittedly it was played with a paper ball in a classroom, but that's beside the point. We couldn't run more than 4 runs before you HAD to drop your bat and help look for the ball. Also, we have a rule where if you lose the ball, you either find it, or you're out. This applies to the "six and out" rule as well. If you can get the ball back within a short amount of time, you're not out. However, we stopped that after a few complaints from the neighbours about us climbing their fences. Never heard of the three leg out though..</p>
<p>At my School if the ball bounced off a wall, or in our case a cricket net, The fielder had to catch it one hand. We also modified the one hand one bounce rule that you had to catch it in one grab if you juggled it it was given not out</p>
<p>- <a href="../../../q/p/e/User%7EQpeedore_7eaa.html" title="User:Qpeedore">Qpeedore</a></p>
<p>And about the ball. In India Cosco (sports goods manufacturer) markets a ball. It is a tennis ball but with the slight difference that it is marketed as a cricket ball with the name <i>Cosco Cricket</i>. It is highly likely that Cosco sells more Tennis balls in India than Cricket balls. Economy and safety guides cricket here. A real cricket ball will injure more and is costlier. --<a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnkur_0fc1.html" title="User:Ankur">Ankur</a> 10:19, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>What about the rule you can't bat then bowl, or is that just where I come from?</p>
<ul>
<li>We play that one as well as having designated fixed objects as fielders <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacco007_8efc.html" title="User:Bacco007">bacco007</a> 10:08, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I remember playing the can't bat then bowl rule, often the out batter went straight to wicket keeper if there was no auto wikki's because it was close to the stumps. We also had to announce that we were bowling next when the current bowler was bowling. --202.154.128.137 05:40, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tend to think of "peg" and "hit and roll" as games based on cricket, whereas backyard/beach cricket is cricket with some modified rules. It seems that some sort of distinction should be made between these "rules" and the others which are less signficant changes. Does anyone agree? <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 12:57, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, this should maybe seem obvious to y'all who've <i>played</i> beach cricket, but to this <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankee.html" title="Yankee">yank</a>, it's not. If you have a field that's "ideal for spectacular diving catches" you can't bowl the ball so it pitches, right? It's just an underhanded delivery, or what? It looks like the dude in the picture is bowling for real, and I don't know what the surfaces of your beaches are like, if you play at low tide or the dirt is packed tighter or what... but out here in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">Cali</a>, if you tried bowling a devastating leg break at a beach out here, it would thud unceremoniously a few feet in front of the batsman. So that should be clarified somewhere on the page. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_Wikardo_6749.html" title="User talk:Wiki Wikardo">Wiki Wikardo</a></p>

<dd>There's two ways you can play on a beach. (1) Do as you say and only "bowl" underarm full tosses. (2) Play on the smooth, hard-packed sand close to the surfline. A tennis ball bounces quite well off this sand. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 00:38, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I presume that this article is really about background cricket in Australia - but it doesn't say so. It all seems very familiar to me except for a couple of rules about fielders having to hit a bit to get a turn. Are the rules in NZ, SA, England, India, etc different? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 14:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My memory is that there was a reasonable amount of Indian input in this article.

<p>I think there may be an element of advertising to the last section are there any rules as regard to this opn Wikipedia?</p>

<p>Backyard, beach or garden cricket? Beach is probably too Australian-centric. I have never heard of Garden cricket. Article name changed to Backyard cricket which is universal. —&#160;<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 06:53, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
