<p>Is "off beat" synonymous with "back beat"? I've always thought of the off beat as the beats between the down and back beats (or as the odd eight notes).</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you read the article "Back beat (or "the off-beat") refers to any of the even beats in music" regardless of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metric_level.html" title="Metric level">metric level</a>, so that both the odd quarter and eighth notes are off/back beats on the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_level.html" title="Beat level">beat level</a> and the first division level, respectively. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 00:59, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This question is sort of along the same lines as the unsigned "Off-beat" q above. I used to think the sequence went "DOWN-up-BACK-up" but this article refutes that. I'm thinking of a simple rock beat where the sequence is kick drum &amp; hi-hat, hi-hat, snare drum &amp; hi-hat, hi-hat.... What do you call the times when only the hi-hat is played? <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoris_B_a324.html" title="User:Boris B">Boris B</a> 08:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My degree is in music, and when musicians refer to the off-beat, they usually mean the beats that occur between the four main beats in 4/4 time (usually counted 1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;). I have never heard back beats refered to as off-beats. I think it's wrong, so I will change it in a few days, if no one objects. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidan81_a7b5.html" title="User:Wikidan81">Wikidan81</a> 01:46, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>nobody objects if you source your information using text books. The article really needs text book refs. My research indicates that the offbeat is probably any of the even eighth notes (2,4, 6 &amp; 8). I think it's a note that doesn't start on a quarter beat 1 2 3 or 4, but more rsrch is needed.--<a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_9bbe.html" title="User:I'll bring the food">I'll bring the food</a> 03:44, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why single out thrash metal? Yes, it usually has a strong back beat, but it's not unique in that regard.</p>

<p>Did it really start in the 1940s? There are Jelly Roll Morton recordings (like Shreveport) which I'd say have a pretty definite backbeat. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKisch_3350.html" title="User:Kisch">Kisch</a> 19:10, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys were using a 2-4 back beat as early as their first recording session in 1935. Listen to songs like "Get with It."</p>

<p>Two topics I'd like to see addressed in the back beat article (or elsewhere), but don't feel competent to tackle myself:</p>
<p>First question: When a back beat is routinely defined as putting the emphasis on the 2nd and 4th beats in a 4/4 measure, what keeps these beats from being considered the new strong beats, i.e., beats 1 and 3, instead of 2, and 4? The Wikipedia article on time signatures (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signatures" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signatures" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signatures</a>) for instance, points out that most of the time, the downbeat (beat 1) receives the most emphasis, and in 4/4 meter, commonly the 3rd beat also receives emphasis, albeit to a lesser degree. So when the back beats (2 &amp; 4) are emphasized, what keeps them from becoming beats 1 and 3, just offsetting the location of the beats in a piece? That the casual listener feels the beat in this way is demonstrated by crowds that begin clapping to the beat in rock concerts. Invariably they clap on the so called back beats, beats 2 &amp; 4, not on 1 &amp; 3. So what is it about the music that keeps these back beats as beats 2 &amp; 4, instead of them simply becoming beats 1 &amp; 3 by default?</p>
<p>Second question: the definition of back beat is not enough to really define what it is that makes rock music rock music. Instead, it's the combination of sounds that are used on those beats. The sound pattern that I would call BOOM CHICK BOOM CHICK BOOM CHICK etc. I assume this is the sound that is referred to in the section titled "Beat between down and back" above as "kick drum, snare drum" (the hi-hat parts don't matter so much for this point). Is this drum pattern analyzed, described, or defined anywhere? It seems to be the universal rhythmic underpinning of most popular music since the 1950's when rock 'n' roll took off, and yet I rarely see any "scholarly" or serious discussion of it anywhere.

<hr />
<p>Answer to first question: I can't provide a sourced explanation, but with a back beat the stress in the melody is still on the 1 and 3, while the stress in the rhythm section is on 2 and 4.</p>

<p>Hi. I'm wondering why this page was reverted to a version that, in my opinion, contains much information that is unclear or impertinent to the topic (4/3/2007). Given that the subject is 'Back Beat', I believe the reverts give far too much weight to other things. Specific issues:</p>
<p><br />
1. In a 12/8 measure, the Back Beat is NOT counted on beats 2 and 4, but rather 4 and 10 (which would provide a 2, 4 macrobeat).</p>
<p>2. The topic of Afterbeat is not directly related to the Back Beat. Perhaps it would be better suited to a page on Musical Beats or Percussion Styles.</p>
<p>3. In a 4/4 measure, beat 4 ALWAYS precedes a new musical bar.</p>
<p>4. Back Beat emphasis is certainly NOT "used in virtually all contemporary popular music." This POV disregards almost all music made outside of North America and Western Europe.</p>
<p>5. The paragraph regarding Reggae and James Brown is focused entirely on the Downbeat. This information takes up 1/3 of the article and is unneccessary to this page as the Back Beat is emphatically distinct from the Downbeat.</p>
<p><br />
These issues aside, there is some good information to work with and I believe that the edits preceding the revert helped clarify and focus the subject. If you feel otherwise, please help the rest of us to understand why.</p>
