<p>Hopefully, some discussion, and a listing of sources will make the entry here much more honest to the situation in Canadian life.</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed your comment on the AfD talk page for Warden Avenue, and thought I'd inform you about what I'm doing. I've decided to test road articles to see which ones Wikipedians feel belong in WP, and which ones don't. Here are a few Toronto-area road articles up for deletion recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Warden_Avenue_fd60.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Warden Avenue">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Warden Avenue</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_O%27Connor_Drive_2140.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/O'Connor Drive">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/O'Connor Drive</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The first two have both been deleted, and the latter two are still open for comments and votes - if you'd like to shape the direction of wikipedia regarding road articles, you should participate in those two AfDs. Further, you should know that I'll be nominating a number of Toronto-area roads of <i>lesser significance</i> than the listed AfDs, and given the results so far, they'll probably be deleted too. Keep an eye on the <a href="../../../a/f/d/Wikipedia%7EAfD_ce4d.html" title="Wikipedia:AfD">AfD</a> page, or my contributions, to know when I make the nominations. Alternatively, I can leave a message on your talk page after I nominate articles - if you'd like that, leave me a message indicating this please. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 23:02, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, by the way, have a look at Category:Toronto streets and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Toronto%2C_Ontario_roads_f766.html" title="List of Toronto, Ontario roads">List of Toronto, Ontario roads</a>. Are there any you feel do <i><b>not</b></i> belong in WP that should go to AfD? I've made my own list, but I'd like input from other editors too. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 23:07, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How did bp nichol lane make it there, and a lot of arterial access roads not make this list...I'm surprised that you haven't started to purged some of the Church sites that I first went into wiki for haven't been purged because they aren't relevant??</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not a deletionist, I'm just trying to see what the consensus is for road articles. What I think doesn't matter, what the WP community thinks is more important. Anyway, bpNichol Lane is one I've targetted, but it has content that needs to be saved, so I'm treating it differently from all others. I just nominated a few <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Toronto-area_roads_5ee4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Toronto-area roads">Toronto-area roads</a>, so make sure to add your vote.</dd>
<dd>By the way, for AfDs, you should add your vote <b>at the bottom</b> of the list, and make sure you sign it (add four tildes, <i>~~~~</i>, at the end of your comment). In fact, you should sign all messages you leave on talk pages as a courtesy to others. If you're not sure if you've done it correctly, use the <i>Show Preview</i> button to see what the message looks like; then make sure to save if it looks OK.</dd>
<dd>Aside: please don't accuse me of purging - I have no such authority; I simply nominated the article that I felt would make a good test case for road articles. It was community consensus to delete it, just like it's community consensus that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steeles_Avenue_4940.html" title="Steeles Avenue">Steeles Avenue</a> will likely be kept. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 00:22, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good work on the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_George_Brown_da4c.html" title="Walter George Brown">Walter George Brown</a> article! My interest was in his political activities (which are a bit of a footnote) so it's good to have someone working on the article who has a strong interest in his religious vocation.</p>
<p>The article states: " During his summers, he went into the newly-opened lumbering camps of Northern Ontario." I assume that this was to preach amongst the workers rather than to work as a lumberjack (or perhaps both?) but I don't want to make any assumptions. Do you have any information we can add to the sentence?</p>

<p>(Chuckle) You make a good point about Presbyterian Church names. In <i>This Presbyterian Church of Ours</i>, I read that fifty percent of Presbyterian Church in Canada congregations are named for St. Andrew.</p>
<p>I came to your article through the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churches_on_the_Hill_502e.html" title="Churches on the Hill">Churches on the Hill</a>, article which I created, along with the one on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_Church_Deer_Park_d9f4.html" title="Christ Church Deer Park">Christ Church Deer Park</a>, where I attend. I am glad that you created an article on Calvin Presbyterian. The reason why I changed the name was simply because there are no other "Calvin Presbyterian Church"es with articles on Wikipedia. If there were articles on (as my google search produces) the one in <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigard%2C_Oregon_767c.html" title="Tigard, Oregon">Tigard, Oregon</a>, <a href="../../../z/e/l/Zelienople%2C_Pennsylvania_cd0a.html" title="Zelienople, Pennsylvania">Zelienople, Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland%2C_Rhode_Island_88de.html" title="Cumberland, Rhode Island">Cumberland, Rhode Island</a>, North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corvallis%2C_Oregon_1068.html" title="Corvallis, Oregon">Corvallis, Oregon</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoreline%2C_Washington_4530.html" title="Shoreline, Washington">Shoreline, Washington</a>, etc. etc. (that's just my first page of results) then I would put the "Toronto" distinguisher. But until/unless these articles exist, then "Calvin_Presbyterian_Church,_Toronto" is just more for visitors to type. Since you feel strongly about it, I can just reinstate the old title and make "Calvin Presbyterian Church" redirect so that people don't have to type the city name. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 16:55, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. What's your reasoning in reinstating the article? I thought it was fine merged with <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlington%2C_Ontario_153f.html" title="Burlington, Ontario">Burlington, Ontario</a>. You should probably have started a discussion on the Burlington talk page first. Anyway, since you've already reinstated the article, you should remove the stuff that was merged into Burlington, Ontario. There's also a lot of typos and work that needs to be done to the Burlington Transit article. (For instance the image that was deleted... I removed it from the article for you.) If you really want the article reinstated you should re-upload the logo. Still, I don't think it's a good idea. It doesn't add a whole lot of information.. except for the small list of busses used (which is probably unverifiable right now and outdated.) I also removed the routes. It looks like it was just copied and pasted it from a web site anyway, but the Burlington Transit page is listed in the external links already. I don't think we should have to maintain a separate list on Wikipedia just for the sake of it being on Wikipedia. Well it's probably clear where I stand on the issue of the reinstatement&#160;:) but please leave me a note with a response because I would like to hear what you have to say&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtea_ee58.html" title="User:Mrtea">Mrtea</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/t/User_talk%7EMrtea_12d6.html" title="User talk:Mrtea">(talk)</a></small> 23:36, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I noticed you've done quite a number of edits recently. Most are good but there is one thing that really irritates me and that is the overlinking of dates.

<p>"True, but look at recent developments, as the Mayor wants to get back into Streetcars" Given that the previous system was abandond on the basis of "unsightly" overhead wires, I hope that the new system is only allowed to open on the condition that it uses <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground-level_power_supply.html" title="Ground-level power supply">Ground-level power supply</a> and not <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overhead_wires.html" title="Overhead wires">overhead wires</a>.

<p>I agree that it is quite ridiculous that this article was nominated for deletion, and that it was clearly done by someone who actually knew nothing about the subject. However, the proper procedure is to write a cogent explanation of why it should be kept, not to blank the VfD debate and remove the AfD header. When presented with the facts, the Wikipedia community will almost always come to the correct decision. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:02, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And nn does not mean "no name", it means "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">non-notable</a>".

<p>Once again, I'm back, a little repentant, but concerned that the moderator who banned me, never replied to my e-mail. Thanks to the folks who have assisted. I must ask openly, if there is a problem with any of my postings, to use this forum (or otherwise) to object if a posting seems out of kilter.

<p>Hi, I got your email message. I wanted to clarify, on behalf of others, why you were blocked. Note that I have not spoken with them, so what I write here is my interpretation only.</p>
<p>First, you removed an AfD template from an article. This is considered vandalism; you shouldn't do that. If you disagree with an AfD, say so in the AfD page, and give reasons why the article should not be deleted.</p>
<p>Second, you blanked the AfD discussion. Again, this is vandalism. AfDs are designed to allow editors to debate the merits of an article's inclusion in Wikipedia. Blanking it can be viewed as an attempt to censor that discussion.</p>
<p>Third, you moved the AfD page. This is blatant vandalism, and should never be done. As with my second point, this may be viwed as an attempt to censor or derail a worthwhile debate about the article.</p>
<p>Fourth, removing the admin's comments from your talk page indicate that you're unwilling to discuss issues with other users. Wikipedia is about debating issues and achieving consensus. You've been here long enough that you should be familiar with that mantra by now.</p>
<p>You are right about one thing - it would have been better if the user that had nominated the article for deletion had informed you about it. Unfortunately, this doesn't always happen. However, if you keep articles in your watchlist, you should notice such actions.</p>
<p>You've made useful contributions to Wikipedia, but the behaviour you exhibited in this regard was simply inexcusable. The admin that blocked you had every right to do so, and used the privileges granted to him as an admin judiciously. I wholly support the short block that was placed on you (it should have expired by now).</p>
<p>In the future, it's best to engage in a meaningful discussion, through which other Wikipedians can understand your reasoning, and maybe even agree with you, than it is to act in a petulant manner. Vandalising Wikipedia will likely result in other editors taking you less seriously, and perhaps dismissing your arguments. That doesn't help your cause, does it?</p>
<p>Again, you've made good contributions to Wikipedia, and we'd like to see that continue. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 15:26, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bacl-presby,</p>
<p>I've seen you around the Presbyterian related pages for a while now. I was wondering if you had thought of putting something on your <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">user page</a>. It would be nice to get rid of that red link in the edit histories, even if you only put a simple "My name is Bacl-presby". It adds a degree of respectability, making you stand out from the "I just got a username to disguise my vandalism" editors. Just a thought.</p>

<p>Why did you revert the new photo of William Burns? It isn't a portrait, but it is a much clearer picture. I would like to add it back to the page since the quality of the Chinese wikipedia portrait is so poor. What are your thoughts?<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0324_b6f3.html" title="User:Brian0324">Brian0324</a> 19:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sorry, it's been put back into the article; glad it wasn't the one of Montgomery Burns (deleted with this comment-&gt; Simultaneously, with this edit, I am removing <a href="../../../m/r/_/Image%7EMr_Burns.png_4d62.html" title="Image:Mr Burns.png">Image:Mr Burns.png</a> from your user talk page. Please note that fair use images are only allowed in articles per <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html#Policy" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR#Policy</a> point no. 9.

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. W C Burns deserved a better image. Hopefully one day as much can be said of the missionary as appears noteworthy on the page of the cartoon character.
