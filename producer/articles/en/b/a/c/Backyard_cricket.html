<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backyard_cricket.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Whilst loosely based upon the game of cricket, many aspects are improvised: the playing ground, the rules, the teams, and the equipment. Quite often there are no teams at all; the players take turns at batting and there is often no emphasis on actually scoring <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28cricket%29.html" title="Run (cricket)">runs</a>. A bat of some kind is necessary. The bat can be anything, as long as it can hit the ball and can be suitably held in the hands. A ball (often a <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a> ball, since this is less likely than a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_ball.html" title="Cricket ball">cricket ball</a> to inflict injury) is the other essential item, (a tennis ball can be modified by wrapping half of the ball in electric tape in order to induce <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_bowling.html" title="Swing bowling">swing bowling</a>). The tennis ball is also common due to being much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and is easier to hit due to having a slower air-speed. The <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_pitch.html" title="Cricket pitch">pitch</a> can be any stretch of ground that is reasonably flat. The <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicket.html" title="Wicket">wicket</a> may be any convenient object - a cardboard box, a rubbish bin, case of beer, telegraph pole, or tree. Often, the wicket is by no means close to the official size, but it is used anyway. A wicket at the non-striker's end is generally a single stump if true stumps are available and in the absence of larger objects may be just a hat. It's main purpose is to mark the bowler's crease, but you can be run out by it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backyard_cricket.html" title="Edit section: Rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rules</span></h2>
<p>Backyard cricket rules change constantly. Often they are made up on the spot. As always with informal games, it is the unspoken rules that are most important: these are usually that all participants should have a reasonable chance to play a part regardless of age, gender, or skill level, and that no-one should be injured. Typical examples of the less important but explicit rules for a particular game include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bowling</b> - 'normally' 6 balls to an over with a new bowler each over. Sometimes longer overs or no overs are used. The striker's (batsman) and non-striker's (bowler) ends do not change. Instead, if there are two batsmen, they swap ends at the end of each over.</li>
<li><b>No balls</b> - would normally only be given if the ball is a grubber (strikes the pitch and rolls rather than bouncing). Random play may throw up other incidents which are inarguably a no ball though. The ball will be bowled again and depending on the days rules, will probably score the batsmen a run.</li>
<li><b>Wides</b> - Have to be obvious. A wide may or may not be bowled again depending on local rules and may or may not score a run. It is not wide if the batsmen swings at it unless it is out of his reach at the full extension of arm and bat. Which is a wide as obvious as a barn.</li>
<li><b>First ball rule</b> - a player cannot be given <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dismissal_%28cricket%29.html" title="Dismissal (cricket)">out</a> on the first ball he/she faces.</li>
<li><b>No Duck</b> - a player cannot be given out without scoring.</li>
<li><b>3 miss rule</b> - once a player has failed to hit 3 consecutive deliveries they are out, this number can be adjusted depending on ability and number of players. Rare.</li>
<li><b>Six and out rule</b> - hitting the ball over the fence (or into the water, into the big hedge, or some other area where the ball may be difficult to retrieve) counts as <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_%28cricket%29.html" title="Six (cricket)">six runs</a> <i>and</i> out. If a game is being played where runs are not scored, this rule may still apply.</li>
<li><b>One hand, one bounce</b> - a player is able to catch the batsman out with one hand as long as the ball has bounced only once, hence the name "one-hand, once bounce." A variation on this is that a player is out if caught one-handed after the ball has bounced off an obstacle (not the ground) such as a house, car, or window pane, etc. Another variation counts "one hand, one bounce" as half a wicket, requiring two catches for a dismissal. This counteracts the ease of dismissal when playing on hard surfaces with a tennis ball.</li>
<li><b>Two Bounce Headbutt</b> - A fielding player is able to headbutt the ball after it has bounced on the ground twice to dismiss the batsman</li>
<li><b>No LBW</b> - the more complex and subtle rules of formal cricket (like the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_before_wicket.html" title="Leg before wicket">leg before wicket</a> rule) are often ignored. This rule is often expanded to include no-balls and most wides (unless of course, the ball is unmistakably wide). This rule came about because of the lack of <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire_%28cricket%29.html" title="Umpire (cricket)">umpires</a> in this form of the game. Indeed, the bowling and popping creases are hardly ever indicated. There is simply a general consensus to deliver the ball when at a certain area.</li>
<li><b>Fixed LBW</b> - if LBW is being used, the ball must hit a specified area of the batsman, usually designated as below the knees while the batsmen is standing in his/her crease and directly in front of the stumps for he/she to be out.</li>
<li><b>Tippy-go'<i>,</i></b> <i>Tippity<b>,</b> Tip-and-run<b>,</b> Tip-hit<b>,</b> Hit and run<b>,</b> Tipsy<b>,</b> Tipneys<b>,</b> One Tip</i> or similar - if the batsman hits the ball he or she must run regardless of the distance or quality of the shot played. This is sometimes varied to two or three chances and the player must run before the second or third ball, respectively. These variant are called two tip and three tip respectively.</li>
<li><b>Tip-is-it</b> - often employed when there are two batsmen and the above rule is in effect. Tip-is-it specifies that in the event of a runout the batsman who hit the ball is out, regardless of which player is found short of their crease. This helps prevent the non-striker being dismissed at fault of their batting player.</li>
<li><b>Any wicket</b> - Fielders may run the batsman out by knocking over either wicket, irrespective of the end the batsman was running to.</li>
<li><b>Automatic Wickie</b>, <b>Electric <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicket-keeper.html" title="Wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a></b>, or <b>electronic wicket-keeper</b>, <b>automatic wicket-keeper</b>, or <b>auto-wiky</b> - a rule which states that if a batsman "snicks", or edges, the ball so it goes to where a wicket-keeper might have been able to catch him out, then the batsman is out, regardless of the fact that he was not physically caught out. Electric/automatic wicket-keeper is often a feature of backyard games played in house <a href="../../../d/r/i/Driveway.html" title="Driveway">driveways</a> and against garage doors, where it is physically impossible for any player to take the <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fielding_positions_in_cricket.html" title="Fielding positions in cricket">fielding position</a> of wicket-keeper. Of course, if there is a person playing at 'keeper, the electric/automatic wicket-keeper rule does not apply; an electric/automatic <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slip_%28cricket%29.html" title="Slip (cricket)">slip</a> fieldsman might be called into play instead.</li>
<li><b>Wicket-leave</b> - if there is only one batsmen and he makes a single run, he/she must exclaim Wicket Leave!, Wicket!, Safe!, Crease! or similar before walking back to the batting crease, or they may be run out.</li>
<li><b>Magic Fielders</b>, similar to the automatic wicket keeper rule, magic fielders can range from a chair to a hose, and the rule states that any magic fielder that is hit on the full will be recorded as out.</li>
<li><b>Tree Fielders</b>, similar to the Magic Fielder rule, the bowler is allowed to nominate a set number of trees (or bushes) as fielders. If the ball hits the tree on the full, the batsman is out. There are variations on the rules, such as the tree's canopy only counting as a fielder.</li>
<li><b>Hit and Roll rule</b> - a rule in which fielders who retrieves balls hit by the batsman are given the opportunity to get the batsman out by rolling the ball from that point towards the batsman's bat which is laid flat on the ground facing the fielder. If the ball rolls and hits the bat then the batsman is out and is replaced by that fielder. If the ball is only hit within a short distance, then instead of laying the bat down, the batsman swings the bat like a pendulum and the fielder targets the swinging bat. Another variant involving balls which are only hit over short distances is that the batsman holding his bat with the edge facing the fielder. The fielder aims to target this to get the batsman out as above.</li>
<li><b>Peg</b> - after the batsman has struck the ball they do not run. Once the fielder has the ball, they may throw it at the batsman's wicket. If the fielder hits the wicket, then the batsman is out and it is the fielder's turn to bat. Alternatively, if the batsman is caught or bowled then the fielder responsible bats next. Uncommon, bears more in common with Rounders.</li>
<li><b>Hit the Window</b> - If the batsman's shot hits a fragile item such as a window pane or a car, they are often given out. However this rule normally doesn't apply if the ball has ricocheted off another item first.</li>
<li><b>House Rule</b> - If the ball hits the house the batsman is out. Sometimes this is limited to the roof, or another area of the house, such as a garage door or a fence.</li>
<li><b>Creases</b> - The bowling crease is generally the non-strikers wicket along a line straight out to either side. The batsman's crease may be marked by a stick or spare bat, but is generally made by dragging the bat across the line of the pitch at a guessed metre out from the stumps and however distance is large enough to be clearly seen.</li>
<li><b>Batter to bowler</b> - not used much anymore but still an accepted form, a batsmen who goes out bowls the remainder of the over.</li>
<li><b>Can't Bat then Bowl</b> - If a lot a players are playing the batsman that just went out can not bowl for at least one over after he goes out. Sometimes he is not allowed to bowl until everyone else has bowled depending on local rules</li>
<li><b>Scoring</b> - when used is an informal thing with people keeping count in their heads and the winner gets nothing more than prestige. Runs can be made by running the length of the pitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sixes and Fours vary based on the surroundings but generally they are as follows: Fence on the bounce is 4, on the full is 6, over the fence is 6 and out. Far side of the road is 4, on the full is 6. If it goes too far down or over the road its six and out. The roof is 6 and out. Cars and caravans are out with no score. The house/shed is 4 on the bounce, 6 on the full. The windows though are out, no score. If the ball is lost in the bushes/scrub local rules apply. The batsman may keep running indefinitely, but more often a maximum number of runs would be agreed upon before he helps search, or he may join in the search immediately. A token 4 runs may be added.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Catcher's in</b> - The person who gets the batsman out will be the next to bat unless some players are missing out, in which case it will go to the person with the least chances at bat, or the youngest of same. Taking the catch counts as taking the wicket, the bowler gets no credit.</li>
<li><b>Current</b> - In the absence of two sets of stumps or objects of similar height and structure are total non availability (where batting stumps are drawn on walls doors etc,.)the bowlers end has usually a stone,or any similar object(including sandals),to act as stumps.Since hitting it directly with a ball is nearly impossible,the fielder can just have contact with the stone,while catching the ball in order to run out a batsman.Usually the contact is with legs.</li>
<li><b>Going out</b> - catch on the full, run out (either end for one batsman games), bowled, one-hand one bounce, 6 and out, roof, car, window etc is out, no 6. Spectators can catch you out.</li>
<li><b>Number of batters</b> - really depends on how many players you have. Two players only happens if there are enough fielders.</li>
<li><b>Bouncing on grass</b> - where the pitch is a small patch of lawn, or area surrounded by a cement circle/rectangle/path/etc, the ball must bounce on the green (or similar area) first, or else can be given out. Also similarly when there are few players, the ball might have to go past a certain point before runs can be scored.</li>
<li><b>Third Umpire</b> - In the event that there is a third umpire decision required a "toss" of the bat will occur and the batsman will make the call, if the call is successful then the batsman will remain "in" otherwise the batsman is "out".</li>
</ul>
<p>Within a given game, rules are often interpreted in varying ways, or added to as the game progresses. A younger child that benefits from the "first ball rule" but goes out to the second ball also might discover that there is now, by unspoken consensus, a "second ball rule" as well, and if necessary a "third ball rule".</p>
<p>The scoring system is sometimes modified, with rules such as "12 and Out" or "8 and Out" an event that occurs when a player hits the ball a great distance, possible over the road or into the ocean, depending on the location of the game. Sometimes, the "Aggrigate Rule" is played, meaning that a player receives the runs from a boundary as well as any runs they claim during the chase and retrieval of the ball. This allows for scores such as fives and sixes (without getting out).</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, backyard cricket (and other similar games) is one of the very few truly child-like activities that modern adults may participate in without attracting social stigma, and one of the dwindling number of adult activities that are accessible to children.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backyard_cricket.html" title="Edit section: Tactics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tactics</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Snicket</b> - A tactic employed by batters. Instead of hitting the ball towards the boundary or into open space, the batsman nicks the ball, thus sending it past the wickets. If there is no wicketkeeper, slips, or as in many backyard games, thick bushes, the batter can make several runs, while the bowler or the fielders run to retrieve it. This tactic is often banned by a disgruntled fielding team.</li>
<li><b>The Lost Ball Trick</b> - A tactic employed by fielders. When the ball is hit into bushes, the fielder/s locate the ball, but rather than return it to the pitch, the fielder/s pretend to continue to search for the ball, thus coaxing the batter to go for another run. At this time, the fielder quickly returns the ball, and if properly executed causes the batter to be run out.</li>
<li><b>The Hide the Ball Trick</b> - A tactic employed by fielders (at least 5 are required for). This tactic is similar to the "Lost Ball Trick". However, this tactic requires more fielders and is notably more spectacular, therefore is only used to dismiss batters who have been in for a long amount of time. When the ball is hit into bushes, the fielder/s locate the ball, but rather than return it to the pitch, they pretend to continue to search for the ball, thus coaxing the batter to go for another run. After about 15 seconds of "unsuccessful" searching, several other fielders (including the wicketkeeper or bowler) go over to help, appearing to be annoyed. The initial searcher slips the ball to the bowler/wicketkeeper, who after another 10-15 seconds of "fruitless" searching return disdainfully to their positions near the wicket with the ball hidden in a pocket or behind their back. The player appears to be impatiently awaiting the discovery of the ball, until the batter goes for another run. At this time, the player "knocks of the bails" with the ball, thus ending the batsman's innings.</li>
<li><b>Bush Belting</b> - A tactic employed by batsmen. If a thick, spiky, spiderweb infested or otherwise inhospitable bush is located near the pitch, the batter "slogs" the ball into it, thus slowing the fielders.</li>
<li><b>Cheeky run</b> - In the absence of a wicketkeeper or silly point fielders, the batsman can 'blade' the ball by playing a defensive shot and take a cheeky single. This tactic is countered by the fielding team by disallowing single runs altogether, thus forcing the batsman into positive strokeplay to get runs.</li>
<li><b>Guyanese Wicket</b> - If using a wicketkeeper, the wicketkeeper can attempt to tip the wicket over with their foot or hand, giving the impression of the batsmen hitting the wicket.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backyard_cricket.html" title="Edit section: Beach Cricket">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beach Cricket</span></h2>
<p>Play on an actual <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach.html" title="Beach">beach</a> can be achieved either by using the flat strip of hard-packed <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sand.html" title="Sand">sand</a> along the <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean_surface_wave.html" title="Ocean surface wave">surf</a> line as the pitch, or by only "bowling" gentle <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_toss.html" title="Full toss">full tosses</a> to avoid the problem of the ball not bouncing off loose sand. If there are no true stumps available a bin is the first choice, followed by a deck chair. While Eskies (Plastic drinks cooler) are sometimes used they are less popular because they are too bulky, someone is probably sitting on it and the drinks are still inside it. In beach cricket the creases and the boundary are normally drawn in the sand in a line which extends well past the side of the agreed pitch to prevent them becoming obliterated in the first over. The batsmen will frequently redraw the line. Sometimes, play is shifted along the beach to a new pitch as the packed sand of the original pitch is turned up, thus reducing the standard of or even completely disabling bowling.</p>
<p>The tide plays a big part in the standard of the pitch in beach cricket. During low tide, the pitch tends to be on the semi-wet sand, and is deemed superior than cricket played in high tide (when the pitch is on dryer, looser sand). In particularly long matches, the play will shift up and down the beach depending on the tide.</p>
