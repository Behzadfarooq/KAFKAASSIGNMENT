<p>It's like an iPod dock and iPod or something. What is it, anyway? Darryl shouts out: "Oh, yes. Yes, what'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up. You see that? (laughs) This is the greatest night of my life," and holds it up. What is that thing? Is this referenced in a previous episode? --66.233.54.205 11:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe the ipod from christmas? Who got that in the end?</p>
<p>Prop specialist John Sparano explains in his blog that it's a speaker dock for his iPod. I added a Trivia entry since many people seem to be baffled by it. -- Raymondc0 22:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I see it <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=102409815&amp;blogID=213736679" class="external text" title="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=102409815&amp;blogID=213736679" rel="nofollow">here.</a> He says: "It was a speaker that the ipod fits into. I didn't really get the point either, I think it was just to show how unimportant the inventory was to everyone. We spent a lot of time making sure it was dusty, so the writers had something in mind."</dd>

<p>i removed the line which speculated that jan did NOT know of the photo being circulated. there is no indication throughout the episode that she doesn't actually already know about the email by the time she come to the office to speak with michael. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.91.18.100_22d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.91.18.100">24.91.18.100</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.91.18.100.html" title="User talk:24.91.18.100">talk</a>) 21:23, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Okay, this is what I initially thought as well. However - Jan says to Michael, "Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, meet me at your condo," implying via "find an excuse" that she believes nobody else to know. On the other hand, Jan may have indeed discovered it and been so overwhelmingly shocked at Michael's audacious stupidity that it put her into some sort of self-destructive <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugue_state.html" title="Fugue state">fugue state</a>, which was my original thought.

<p>Jan obviously knows because she asks "Why am I here, Michael?" She then explains why she still wants to be with him.</p>
<p>Also where is kelly? She has been missing from the last 4 episodes? What's up with that? --Mylakerye 05:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kelly was in the back left corner of the conference room when Pam discovers Jan in the photo. Her hair is permed, so it's a little harder to recognize her. It's not surprising that she isn't often seen: She works in the back room (therefore is not in the background of the main office scenes) and her character isn't a salesman so she doesn't appear in sales meetings. -- Raymondc0 22:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>why was my trivia about pam mentioning michael playing a "conch shell" (instead of steeldrum) deleted? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.91.18.100_22d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.91.18.100">24.91.18.100</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.91.18.100.html" title="User talk:24.91.18.100">talk</a>) 09:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I didn't delete it but I agree with the decision. It's not a significant plot point, an advancement of character development, or a point of viewer confusion. There are always things that happen in the office that the film crew chooses not to include in the final "documentary". -- Raymondc0 22:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ok, well, someone added it back in anyway. (you can check, it wasn't me). regardless, since when do "trivia" entries have to be "significant"? i mean, you do realize those words are essentially antonyms, right? &#160;;-p <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.91.18.100_22d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.91.18.100">24.91.18.100</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.91.18.100.html" title="User talk:24.91.18.100">talk</a>) 23:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Is it really significant that Jan's psychiatrist is named Dr. Perry? Dr. Cox is not even a psychiatrist, so the connection seems a bit weak to me.</p>
