<p>Hi, I've reverted your addition of a caricature to <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad_09f0.html" title="Mirza Ghulam Ahmad">Mirza Ghulam Ahmad</a>. Using someone's death as a source of amusement is likely to be offensive to a quite a few people. I hope you understand.

<p>In your opinion Mirza Basheerud Deen Mahmood may be an impostor. However redirecting a page with his name to <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impostor.html" title="Impostor">Impostor</a> does not make sense on Wikipedia. I've redirected the page to <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadiyya_Muslim_Community_ab40.html" title="Ahmadiyya Muslim Community">Ahmadiyya Muslim Community</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 05:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The links were inactive or missing therefore I added the general redirect link which is the position of Muslims in general. You can certainly disagree with that. I admitt my mistake about Hakim noor uddin's article. He is an important figure in the Ahmadi community and it was happened in haste. Regading the seemingly offensive picture, I don't see how it could be taken in wrong context. As the article suggests, Mirza sb. is a controversal figure, and the picture was just the depiction of this notion. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and it presents how different view points are held about a person. I wanted to contribute but its unfortunate as how my things can be taken as offensive. I still belive that picture would not compromise the article and its up to you if you want it there or not. I think I remeer similar pictures or other articles. --<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabbarshair_970d.html" title="User:Babbarshair">Babbarshair</a> 07:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have seen ur recent changes in Ahmadi related Artical. I know u may not like the Ahmadies for ur personal belief what so ever, but it does not mean that you start reverting and puting ur personal belief on the articals. There are many related artical where your personal point of view can be put and added. Try to keep ur information related where it required. If information does not include any use full thing in any artical can be reverted back. Pls consider the Artical regarding Personalities are strickt about the personalities. Puting ur point of views does not bring any thing init. Wikipedia has a neutral policy&#160;! for Wikipedia it is not allowed either for example to say that Mirza Ghulam was right or wrong or his death was Accursed or not! these are personal point of views, so pls consider this before you attempt to do anything. regards <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 13:48, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please don't make personal remarks and delete things. If you have something contribute rather destroying work. And for and details see the <a href="../../../m/i/r/Talk%7EMirza_Ghulam_Ahmad_c5dd.html" title="Talk:Mirza Ghulam Ahmad">talk:Mirza Ghulam Ahmad</a> --<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabbarshair_970d.html" title="User:Babbarshair">Babbarshair</a> 14:09, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>which personal remarks did I made here&#160;? if you read the lines above again, u may see what I was saying. You want to put some information for readers, fine, put it where it relats and not where it does not make any sence, there are alot of other related artical for you to edit. 2nd I think you are new on wikipedia, and you have a hot brain about some of the beliefs of Ahmadies, I do not also accept some of there belief, but it does not give me any right to force my point of views and mis guide the readers, remember we are here to present a neutral point of view to the world, people who are reading these artical trust Wikipedia for all purposes and for references, that is why it is very important to be neutral. I hope you understand my point, if not I m happy to assist you. regards.. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 16:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In you comments you made speculations about my beleifs which I take as offensive. We are not here to make speculations about people rather contributing with references. Thanks and I hope you respect people's work. --<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabbarshair_970d.html" title="User:Babbarshair">Babbarshair</a> 16:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Great that u understand that! however please also consider that references you are puting in artical are obviously Biased Anti Ahmadiyya website references which are also offensive to some of our readers. If you consider that you should not be offended by remarks, please be just and do not offend other readers. There are other Artical, just go and search them and they are more realible and suitable for such things. But about Biographical Artical it is not suitable to disgrase any person, it will open a pandora box for other users to put offensive material on Muslim related artical. regards</li>
</ul>
<p>It is true that I can not read urdu but this is not the point which i want to make. My point if simple, on wikipedia we are not usually encourage to put our own point of views. For example the reference you put are biased on one openion and in one direction that is Anti Ahmadiyya websites. How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community.

<dd>Its not 'for Ahmadi's only' article and nor they have exclusive rights on this. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was famous figure in history and people can present facts about him in the light of varying sources. All references are from his own writings. Please get yourself familiar with wikipedia before deleting sections from an article. I wish you could read Urdu to learn in orgional the message and claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. with Regards, --<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabbarshair_970d.html" title="User:Babbarshair">Babbarshair</a> 12:48, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Babbarshair, I am sorry if you perceive edits as "vandalism". Two issues:</p>
<p>(1) If you are going to make an edit that is likely to be controversial (such as inclusion of the "infamous" cartoon! into <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad_09f0.html" title="Mirza Ghulam Ahmad">Mirza Ghulam Ahmad</a>) in the interest of civility the onus is on you to discuss it <b>before</b> making the edit.</p>
<p>(2) Deletion of what a user considers to be an offensive image after the user has given what (in his opinion of course) are good reasons in not vandalism.</p>
<p>Hope that clears up things. Best regards, <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 13:56, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I am very careful when to use this word, infact I remember when I was a newcomer I was immediately accused of Vandalism and was repeatedly threatend. Anyway we have already discussed it couple of times, so lets move forward. As I can see you are a long contributor to Ahmadi related sites and I respect that, but I expected you to be neutral on this issue as you have stated on your user page, but on the contrary you have taken an ultra neo-Ahmadi stand. We are discussing the matter in a civilised way so why we have to delete things every time? It will simply waste our time and bring bad taste. Anyway, I deeply respect you and hope that we don't have any hard feelings. --<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabbarshair_970d.html" title="User:Babbarshair">Babbarshair</a> 14:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For your information there is a Artical namely "views on Ahmadiyyat" already exists, which is more suiatable to present ur information. Check it out <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 14:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Go ahead and present info there. Seems like a good article. I am currently busy on Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's article and given the time I would work on it too.

<dd>Hi Babbarshair, yes you remember correctly, all you earlier edits were redirections to <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imposter.html" title="Imposter">Imposter</a>. Given your educational background, the sophistication of your editorial skill as well as knowledge of wikipedia policy, and also given these edits, good faith was hard to assume. Your recent edits are much more constructive. Thank you. I disagree with your inclusion of the cartoon and yes I agree the this issue should be thrashed out on the talk page until a consensus in reached. In this regard please delete the offending image until the discussion is complete. Thanks. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 16:42, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your comments regarding my editorial skills.

<li>Thanx for your message. I have no hard feeling about anything, I am just trying in my openion keep the artical neutral, it is not personal vandeta also for me. as you may know, I live here in Germany, and I have many muslim friends, most of them are Turks and I respect them, if I am chris then it does not give me any right to critise any one, no matter which faith he or she belongs so you may be right, you know about ur faith better then me, I have studied Islam as well and for me if some one claim that he is muslim, I consider him Muslim, for me it is not important that he is Shiat or Sunnit or Ahmadi etc. In my view everybody has a right to be what he or she want it to be and that is it. I m willing to see any proposal from you as well where you suggest that how we mentain a neutral point of view and which information should present HOW&#160;?
