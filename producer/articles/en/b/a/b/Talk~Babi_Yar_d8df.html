Any source for the 700 psychiatric patients? Beware of einsatzgruppen reports. I remember one that was signed by an officer who had been dead for about 6 months - I would guess that particular report was a forgery.</p>
<p>My understanding was that the Ukranians were a constant source of problems for the USSR. I have heard that many fought for the Germans during WW2 and for the White army before WW2 ( they have never been on friendly terms even today). Is there some overlap between Babi-Yar and these other conflicts - confusion as to counts etc over time.</p>

<p>The entire Babi Yar story I thought had been consigned to the dust bin of history. Wat-time aerial photos - and post-war photos - and on-site surveys - and ground radar - etc came up with zilch. Isn't there any myth that can be abandoned - folks stick with a few good ones, not ones you have already lost.

"anything but fact" - Can we assume that the US aerial photos were found to be forgeries?</p>
<p><br />
From the above, a person might conclude that you would rather publish propaganda than "facts". Dispute "facts" - ie aerial photos, etc - if you want to but ranting about "personal attacks"etc makes you look like a personal who engages in "personal attacks"etc.</p>

<p>--Sean 06:52, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Revisionism has its own article in Wikipedia. So does Holocaust Denier. Kindly keep comments about "reasonable doubt," "alleged incident" and "myths" confined to those pages. Einsatzgruppe Operational Situation Report 101 claims 33,771 Jews killed September 29 and 30. I'll take the words of the group responsible, thank you very much.</p>
<p><br />
Are you advocating paralell truths. Is this a code word or a supercode word. Who writes the denier article - it appears not to be deniers?</p>
<p><br />
Sorry to contradict you but the Holocaust Denial article has been totally taken over by proholocaust writers, if you didn't know.159.105.80.141 19:44, 27 March 2007 (UTC) It's almost funny to read the discussion page, had forgotten it for some time.

<p>This section starts with the sweeping statement: 'The Soviet Union was anti-semitic'. Could someone outline (and source) what form this took and what the justification for not creating a memorial was? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 00:14, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Current version (29 Sept 2006, 7:35 AM Eastern Time) has "hilarious" in first paragraph that is probably vandalism or remnant of past vandalism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the motivation for not wanting to place any memorial whatever at the site, I am unsure. However, with regard to the refusal of Soviet authorities to recognize that the Jewish population was specifically targetted, it comes down to the authorities not wanting the surviving Jews -- and other minorities that were victimized -- "stealing" the spot-light from the Soviet state, as it were. Recognizing the Jews, or the poles, or the gays, or whoever as being the targets of the Nazis instead of the Soviet people as a whole would have undermined the attempts by the authorities to frame the mass murder that accompanied the War as noble "Soviet sacrifice". If specific minorities were seen to be the ones who had paid the heaviest price for the War, the Soviet government would not very well be able to claim that they had sacrificed out of loyalty to communism. It's entirely about propaganda potential. (You'll find this in any serious historical-political treatment of post-war USSR.) --<font face="Papyrus"><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a><big>|</big><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a></font> 21:31, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess I can see the rationale of the Soviet authorities behind refusal for a separate monument to Jews. The official policy of the Soviet state was "internationalism", that means that every nationality should be treated equally. In that light erecting a monument to only 1/3 of the victims (Jews) would pose a lot of unanswered questions as it does in present day Ukraine. Yes, the Jews were targeted specifically, but so were the Romas. A monument to them is not warranted because of the low numbers? Than if that rationale is applied universally a monument to 37,000 out of 100,000 overall killed is in need of explanation as well. I guess the Soviet government was afraid of what has happened now: almost total monopoly on sufferenig of one ethnic group over all the others. In any site about Babi Yar on the internet you would be hard-pressed to find any mentioning at all about non-Jews (75% of the victims killed). It simply comes down to a question of fairness. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 15:42, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Soviet Union was anti-Semitic? You have got to be kidding. A very large number of the Communist leaders were Jewish I believe. In later years other ethnic groups became more equally represented. but I don't think anti-Semetic could ever be applied to Communist Russia - currently that is not so but then Russia is now capitalist, with a small favoring of mobster thrown in.</p>

<p>The article includes the name of one victim. I'm thinking that that is sort of PoVish, and should be removed. (the text mentions Jews, of course, Roma, Soviet prisoners, and mental patients. Should it mention Ukrainians or Ukrainian activists as well?) <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 03:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, what is the deal with <i>Ukrainian activists</i>? What is meant by that? Is someone afraid to mention that those activists were actually members of OUN (<a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_of_Ukrainian_Nationalists_1960.html" title="Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists">Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists</a>). By the way the link in 'activist' leads to a page about OUN. So what is the deal with hiding the real name of victims behind that vague "activists"? How about NPOV and naming things as they are?</li>
<li>Second of all, among the victims was a famous Ukrainian poet <a href="../../../o/l/e/Olena_Teliha_b062.html" title="Olena Teliha">Olena Teliha</a>. There are plans in Ukraine to erect a monument to her as well.<a href="http://www.pk.kiev.ua/city/2006/06/16/191223.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pk.kiev.ua/city/2006/06/16/191223.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I think it should be mentioned as well, as it corresponds to the truth and is in full compliance with the guidelines. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 04:46, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The sentence I rewrote originally said: "Among the other victims was <a href="../../../o/l/e/Olena_Teliha_b062.html" title="Olena Teliha">Olena Teliha</a>, a promising poet and <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_of_Ukrainian_Nationalists_1960.html" title="Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists">Ukrainian activist</a>." The link was to the OUN, but it was piped to "Ukrainian activist." I didn't change that.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>As it is supposed to be about neutral point of view and be true to facts, mentioning of Ukrainian nationalists who died there by name is warranted. They <b>did</b> die there, so it belongs in the article and should have a link. There should not be any secrets.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The little bio I found for her on line I can't read (it's in Ukrainian) but the best I can make out makes it sound like she was more significant as a Ukrainian Nationalist than as a poet.<a href="http://www.brama.com/news/press/2006/07/060720embassy_olena-teliha.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brama.com/news/press/2006/07/060720embassy_olena-teliha.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>What kind of poet she was is beyond the scope of discussion. The fact remains that she was executed there and for some people (notably the President of Ukraine) it warranted considerations to erect a monument to her. Irrespective of what people might think of her, her death and attempts to commemorate her are a fact, and as such are <b>definitely</b> worth mentioning.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In the end I think that her name is being used as a counterbalance to 33 thousand Jews killed in 2 days. It is quite POV, but the initiative is not from any of our editors. To go along with it, though, would be to make this article <b>not</b> be primarily about the massacre. That would be wrong. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 05:16, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Again, it is about NPOV. If it is a fact (which it is) it should not be excluded because some people are afraid that mentioning one name (!) or a few for that matter, are going to counterbalance 33 thousand Jews killed. There were other people who died there. If you want to write an aricle <i>exclusively</i> about Jews who died there you may write another article and <i>title it accordingly</i>. As of right now, this article is about ALL VICTIMS of Babi Yar. This is not about likes or dislikes it is about <b>OBJECTIVITY</b>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Contradicting myself: I kept her name, but made it less prominent. It <b>is</b> well-sourced. Is there an update on the memorial? <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 05:28, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I still don't understand why it should be less prominent? What are you afraid of? Is this article about Jews only or about the tragedy of Babi Yar? I am going to research on her and write a separate section. There is no and never will be a monopoly on human suffering, including in Babi Yar. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 05:57, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What makes Babi Yar notable is the magnitude of the killing on September 29 and 30, 1941. Is this the largest machine gun killing of civilians in European history? The article is primarily about the massacre, as it should be. Most readers coming here are coming to read about the massacre. I've moved the other killings to the next section. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 06:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it is about massacre and it should be true to facts without preferences one or the other way. Is mentioning victims other than Jews makes it less significant? This approach is racist, as <b>all</b> victims of that tragedy deserve mentioning, not only some that suit you. No one who died there should be made less prominent!

<dd>The massacre that people come to this page to read occurred on two days in 1941. Yes, there were other killings there, and the article mentions that. No one has tried to hide that. But the historical significance comes from the large massacre, and yes, that massacre deserves the center section of the article. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 06:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The use of terms such as Soviet citizens is also somewhat misleading. During the massacre the people were not Soviet citizens. Also among the dead were people who arrived in Kyiv from other countries who were not Soviet citizens before the war. They include Olena Teliha and her husband Mykhailo who lived in Prague and then Poland in the mid war years. Residents of Kyiv would be possibly more accurate. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBandurist_6fc0.html" title="User:Bandurist">Bandurist</a> 13:11, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do agree the article needs improvement. In my view in its present form it is one sided and does not correspond to NPOV. While this tragedy is undoubtedly is one of the worst in Jewish history it should not exclude other nationalities and should not present unjustified and unsubstantiated accusations. In my opinion there is an obvious attempt to smear Ukrainians as a whole along with the perpetrators of this tragedy. What I have in mind is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>mentioning "Ukrainian perpetrators of the Holocaust and similar genocide operations by Bogdan Khmelnitsky" is completely out of context. If other genocide operations should be mentioned than the role of Jews in NKVD and atrocities of Trotsky and Kaganovich should not be excluded either. This article is not about smearing Jews or Ukrainians, it is about the tragedy of Babi Yar. While I do not object to mentioning about Ukrainian collaborators as such - for which citation is needed - I strongly believe names of Khmelnitsky and Petlura do not belong here.</li>
<li>In my view separating Jewish and "other" victims is racist, it has no place not only here but anywhere in Wiki. If the article is to be structured by periods of executions than again ALL victims should be mentioned without exclusion with equal prominence.</li>
<li>As well if there is going to be mentioning about debate in Ukraine about collaborators and that "these events, now documented and proven", than documents and proofs have to be presented otherwise it is violation of NPOV policy and should have been taken out long ago. <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 07:22, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm still looking this article. I think that most of your concerns have been addressed. There is one of mine that is still open: Babi Yar was used by the Nazi's as an execution site. They killed many people there, including Jews, but the majority were not Jews. This is what the article says, and it is true.</dd>
<dd>But Babi Yar is also the name by which people refer to the massacre of September 1941. The body of the article reflects this; the lead does not. Perhaps a one sentence <b>addition</b> to the lead? Let's not take away from what is already there - it accurately reflects what happened. But let's find a way to put both meanings up top. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 04:49, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought this sentence in the lead "The massacres at Babi Yar were among the worst of the Holocaust" accurately reflects what happened. Is that not enough? Tragedy of Babi Yar <b>is not</b> exclusively an event of two days, it continued for two years and the article should accurately reflect so. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 06:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Babi Yar" as a name is both: the place where 100,000 were killed, and, as part of it, the place where 37k were killed in 2 days. I'll come up with a reword or an extra sentence, and I will put it here. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 10:10, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I remember once reading in the Soviet press of the 1980's about an individual Anatoliy Kabayda who lived under his mother's surname in Australia who was involved with the massacre.

<p>I think putting kikes or zhids in the article is over the top. Besides, the question which word is derogatory is very subjective. As far as the word "жид" goes it depends on where it is uttered. It is a literary norm for "Jew" in Poland, Lithuania and a few other countries. In Ukraine in different regions the use of it was different too. Shevchenko always used it, the old version of the Bible almost exclusively uses this word too, because there were no other in the Ukrainian language. Some people didn't think it derogatory as for example did volunteers of the Ukrainian Galician Army who formed the Жидівський курінь(Zhydivs’kyy Kurin’ UHA) in the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Galician_Army_905c.html" title="Ukrainian Galician Army">Ukrainian Galician Army</a>. Now it is derogatory because it is derogatory in Russian, but it was not always the case in Ukraine as it is also not derogatory in Poland. Was it meant to afflict additional pain to the victims? It is hard to say now, but being so particular about that word I think is petty. Is it adding insult to injury? I think the injury was big enough to go into pieces over linguistic peculiarities.--<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 04:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hillock65, your examples are from another century and/or region. In Kiev of 1940s "жид" was definitely an offensive ethnic slur. An alternative (Yevrei) was widely used. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 21:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In Ukrainian the word does not have the same connotation as in Russian. In the Dictionary of Ukrainian Language published by Naukova Dumka/Scinetific thought, Kyiv 1971 Vol 2 p.528 it states ЖИДИ (одн Жид, а ч. Жидівка , и ж, Те саме що Євреї. А жид старий ніби теж знає, Доньку свою одиноку в хаті замикає. (Шевч., ІІ 1953, 158 - Zhydy (sing. Zhyd mas. Zhydivka fem.) The same as Yevreyi. The old Zhyd knows, his daughter by herself in the home he locks up - Shevchenko vol II, 1953 p 158) The ethnonym "Yevrei" was intoduced into Ukrainian usage only after the 1933 spelling reform. The spelling reform was considered by many as a step towards the russification of Ukrainian and it was opposed by many. With the German occupation the Soviet spelling reform was cancelled and language style reverted to the 1928 spelling rules which did not have the ethnionym "Yevrei". It would be interesting to study the use of this ethnonym "Zhyd" in the context of other spellings used in the passgaes quoted - whether they use the post 1933 guidelines (i.e. russified) or pre. It should be noted that the ethnonym "Zhyd" continued to be used in Western Ukraine (then under Poland where the same word existed in Polish). The ethnonym also continued to be used after the war and in the diaspora who did not acknowledge the spelling reforms of 1933. The 1998 dictionary states that it is a derogatory term, but during the the German occupation there can be doubts. I feel that translating it as a derogatory term is using a current interpretation to a word which was in normal usage at the time. It is however right on the border. Interesting article to review about this is <a href="http://http://exlibris.org.ua/nakonechny/r24.html" class="external text" title="http://http://exlibris.org.ua/nakonechny/r24.html" rel="nofollow">ЖИДИ ЧИ ЄВРЕЇ?</a> or the publication in Israel of <a href="http://www.lsl.lviv.ua/e-library/lsl-editions/Nakonechnyj_J_Ukradene_Imja_2001/XXIV_Zhydy_chy_jevreji.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lsl.lviv.ua/e-library/lsl-editions/Nakonechnyj_J_Ukradene_Imja_2001/XXIV_Zhydy_chy_jevreji.html" rel="nofollow">link title</a> --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBandurist_6fc0.html" title="User:Bandurist">Bandurist</a> 06:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is another translation into English of the same passage - (www.deathcamps.org/occupation/babi%20yar.html Babi Yar). The Ukrainian_English Dictionary compiled by C H. Andrusyshen and J. Krett Published by the University of Saskatoon and the University of Toronto Press Original printing 1955 have for the word Zhyd - m Jew, Hebrew with a list of 32 words that use this ethnonym as its root. No mention of the word kike in any of the translations. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBandurist_6fc0.html" title="User:Bandurist">Bandurist</a> 05:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a difference between the usage of the word in Poland (where Zhyd = Jew) and in Russia/Ukraine (where Zhyd is offensive slur). One of your own sources mentions a letter written as early as 1860s pleading to stop using this word. While some regions of Western Ukraine belonged to Poland before 1939, Kiev was not one of them. The fact that our dialog takes place in this particular article is telling. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 22:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
