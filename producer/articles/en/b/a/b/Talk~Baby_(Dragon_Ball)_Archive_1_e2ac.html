<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bebi/Baby</span></h2>
<p>Why is this topic called "Bebi (Dragon Ball GT)"? Would "Baby (Dragon Ball)" not suffice instead? After all, Bebi is just Japanese phonetics for "baby". That would be like making topics on Piccolo and Trunks, and calling them "Pikkoro" and "Torankusu".... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_S_f5c0.html" title="User:The S">The S</a> 03:57, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article name should probably be "Baby (Dragon Ball)" because the official English name of the character is "Baby". However, I think that name was used once and so we can't rename it without an admin. If you want to add it to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>, I'd second it. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 04:12, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The US Dragon Ball GT DVDs' Japanese subtitles clearly show the name written as Baby, rather than Bebi as most fans adopted since VHS fansubs. Tsukento 00:21, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am going to change it because it doesn't make any sense. Bebi is the japanese spelling and this is the english section of wikipedia, and since they spell it Baby in the show, it should and will be changed. Super 4 Vegeta 20:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bebi Powers</span></h2>
<p>When has Babi ever used Kuririn's Kienzan I haved a Dragonball GT box set and I never seen Baby used Kuririn's Kienzan nor Tenshinhan's Taiyoken. The moves that I only seen him copy was the Big Bang Attack and the Final Flash.</p>
<p>Answer: Bebi forms one during his fight with Uubu, but does not call out the name. Also, the article does not state that he copied the Taiyoken, only that the light he emits from his eyes is similar.</p>

<p>I would appreciate it if others could assist in reverting the vandalism by that anonymous user. Kibitoshin is the Japanese name for the Fusion of Kaioshin and Kibito. Kibitokai is the English dub name for that same Fusion. I don't know why the anonymous user fails to understand something so simple, despite my attempts to explain it to them. Regardless, I am sure that the rest of you can comprehend this, and also know that my inclusion of the character's name isn't an attempt to make this article about anyone besides Bebi. After all, Goku's name is included in the article, is it not? Why does this anonymous user not object to this, and claim that the article is about Bebi and not Goku?</p>

<p>Excuse me, but your wrong too. The name "Kabitokai" are separated in the Funimation dub into Kabito Kai in both the Budokai(videogame) and Dragonball Z,GTs series. Also the notes about Goku is pertaining to the importance of those attacks, seeing as how these attacks are all used on Goku. You seem to have problem to noted to Tenshinhan.</p>
<p>Gundirk 12:49, 7 March</p>
<hr />
<p>I am having difficulty understanding what you just said. If "Kibitokai" is seperated into "Kibito Kai" in the dubs, then fine. I don't care. The issue was not about Kibitokai/Kibito Kai. The issue is about the argument over whether the name Kibitoshin exists, why Kaioshin keeps on being reverted to an incorrect spelling, and whether Kibitoshin should be included in this article. If everyone thinks that all reference to Kibitoshin/Kibito Kai/Kaioshin should be removed from the attack names, then feel free. Just don't mispell the names if you DO include them, and do NOT claim that something doesn't exist when it DOES.</p>
<p>What was that last comment about? I never said anything about Tienshinhan. Also, I KNOW why Goku's name was included. Kibitoshin/Kaioshin was included for the same reason. That is why I do not see what problem there could possibly be in mentioning that character.</p>
<p>Saying I am "wrong" when nothing in my statements, or your own, would indicate I am wrong about anything, doesn't make sense.</p>

<dd>I'll hold off until I see the episode again, but I'm certain ti was x10. It appears as such in both Curtis Hoffman's translations, as well as the SUper 5 fansubs, but I'd have to hear him say it again (I haven't seen the show in years).</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">bebi soul</span></h2>
<p>it says Bebi is the only villan not seen when the gateway to Hell was opened. It is possible that since he was an artificial life form he had no soul to be sent to the Afterlife. but cell was there and hes a artificial life form too.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cell is a Bio-Android, made of human, Namekian and Saiyan cells.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right. Cell was a living being. Bebi was some kind of organic metal, and wasn't actually born or even grown (like Cell) but was simply BUILT. Android 16 didn't appear in Heaven when he was destroyed because he was just a machine. He may have had a personality, but that doesn't seem to equate to a soul. It's complicated, and it may be best not to discuss the issue of souls, since it's a touchy subject with some people. It MAY be best to remove that part of the article entirely, unless others feel it is okay enough to remain without causing further confusion.&#160;::<a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaishokaioshin_d77d.html" title="User:Daishokaioshin">Daishokaioshin</a> 21:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Best to get rid of it. Toei included Android 19 (a machine model like 16) in Hell for no reason but a sight gag. Gero is still a cyborg, as is Dr. Myuu (though it's been so long since I've seen GT he might have been a full robot too). No one is supposed to be just strutting around in Dragon Ball's Hell anyway, it's a massive plot hole created by animation filler. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 22:15, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never really understood what happens to dragonball villains when they go to hell. Whenever you see dead souls at King Yemma's castle they always look like white blob things. However, when they're show in hell it seems as though they have bodies. I thought that in order to keep your body you had to be given special permision by one of the Kais. In fact, that was a major plot point in the namek saga, seeing as how Krillin, Tien, and Yamcha had to be transported to the check in station on earth because their physical bodies had been transported to King Kai's planet. I was especially confused by the other world tournament saga. From early on it was said that only a select few get to keep their bodies after death. However, only a few episodes into it, Cell and other villains are shown to be able to beat up some of the demon guys and Goku had to fight them in order to quiet them down. I realise it was only filler, but can the writers have been that stupid as to contradict themselves in the first few episodes. Is their something I'm missing or am I trying to read too deeply into something that was never really meant to be analyzed? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 141.157.17.245 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.157.17.245_71e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.157.17.245">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>The reason I put that it's debatable is because no official source has stated whether it's canon or not, so it's something that fans of the show continue to debate. I am not putting in the article that he's canon, just that it's debatble. I have editors who agree with me and Koji has one(maybe more) that agree with him. Most websites consider GT canon but no official source has said if it is or not. For now I won't revert, but I did put up citation tags on the parts of it being non-canon so you have a opportunity to proove it.

<p>The definition of Canon states that it needs to be <b>considered authentic</b> or created by a <b>particular author</b>. In this case, the particular author would be Toriyama. Also, authentic means genuine, which GT is not because it isn't based on the manga. Therefore, it would be non-canon. But, if you still don't want to listen to the facts, that's okay.

<dd>Err... That's a flawed argument if I ever saw one. Just because sources that an individual considers credible do NOT state something doesn't meant that an individual's particular beliefs are valid. That is a logical fallacy. If you cannot provide evidence that Dragon Ball GT IS canon, then you don't have a leg to stand on. Dragon Ball GT is considered non-canon by most people due to its many contradictions of facts, characters, and so on that have been established in Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It considered non-canon by most people because it is not based on any of the canon manga that Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z is based off of. It is considered non-canon by most people because it is poorly written, has bad characterization, and focuses almost entirely on a single character (Son Goku), giving little or no attention to any of the other characters. While the latter reason I provided may be debatable, the first two are NOT. They are facts. Dragon Ball GT is considered non-canon. Whether it is specifically stated that this is so by 'most websites' that 'consider it to be canon' is utterly irrelevant, because 'most websites' are not credible sources of information on this subject, nor are they authorities which can decide such matters.</dd>

<dd>The fact that Dragon Ball GT is non-canon doesn't need to be stated in the article, but arguing against it being such is a waste of everybody's time, especially when you break 3RR as badly as you and Kojidude have. Kojidude, I'm a bit disappointed in you. You should have just let TJ get banned temporarily. It might have granted him some time to think about what he was doing wrong. Entering into an edit war with him doesn't solve anything, and while I'm glad you've decided to drop the issue, you should have done it far sooner. Let others dig their own graves. You don't need to dig your own as well.</dd>

No. And we use <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeza.html" title="Freeza">Freeza</a> instead of the licensed English anime's name Frieza, <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coola.html" title="Coola">Coola</a> instead of Cooler, <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rou_Dai_Kaioshin_9154.html" title="Rou Dai Kaioshin">Rou Dai Kaioshin</a> instead of Elder Kai, etc. I had always thought that we were naming the DB articles by the names given in the English manga and even if I'm right, there is no manga to name Bebi after.

<dd>Agreed. We need to come up with some sort of system for naming DB articles instead of randomly selectng names as Nemu (or do you want me to call you TTN?) mentioned above. We could use the manga names, but not all characters are in the manga. We could use the English anime names, but there's more than one English dub. We can't just use the American names because the English Wikipedia is shared by <i>all</i> English-speaking people.

<li><b>Oppose</b> The "official" English/Romanji name for Bebi is Bebi. I just checked on a number of English to Japanese translators, and "baby" is not and never has been how the word is spelled in Romanji. The accepted Romanji translations of "baby" include the following: "osanago, akachan, chinomigo, youji, akanbou, bebi." I don't see "baby" anywhere in the list, do you? If you can find somewhere where the translation of "baby" in Japanese (Bebi) equals "baby" in English, then please provide us with the information/address/etc. Otherwise, this is just the same old "I like this name over here so I'm going to make a fuss until people agree to it" schtick that has been thrown around so many times. Bebi is the name of the article, and I vote for it to remain such, based on the fact that Bebi is a Japanese word, and the original name, and "Baby" is not, merchandise be damned. -- <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaishokaioshin_d77d.html" title="User:Daishokaioshin">Daishokaioshin</a> 00:58, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heh, true. Toriyama (if he even remembers the Tsufrujin) would have probably used a better pun than 'baby'. I agree, it's lame - but it's all we've got. 'Baby' is a correct romanization, it's use on official merchandise, both English and Japanese. Whether or not it's popular is not a concern to me, but a Google test does seem to weigh in on 'Baby's favour.

<li>Guidelines say we should use the standard romanization of the name unless another "acceptable" romanization is far more popular.

<li>Technically, you are correct and the Japan-related naming conventions don't seem to list fictional characters, point me to it if I'm wrong. I felt that the reasoning behind this guideline would be the same for fictional characters, even if it isn't specifically spelled out. I believe it's to keep a consistant manner for the average English speaker who isn't necessarily familiar with Japanese language and transliteration. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 01:04, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see why a different romanization would confuse those unfamiliar with Japanese. If anything, I think that romanizations like 'Baby' would confuse them more ("is he a baby? Is it a term of endearment?") than a 'strange looking foreign name'. That said, I think the name should reflect the most accurate romanization possible. If ベビー was transliterated from 'baby', then the romanization should be 'Baby' as well - just as is the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a> says. Further, if the name is changed (like <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegeta.html" title="Vegeta">Vegeta</a>'s ベジータ with a long <i>ji</i> instead of a short one, as in <i>bejitaburu</i>) then the romanization should reflect that as well. Perhaps the best option is to name the article 'Baby' and input a section detailing the name more deeply (in fact, this sounds like a good idea for all Dragon Ball characters). -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 01:41, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Huh? That doesn't make any sense at all. Viz is pretty bad with keeping original names. 'Vegerot', 'Djinn' Boo, 'Hercule'. And such an 'if' doesn't matter - there isn't a manga. 'Bebi' is a direct romanization of the kana, but that kana could just as easily come from 'baby' - indeed 'baby' is a correct romanization of ベビー, just as 'bebi' is. The difference is 'baby' is used on official merchandise (Japanese and English), and is an official romanization of the name (in at least one English dub). That information is enough to warrant the name changed based on the MOS-JA for Japanese articles and the <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EAnime_a66c.html" title="WP:Anime">WP:Anime</a> Wiki Project. But that's not my main goal here. I don't want to just enforce rules. I want to figure out what the proper name is.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Argument</span></h3>
<p>Baby is not just the name present in all of the English dubs of the anime. It's the name present in every piece of DBGT merchandise released in Japan. Two evidence for this argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Dragon Ball GT trading from the "VS Combo Collection" by Morinaga.<a href="http://page4.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/d64881746" class="external autonumber" title="http://page4.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/d64881746" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>
<ul>
<li>Baby is clearly written on the card. Other cards from this collection features "Super Baby" and "Vegeta Baby".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The other piece of merchandise that uses the Baby spelling are the "Super Battle Collection" figures distributed by Bandai.<a href="http://www.action-hq.com/store/images/items/dai021418_b.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.action-hq.com/store/images/items/dai021418_b.jpg" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>
<ul>
<li>Clearly it's "Baby" and not "Bebi" on the packaging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can understand if Baby was only used in the English dub of the anime (like Frieza), but clearly this is not the case. Baby is the official spelling used in Japan and outside. If there was any case where the spelling Bebi was used in a Japanese product, I would like to see it. This isn't a popularity contest. It's about determining the correct way to spell the character's name. Jonny2x4 01:24, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>How about instead of producing the same irrelevant and completely meaningless "evidence" over and over, you accept that merchandise is not going to be used to determine this issue. What I recommend you do, is go watch the Japanese episodes of GT, find an episode with Bebi's name in the episode's title, and translate out what the Kanji say. If the SHOW ITSELF SAYS THE CHARACTER'S NAME IS "BABY" then and ONLY then should we use it as the name. Otherwise, it has been a few days now, and the votes are overwhelmingly opposed to the move. There is a concensus, and that's for the article to remain where it is. As far as I can tell, this is over.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and don't just use subtitles saying it's "Baby" as your evidence either, incase you were thinking about that. The subtitles provide literal translations, not necessarily the spelling of original names.</dd>

<dd>This shows a bit of ignorance in the Japanese language from "Daikaiohshin's" part. First of all, Bebi's name is written in katakana in Japanese, not kanji. Secondly, deciphering the episodes' titles into romaji does nothing. Translating a foreign word written in katakana in Japanese back to romaji does nothing, since we are merely providing phonetic pronounciation, not the actual spelling. Citing the Cell example from above, just because his name when romanized from katakana is Seru, doesn't mean Seru is the correct English spelling.<br />
I've already provided evidence that the official English spelling in Japanese and English products is Baby and no one has provided a counter-evidence. Again, this isn't an argument for the most popular spelling, but rather the correct spelling.<br />
Besides merchadises, the name is spelled ベビー in kana, with a long vowel at the end. This is how the English word "baby" is written in Japanese katakana.<a href="http://linear.mv.com/cgi-bin/j-e/jis/nihongo-de/dosearch?sDict=on&amp;H=PS&amp;L=J&amp;T=%1B%24B%25Y%25S%21%3C%1B%28B&amp;NOFUZZY=on&amp;wc=none" class="external autonumber" title="http://linear.mv.com/cgi-bin/j-e/jis/nihongo-de/dosearch?sDict=on&amp;H=PS&amp;L=J&amp;T=%1B%24B%25Y%25S%21%3C%1B%28B&amp;NOFUZZY=on&amp;wc=none" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>Jonny2x4</dd>

<dd>Isn't Romanized katakana what's known as Engrish? There was a similar discussion at Naruto about the English "Might Guy" versus the Engrish "Maito Gai". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 05:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There's a really simple answer to this. Which name is used more often in English languege dubs? Figure that out and you have your name. Try to spend a little less time arguing and more time studying.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 03:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only official English dub I'm aware of is the Funimation one, which uses Baby. If there is another one, please show us. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 03:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there's only <i>one</i> english dub, and it uses Baby, the article's name should be Baby. That one was kind of obvious...--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 03:46, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, actually, there's at least two English dubs (Funimation's Texas cast, and the International Blue Water dub) but that neither here nor there, we should be using romanizations of the original name. The name is just the word "baby" in kana. <b>ベビー</b> is "baby", that's it. There are other DragonBall names that are a bit ambiguous (like <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burdock.html" title="Burdock">Burdock</a>, or <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegeta.html" title="Vegeta">Vegeta</a>), but there's nothing here to debate, really.</p>
<p>Personally, I like "Bebi" more, I've always used "Bebi", and think "Baby" looks weird - but that's the name. *shrug* -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 05:19, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I said before it, I say it again. Wikipedia isn't aimed solely at the hardcore Dragon Ball fans, but at new or casual fans as well. Anyone who sees the DBGT dubs/subs by Funimation is going to see Baby, not Bebi. Likewise, the guy who buys the Bandai toys, is going to see Baby too. I can undertstand the argument if there were different spellings used by official sources, but pretty much every official source I've seen uses the spelling Baby. Bandai has been using the spelling Baby long before the series was dubbed into English. Jonny2x4 18:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
