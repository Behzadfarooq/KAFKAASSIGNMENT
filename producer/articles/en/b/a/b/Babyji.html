<p><i><b>Babyji</b></i> is a novel by <a href="../../../a/b/h/Abha_Dawesar_08b2.html" title="Abha Dawesar">Abha Dawesar</a> first published in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_literature.html" title="2005 in literature">2005</a>. Set in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, it recounts the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coming_of_age.html" title="Coming of age">coming of age</a> and the sexual adventures and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_%28psychology%29.html" title="Fantasy (psychology)">fantasies</a> of a 16-year-old bespectacled schoolgirl, the only child of a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> family. The three simultaneous "<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affair.html" title="Affair">affairs</a>" she has—or imagines having—in the course of the novel are all secret, and all with members of her own gender: two with older women and one with a classmate.</p>
<p>The title of the book points to the old custom of <a href="../../../v/e/n/Veneration.html" title="Veneration">venerating</a> an elder by referring to them with the <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffix.html" title="Suffix">suffix</a> <i><a href="../../../j/i/_/Ji.html" title="Ji">-ji</a></i> added to their name (cf. "<a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhiji.html" title="Gandhiji">Gandhiji</a>"). Ironically, in the novel it is the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_worker.html" title="Domestic worker">family servant</a> who, though she is older than the daughter of the house, out of <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deference.html" title="Deference">deference</a> toward the latter's higher <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> addresses her as "Babyji". ("Was I a baby or a <i><a href="../../../d/i/d/Didi.html" title="Didi">Didi</a></i>? <i>Babyji</i> was such a contradiction in terms, conveying too much <a href="../../../r/e/s/Respect.html" title="Respect">respect</a> that the age of a child doesn't warrant.")</p>
<p><i>Babyji</i> is the winner of the 2005 <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_Literary_Award_f8d7.html" title="Lambda Literary Award">Lambda Literary Award</a> for <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian_literature.html" title="Lesbian literature">Lesbian Fiction</a> and of the 2006 <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonewall_Book_Award_a41d.html" title="Stonewall Book Award">Stonewall Book Award</a> for Fiction.</p>

<p>Sixteen year-old Anamika Sharma, the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-person_narrative.html" title="First-person narrative">first person narrator</a>, is a bright young student aware of her privileged position within Indian society. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefect.html#Academic" title="Prefect">Head Prefect</a> at her school, she aspires to graduate with excellent grades so as to be able to go on to <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html#United_States_of_America" title="College">college</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. At the same time, rather than leave for good, she would like to return to her native country after completing her studies and contribute to modernizing traditional Indian society and see the rigid <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste system</a> broken down.</p>
<p>While thus time and again pondering about the future, Anamika has to get on with her daily life. The novel is set against the backdrop of the protests against the recommendations of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandal_commission.html" title="Mandal commission">Mandal commission</a>, which trigger several acts of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-immolation.html" title="Self-immolation">self-immolation</a>, and for high school students all this means a disruption of the normal school routine. In particular, classes are suspended for weeks on end, and although students are obliged to form self-study groups at their homes Anamika finds more time than usual to pursue her private interests.</p>
<p>She spends much of her time with Tripta Adhikari, a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freethought.html" title="Freethought">free-thinking</a> <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> lady about twice her age whom she calls "India". India is a wealthy academic who lives in Anamika's neighbourhood, and occasionally Anamika sneaks out of the house when her parents have already gone to bed to spend the night with her new-found friend. Mr and Mrs Sharma know about Tripta Adhikari but naturally assume that the latter has a maternal relationship with their daughter, while India herself knows very well that what she is doing amounts to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statutory_rape.html" title="Statutory rape">statutory rape</a>. Anamika's parents even let her go on a short holiday to <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kasauli.html" title="Kasauli">Kasauli</a> with India and two of her friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] I noticed that my biting had caused her to start breathing heavily, so I replaced my teeth with my lips. I gathered different parts of her flesh between my lips and kissed her all over, in the opposite order in which I had bitten. In her breathless moans and her cries of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleasure.html" title="Pleasure">pleasure</a> I owned her more than I owned myself and was immersed in her more than I had ever been immersed in my own self. Me, I had not yet discovered. I was an unknown quantity, a constantly unraveling mystery. But India was absolutely and completely known both carnally and otherwise. I rolled off of her with the sweet exhaustion of a man who has just hunted his dinner animal. (Chapter xix)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also in Kasauli, Anamika is horrified to see that she is expected to drink <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a>—which she does—and that one evening the grown-ups with whom she is travelling not only gather together to smoke a <a href="../../../s/p/l/Spliff.html" title="Spliff">joint</a> but also offer her one as well. In the end Anamika politely refuses. ("The love of my parents, my education, every moral lesson I had learned was being challenged.")</p>
<p>Anamika's second "<a href="../../../l/i/a/Liaison.html" title="Liaison">liaison</a>" is with Rani, the family's live-in servant. <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literacy.html" title="Literacy">Illiterate</a>, only able to speak <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, and regularly beaten up by her alcoholic husband, 23 year-old Rani is rescued from a jhuggi by the Sharmas. However, as their apartment does not have a servant's bedroom, Rani is ordered to sleep on the floor of Anamika's room. This, of course, provides the girl with ample opportunity to explore submissive Rani's perfect body, in spite of the servant's occasional tentative protestations that "Babyji", for her own good, should seek the love of a boy her own age. Anamika, however, sticks with her choice, rejects male advances, and, despite the danger of being <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_stigma.html" title="Social stigma">stigmatised</a> as someone who associates with a person from a much lower caste, is even prepared to teach Rani some <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, she makes several passes at Sheela, one of the girls in her class. Although by their male classmates' consent Sheela is much prettier than Anamika, she herself is quite unaware of her budding beauty and the boyfriends she could have if she wanted to. She does question whether her intimacies with another girl are morally okay but does not recognize the seriousness of Anamika's endeavours. When Anamika asks her if she will be her "<a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistress_%28lover%29.html" title="Mistress (lover)">mistress</a>" when they grow up she replies with a non-committal "Maybe". Only when Anamika goes too far and forces herself on Sheela does the latter reject her, at least for the time being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anamika, please stop," she whispered urgently.<br />
If she really didn't want me to she could scream or move away or kick me. "You're beautiful," I said as I slid my hand between her thighs where her <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomers_%28clothing%29.html" title="Bloomers (clothing)">bloomers</a> should have been. She closed her eyes again, but this time I couldn't tell if she was enjoying it or not. I pushed with my finger. I wasn't slow, the way I had been with India and Rani. I was afraid if I was too gentle she would use it to move away. I used all the force I could muster.<br />
She let out a howl. "Stop, it hurts."<br />
I pulled back and said, "I just <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fucked</a> you." There was blood on my finger. (Chapter xviii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Divorced woman, servant woman, underage woman, I was pursuing them all," Anamika says about herself but always makes sure that none of her lovers suspects anything out of the ordinary, that each of them believes she is the only one for her.</p>

<p>In <i>Babyji</i>, Dawesar paints a Delhi of crime, rape, dirt, <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_outage.html" title="Power outage">blackouts</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backwardness.html" title="Backwardness">backwardness</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Residual_colonialism.html" title="Residual colonialism">residual colonialism</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_violence.html" title="Domestic violence">domestic violence</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arranged_marriage.html" title="Arranged marriage">arranged marriages</a>, a city where promising young people see their only option in going to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, thus contributing to the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_drain.html" title="Brain drain">brain drain</a> and setting in motion a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle.html" title="Virtuous circle and vicious circle">vicious circle</a>. Contrasted to this scenario is Animika, a budding intellectual who devours books—among other authors, she has read <a href="../../../f/y/o/Fyodor_Dostoevsky_0fbb.html" title="Fyodor Dostoevsky">Dostoevsky</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Sartre_c20d.html" title="Jean-Paul Sartre">Sartre</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Kundera_3894.html" title="Milan Kundera">Kundera</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Bradbury_a4ab.html" title="Ray Bradbury">Bradbury</a> and reads <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Nabokov_17e2.html" title="Vladimir Nabokov">Nabokov</a>'s <i><a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolita.html" title="Lolita">Lolita</a></i> during her trip to Kasauli—and at school excels at <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">maths</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>. At the same time her <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_relativism.html" title="Moral relativism">moral relativism</a> is of a youthful kind, where every new experience she has is likely to trigger a change in her outlook on the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_condition.html" title="Human condition">human condition</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science had told us <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">this century</a> that nothing was certain. The universe was chaotic and relative; these aspects measurable. There were few hard facts on which one could base a way of living one's life. I'd always scoffed at religion [i.e. <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>] as a crutch for the masses, so it wasn't even a consideration. We'd spent two thousand years only to find out that we didn't know. That moment, sprawled on my bed, changed my whole life. I was free all of a sudden. Free of the burden of knowledge and therefore of any morality that proceeds from knowledge. Only feelings counted. And sensations. (Chapter iii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbianism.html" title="Lesbianism">lesbianism</a> is a <a href="../../../f/o/i/Foil_%28literature%29.html" title="Foil (literature)">foil</a> for traditional Indian thought and values. Convinced that she has been born with a lesbian <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene.html" title="Gene">gene</a>, she resists all advances by men, in particular those by her classmate Vidur's father, who, at their first encounter, asks that she call him Adit rather than <i>Uncleji</i> and wants to meet her again, alone. India teaches her that being <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> is a "Western <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_construction.html" title="Social construction">construct</a>," that <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexuality.html" title="Human sexuality">sexuality</a> is a continuum rather than a <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary.html" title="Binary">binary</a> phenomenon. Anamika's mind, however, seems already set. She prefers "Sheela's smoothness to Vidur's hairiness," sees herself as predator <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolita.html" title="Lolita">Humbert Humbert</a> and all-too-willing victim rolled into one, and as a grown-up wants to have "a big <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harem.html" title="Harem">harem</a> full of women".</p>
<p>She also realizes that <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> in India still has a long way to go in order to catch up with developments in the West. People like Rani have been led to believe that "women are not meant to enjoy," and when Adit talks about his wife he calls her a "power woman" because she works for <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Express_352b.html" title="American Express">American Express</a>. The dark side of growing up female in India is further demonstrated in the episode where Anamika and Sheela, having missed the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_bus.html" title="School bus">school bus</a>, have to take a crowded public bus to get home from school and fall prey to <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frotteurism.html" title="Frotteurism">frotteurs</a>.</p>
