<p>Bābak was born into a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian</a> family in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Azarbaijan_fc5a.html" title="Iranian Azarbaijan">Āzarbāijān</a> (northwestern <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>) close to the city of Artavilla (modern <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardabil.html" title="Ardabil">Ardabil</a>). According to Wāqed, Bābak's father was a Persian from Madā'īn (formerly known as <a href="../../../c/t/e/Ctesiphon.html" title="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a>, former capital of <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sassanid_Empire_b8bc.html" title="Sassanid Empire">Sassanian Persian Empire</a>, 35 km south of modern <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Bağdād</a> in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Irak.html" title="Irak">Irāq</a>) who left for the Āzarbāijān frontier zone and settled in the village of Balālābād in the Maymad district. According to Fasīh, his mother - a native of Āzarbāijān - was known as Māhrū (meaning <i>Moon-Face</i>/<i>Belle</i> in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>)<sup id="_ref-Yusofi_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yusofi" title="">[1]</a></sup>. After his father’s death in his early teens, he was given the responsibility of his 2 brothers and mother during a traditional <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zarathustra.html" title="Zarathustra">Zoroastrian</a> ceremony in a fire-temple. By the age of 18, Bābak had established himself in the city of <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabriz.html" title="Tabriz">Tabrēz</a> and was engaged in the arms trade and industry.</p>
<p>Later on, this engagement gave him the opportunity to travel to different regions like <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasia.html" title="Caucasia">Caucasia</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../../7/5/5/755.html" title="755">755</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Muslim_1876.html" title="Abu Muslim">Abū Muslim of Khorassan</a>, a famous and popular Persian nationalist, was murdered. Although he had helped the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasid.html" title="Abbasid">Abbasids</a> to defeat the former Caliphs, the <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umayyad.html" title="Umayyad">Umayyad</a> dynasty, the ruling Caliph had given the order to kill him, probably because of his increasing popularity among Iranians and Non-Muslims<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Many Iranians, who had expected more freedom and more rights from the new rulers, could not believe that their hero was killed by the ruling Caliph whom they had considered a friend of Iran and Iranians.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>This incident lead to many revolts, mostly by angry <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrians</a>. This, in turn, forced the Caliphs to use more violence against the Iranian population in order to keep the eastern provinces under control. The constant revolts did not come to an end in the following decades, and the Iranian population of the Caliphate was constantly being oppressed.</p>
<p>Bābak joined the "<a href="../../../k/h/u/Khurramiyyah.html" title="Khurramiyyah">Khurramiyyah</a> (Khorram-Dinān)" movement in what later became known as <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babak_Castle_0442.html" title="Babak Castle">Qale-ye Bābak</a>, meaning "Bābak Castle", located in the mountains of Qaradag. The story of joing the Khorrami movement is being told in Waqed's account, in summary, as follows:</p>

When Babak came back and spoke to Jāvidān, he impressed Jāvidān with his shrewdness despite his lack of fluency of speech. Jāvidān therefore asked the woman for permission to take her son away to manage his farms and properties, and offered to send her fifty dirhams a month from Babak's salary.

<p>Under the direction of his Mentor Javidan b. Shahrak, a Persian noble from <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray%2C_Iran_8fbc.html" title="Ray, Iran">Ray</a> (near modern <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>), his knowledge of history, geography, and the latest battle tactics strengthened his position as a favorite candidate for commander during the early wars against the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> occupiers.</p>
<p>Bābak was a highly spiritual person who respected his <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrian.html" title="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a> heritage. He made every possible effort to bring Iranians together and also with leaders such as Maziyar to form a united front against the Arab Caliph.</p>
<p>However, one of the most dramatic periods in the history of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> was set under Bābak’s leadership between 816-837. During these most crucial years, they not only fought against the Caliphate, but also for the preservation of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian language</a> and culture.</p>
<p>After the death of Javidan, he married Javadan's wife, and became the Khorramis' leader, sometime in the year 816-17 in <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Ma%27mun_b6ed.html" title="Al-Ma'mun">al-Ma'mun</a>'s reign. Babak incited his followers to hate the Arabs and rise in rebellion against the caliphal regime. The reports state that Babak called Persians to arms, seized castles and strong points and ordered his warriors to kill people and destroy villages, thereby barring roads to his enemies and spreading fear. Gradually a large multitude joined him.<sup id="_ref-Yusofi_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yusofi" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There had long been groups of Khorramis scattered in Isfahan, Azarbaijan, Ray, Hamadan, Armenia, Gorgan, and elsewhere of Iran, and there had been some earlier Khorrami revolts, e.g., in Gorgan jointly with Red Banner (Sorkh-'alamān) Bātenis in the caliph <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mahdi_9285.html" title="Al-Mahdi">Al-Mahdi</a>'s reign in 778-79, when 'Amr b. 'Ala', the governor of <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabarestan.html" title="Tabarestan">Tabarestān</a>, was ordered to repulse them, and at <a href="../../../i/s/f/Isfahan.html" title="Isfahan">Isfahan</a>, Ray, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamadan.html" title="Hamadan">Hamadan</a>, and elsewhere in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harun_al-Rashid_e296.html" title="Harun al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a>'s realm, when 'Abd-Allah b. Malek and Abu Dolaf 'Ejli put them down on the caliph's behalf - but none had the scale and duration of Babak's revolt, which pinned down caliphal armies for twenty years. After his emergence, the Khorrami movement was cantered in Azarbaijan and reinforced with volunteers from elsewhere, probably including descendants of Abu Moslem's supporters and other Iranian enemies of the 'Abbasid caliphate. The figures given for the strength of Babak's Persian army, such as 100,000 men (Abu'l-Ma'ali), 200,000 (<a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_al-Masudi_d4c3.html" title="Ali al-Masudi">Mas'udi</a>), or innumerable (Bagdadi) are doubtless highly exaggerated but at least indicate that it was large<sup id="_ref-Yusofi_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yusofi" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Jarir_al-Tabari_70f7.html" title="Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari">Tabari</a> records that Babak claimed he possessed Javadan's spirit and that Babak became active in 816-817. In 819-820 Yahya ibn Mu'adh fought against Babak, but could not defeat him. Two years later Babak vanquished the forces of Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Khalid. In 824-825 the caliphal general Ahmad ibn al Junayd was sent against Babak. Babak defeated and captured him.</p>
<p>In 827-828 Muhammad ibn Humayd Tusi was dispatched to fight Babak. He won a victory and sent some captured enemy, but not Babak, to al-Ma'mun. However, about two years later, on June 9, 829, Babak won a decisive victory over this general at Hashtadsar. Muhammad ibn Humayd lost his life. Many of his soldiers were killed. The survivors fled in disarray.</p>
<p>In 835-836 the caliph al-Mu'tasim sent his outstanding general <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshin_%28Persian_General%29_fa38.html" title="Afshin (Persian General)">Afshin</a> against Babak. Afshin rebuilt fortresses. He employed a relay system to protect supply caravans. Babak tried to capture the money being sent to pay Afshin's army, but was himself surprised, lost many men and barely escaped. He did succeed in capturing some supplies and inflicting some hardship on his enemies.</p>
<p>The next year Babak routed the forces of Afshin's subordinate, Bugha al-Kabir. In 837-868 al-Mu'tasim reinforced Afshin and provided him clear military instructions. Patiently following these enabled Afshin to capture Babak's stronghold of Badhdh. Babak escaped. Al-Mu'tasim sent a safety guarantee for Babak to Afshin. This was taken to Babak who was very displeased. He said:</p>
<p>"Better to live for just a single day as a ruler than to live for forty years as an abject slave."</p>
<p>He made his way to the Armenian leader Sunbat. Sunbat, however, betrayed Babak to Afshin. Al-Mu'tasim commanded his general to bring Babak to him. Afshin informed Babak of this and told him since Babak might never return, this was the time to take a last look around. At Babak's request, Afshin allowed his prisoner to go to Badhdh. There Babak walked through his ruined stronghold one night until dawn.</p>
<p>Eventually, Bābak, his wife, and his warriors were forced to leave <i>Ghaleye Bābak</i> after 23 years of constant campaigns. He was eventually betrayed by <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshin.html" title="Afshin">Afshin</a> and was handed over to the Abbasid Caliph. During Bābak’s execution, the Caliph's henchmen first cut off his legs and hands in order to convey the most devastating message to his followers. The legend says that Bābak bravely rinsed his face with the drained blood pouring out of his cuts, thus depriving the Caliph and the rest of the Abbasid army from seeing his pale face, a result of the heavy loss of blood.<sup id="_ref-Yusofi_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yusofi" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babak_Khorramdin_2f82.html" title="Edit section: Ancient historical figure and modern nationalistic debates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ancient historical figure and modern nationalistic debates</span></h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been debate on the ethnic origin of Bābak, even so trying to fit an ancient figure to a certain nationality goes against any objectiveness. Some Turkish nationalists claim that Bābak was an Azeri <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turk</a>. On the other hand, Iranian nationalists and modern scholars retain the established opinion that he was Persian and that at the time of Bābak, the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turks</a> had not yet migrated to <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>.</p>
<p>From the Turkish point of view, it is said that Bābak's name cannot be shown as proof of his alleged Persian roots, because it was not his real name. Names of some of his lieutenants such as Tarkhan, who is claimed as being a Turk, and Azrak who was an Arab, show that the movement was of mixed ethnicity and was a broad regional freedom movement against the Caliphates rule. Existence of Muslims among Bābak's supporters also reinforces this assertion.</p>
<p>According to the Persian point of view, Bābak's (more correctly Pāpag) name is purely from Persian (Iranian) origins. Turkic peoples migrated to Azarbaijan several centuries later. Bābak was a follower of Zoroastrian Persians and Abū Muslim of Khurassan. There is no proof supporting a Turkish background. There was never any mention of Babak being Turkic in any of the literary works of the time. He has always been known as an Iranian and Zoroastrian patriot. Also, the name of the province, <i>Āzarbāyjān</i>, is an Arabicized form of Persian word <i>Āzarpadgān</i>, meaning "Place of Guardians of Holy Fire". The ancient Arab historian Ibn Hazm, in the book "Religion and People", and ancient Armenian historian Vardan, in his "World History", clearly and explicitly mentioned Bābak as being an ethnic Persian. The name of Bābak's father was Mardas and his mother, in some sources, has been called Maru. Both names are Persian and found in the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahnama.html" title="Shahnama">Shahname</a>. The mentor of Bābak was Javidan pur Shahrak, which is another Persian name. Also, Bābak's two most important commanders, Adhin and Rostam, were ethnic Persians.</p>
<p>The name Tarkhan is also mentioned as "Tarhan" (which is an Arabic word) in some sources. In addition, the name also occurs in the <i>Shahnameh</i> and some sources mention that the Sogdian rulers of Samarghand also went by this name, seemingly using it as a military title. <i>Tarxan</i> means "judge" in Ossetian (related to Alannic and Sogdian) and this meaning can be traced to Indic but the Turkic word does not have the same definition, and the appearance of the same word in both languages could be mere coincidence.</p>
<p>One of his comments that confirms his non-Turkic origin is his letter to the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine.html" title="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> emperor <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theophilos_%28emperor%29.html" title="Theophilos (emperor)">Theophilus</a> (r. 829-42) said:</p>

<p>Finally it should be noted that there are no traces of Turkic tribes in Azarbaijan before the Ilkhanid era and all sources at that time mention that Azarbaijani's spoke Azar-Pahlavi (the local dialect of middle Persian), which continues today in the form of Talyshi, Kurdish, Tati and other north western Iranian languages. Due to the invasion of the Oghuz Turks and later Turkic tribes the region became predominantly Turkic speaking. All this was after the time of Bābak. From the Iranian point of view the claim that he was a Turk is recent and propagated mostly by Pan-Turkists.</p>
