<p>I think the baby boomers definately need a criticism section. They are the most hypocritical and self righteous of any generation. When they were young they were all about 'free love' 'experimentation' 'expanding your mind' and 'free speech'. And now that they have had their fill of drugs and sex they wan't young people to 'just say no' to drugs, and abstain from sex, and V-Chips in their kids TV's. Also, the list of celebrities seems appropriatly deviod of any pivotal people.</p>

<p>Hey, this seems too biased. Especially the comment about Bush being a draft dodger. I personally don't like the man, but I wouldn't call him a "draft dodger" either. His daddy got him in the National Guard, which wasn't be deployed to Vietnam during that time. He, therefore, served his country and did not dodge the draft. While it's debateable what he actually did in the national guard, being in the national guard doesn't constitute being a "draft dodger". A draft dodger is someone who burned their draft cards and/or refused to register for the draft to avoid military service for political reasons. GW Bush didn't avoid military service. Clinton did. There is a big difference between the two. And this is coming from somebody who doesn't particulary like Bush and is a liberal. Encyclopedia articles are supposed to state the facts. Not personal opinion. This is shaky.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>This is biased opinion, to be sure, but George W. Bush trained for an ongoing war and didn't make it to that war. He did not oppose the war; he simply failed to do active military service, for which much opportunity was open. Had he failed as a pilot, he could have gone to Vietnam as part of a flight crew or served a sting guarding airbases. He could have gone to duty in Europe, where America's allies still understood to face what then seemed the great danger of a Soviet invasion. There was also Korea.</p>
<p>Unlike some others who avoided the war and actively protested it, he found ways to avoid service. There is no evidence that George W. Bush opposed the war on any principle as did his predecessor as President, William Jefferson Clinton; quite to the contrary. He was for the war, and he failed to put his life or even sacrifice his comfort. --66.231.41.57 11:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article only deals with American booms. Did you know, there was a boom in Europe as well?</p>
<p>Also, the list of famour baby boomers seems a bit silly, as it is merely a list of people born around the year 19xx. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User%7EEc5618_0777.html" title="User:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 15:15, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>cannot be a baby-boomer: this term is as far as I know attributed to the post-war generation. In September 1943 when Walesa, former Polish president was born the WWII was still present in Europe (until next Spring-Summer), it can be considered as the worth times in Poland. I would suggest to remove him from the list.</p>

<p>I've never heard of the "Baby Boom" as ending any earlier than 1964 (and in fact, have often seen it regarded as ending in '65). The fact that many celebrities born in the early to mid 1960s, (Coutrney Love, etc.) enjoy strong Generation X followings, doesn't mean that they themselves are of Generation X, just as many Baby Boomer icons -- Bob Dylan (born 1941), the Beatles (all born between 1940 - 42) -- were not themselves Baby Boomers. The Baby Boom (at least in the US), as I've always seen it defined, spanned twenty years, from 1945 (when soldiers came home after World War II and began creating the generation) until 1964 or '65 (when that generation began to come of age and began producing the next generation. User:Markt3 August 17, 2005</p>
<p>==Baby Boom ended in 1960, not '63 or '64 I haven't heard too many recent cites of the Baby Boom extending to 1965, and as time goes on, fewer and fewer cites of the Boom ending at any time after 1960. In the sociology class that I took last year, the textbook and the instructor (a Boomer herself) defined it as having ended in 1960. Older cites of the "Baby Boom", done before Generation X made its mark on society, tended to give 1964, 1965 or occasionally 1967 as cutoff dates. The influence of Strauss and Howe has clearly grown. Prairie Dog August 26, 2005</p>
<p>One has indeed a clear distinction between the more religious Boomers born before 1961 and the more secular Thirteeners born beginning in 1961. The Boomers were more likely to absorb some positives of the cultural ferment of the 1960s and Thirteeners generally weren't. Thirteeners are marked by their political conservatism that coincides with the rise of the Republican Party between 1980 and about 2000 as one Thirteener cohort after another voted increasingly for secular right-wingers. Even Bill Clinton proves a conservative by standards of almost any other time. Tellingly, Thirteener Jews are the first generation of Jews to have a majority of Republican voters, indicating a great cultural divide with those Jews affiliated with the mass immigration of eastern European Jews around AD 1900. Notice also that Mexican-Americans, once a predictable constituency for liberal Democrats, became increasingly Republican as the Thirteeners began to appear as voters.--66.231.41.57 07:01, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>I think that the list must revert to the convention of Boomers fitting the birth years of 1943-1960, if only because such is more consistent with Howe and Schwartz' format. Youth born in 1943 and 1944 were more likely to participate in radicalized causes, and were more likely to participate in the harder-edged culture that distinguished the mid-1960s from the early 1960s, and were more likely to serve in the Vietnam War as low-ranking soldiers than those older than them. Boomers born before 1961 were able to get something out of the Consciousness Revolution that Thirteeners born after 1960 were too young to appreciate (and such is not Thirteeners' fault!). Thirteeners were also far more likely to seek pure entrepreneurialism as a solution to personal discomforts than to achieve solace or purpose in religion or political radicalism.</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>I agree with the above statement. In no way, shape or form are those Americans born in the 1960's members of the the baby boom generation. Also, why does the "Generation Succession" footer on the Baby_boomers page show a definitive 1943 – 1960, while the Generation_X page shows (1943-1946) – (1957-1964)? How can Strauss and Howe be cited on the boomer page as definitive dates, whereas on several other generation pages there is this arbitrary form?</p>

<p>This list has become unwieldy in the extreme. It is full of sports stars and popular musicians who are likely to disappear from the public view very fast. Politicians, authors, entrepreneurs, scientists, inventors, artists, and classical composers are likely to stick to the center stage long after the sports stars are supplanted by other sports stars.</p>
<p>Yes, it is true. Nobody has Christy Matthewson or Honus Wagner in the list of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary_Generation_3c8f.html" title="Missionary Generation">Missionary Generation</a> celebrities. Christy Matthewson was the Roger Clemens of his time, and Honus Wagner was the Cal Ripken, Jr. of his time. The popular musicians of a hundred years ago are largely forgotten.

<p>I've read many comments above about this article being US-centric, but generation groups cannot easily be defined on a global scale, as events are going to be different for each country. If there are "baby boom" cohort groups in different countries, start those pages as "Baby boomer (country)" or something, change this page to a disambiguation page, and create this content as "Baby boomer (Unites States)". I could try and make those pages, but wouldn't know enough to create accurate content.</p>
<p>As the case is, historians (or so I hear) say you need at least 50 years before you can look back upon an event or group in order to have a good perspective. We're just reaching that point now in regards to the majority of the baby boomers. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Et_Cetera_300f.html" title="User:Sean Et Cetera">Sean Et Cetera</a> 14:46, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I dropped into the merge debate on the indicated talk (the WW-II version), and found that no one had set the table. Since it was a poorly reasoned idea (0 reasons stated), there is nothing to rebutt and as a committee of one, I'm voting unanomously to table the motion.

<p>I have sympathy with the call for globalisation, and a while ago added a section on the UK. However, the term is mainly a US one and in many countries they did not have a similar demographic history to the USA so there is no similar Baby Boomer generation.--<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuncorn_4389.html" title="User:Runcorn">Runcorn</a> 20:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I must respectfully but strongly disagree with your assertion that this demographic is largely limited to the USA. In France, which is the non-USA country whose culture I am the most familiar with, <i>les baby-boomers</i> are often spoken of as a demographic, in pretty much the same terms as in the USA. The French boomers, however, have their own shared culutral experiences distinct from American ones -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Hallyday_9e3e.html" title="Johnny Hallyday">Johnny Hallyday</a>, the uprising of the <i><a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1968.html" title="May 1968">soixante-huitards</a></i>, and the changes of post-colonialism are as closely associated with the boomer experience in France as much as <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodstock_Music_Festival_2e82.html" title="Woodstock Music Festival">Woodstock</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate.html" title="Watergate">Watergate</a> and the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_State_Massacre_5526.html" title="Kent State Massacre">Kent State Massacre</a> are in the US. I mention France because, as I've said, I'm pretty familiar with their recent history (and will add some of the above to the article soon), but I imagine that a lot of this was taking place in other industrialized countries as well. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 22:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry if I was unclear. I believe that the term is mainly used in the US; it is certainly rarely used in the UK. I did not say that this demographic is largely limited to the USA, just that the term is and that many (not most) countries have a different demography. As i say in the article, the UK has a very different birth rate history. Certainly, it seems worth having a section on France.--<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuncorn_4389.html" title="User:Runcorn">Runcorn</a> 22:10, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As well as a section on every other country where the boomer demographic is important. I can add info for France but I don't know what the Boomer experience was like for West Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Australia, Japan, Canada, etc. (or if these countries were like the UK in not sharing the US's shift in birth rates and concordant cultural changes). Hence the "globalize" tag. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 23:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suppose the thing to do is approach National Statistical Institutes for data on births so we can see who had a baby boom and when. Probably they would hold foreign publications too, so no need to do a world-wide trawl.--<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuncorn_4389.html" title="User:Runcorn">Runcorn</a> 19:23, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"Boomers have played a strong (and surely unforeseen) role in attempts to make America more overtly religious. Many have turned to fundamentalist Christianity as a solution to what they see as social rot. Many prefer religion over science wherever any doctrinal conflict appears; thus one finds a rise in creationist dogma and the promotion of prayer in public schools to an extent not known since the time of the Scopes Trial. If not so religious, Boomers are in general unusually protective over Gen X and Gen Y children, and this could be a reaction to their parents not being protective over them. An example of this is the fact that Boomers are the ones who insist upon V-chips in television so that children not see 'adult' content that Boomers could hardly wait to indulge in when children (because of this they have been called "hypocritical"); they are unusually swift to sanitize the culture that children see; they also often insist that their children be brought under control by curfews which in reality serve no function except to relieve the fears of paranoid Boomers who are worried about their children. Because of these and other reasons, some believe that because the freedom of Gen X and Gen Y people is more restricted, they may end up being less protective over their own "Gen Z" children."</i></p>
<p>This entire Paragraph is entirely POV unless supporting documentation can be provided for the ascertations made. If this is an excerpt from a book, it needs to be stated as so. If this is pure speculation on the behalf of a writer, then it needs to be re-written to reflect source material or it needs to be (and will be) removed. Statements such as "<i>often insist that their children be brought under control by curfews which in reality serve no function except to relieve the fears of paranoid Boomers</i>" are complete speculation and have no place in an accurate article. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColdbourne_d782.html" title="User:Coldbourne">Coldbourne</a> 23:57, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Baby Boomers grew up in a new world quasi-dominated by American Military might, where the bad guys were known to be <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialists.html" title="Socialists">socialists</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communists.html" title="Communists">communists</a>, during a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_war.html" title="Cold war">cold war</a> where researchers lead to today's computer driven world, which if glimpsed then would have been scoffed at as poor <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>. Moreover, the generation matured for the most part both off the farm and outside of urban crowding where every year brought new wonders, marvelous gadgets and household appliances, and unemployment was virtually absent (provided your family was Caucasian and willing to work).</p>
<p>There are early boomers that the generation is identified by, and late boomers who did not experience the 1960s and were not subject to the military draft. Nonetheless, demographic popularizers have referred to them as a generation for the cultural factors they shared went far deeper than the triviality of a foreign conflict, more people were killed on the nations streets and by-ways in any single year of the conflict, than were lost to enemy action.</p>
<p>A caveat applies: the arrogance, selfishness, and ruthlessness that Strauss and Howe attribute to an unusual degree in all prior Idealist generations can lead to factional strife (as during the American Civil War) or to outright despotism. Younger generations may need to rein in these destructive tendencies.</p>
<p>Strauss and Howe's posited patterns of history indicate that Boomers will occupy the upper echelons of worldly power through a likely Crisis Era that will not end until about 2020. The best <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealist.html" title="Idealist">Idealist</a> leaders demonstrate vision, decisiveness, and culture that allows them to lead in the best manner in the worst of times.</p>
<p>If not so religious, Boomers are in general unusually protective over <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gen_X_fa37.html" title="Gen X">Gen X</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gen_Y_1dc0.html" title="Gen Y">Gen Y</a> children, and this could be a reaction to their parents not being protective over them. An example of this is the fact that Boomers are the ones who insist upon V-chips in television so that children not see 'adult' content that Boomers could hardly wait to indulge in when children (because of this they have been called "hypocritical"); they also are unusually swift to sanitize the culture that children see. Because of these and other reasons, some believe that because the freedom of Gen X and Gen Y people is more restricted, they may end up being less protective over their own "Gen Z" children.</p>
<p>Boomers seek to improve society through children as their Silent next-elders seem to have failed (by Boomer standards) through excessive leniency. Such change will come with mixed blessings, particularly to those who must endure Boomer judgment, which becomes steadily harsher as Boomers supplant older (GI, Silent) adults.</p>
<p>Boomers may have been best known for hippies and other counter-cultural types, but the conservatism that one associates with country music has become more the norm. But like other Idealist generations of the past, Boomers have strong passions for personal and social improvement, and although the expressions of such passion change, the intensity of that passion remains until they age out of prominence.</p>

<p>Definately should of go to meta - it's trash. I tried to NPOV it just now, got a third of the way through and realised that the task was hopeless. What is the source of the long quotation? Why is it on Wikipedia? What justification is there for the absurdly vague generalisations this article makes? Do we have any scientific evidence at all to rely on here? Or just a pop psychology book or two?</p>
<p>In its defense, it is a brave attempt to outline something of the flavour of the baby-boomer generation, but it's hopelessly impressionistic and (so far as I can tell) entirely unscientific. Better than astrology, but not much. It's one thing to have a bit of life and air in articles, but this one is all froth, no beer.</p>
<p>In short, it's probably beyond hope. In a moment I'm going to revert my own edit - it was pointless. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 07:55 Feb 6, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know about the above. the overal tone seems fine to me, except that it is now written in from rather American viewpoint. Are there no baby-boomers in the rest of the world? We use the term in The Netherlands too. the phrase "foreign born" gets me ticked off a bit. Haven't rewritten because I don't really know how to change it. But I guess it's just too US-centric to me. at least some sentences. <a href="../../../k/h/7/User%7EKh7_de99.html" title="User:Kh7">kh7</a> 09:48 Mar 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tannin is right. This page is beyond redemption. I changed the defintion to acknowledge that countries other than the US had baby booms, and cut the following passage, which is POV and unsupported by any evidence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As Boomers have charted their life's voyage, they have metamorphosized from <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leave_It_to_Beaver_40dd.html" title="Leave It to Beaver">Beaver Cleaver</a> to <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a> to "braneater" to <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppie.html" title="Yuppie">yuppie</a> to what some are calling "neo-Puritan". From VJ-Day forward, whatever age bracket the Boomers have occupied has been the cultural and spiritual focal point for American society as a whole. Arriving as the inheritors of G.I. triumph, Boomers have always seen their mission not to construct society but to justify, purify, and even sanctify it. Throughout the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consciousness_Revolution_7379.html" title="Consciousness Revolution">Consciousness Revolution</a> of the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, the Boom ethos remained a deliberate antithesis of everything G.I.: <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a> over <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, gratification over patience, negativism over positivism, fractiousness over conformity, rage over friendliness, self over community.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If this passage could be fleshed out with some evidence and re-worded in some plausible way (for example, I doubt that most baby boomers even think they have a mission, so they are unlikely to see it as anything), then it would be a valuable addition to the article. No doubt there are attitudinal and behavioural differences between generations, but this passage is too sweeping and too often wrong -- for example, I'm a baby boomer, and like many other baby boomers I find the idea of spirituality repulsive.</p>
<p>I also don't see the point of the lists of baby boomer celebrities and achievements. They don't seem to illustrate anything about the baby boom.<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrontonian_6c76.html" title="User:Trontonian">Trontonian</a></p>
<p>I believe that the Baby Boom may of initially begun during WWII, in the early-to-mid 1940s, but it did NOT end in 1960. For one thing, in the early 1960s, the birth rate was still UP THERE, and second of all, most people born in 1960-'61-'62 are from rather large families with parents generally born in the 1920s and mostly were the last born or next to the last and occasionally few were born in the latter middle. By the mid '60s however, parents of those families were generally finished with having babies themselves and were on the verge of becoming grandparents, thus there are people who were born in the early 1960s that do have nephews and nieces born in the mid-to-late '60s, which was the beginning of the so called 'Generation X'. (P.S., I am a 'Boomer born in 1962.)</p>
<p>The issue isn't hat you think but how the baby boom is usually defined by demographers etc. Anyway, no one has made an effort to correct the problems with this article. It is not encyclopedic for the reasons given above and apparently will remain so. At least it no longer pretends that baby boomers didn't fight in Vietnam. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrontonian_6c76.html" title="User:Trontonian">Trontonian</a> 17:28, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just noticed the list of celebrities consists of American celebrities – Arnold Schwarzenegger's inclusion has to be justified by his dual citizenship. This national POV is a serious flaw in the article. Some of us have tried to remove it, but people keep putting it back in. So my last word on this article is it's hopeless. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrontonian_6c76.html" title="User:Trontonian">Trontonian</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I have made an attempt to restore this article so that it is analogous to pages about other generations. One obvious difference is that the Boomers, unlike earlier generations, have yet to even approach the completion of their active role in history. I have noted that the oldest Boomers are approaching retirement age, but that many are still yet to reach their political prime. The last leaders from among the Boomers have yet to even show that they are the final participants or the most important participants in history.</p>
<p>In the end I think that most of the athletes, film stars, popular musicians, and early figures of politics will have lost their significance in history. I have excised several of them so that the list becomes less unwieldy, and that there is room for others -- composers, artists, writers, and politicians of greater influence that we may not yet know. For example, I replaced Lee Atwater with Karl Rove, the latter having the potential to reshape American politics for decades if certain things go his way -- at least under my interpretation of what I think is his way. To say further about Karl Rove is to bring NPOV into question.--66.231.38.91 18:10, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did find some articles about baby boomers and religion and will add that, but those articles do not support the statements above.</p>
<p>ALSO, it seems that some of the controversy around this article is keeping its focus on the group that is known as the baby boomers (as opposed to the baby boom which can be covered in the baby boom article), so should describe what that group is, did, etc. If people from other countries want to add a description of the baby boomers in their countries, that seems like a great idea. --<a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinned_Elk_9a9c.html" title="User:Tinned Elk">Tinned Elk</a> 23:11, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
