<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Baba_Vanga_a447.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Vanga was born in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strumica.html" title="Strumica">Strumica</a> (today in <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>), and after 1942 lived in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrich.html" title="Petrich">Petrich</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>). Her birth was a premature one, so the baby had to stay tucked in an ox stomach for two months. Her fingers and toes were initially knit together, her ears were stuck to her head, and her <a href="../../../f/o/n/Fontanelle.html" title="Fontanelle">fontanelle</a> stayed soft all her life. In accordance with local tradition, the baby was not given a name until it was likely to survive. After the baby's first cry-out, a midwife went out in the street and asked a stranger for a name. The stranger proposed <i>Andromaha</i>, but it was not accepted for being "too Greek", so the second stranger's proposal, <i>Vangelia</i> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Βαγγελία</span>, short for <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Ευαγγελία</span>, "herald of the blessed word"), was accepted — also a Greek name, but popular in the region.</p>
<p>In her childhood, Vangelia was an ordinary girl. Her father was conscripted into the Bulgarian Army during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and her mother died when Vanga was quite young. The girl depended on the neighbours for a long time. Vanga was smart, with blue eyes and blond hair. She loved every object having its own place. Her hidden talent started to show up when she herself thought out games and loved playing "healing" – she prescribed some herbs to her friends, who pretended to be ill. When Vanga was 11 years old, she thought out a strange game, which seemed dangerous to her father. Vanga used to put something in the street or in the house, then put her hands on her eyes, imitating blindness, and sought for it. Although her father prohibited playing blind, she continued. Her father, being a widower, eventually married a good woman, thus providing a stepmother to his daughter. He had an animal farm, so Vanga had to drive the milk-can.</p>
<p>Once, there was a terrible storm, rooting up trees, which lifted Vanga up and threw her in the field. She was found after a long search. She was very frightened, and her eyes were covered with sand and dust, so she couldn't open them because of the pain. No healing gave results. There was money only for partial operation,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> so her eyesight was failing.</p>
<p>In 1925 Vanga was brought to a Blind House in <a href="../../../z/e/m/Zemun.html" title="Zemun">Zemun</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, where she spent three years, and was taught to read <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braille.html" title="Braille">Braille</a>, play the piano, as well as do knitting, cooking, and cleaning.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> After the death of her step-mother she had to go back home, in order to take care of her little siblings. Her family was very poor, and she had to work all day.</p>
<p>Believers claim that supernatural abilities of Vanga appeared gradually. Nobody noticed the date of their coming, but many remembered later how she helped her father find a sheep stolen from the flock. She simply described the yard, where the sheep was hidden, claiming to have dreamt of it beforehand. She noticed that she had dreams about bad events and then they eventually became real.</p>
<p>In 1939 Vanga caught <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleurisy.html" title="Pleurisy">pleurisy</a>, although she had been quite healthy in the previous years. The doctor's opinion was that she would soon die, so some fellow citizens were already collecting money for the poor girl's expected funeral. Vanga's body recovered unexpectedly from the illness in a day.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another story told by believers of Vanga's supernatural powers says she predicted the death of her eldest brother, Vasil. When he joined a partisan party, Vanga asked him not to go, saying that he would be killed at the age of 23. But Vasil would not believe her — he left in June, and in October he surrendered to the Germans. He was tortured, and then executed.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> Vanga attracted more believers — a number of people visiting her, hoping to get a hint about whether their relatives are alive, or seeking for the place where they died. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_8.html" title="April 8">8 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> the Bulgarian king <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_III_of_Bulgaria_964c.html" title="Boris III of Bulgaria">Boris III</a> visited her, and it is claimed that she told him to remember the date of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">28 August</a>. He died on that date in 1943.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">10 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> Vanga married Dimitar Gushterov, a man from a village near Petrich, who had come asking for the killers of his brother, but had to promise her not to seek revenge. Shortly before marriage, Dimitar and Vanga moved to Petrich, where she soon became well-known. Dimitar was later conscripted and had to spend some time in Greece. He got another illness in 1947, fell into alcoholism, and eventually died on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
Vanga died on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">11 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. Her funeral was honoured by large crowds, including many political leaders.</p>

<p>Vanga claimed that her alleged extraordinary abilities had something to do with the presence of invisible creatures, but she couldn't clearly explain their origin. She was saying, that those creatures were giving her information about people, which she could not transmit to them, because, distance and time didn't matter. According to Vanga, the life of everyone standing in front of her, was like a film to her, from birth till death. But changing "what was written on the generation" was beyond her power.</p>
<p>Apart from profesying, Vanga was known as a healer, but only through herbal medicines. According to her, people had to heal themselves only with herbs from the country they live in. She prescribed washing with an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infusion.html" title="Infusion">infusion</a> of herbs and spices, because they heal better through the skin. Vanga did not oppose mainstream medicine, although she thought that taking too much medicines is bad, because "<i>they close the doors, through which nature restores the balance in the body with herbs</i>".<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Vanga was not afraid of death. She said that there is no death: "<i>I have told you, that after death the body decomposes, like anything living, but a part of the body – the soul, or something I don't know how to call, does not decompose. But what remains from a man is his soul. It does not decompose and continues to develop to reach higher states. This is the eternity of soul.</i>" (part of a conversation with a theatre man)<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Many witnesses remembered about the contacts Vanga made with dead people. A man asked her why she was talking about his dead mother, and she replied: "<i>You have not taken it with you. They come on their own, because for them, I am a door to this world. When somebody comes to me, his dead relatives are around him, ask me questions and answer, and I only tell the living what I hear</i>".<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Vanga never allowed anybody to seek revenge. She believed that a man is born to do good, and no bad deed ever remains unpunished. Bad is always punished and if it does not affect the man who did it, it affects his children.</p>
<p>Vanga made prophesies of newborn or unborn children. She claimed that she was "seeing" and "talking" to people, who had died hundreds of years ago. Vanga talked about the future, although she did not like to. In her words, in 200 years man will make contact with brothers in mind from other worlds.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> She even said that many aliens have been living on the earth for years. They came from the planet, which in their language is called <i>Vamfim</i>, and is the third planet from the Earth.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Followers of Vanga believe that she knew the precise date of her own death, and shortly before that she had said that a 10-year-old blind girl living in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> was to inherit her gift, and that people would soon hear about her.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Baba_Vanga_a447.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Sceptics accuse her of speaking too ambiguously<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> — any cryptic thought can apply to a future historical event, sooner or later.</p>
<p>Vanga is known to have been rude to people whom she considered bad and sinful. The guilty person's deeds were usually exposed by her in detail before she sent him or her away.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Believers think that sometimes Vanga intentionally hides information, especially bad news, from people whom it concerns. This is attributed to her philantropy, and is confirmed by her relatives to have caused her discomfort after the visitor goes out.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Vanga said that she is not allowed to reveal certain facts to anybody.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
