<dd>And where did he get that from? "Ahka" is simply a typo, that should be "Akha". And I couldn't find any source that called the Hani "Hakka".

<dd>There are many and they are easy to find if you can read the languages involved. (If not, you'll be at loss anyway.) The problem is that some minorities don't have well-established written languages.
<ul>
<li>For place names in Inner Mongolia, there is the very comprehensive <b>Nèi Měnggǔ dìmíng cídiǎn</b>, <i>Hàn-Méng duìzhào</i> 《内蒙古地名词典》汉蒙对照 (<i>Nèi Měnggǔ rénmín chūbǎnshè</i> 内蒙古人民出版社，2000);</li>
<li>for Tibetan place names, there is <b>Yīng, Hàn, Zàng Xīzàng dìmíng duìzhào</b> 《英、汉、藏西藏地名对照》, in: <i>Xīzàng yánjiū</i> 《西藏研究》 1997.4 and 1998.1, and several books and lists produced by agencies such as Xinhua;</li>
<li>for Xinjiang, see <i>Niú Rǔchén</i> 牛汝辰: <b>Xīnjiāng dìmíng gàishuō</b> 《新疆地名概说》 (<i>Zhōngyāng mínzú dàxué chūbǎnshè</i> 中央民族大学出版社 1994） etc.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Some dictionaries for minority languages contain place names. Place names in languages of smaller minorities, such as in Yunnan, are generally rather difficult to find unless you go to those areas. — <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabelfisch_898b.html" title="User:Babelfisch">Babelfisch</a> 01:08, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to take so long to reply, I've just come back to Jinghong from a trip south through Thailand and Laos. I'm a bit confused as to the current state of things article-wise, as I can't see phonetics and am not familiar with the scripts or the finer linguistic properties of the language spoken here.</p>
<p>Firstly, I saw the <a href="http://www.cass.cn/minzusuo/mzwz/" class="external text" title="http://www.cass.cn/minzusuo/mzwz/" rel="nofollow">site you mentioned</a> but it seems to only have one Dai/Tai script <a href="http://www.cass.cn/minzusuo/mzwz/07.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cass.cn/minzusuo/mzwz/07.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This is strange, as there are at least 3 as far as I know (I was informed by a monk at the largest temple in XSBN, so I take it that this is fairly informed/good advice) - the 'new' (government-simpified), the 'old' (possibly two of these, one for xsbn and one for dehong prefecture, though the latter is possibly just lanna .. I don't recall) and the 'lanna' ("ancient"), which IIRC was used and/or more influential in Dehong than in XSBN), however from what I can see on Wikipedia right now there is a distinction being made between 'Tai Le' (redirected to 'Tai Nua'), and 'Tai Lu', with the latter being placed here in Xishuangbanna.</p>
<p>It's important when considering this to remember that scripts and languages have different distinctions - all of the scripts are used to write at least both <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pali.html" title="Pali">Pali</a> and a local vernacular.</p>
<p>One possible omission is that I can tell you that some Tai people of northern Laos (<a href="../../../l/u/a/Luang_Namtha_31d1.html" title="Luang Namtha">Luang Namtha</a> Province) speak a language VERY similar to what the Dai people speak here in Xishuangbanna - 90% sure it's the same, as the area is physically adjacent. I won't make this change myself as I'm unsure right now which article is which language, or indeed, which languages are about!</p>
<p>I wish I had access to an English library to figure this out. I'll have to leave it to someone else, but AFAIK the current state of things looks misleading and/or incorrect, re: what languages are about, their geographical coverage, scripts they are written in, from whence they came, etc. Just wanted to make this clear. <a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPratyeka_4be2.html" title="User:Pratyeka">prat</a> 00:08, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oops, just noticed the entry for XSBN new dai script on the link you sent. That source isn't too bad, then. However, this is a distinction between <i>scripts</i>, not between <i>languages</i>.</dd>
<dd>If you see 'languages recorded' on each Dai script's page, you get cop-out entries like 德宏傣语 (Dehong Dai) - a wholly Chinese concept (is it the same as Shan across the border?) - and 勐定傣语 (Mengding Dai).</dd>
<dd>It appears that in moving articles around we've ended up with <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tai_L%C3%BC_language_c114.html" title="Tai Lü language">Tai Lü language</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tai_N%C3%BCa_language_9579.html" title="Tai Nüa language">Tai Nüa language</a>, which do not map well to either these sources or my experiences. I'm at a loss as to the actual situation, however. <a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPratyeka_4be2.html" title="User:Pratyeka">prat</a> 00:16, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is actually an entry showing the <a href="http://www.cass.cn/minzusuo/mzwz/34/sample34-5.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cass.cn/minzusuo/mzwz/34/sample34-5.htm" rel="nofollow">new old-Dai government-simplified script</a> (新老傣文对照课本) on that site, which I guess can be contrasted with the actual old Dai script in other entries (<a href="http://www.cass.cn/minzusuo/mzwz/34/sample34-3.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cass.cn/minzusuo/mzwz/34/sample34-3.htm" rel="nofollow">勐泐王族世系</a>). These are both listed under the mixed heading "<a href="../../../x/i/s/Xishuangbanna.html" title="Xishuangbanna">Xishuangbanna</a> <a href="../../../d/a/i/Dai.html" title="Dai">Dai</a> / Old Dai (西双版纳新、老傣文)". So you can see there's at least 3 scripts, New XSBN Simplified Dai ('new old Dai'), XSBN Dai, and Dehong Dai. The relationship to the old Lanna script is still unclear to me, however I seem to recall the monk I met told me the Dehong Dai was traditional for monastic use so it very well may be the same (and the bearer of the 'old dai' name). Anyway this tells us nothing about distinctions between languages, which seemingly are the only subject of the current 2-wiki's contents... <a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPratyeka_4be2.html" title="User:Pratyeka">prat</a> 00:28, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sure there is a dialect continuum between most of these languages or dialects, blurred by some migration: Thai, Lao, Tai Nüa (Dehong Dai) and Tai Lü (Xishuangbanna Dai) in China, Shan in Myanmar, and other Tai languages and dialects in Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam etc. That makes things complicated. Thai nationalists usually suggest that all these languages are just Thai dialects. Chinese sources tend to ignore what's going on across the Chinese border.</p>
<p>I can't tell how far these languages are really apart. One source I found says that Tai Lü and Tai Nüa are not mutually comprehensible. Another says that comparing lists of 1400 words from the basic vocabulary of Tai Lü and Tai Nüa, we can find 75% are identical - which is actually a rather low figure. So far I didn't find any sources for the other languages or dialects of the Dai in China, but Chinese sources mention two other written languages.</p>
<p>Some other points you've mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pali</b>. I can't imagine that all the modern alphabets are also used to write Pali. On one hand, they have been simplified so much that they lack distinctions that are not made in the modern spoken languages, but these distinction have to be made in Pali; on the other hand the monasteries probably don't give up their writing traditions just because the Chinese government issues a decree for a new script. Writing systems for everyday use (Tai languages) and for religious purposes (mostly Pali) should be clearly distinguished.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dai of China, Lanna script and Tai languages outside China</b>. I have not really looked for sources on Tai languages outside China, nor for liturgic scripts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Languages and scripts</b>. In China today, the Dai use four modern written languages, namely Tai Lü (Xishuangbanna Dai) and Tai Nüa (Dehong Dai), and two others which are called 傣绷 (Tai Pong) and 傣担/傣端 (Tai Dam or Jinping Dai). (The table in the article on the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Dai_people.html" title="Dai people">Dai people</a> is not correct, I'm afraid.) I don't fully understand what alphabets were used for these languages before the 1950s or are still used in monasteries. For <b>Tai Lü</b>, a reformed script called 新傣文 was introduced in 1954. An older form was officially revived ten, twenty years ago. For <b>Tai Nüa</b>, a reformed script was introduced in 1954 as well. The original Tai Nüa script was apparently derived from the Tai Pong alphabet, which in turn was a modified Burmese alphabet, and still today some Tai Nüa fonts resemble Burmese very closely, but not the style that is usually used today. In the 1970s/1980s, new tone letters were introduced for Tai Nüa. I don't know enough yet about <b>Tai Pong</b> and <b>Tai Dam</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CASS pages actually give fairly detailed and yet very short descriptions not only of these writing systems, but also about where they are used. Small-town bookshops usually are not very well stocked, but I guess you could find material in Jinghong.</p>
<p>What I'm absolutely sure about is that what you called Tai Le is actually Dehong Dai / Tai Nüa. The images of the alphabet you put into that article make that absolutely clear.</p>
<p>Terminology is a serious problem, of course. We probably need more tables and samples, but encoding is yet another problem. Only Tai Lü ("New Tai Lue") and Tai Nüa ("Tai Le") are covered by Unicode so far. I've tried to make things as clear as possible, but of course I'm aware that the result is still far from ideal. — <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabelfisch_898b.html" title="User:Babelfisch">Babelfisch</a> 02:01, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

(see <a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15374" class="external text" title="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15374" rel="nofollow">Online encyclopedia Wikipedia censored</a> by Reporters sans frontières) I haven't been able to edit pages directly since I returned to Beijing on October 16th. The only proxy that I know which isn't blocked by Chinese government censorship has been blocked by the Wikipedia administrator <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> because someone has used this IP address (67.15.136.199) to vadalise Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>At the moment, this discussion page seems to be the only page I'm able to edit, even if I log in, because I have to use this proxy. I hope there will be a solution for this problem soon, or users in China will remain barred from Wikipedia. — <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabelfisch_898b.html" title="User:Babelfisch">Babelfisch</a> 14:22, 25 September 2005 (Beijing time)</p>

<p>Are there instructions somewhere for inputting the special characters needed for letters with tone marks? It's wonderful that people are so conscientious about this.

<dd>When you edit articles in Wikipedia, below the three buttons <i>Save page</i> / <i>Show Preview</i> / <i>Show changes</i>, you'll see a box with special characters. When you click on one of them, it will be inserted. In MS Word it's possible to define key combinations for special characters. (I guess you'll need something like that even for Pinyin without tones, because <i>ü</i> is not on an English keyboard.) Recent versions of Word also have a function to add Pinyin to Chinese characters ("ruby"), which I find useful, although it is not very reliable. —<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabelfisch_898b.html" title="User:Babelfisch">Babelfisch</a> 01:10, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you take another look at this article? I've resolved to most of your objections (though I'm not sure what other examples of racism there are; in any case I changed the example you mentioned and added sourced description of the Huaorani lifestyle). I also left "hope to present Christianity" and described my reasoning on the talk page. The only one I haven't gotten to yet as far as I can tell is mentioning which mission board each missionary was associated with. By adding more information from non-missionary sources I hope that you see this as less POV and that you would be willing to remove the NPOV dispute tag. If that action is conditional on the inclusion of the missionary board information, this weekend I'll try to write a subsection under "background" that covers the basics of each of the five guys and includes their mission organizations. I'd also appreciate it if you let me know if there's anything else that needs to be improved.

<dd>Hi Babelfisch, I've recently been working on an "Aftermath" section, and I'd like your opinion on it. It's not as detailed as the account you included in the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Saint_8dfa.html" title="Rachel Saint">Rachel Saint</a> article, but I think that's acceptable since the subject of the article is the actual encounter of the five men with the Huaorani. The aftermath is obviously important, but I feel that fewer specific details are necessary. Even so, if you can think of anything that needs to be added, please suggest it. At this point, I planning to add a section called "Preparation" or something similar that discusses the events of the last few months of 1955, and I'm going to expand the "Legacy" section. Anything else you think is necessary? —<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="../../../../es/s/p/a/Usuario%7ESpangineer_0822.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Spangineer">[es]</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 03:39, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Chilai" is found in some foreign-language publications from China, but it's wrong. The reason is probably that in Chinese the name is usually written "<i>Chìliè</i> 赤列".

<dd>Cool,I appreciate your input on this sort of thing. Still, I wonder what your source is for this info, partly because I might try to get ahold of it myself. It does seem that "chinlai" is less common on the internet: "chinlai dojê" and "chinlai gyaco" turn up no google hits other than your edits to the English and German Wikipedias. However, this is hardly conclusive, because there are quite few hits for "chinlai dojê" and "chinlai gyaco" (exactly one non-Wikipedia for the latter). - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 05:55, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It seems you didn't notice in the SIL article that I'd moved the section on funding allegations further down (so that the SIL denial of funding from rockefellers would have a more immediate context), and you reinserted the paragraph where I'd moved it from. The remaining info in that paragraph is either repitition from further above (countries were work was halted), or somewhat questionable (e.g. limited in Peru by the 1980s...?).</p>

<dd>A Chinese government Website writes:

<dd><i>The Jing people had their own script which was called Zinan. Created on the basis of the script of the Han people towards the end of the 13th century, it was found in old song books and religious scriptures.

<dd>In the 1980s, a book was published about the "Gin language", a recognition as a separate language, definitely not Cantonese:

<dd>The Wikipedia article is about an ethnic group. You say that the Gin and the Vietnamese are the same ethnic group, so what's the point? The fact that these people in China have citizenship and speak Cantonese (as a second language, presumably) is not really relevant for their ethnicity, unless - and that's the main point - the Gin see themselves as a separate people, an "ethnic group" that is separate from the Vietnamese. They probably don't, but that question hasn't been answered yet. —<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabelfisch_898b.html" title="User:Babelfisch">Babelfisch</a> 02:38, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Thanks for your edits to the external sources section of the Jung Chang article. Just a note, blogs are not completely prohibited from being used as sources on wikipedia, merely they have to be used carefully. The reason that entry is in there is because it's to source a statement made by an academic about the Mao book.

<p>Hello The list of references is very good. Many talk about the writing system based on Chinese charcters. Therefore the link to [[Zhuang logogram]s is valuable, as it is the only wikipedia article on these. The difference in terminology logogram vs logograph is a little unsightly, if they were changed to match that would read better.</p>
<p>The information put in re tone-letters had two parts to it, firstly that the change in 1986 was from a Cyrillic alphabet to an English or Latin alphabet. For a reference see <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrillic_alphabet.html" title="Cyrillic alphabet">Cyrillic alphabet</a>, this is definitely correct. The writting system was designed by Russian nad Chinese linguists in the 1950's and so they naturally used a Cyrillic alphabet. Second the change from numbers to letters, exact wording here might be in questionable in the 1957 Cyrillic Zhuang the second to sixth tones are marked by final letters that look like 2,3,4,5 and 6 respectively, the similarity is very close in the 1957 system, these in 1986 were changed to z,j,x,q, and h of which look a little like 2,3,4,5, and 6. z,j,x, and q only represent tones, h can also represent sounds. It is much clearer to talk about the Cyrillic alphabet than about "a <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> with some special letters". The comment about tone numbers could be left out as the visual data already shows this.</p>
<p>A lot of work has gone into this page, a link to <a href="../../../z/h/u/Zhuang_logogram.html" title="Zhuang logogram">Zhuang logogram</a> and a clear mention of the <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrillic_alphabet.html" title="Cyrillic alphabet">Cyrillic alphabet</a> would add to it.

<dd>Hi again</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Re the ancient Zhaung dictionary 'contains 4,900 characters and more than 10,000 variants' more accurate would be 'has 4,900 enteries, and contains more than 10,000 different characters in all' (This is the first sentance of the introduction to the dictionary it says 10,700 and 4918.) Using an approximation here is good as neither of these figures is accurate, especially the 10,700 -- there may not even be 10,000 different characters in the dictionary -- unless one adds in the characters included in the example sentances but not in the entries themselves.</dd>
<dd>Re the article itself it would be good if we could agree on a wording that we are both happy with, it would not be productive for things to be changed back and forth again and again. I am more than happy to drop the comment about the use numbers for tones.
<dl>
<dd>(1) Even a small change from 'Zhuang had been written with <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logogram.html" title="Logogram">logographs</a> ' to 'Zhuang has been written with <a href="../../../z/h/u/Zhuang_logogram.html" title="Zhuang logogram">logographs</a>' would be clearer, the sawndip writing system was never official and continues to be used to this day in much the way it always was and the link is more relevant. Or it could be worded so that links to both exist 'Zhuang has been written with <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logogram.html" title="Logogram">logographs</a>, sometimes called <a href="../../../z/h/u/Zhuang_logogram.html" title="Zhuang logogram">sawndip</a>'.</dd>
<dd>(2) Describing the 1957 as special letters is not very exact it is a wikipedia policy to be as exact as possible, most of the 'special letters' are Cyrillic letters, and two of the vowels are common ipa symbols.</dd>

<dd>There is enough to say on the Zhuang language to make several pages, there is not much wikipedia material on Zhuang, a collective effort to improve this is best.</dd>

<dd>You wrote: "For a reference see Cyrillic alphabet, this is definitely correct. The writting system was designed by Russian nad Chinese linguists in the 1950's and so they naturally used a Cyrillic alphabet."</dd>
<dd>Sorry, this is not correct. Have a look at the <a href="../../../z/h/u/Zhuang_language.html#Writing_systems" title="Zhuang language">section on writing systems</a> in the article on the Zhuang language: The 1957 Zhuang alphabet consists of 18 Latin letters (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, r, s, v and y) plus 10 non-Latin letters. Of the non-Latin letters, ƽ is definitely not Cyrillic; it marks the 5th tone and looks like a number 5. The letters з, ч and ƅ look like Cyrillic letters, but don't have their sound values; they mark the 3rd, 4th and 6th tones and also look a bit like numbers 3, 4 and 6. The letter ƨ is not Cyrillic; it marks the 2nd tone and could actually be derived from a number 2. The letter ƌ is not cyrillic either. The letter ƃ looks a bit like the cyrillic Ƃ, but it seems more logic that ƃ was derived from b and ƌ from d. The letters ə and ŋ look like <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> letters; both have also been used in both Latin and Cyrillic orthographies of many languages in the Soviet Union, as well as in the Latin orthographies of some minority languages—in Xinjiang and elsewhere—in China. The letter ɯ looks a bit like the Cyrillic ш, but it doesn't have it's sound value.</dd>
<dd>Conclusion: It is a Latin alphabet with 10 extra letters; 5 of them are derived from numbers, 3 from Latin letters and 2 from some phonetic alphabet. Five of the extra letters look a bit like Cyrillic letters, but not a single one has the sound value of the Cyrillic letter it looks like. (The result actually reminds me of the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_reference_alphabet.html" title="African reference alphabet">African reference alphabet</a> which was created much later, and other attempts to create new written languages.)</dd>
<dd>I agree that we have to be precise; you should check your sources once more. I really recommend the book by Zhou Minglang. (If you happen to be in Beijing, you can find it in the National Library.)</dd>
<dd>Maybe this discussion should be continued at the <a href="../../../z/h/u/Talk%7EZhuang_language_4f82.html" title="Talk:Zhuang language">talk page</a> of the article in question. —<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabelfisch_898b.html" title="User:Babelfisch">Babelfisch</a> 02:14, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know, I know, it's "not permitted". I've read that page months ago. It doesn't help. It doesn't work. I don't know what to do. On another language version of Wikipedia, I was advised to get a proxy server abroad. I have no idea how to do that. It's absolutely ridiculous that all users of China are banned by this collusion of Wikipedia with Chinese censorship. —<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabelfisch_898b.html" title="User:Babelfisch">Babelfisch</a> 03:31, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
