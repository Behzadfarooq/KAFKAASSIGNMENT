<h2><span class="mw-headline">Level 5 colors</span></h2>
<p>The issue of template colors has been adressed before, yes. And yes, I'm bringing it up again. Level 5, as I have said before in other discussions on this matter, SHOULD NOT be red, or any shade thereof. In a similar vein, Level 4 shouldn't be the piss-shade of yellow that it is now. Since the trend with these things seems to be a steady hue shift from blue to green (with the exception of the rather soothing colors of level-0 boxes), why not continue that shift by using more shades of blue? The term "professional" is controversial enough as it is, and we don't need angry colors to drive that point home. Any ideas? <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECernen_7781.html" title="User:Cernen">Cernen</a> 12:23, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that this topic warrants additional discussion. Ideally, the color coding and the numeric codes should be redundant. The current blues that are used to denote level 1 and level 3 proficiency are too similar and are easily confused. This is a problem given that these levels represent quite different levels of proficiency. I also agree that the current yellow is too saturated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Jigen III's proposed palette (copied from above) has merit. The extremes of this scale are clearly anchored (pink 0, yellow tint 1, green tint for native proficiency). I think the blues used for levels 2 and 3 are too similar in this proposal, but at least they are adjacent points on the scale. (In truth, it's hard to discern <i>intermediate</i> and <i>advanced</i> levels semantically, so perhaps the ambiguity of the corresponding colors is not such a problem!) <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingster_9137.html" title="User:Lingster">Lingster</a> 13:43, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The whole current color scheme is meaningless IMO. We should begin with red for xx-0 and use higher-frequency colors for higher levels. And xx-N does not belong to the xx-0 to xx-5 scale. For example:

<p>So when is a decision going to be made on this? Any of the proposed color schemes looks better than the current one. In fact, the color scheme they've got on the Spanish Wikipedia <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Babel" class="external autonumber" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Babel" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> looks pretty good. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadler_77dd.html" title="User:Madler">Madler</a> 20:04, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Note that some userboxes were not adding to the relevant category. I have fixed this for id-3 &amp; id-4 but it may also exist in other userboxes.</li>
<li>A bigger issue is that the userbox for native speakers usually has no suffix, e.g. for Indonesian they have {{user id}} rather than {{user id-N}}. However, non-natives such as myself are added to this category as well. This makes it impossible to list a category of just native speakers, as they are mixed in with everyone else (e.g. users with id-1 through id-4 are all in <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_id_4c98.html" title="Category:User id">Category:User id</a>).

<dd>I ran into a similar problem with Template:User en. The template places me in Cat:User en-N, but not Cat:User en. I think it should place me in both (as should all templates except xx-0), so that the general category is a list of all speakers of the language, while the subcats divide the levels. I think most Babelboxes already work that way. If no one minds, I'm going to change the User en template so that it does that. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">Talk</a> 23:15, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Responded to me? hmmh. Let me see. We should really nominate the article on Response (communication) as an urgent request to be written. Response implies that you hear or read what the other person says. In this case, I already said on the deletion discussion, what I am going to tell you again. Policies are decided by drawing up a Policy proposal. There have been several cases of abuse like the ones by Cool Cat and Ilmari, but usually voters acknowledge that there should be a policy discussion first. Just putting up something for deletion in order to skip a discussion with people who have an interest and a competent opinion on the subject is abusive. You are living proof that this kind of abuse works perfectly. <i>it's just a userbox</i> - if it just a userbox, why vote (you could not possibly have missed that it is part of a larger project). You were obviously voting for the fun of destruction. You don't care. To you its just the fun of disrupting other users.

Regarding your quote from TfD, please explain in what way en-5 is part of the functioning of a policy or guideline. Also please explain where "the discussion for that guideline is taking place".

<li>EldKatt - unbelievable. Just read the page you are complaining about. Claiming here you took a look and you obviously didn't does nothing to give you credibility. (Profilaes was obviously lying about their being no translation on WP. He claimed he did not know there were translations on Wikipedia and that was obviously a lie. He has a link to the translations on his userpage. You'd have to be a mindless idiot to believe he is not lying.)</li>
<li>I posted the quote from TfD which says the TfD for a Babel-template is abusive (wsn't my idea, I did not write that). You fail to read that. Now let me have a good laugh and tell us all again how serious you are and how much you are acting in good faith. Deleted proposals by the way are not being rediscussed or something. They are speedily deleted. I don't know how long you have been here.

<dd>Half the people with "En-5" have massive, glaring spelling and grammatical errors all over their userpages, that no true professional writer would make or leave up. Is it OK if I just unilaterally remove their claim to be a "professional"? En-5 is fundamentally broken because it makes a rather pretentious claim that nobody can verify. A 12-year-old kid can slap "professional" on his or her userpage. I *am* a professional writer and think it's pathetic as hell for people to splash it on their page "omg hai im professional LOLL!!" <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 05:19, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Fist of all: those are their userpages - they can do just about anything on them if they like. You are a native speaker making fun of non-natives - no comment on that. Also, if you are a professional writer you probably know that professional writers almost always have copyeditors to correct their spelling mistakes for them. A professional writer (other than a copyeditor) is good at other things: style issues, sentence building, text structuring, keeping the readers attention, judging what to include in a text and researching.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 08:17, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Correction. I'm a native speaker and professional writer making fun of people who are non-native speakers who CLAIM TO BE PROFESSIONALLY PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH! If you make a false claim, expect to get ripped for it, sorry but that's life. If you don't want to be judged on a professional level, don't pretend to be a professional. Someone who can't spell "societies" is hardly a professional writer. You've also just proved my point, that the userbox in question is utterly worthless because it doesn't tell us anything about the person other than that they've slapped something they like on their user page. It's pure 100 percent vanity. I've edited the box in question to more correctly explain the situation. To do otherwise is to lie to our readers. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 11:14, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would be amazed if you had ever learned a language. I think what you are saying is a result of your complete lack of knowledge of what you are talking about. At that stage (level 5), I'd assume a second-language-student to pick up native mistakes, such as misspelling a plural on y(I assume it was misspelt societys). And as I said, professional "writer" does not mean good spelling abilities. It means you can write, not spell. 'Professionally proficient' is a term used in <a href="../../../i/l/r/ILR_scale_d82b.html" title="ILR scale">ILR scale</a>, as I have said several times. There is an explanation of what it means in our article and it does not mean what you are saying. You are jumping to conlusions, see <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_distortion.html" title="Cognitive distortion">cognitive distortion</a>. A user with this template will most likely not try to tell a native speaker that he is better at English. To me that is completely absurd.I believe that the concept behind 'native' is an entirely different one, it implies a certain level of cultural knowledge that a non-native can't achieve.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 13:09, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>If someone can't use good grammar and spelling skills, they're not really a good professional writer. Hate to break it to you, but that's just the truth. I'm not interested in the "who is what" and your accusation of "nativism" is absurd. I'm saying that a userbox which claims that someone is a professional is entirely useless because it tells us NOTHING. Someone with a "professional" userbox might be a 10-year-old kid, for all we know. It's misleading and pointless. You're jumping all around these psych buzzwords. If you want a fifth level, such as ""This user contributes with a natively-proficient level of English," that would seem supportable. But to slap "professional" on a userbox implies something that is clearly flat-out false in several cases. I'm a professional writer and I would never be pretentious enough to put a box claiming I was such on my userpage. Our babel categories don't line up with the ILR, so who cares what it says? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 18:30, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're obviously not clear that the userbox is not being *used* in that manner, because that is not the common meaning of "professional level of English" outside the State Department.

<li>Well here we go again in circles. The wording could have been changed. It would have been a good idea (and the rule) to have a concept first (clarifying levels) and discuss a proposal instead of a drive by shooting for the fun of disrupting other users.

Maybe the xx-5 [or xx+1?] can be the "Versed in Technical Words" or kind of.

<dd>Btw, reading other issues about babel I just saw what could be a flaw: maybe we can put numbers to the knowledge we have on a language, but more than a scale it just define how well are we in that language, therefore, being a native speaker doesn't mean that it's better than a xx-5 level speaker.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What are the Babel levels measuring?</span></h2>
<p>A lot of confusion and some conflict has arisen over the Babel levels, which I believe is in part caused by the different and sometimes conflicting things that the levels are trying to measure. Originally a four-level system of beginner, intermediate, advanced and native, it measured one's proficiency in a language, with the reasonable assumption that a native speaker has mastery of their own native language. The introduction of level 0 (no proficiency in the language) fits well with this classification schema.</p>
<p>However, even before a sixth level, (level 4, "near-native") was introduced, a great deal of confusion ensued, due to the conflict between nativeness (which means you learned it as a child) and proficiency. See, for a start, the first discussion thread on this page. Compounding the confusion was the question: proficiency in what exactly? A lot of suggestions were made: Spoken, as the wording of the templates imply? ("I write well but I'm always picked as non-native by my accent, so I'll put level 3") Written, because that's the mode of language we're using on wikipedia? Spelling? Grammar? Adherence to a particular standard dialect or conventional form? Ability to "argue for or against a legal text or a philosophical thesis"?</p>
<p>The conflict was brought to the fore by the introduction of the "near-native" category, when "proficiency" and nativeness really began to clash (see, for example, <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template_talk%7EUser_en-4_70a8.html" title="Template talk:User en-4">Template talk:User en-4</a>). Clearly, one may have strengths in some of the areas listed above, and weaknesses in others. Many if not most native speakers have poor writing skills, and the written form is where second language learners often excel.</p>
<p>The key to this puzzle may be in the the linguistic concept of <a href="../../../r/e/g/Register_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Register (linguistics)">register</a>. A register is a particluar style of language used in a particular setting, e.g. <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legalese.html" title="Legalese">Legalese</a>. Again, a second language learner may well have better grasp of a particlular register (such as Legalese) than the majority of native speakers do. The register that native speakers tend to be unbeatable in is in fact casual (colloquial) speech, particlarly the casual spoken register of non-university-educated native speakers. No-one is universally proficient in all registers of a language, and this is why the tower of Babel begins to fall down when we start introducing more than three or four levels.</p>
<p>This ever-expanding system is now considering a <i>seventh</i> level (level 5 or "professional writer level"). It looks like the majority sentiment is against it, perhaps because it displaces nativeness from the top of the heirarchy? I would argue that it had already been displaced. I suggest that people with skills in particular registers can have seperate userboxes if they are so inclined, but a one-dimensional numbered system for language proficiency is never going to account for all these different axes if expanded beyond the original four broad levels. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 00:32, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The only really necessary template in the Babel tower is en-0. All others are useless because they say almost nothing about the users proficiency, if there are only three or four levels, and six levels would improve this situation only slightly. This page is full of user comments who have trouble placing themselves in one of the categories. In an Asian language the situation of the learner is completely different because they also need to learn the characters. You named some of the areas that cause problems: registers (talk vs. encyclopedic text), spoken vs written, technical terms.</li>

<dd>AFAIK, xx-1 means you can read xx, but you don't feel able to contribute to an article in xx. xx-2 to xx-4 mean that you can write xx, respectively at a "just sufficient", "decent" and "like an average native" level. xx-N is for being a native speaker (not necessarily it must be the first language you have learned as a children, but at least you are used to use it in all everyday situations). For example, I expect almost all en-N speakers, no matter how illiterate they are, to know what <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepperoni.html" title="Pepperoni">pepperoni</a> is, whereas there are hordes of foreign English learners who, no matter how well they can write in formal English, never learn what pepperoni is, and some of then are even mistaken about that. (<i>Peperoni</i> means "bell peppers" in Italian, and most English-Italian dictionaries lack an entry for <i>pepperoni</i>.). Therefore, if I'm writing in the talkpage of someone who isn't en-N, I'd rather talk about a "pizza with spicy salami" (or about a <i>diavola</i> if they are it-N...) than about a "pizza with pepperoni" if I want to be sure to be understood. Actually (I'm it-N and en-3), a few months ago, when solving a crossword game in English, I was astonished noticing that I did not know the words for many everyday concepts (for example "segment" of an orange), even though I know even very technical words about specific topics. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 15:28, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"...and six levels would improve this situation only slightly."</i> Personally, I believe it would, on the contrary, make it more difficult. I had no trouble deciding any of the Babel levels you can find on my user page. If there were more levels, I might have had more trouble. Fenice states that en-1 to en-N are useless because they say almost nothing about the user's proficiency—what alternatives are there that could say more, though?

<dd>I think the Babel system is helpful as long as the levels are clearly defined on at least one page - no matter how long the definition gets. I've already been asked to translate articles based on my Babel boxes and I was of some help to the person who requested it, so it's not useless. As for how many levels are needed, I don't have a strong position on the issue - either 4 or 5 is fine IMO. However, I do strongly believe that the Native level is completely pointless. The problem with removing it is that most people who use Babel use it and it would create a disaster among users who use Babel. The reason I think native should be deleted is that it's ill-defined and no two users agree exactly on what it means and where it stands compared to xx-3, xx-4, etc. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 21:35, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tend to agree. The original Babel system was nice and simple. There were three levels: 1 = <i>beginner</i>, 2 = <i>intermediate</i> and 3 = <i>advanced</i>. The initial mistake, I believe, was the addition of a separate <i>native</i> level distinct from xx-3. After that, it was more or less inevitable that people would want xx-4, xx-5, xx-6, <i>et cetera</i>. That's because, on one hand, it is only natural to perceive the native level as highest no matter how many other levels there are, yet, on the other hand, there will always be non-native speakers who speak a given language better than most natives. It'd be nice if we could go back to the old 3 level system, but unfortunately I see no way to do that in practice without major confusion, since the deflation has already progressed to the point where xx-2 is now taken to mean "just sufficient" and xx-3 only "decent" skills (see above). Not to mention that every Wikimedia project seems to have different standards, with the number of levels ranging from 3 to 6 or more. I guess the name of this project has turned out to have been rather unfortunately prophetic... —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 00:02, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suspect that the problem that appeared together with xx-N was caused by the involvement of additional factors besides skill. Separating native from non-native serves no purpose in a system concerned with representing the level of <i>skill</i>. <i>Native</i> speakers of a language exist, in practice, at all levels of skill. Categorizing by skill level alone—despite the difficulties involved with registers etc—is quite one-dimensional (and thus less likely to cause confusion) compared to—as we have now—a system taking into account skill level <i>and</i> cultural background (native or not)—or, if you want to count en-5 as well, skill level, cultural background, and also profession. The original Babel system was indeed nice and simple—not because it had three levels as opposed to any other number, but because it took only into consideration only <i>one</i> factor. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 15:36, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMO a "native" level (even not taking the word "native" to mean its strictest sense) is useful for communication in Talk pages: see the pepperoni example above, or even for popular culture reason. For example, if someone is it-N, that means that they live, or have lived long enough, in Italy, and therefore I can reasonably assume that they know what <a href="../../../s/t/r/Striscia_la_Notizia_b986.html" title="Striscia la Notizia">Striscia la Notizia</a> (the most popular Italian TV programme until 2 years ago, and still one of the best known ones) is about, or who <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasco_Rossi_c8c0.html" title="Vasco Rossi">Vasco Rossi</a> (one of the most popular living Italian pop/"rock" songwriter) is, and similar. But if they are not it-N, and I have to talk about those on their talkpage, I would refer to them as "the Italian satyrical news programme Striscia la Notizia" or "the Italian popular "rock" songwriter Vasco Rossi". Similarly, if someone says to be a fan of The Simpsons, and they are it-N, I guess they watch to the Italian dubbed version of it, and they know the Italian names of characters, idioms, etc., maybe unaware that they are different in the originar version. (For example, Wiggum is known as Winchester in the Italian version). Etc. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 21:00, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I certainly see your point; it is not, however, error-proof: an it-N who moved to the U.S. at a reasonably early age is probably not going to consider himself an en-N, yet he will most likely know as much as anyone about American popular culture, as well as have no idea what Striscia la Notizia is. "Native" thus doesn't necessarily tell you anything about a person's knowledge of either language or culture, although in many if not most cases I admit it does. The practical problem for Babel comes when you consider "native" its own level on the skill scale, and that's when people like the fictional Italian above might have doubts. It would perhaps have been better if it were used only in addition to a numerical value—telling people unambiguously how well a user speaks a language, and then, in addition, his native language(s). Helpful though the current system may be, I do think it would be better to use a scale with fewer axes. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 21:23, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(Even the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_language.html" title="First language">first language</a> article agrees that one can be considered a "native speaker" of any language they learned through immersion before puberty.) And if the "early age" is <i>very</i> early, e.g. six years, they probably are no longer fluent in Italian and they probably won't consider themself as it-N... BTW, xx-N used alone means that your knowledge of the language is comparable to that of an xx-4 person, else you should use both xx-N and one of the xx-# levels.

<p>Maybe one solution would be to modify the boxes so that a person can say they are (for example) en-3N. This will solve both the "using more than one characteristic" problem and the "native trumps numbers" problem. We would leave out impossible combinations like xx-0N, and a user with en-3N would be included in Cat:User en, Cat:User en-3, and Cat:User en-N, so no new cats would be necessary. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">Talk</a> 23:19, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The TfD for en-5 was closed as "no consensus". This is the worst possible outcome. If there had been consensus to delete, we would have deleted the template, the category, and the description of the level both on WP:BBL and on the Levels subpage.</p>
<p>If there had been consensus to keep, we would have deleted the word "proposed" from the description and would be creating templates and categories for other languages.</p>
<p>But neither happened. What shall we do now? Keeping the template for English without creating ones for other languages is quite inconsistent...</p>

<li>Nothing to decide, we cannot decide not to keep it, it stays as per TfD. No strategy proposal or anything concerning en-5 could be reasonably created since you cannot build on it, because you cannot create the ones in other languages because de-5 is being deleted. So I don't think you can do anything, anything <i>reasonable</i> except for <b>delete Babel entirely</b>. I think that this event is an important precedent for the viability of this project: There will always be someone who feels that hu-1 is really out of place on Wikipedia for no reason whatsoever. Or someone on tr-2 who feels offended that another person speaks turkish at level three. Just puts it up for deletion. They will get only support votes because no one can read the template anyway. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 16:27, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Fenice, the TfD for de-5 is not closed yet. It's too early to say that it "is being deleted". More importantly, why are you claiming that the whole idea of an xx-5 level would be doomed if de-5 were deleted? Why wouldn't it be possible to undelete it if new policy were made? Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy. Your other doomsday prophecy is also rather unlikely. xx-1 and xx-2 are well established parts of Babel, and have been ever since the start, and would never pass a TfD. This was not the case with en-5, and <i>that</i> is why it was nominated. It has nothing to do with anybody feeling offended. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 16:58, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I challenge you to pull through the experiment and let someone with the necessary credibility put hu-1 up for deletion. It will be deleted.

I'll just suggest a possible rewording for the template: "This user can [confidently/&lt;some other adverb, if you can find a better one&gt;] write and copyedit English text in [formal/encyclopedic] style." The reason why I created the template is so that somebody could show they are able to, and would be glad to help to, copyedit or rewrite text. E.g. "The paragraph about foo in the bar article is obscure, but I can't find how to rewrite it in a more fluid manner. As you're en-5, could you help?" or "The article on the Japanese wikipedia about [some very technical topic about something related with Japanese culture] is very good, but I can't decently translate it in English. Since you're ja-N and en-5, could you help?". I am leaving the discussion now. I better spend my time in better ways.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Distinction active/passive oral/written</span></h2>
<p>I think there should be four sets of Babel boxes for each language, to make a distinction between being able to understand, speak, read, and write a particular language. Being a native speaker of <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch.html" title="Dutch">Dutch</a>, I have no problem understanding and reading <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>, and having learnt a reasonable amount of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>, I can to a varying extent also read other <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_languages.html" title="Turkic languages">Turkic languages</a>. However, I could most likely not write a single sentence in those languages without making grammatical errors. --<b><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a></b> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 21:51, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand and I believe that this is a common phenomenon, also when you haven't spoken a language for twenty years you may understand everything but can't say a straight sentence any more. This would be like a level tr-2a or Af-3a. I'd need a it-3a for myself I believe.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 08:08, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As for written language, whereas it is well possible that you can read a language but you can't write in it (e.g. I can read Spanish, but in order to write it I'd need to look every other word on a bilingual dictionary and have a reference grammar at hand), whence level xx-1, but the converse is almost impossible, if you can write a language you're supposed to be able to read it as well. As for spoken language, I agree that listening and speaking are different skills (for example, until about three years ago I could speak English with more ease than I could understand it, but for Neapolitan the situation was, and still is, quite the reverse), but I can't see their usefulness, since you won't probably use spoken language on WP. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 20:08, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>True, the use for oral language skills is limited om WP. But the distinction between being able to read and write is still useful, I think, especially when it comes to translating from or to a certain language. --<b><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a></b> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 17:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For people able to read a language but not to write in it there already is xx-1 level. The converse is almost impossible. (The only example I can think of someone able to write but not to read is someone who knows <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> but almost no <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanji.html" title="Kanji">kanji</a> and therefore could write whatever they want (provided they know spoken Japanese) in kana, but would have serious troubles in reading text containing kanji. However this is so unrealistic that I believe the number of people to whom this (or similar situations) applies is so small that creating templates for this would be pratically useless.) --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 20:33, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that having a plethora of boxes to identify levels in all language skills is highly non-useful. The scale as it is now gives a sort of average of the skills and is fairly understandable. If someone can read at xx-4 but only speaks, listens, and writes at xx-1, they should be about an xx-2 at best, I'd say, particularly since contribution is what this is really about.

I failed to notice that the text to which I reverted stated that the TfD is under discussion. The point of my revert was merely to avoid stating, essentially, that "xx-5 is okay and a standard part of Babel, but inexplicably not for German". The text should of course be altered appropriately now that the TfD is closed, and I hope (but doubt) that you will forgive me for this mistake. I will, however, leave it up to you to remove your vandalism, because I lack the time, patience and energy to deal with you for now. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 19:12, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the "native"/"near-native" issue, please specify what you are talking about. As for formal written language, it is well possible that a foreigner can write it much better than most natives. As for everyday language, including colloquialisms and slang tied to popular culture, and subtle pronunciation features such as shit/sheet, it is very difficult to master it without living in a country speaking that language. I dare anybody who hasn't lived in an English speaking country for at least a year to watch a film such as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Pie_5f6b.html" title="American Pie">American Pie</a> in the original version and thoroughly understand it with ease. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 20:23, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Repeating my suggestion here, to avoid attention being deflected from it: To deal with the offensive wording on level 5: I suggest switching near native to 5, and name the fourth level 'working fluency' or 'fluency'.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 17:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with calling xx-4 "fluent", but not with calling xx-5 "near-native". I think the people who make the "near-native" level really meant "fluent". "Near-native" propagates the misconception that native speakers always speak the language better than non-native speakers. See above for my related suggestions on xx-N issues. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">Talk</a> 23:27, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could we make it so that people who use a language level 0 template (eg. {{User en-0}}) not be included in the category of that languages speakers, (ie. Category:User en) ..?</p>
<p>Currently, using any language level 0 userbox places that user into the category Category:User xx-0 (xx of course being the language in question) BUT that category is in all cases a subcategory of Category:User xx - ie. the users who speak that language.</p>
<p>Sorry if I'm being really unclear here, but wouldn't it make more sense for the users who use language level-0 userboxes not to be included in the category of users who speak that language?</p>
<p>In other words, make it so that (for example) Category:User fr-0 is not a subcategory of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_fr_fff4.html" title="Category:User fr">Category:User fr</a> - I'm sure that would make it easier for people who want to use the Babel project to find a translator for a page, etc.</p>

<dd>I disagree with this proposal as stated, but agree with its spirit. fr-0 and other xx-0 templates should remain as subcategories of Cat:User xx, because they are related to ability or lack of ability with the language. However, users who are included in a subcategory are not necessarily included in the general category that contains it, and I think that should be the case here. Template:User fr-0 should include the user only in Cat:User fr-0, since Cat:User fr should be a list of all speakers of French at any level, not non-speakers. All other levels, however, should include the user in both. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">Talk</a> 23:32, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Babel boxen proposed level for students: xx-S</span></h2>
<p><i>The babel level description list with the proposed level included:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>xx-0</b> if you don't understand the language at all. Don't use it for <i>every</i> language you don't know; only when there is some reason why you might be expected to know it.</li>
<li><font color="red"><b>xx-S</b> if you are a student of the language who is actively making effort to reach a basic understanding of the language.</font></li>
<li><b>xx-1</b> for basic ability - enough to understand written material or simple questions in this language.</li>
<li><b>xx-2</b> for intermediate ability - enough for editing or discussions.</li>
<li><b>xx-3</b> for advanced level - though you can write in this language with no problem, some small errors might occur.</li>
<li><b>xx-4</b> for 'near-native' level - although it's not your first language from birth, your ability is something like that of a native speaker.</li>
<li><b>xx</b> (no dash or number) is to indicate that you are a "native speaker" who has grown up speaking this language.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Why a new level?</b></i> Because there is a <b>significant gap</b> between <i>no knowledge at all</i> (and presumably not even a desire to know) and a <i>basic level of knowledge</i> such that someone can read and possibly even communicate in the language. For example, I love Icelandic and am making a free-time effort to learn it, but I can't claim "basic knowledge" of it, but neither do I know "nothing at all" and don't wish to claim absolutely no knowledge. Hence the need for a level between the two. I propose "xx-S" (referring to student) so that the existing boxes don't have to be changed to accomodate the new level.<br />

<dd>Nowadays, you can have userboxes to proclaim darn near anything about yourself, so that part's not a problem. But, should it be specifically part of the Babel system, which is still primarily to identify how much use you would be at contributing or translating articles in a given language? That's a different question... <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 22:25, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, "contributing or translating articles" is a good reason for the Babel system as a whole. However, it is still necessary to have a Babel system that allows everyone to fairly accurately describe their Babel situation, <b>so they can be honest about their language proficiencies</b>. Remembering the example in my proposal, why would you have me choose between dishonestly claiming either "no knowledge at all" or "basic knowledge" of Icelandic such that I can read it and converse a little? Neither is true. The truth is I'm a student of the language, somewhere between these two categories. Moreover, I can envision a situation where this knowledge could be useful to someone else. At minimum it voices a desire to learn and interest in the language. &#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title="IS"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="IS" width="25" height="18" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a>&#160;<font color="#B53C07"><b>Guðsþegn</b></font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_518d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Guðsþegn">C</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a></small>&#160;– 05:14, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually there isn't such a large gap between xx-0 and xx-1. Xx-1 (see <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_Levels_511f.html" title="Wikipedia:Babel/Levels">Wikipedia:Babel/Levels</a>) means that you know little of the language, and are neither able to fully understand articles nor contribute to them. It's pretty much the most basic level of understanding, generally equivalent to a beginning student (or intermediate for some languages). I don't think an xx-S template would help because it's very ambiguous (the xx-N template has the same amount of ambiguity and look what a controversy it has caused). -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 12:39, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I support a level between 0 and 1, and "S" seems the best suggestion, or alternatively "B" for "Beginner". I was trying to decide what Babel boxes I can use in good faith (besides en-N), and while I can probably honestly assert fr-1 and es-1, I have studied Japanese, Russian, and Hebrew at a beginner level. There is a good alternative for my Russian ability, which is cyr-1, that is, ability to recognize the Cyrillic alphabet and match it to my very basic Russian vocabulary.

<dd>I think that adding an xx-S or xx-B level is totally unnecessary, and creating a userbox to support it is going *way* overboard. If you are a student learning the language who has enough proficiency to contribute in that language, you are xx-1+. If you do not have enough proficiency to contribute in that language, you are xx-0. This is a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean.html" title="Boolean">boolean</a> question, not a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuum.html" title="Continuum">continuum</a> like the other numbers.

<dd>Personally I quite like this idea- there is a significant difference between learning a language outside of the classroom and learning it in one. I would enjoy it if multiple versions of xx-S were developed to represent different levels of those who (unfortunately) are far more attuned to 'book' versions of the language in question versus being exposed to it piece-by-piece in the real world. --<a href="../../../s/y/h/User%7ESyhususi_9a4c.html" title="User:Syhususi">Syhususi</a> 00:58, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I rather like this idea as well, not so much for its specific parameters (students learning a language) than having something in between not being able to speak a language at all (xx-0) and being able to communicate at a basic level- and, more importantly, contribute to articles in- a language (xx-1). I have a personal example of this: I can <i>speak</i> French at a very basic level, thanks to having three years of French class thrust upon me simply because of my Canadian citizenship. However, I don't believe I can contribute to articles in French (I can barely <i>understand</i> written French). It would be nice to have a Babel box stating some elementary amount of knowledge but little or no ability to contribute to articles, rather than the misleading 'no knowledge at all' (which might not be the intended meaning, but it's what many people assume) userbox. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameoAppearance_b323.html" title="User:CameoAppearance">CameoAppearance</a> 10:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have nothing against an extra level of Babel box between xx-0 and xx-1, but xx-s is too ambiguous. How about xx-½?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point of xx-s is showing that you're <i>learning</i> (doing progress) in xx, not just that your knowledge is between xx-0 and xx-1. For example, I can greet, thank, count, and make basic sentences in Japanese, I can read hiragana, katakana and some kanji, but I haven't been studying Japanese for two years, so I'm not making any progress (I'm forgetting that little I used to know, indeed). So I might be ja-1/2 but definitely am not ja-S. (Anyway, IMO, xx-S is not very useful, you'd better just wait, and then use xx-1 when you can understand articles written in xx just enough to use them as sources for writing in your language.)--<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 19:56, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon languages already have Babel boxes, but manuscripts in those languages (not to mention modern textbooks!) usually transcribe them in the Latin alphabet. Some people with advanced knowledge of the vocabulary and grammar still can't decipher English or Scandinavian runic inscriptions: believe it or not, I once studied Anglo-Saxon under a professor who couldn't tell one stave from another unless it looked like a Roman letter. (If runic-script userboxes existed, that would be the level-0 description. &lt;vbg&gt;)</li>
<li>Writing systems developed as part of a fictional world (such as Tolkien's <i>tengwar</i> and <i>cirth)</i> would not count; I'm using the word "<a href="../../../r/u/n/Rune.html" title="Rune">rune</a>" in its strictest sense here. The only map on which Tolkien used bona-fide Germanic runes is the dwarven map appearing in <i>The Hobbit:</i> he wrote short clues about two important locations, transcribing Modern English with the Anglo-Saxon futhorc. What does all this have to do with userboxes? A user who's just barely learned to decipher one inscription would earn a level-1 rating <i>at best.</i></li>

On the other hand, mildly careful wording of the text of the userbox should suffice to eliminate that, so with those caveats....  –<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EAponar_Kestrel_f91e.html" title="User:Aponar Kestrel">Aponar Kestrel</a> <a href="../../../a/p/o/User_talk%7EAponar_Kestrel_5a6f.html" title="User talk:Aponar Kestrel">(talk)</a> 14:11, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If a similar-sized text were written in runes, though, I'd need to spend days before I figured it out. (The Norsemen had reduced their runic alphabet from 24 to 16 letters, which led to some confusing spelling rules...) <a href="../../../i/s/n/User%7EISNorden_b2b8.html" title="User:ISNorden">ISNorden</a> 18:19, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would say (though I don't know) that British English and American English are more distinct than Canadian English is, but they do not have individual Babelboxes last time I checked, nor should they. If they don't, neither should Canadian English.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Natural Languages" Section Rename</span></h2>
<p>I propose a rename of the "Natural Languages" section of this page, and move the languages listed under the "language related pages" part to this section. The "Natural Languages" part would then be renamed "List of languages on Wikipedia". THe natural languages section already has one artificial language, esperanto, on it, and it would seem fair that the others (pig latin, Quenya) be placed there as well.</p>
<p>So in the "language related pages" section, would be the writing systems (e.g. cyrillic) and things like IPA and such.</p>

<li>This is the English version of Wikipedia so we expect users to communicate and find information in English. To me, this includes information about other users, as each language version of Wikipedia has its own set of user accounts.</li>
<li>If I need help translating, validating or finding information in a different language to improve articles in the English Wikipedia, I would try to find someone with preferably native skills in that language and good skills in English. Though I can guess what the Babel boxes mean or simply search the categories, it would be even easier if the Babel boxes themselves were in English.</li>

<p>I'm neutral on this. On the one hand, it is indeed confusing sometimes for users in English Wikipedia what language the template talks about, but on the other it's helpful to have the templates in non-English for users who don't participate in English Wikipedia much to request translations. I support JeffBurdges's idea of using the English name of the language in brackets. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 19:04, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm against changing it. It's clear enough from the ISO codes which language it is, even if you can't recognize it from the text itself, and I see no good reason to change it. Lots of work... And having an English word in a foreign text just looks horrible to my eyes, especially if the language in question is one with a foreign script. Just leave it as it is, this is a solution in search of a problem. —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_esperanza_7d46.html" title="User:Nightstallion/esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> 20:29, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only convincing reason I've heard so far for <i>not</i> translating all Babel boxes into English is that it's too much work, and I won't argue against that. I don't quite understand how keeping the original languages will assist in translation. I mean, if we want someone to translate a piece of text into English, they must already understand some basic English, right? I'm not saying that we must start right away translating all boxes, but it could be a goal for a future version of English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintran_9423.html" title="User:Wintran">Wintran</a> 01:14, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We ran into the same thing on . Our solution was to leave the text in the native language (so that people who know the language can read it) but to change the symbol to the English name of the language (keeping the appropriate number), since the symbols aren't very useful for language identification without looking them up, but we did keep the symbols as part of the template and category names. That makes it obvious to everyone, whether they speak English or not. What works or is accepted there may not work or be accepted here, of course, but I like it better than mixing the languages in the text of the boxes. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">Talk</a> 00:22, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems more logical to me if languages from right to left (like Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Urdu and Yiddish) to have reverse userboxes. There are other languages that are normally written from right to left but the userboxes are written in English. Examples of my suggestion are on the right.

<dd>There aren't any, because it's not very useful. (I assume you know some dialect of Chinese?) Hanja aren't much used anymore, and you can legitimately claim native fluency in Korean without really understanding them. It's therefore useful to have a separate box for it, because it <i>does</i> convey additional information. However, just knowing hànzì doesn't actually help as much as most people think with reading Japanese. (<a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_drift.html" title="Semantic drift">Semantic drift</a> and all.) If you can read hangul and simple phrases, you might want to put yourself down as ko-1; if you're actually familiar with the differences between Chinese and Korean uses of the characters, you should add a ko-han box. However, if – as you imply by omission – you can't read kana and don't know any of the grammar of Japanese, you're effectively ja-0. (And this goes both ways: someone could be jp-N but zh-0.) --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EAponar_Kestrel_f91e.html" title="User:Aponar Kestrel">Aponar Kestrel</a> <a href="../../../a/p/o/User_talk%7EAponar_Kestrel_5a6f.html" title="User talk:Aponar Kestrel">(talk)</a> 01:49, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Prototype replacement system for your perusal</span></h2>
<p>I have begun development of a replacement for the current system of Babel boxes, which can be found <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_Babel_prototypes_9bee.html" title="User:Phil Boswell/Babel prototypes">here</a>, which I started as a result of the controversy over userboxes: I felt that if some separation could be made between Babel boxes and other userboxes they would be less likely to face summary deletion.</p>
<p>The system uses two levels of template: one for the box and another for the individual languages. The former will only display those language codes it is coded to understand; the latter encapsulate all available levels of expertise within a single template. Obviously this framework could be adapted to cover other community-approved types of box also, possibly something to show which WikiProjects a user belonged to. Please feel free to comment on the discussion pages as appropriate: please (pretty please!) don't fiddle with the code unless you see something egregiously wrong because it's still under development and I tend to have them open for editing for long periods (so it would be better to drop me a line…).

<p>I've been fiddling with this all afternoon, but It doesn't seem to be working as well as I had liked. Does anyone more technically minded know how to try to possibly reduce size or hyperlink properly? Honestly, is this a lost cause? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 19:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Level 5 deletions</span></h2>
<p>I am disappointed to hear that the xx-5 userboxes are now restricted to English, French, and Spanish. That decision is both unfair and misleading, in my opinion: To use two examples which I personally don't speak, Mandarin Chinese and Hindi have <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languages_by_number_of_speakers.html" title="Languages by number of speakers">more speakers</a> than English, Spanish or French. There are probably several American users here who have learned Chinese well enough to translate technical or culture-specific articles: should they have to choose between understating their ability or coding their own userboxes?</p>
<p>Judging by the inter-Wiki <a href="../../../t/i/e/WP%7ETIE_be39.html" title="WP:TIE">translation projects</a> that I've read about, even professional fluency in a less prominent language is useful enough to mention on a userpage. Many of my former teachers have described my fluency in Swedish, Danish and Norwegian as suitable for professional writing; would this justify a level-5 rating if I had been equally fluent in French or Spanish? <a href="../../../i/s/n/User%7EISNorden_b2b8.html" title="User:ISNorden">ISNorden</a> 00:39, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
