	    <p>If a native speaker of xx moved into a yy-country as an adult only recently, she probably won't consider herself to be a native yy-speaker. Therefore, she would opt for xx. However, the definition seems to demand daily use of xx, maybe even exclusive use. What about changing 'users who employ' to 'users who are able to employ'?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I personally don't object to this, but it's probably best to bring it up on Wikipedia talk:Babel, because we had several long discussion about the relevancy and definition of the native level there. As I said a million times in the past, IMO it should be removed entirely. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 18:26, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it makes perfect sense. For example, someone may contribute to articles on the history and development of Esperanto but not know any Esperanto. Similarly, someone may have hundreds of edits on a Wikipedia which they don't know the language of - I saw a user once who had over 3,000 edits on interwiki links alone (checking the edit count for example does not make this immediately obvious). -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 02:59, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or a user may have attempted to learn a language and forgotten it, but would still be able to understand a few phrases.

<p>It seems unforunate to me that our language levels do not map well (or do they) to more traditional rankings of language ability, such as for example <a href="http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/mangngyrlngglrnngprgrm/CorrespondenceOfProficiencySca.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/mangngyrlngglrnngprgrm/CorrespondenceOfProficiencySca.htm" rel="nofollow">the ILR or ACTFL scales</a>.</p>
<p>I list myself as de-1, which I think is fair enough, given that I am not de-0. I have done more than dabble, I actively study daily, and I have moved beyond the very very basics into, I suppose, the basics. I do not understand German well enough to use German Wikipedia articles as a source for English articles -- my vocabulary is primarily conversational, due to the nature of the audio courses that I use for learning. So therefore I seem to be overstating myself as de-1. On the other hand, de-2 says that I can coherently translate most articles by using a dictionary. So perhaps I am understanding, since I could actually do that I think. ("coherently" at least, though not "easily" or "perfectly").</p>
<p>It is probably much to late to do anything about this, but I wish we had instead standardized on something like <a href="http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/OtherResources/ACTFLProficiencyGuidelines/TheACTFLGuidelines.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/OtherResources/ACTFLProficiencyGuidelines/TheACTFLGuidelines.htm" rel="nofollow">the ACTFL scales</a>--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 19:05, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that our Babel leveling system is not perfect and there have been quite a few discussions about it under <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EBabel_adb3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Babel">Wikipedia talk:Babel</a>. Unfortunately, no meaningful changes have been made as a result of the discussions, except this very page (separated from main to give more insight on the levels' meanings), and a new level (xx-5), which is for professional users of languages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's impossible to change the Babel system to be based on an existing one, but the problem with ACTFL specifically is that it mostly refers to conversational proficiency rather than written. Written proficiency (especially in the context of Wikipedia) is in many ways different, especially because it nearly negates the importance of being a native speaker, and does not require things like 'survival needs and social demands' (which the ACTFL scale is largely based on). A user who can correctly translate written text from one language to another is more helpful for the Wikipedia translation project (and thus, IMO, should be 'higher on the scale') that someone who can speak the language (possibly even fluently) but has trouble translating.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your personal example however does pose certain questions and maybe other users will think of a way to 'fix' the Babel levels. Right now I'm out of good ideas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, thanks for commenting on this issue. The fact that you took the time to do it places more importance on this subject and may hopefully attract users who were previously apathetic.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EBabel_Levels_be96.html" title="Edit section: Sizeable vocabulary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sizeable vocabulary</span></h2>
<p>What would be considered "sizeable vocabulary" (written here as <i>sizable</i>), as used in <b>xx-2</b>? It's pretty vague. So, its definition would greatly vary from person to person (I can imagine that it would mean 500 words for one person, yet some 3000 to 4000 for the other). It seems to me that an approximate value for <i>sizeable</i> would be quite useful.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the consensus is that for xx-2 a user must know enough words to converse and write without much trouble (as far as vocabulary goes - they may have trouble with fluency and actual understanding of the language). This does not mean they must know enough words to read the Encyclopaedia Britannica easily. I guess the description should reflect this. Why don't you suggest something? Or better, edit the article yourself? Also, it may be a good idea to sign your name with 4 tildes (~). On a side note, <i>sizable</i> is a proper spelling, as is <i>sizeable</i>. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 10:20, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I usually sign it (--<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorisvS_42cb.html" title="User:JorisvS">JorisvS</a> 10:34, 21 June 2006 (UTC)). I must have forgotten it, sorry. I know about "sizeable - sizable", it was just a comment meaning little.<br />
"Know enough words to converse and write without much trouble", that's the problem: I will not be able to <b>truly</b> converse (without much trouble) until I know thousands of words and until I'm certain about most of the grammar <i>(which sounds as a xx-3 to me)</i>, while I will be able to understand written text easily (and also write pretty confidently) long before that <i>(like the xx-2 definition)</i>. This while many people will just go and talk without much grammatical sense to the point that they will barely be understood. In such cases, I will probably keep my mouth shut until I have figured out the best way to tell it. This takes time and would lead to spoken fragments, not a conversation. However, when I'm excited I don't care and somehow will be able to say a lot (that even won't that bad grammatically), even for say my Greek: <i>el-1</i>.<br />
An example: I rated my Spanish as es-3 (3.0 at present). And although I know enough (by far) words to converse, I will not yet say much easily. Moreover I have knowledge of some of the grammar that many people learning Spanish will probably never see or learn, though I would still make a small mistake here and there. I can also make an accent that sounds pretty Spanish, but will lose it trying to converse with other people.<br />
<b>Where would this leave me with the definitions?<br /></b> This proves my point: there is way too much subjectivity in the definition. If I were to adapt the definition, it would probably be an upper estimate, as I rather want to do something right (or not) than wrong.<br />
