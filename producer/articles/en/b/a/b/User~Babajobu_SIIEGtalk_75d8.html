<p>Don't know whether ye think this would be an appropriate project for SIIEG, but here's one idea that's occured to me in the past: removing every instance of the POV supernatural honorific "The Prophet" from before <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>'s name. It's totally inappropriate for an encyclopedia. I hesitated to begin doing this because I foresaw wars and difficulties in distinguishing NPOV titles from POV honorifics, and integral parts of names from tacked-on honorifics. Jesus "Christ" is as unacceptable to me as "The Prophet"...but what about "Lord" Krishna? These sorts of issues would have to be thought out in advance. I worked on the article about Sudanese Muslim theologian <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Mohamed_Taha_76b0.html" title="Mahmoud Mohamed Taha">Mahmoud Mohamed Taha</a>, and removed every one of about twenty instances of the honorific "Ustadh" (equalling something like "wise one") and the original contributor was amiable and agreeable to this, and the article much more appropriately now just refers to him by his name. But I think removing all the legion instances of "The Prophet" would incite some serious rancor, and we'd need to have all our conceptual ducks in a row before giving it a crack. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 13:33, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I hear what you are saying Babajubo, but frankly I can't really see how such efforts should fit with the purpose of this project, which is to: "<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutralize</a> the apologetic content of Wikipedia Islam related articles, most of which are dominanted by the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_movements_within_Islam_48bd.html" title="Liberal movements within Islam">liberal Muslim</a> minority <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>, by reporting the facts on file about traditional, mainstream Muslim beliefs." What this is about (that is my understanding) is to work against the systemic liberal bias in articles regarding Islam, introduced by Western Muslims/converts, that are more likely to hold a liberal POV than mainstream Muslims living in Islamic countries. Something that on the other hand might fit the project, is to take another look at the '<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a>' article, where historical background and justifications of conservative political Islam, has recently been deleted, by someone with an apparent liberal anti-<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">islamist</a> view of the islamic religion. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 15:49, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you're right, I was being a little fuzzy-headed. I was thinking about mitigating "Islam is true" POV, but that's quite a different matter (if in some ways related) from restoring balance to articles characterized by liberal apologetics (and distortions) on behalf of Islam. So this project is more about dealing with "Islam is peace" than "Islam is true". <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 15:59, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that referring to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> as "the Prophet" is rather inappropriate for an encylopedia article. Simply referring to "the prophet" is ambigious even in religious Muslim discourse, since there are many prophets in Islamic theology - Muslims would write "the Prophet Muhammad" in order to differentiate between Muhammad and other Islamic prophets. I think that such a matter falls into mission of SIIEG, because it is a question of Muslim religious bias versus a secular (i.e. non-religious) view of Islam and its founder. SIIEG should protect the secular perspective towards Islam, so that does include neutralizing the "Islam is true" POV (the "Islam is true" bias is an example of apologetics, in my opinion). So, should Muhammad be referred to as "<a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>" on Wikipedia, or as "the Prophet," or as "the Prophet Muhammad," or perhaps "the Final Prophet of Allah?" I think the answer to that is clear, the encylopediac and NPOV approach is to refer to him as "<a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>." I usually <i>do</i> replace "the Prophet" with "Muhammad" whenever I catch such an occurance, while editing, but I've never done a wide-scale changing of all such occurances. To see what kind of response such wide-scaling changing might solicit, I have removed all occurances of "the prophet" from the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> article as an experiment. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 00:49, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do you think about the initial reference to Muhammad in an article? Is plain "Muhammad" specific enough? Could someone credibly claim that referring to him as The Prophet Muhammad helps remove ambiguity? I ask because I'm looking over instances of "The Prophet Muhammad" and many of them are in stubs, and are the only reference to Muhammad. I still think, even in the first reference, it needs to be NPOVd. I changed a couple first references from "The Prophet Muhammad"s to "the Islamic prophet Muhammad". Do you think that works? Incidentally, I also don't want to ride roughshod over Karl Maeir's contention that this should be about removing the spirit of "Islam is peace" rather than "Islam is true" from articles. If he thinks this is inappropriate, then I'm happy to regard this as an effort external to SIEEG, and continue these conversations on User pages, rather than here. What do you think, Mr. Maier? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 12:30, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about "Muhammad ibn Abd Allah?" Generally speaking, when it comes to disambiguating the names of humans, we use full names (i.e., first name and family name). Muhammad's full name is Muhammad ibn Abd Allah. Too obscure? How about "Muhammad the alleged prophet?" LOL - too hostile? How about "Muhammad, the founder of Islam?" Or how about "Muhammad, prophet of Islam?" Personally, I don't think disambiguation is ever needed in the case of "Muhammad," just as disambiguation is never needed in the case of "Jesus" or "Abraham." No one goes around saying "the Prophet Abraham" (except maybe Muslims). I think the use of the word "prophet" is highly contentious. Different religions have different defintions of what a "prophet" is and does. Judaism and Islam, for example, have completely different understandings on what "prophet" means. "Prophet" is not even an Arabic word, is it an English word that Muslims have just gotten used to using without giving it a second thought - it is a very poor translation of what Muslims REALLY call Muhammad: he is called "Rasool Allah," meaning "Messenger of Allah." In addition to referring to Muhammad as "Rasool Allah," Muslims also refer to him as a "Nabi" (meaning reciepient of the divine message). No where here does the word "prophet" come up, except in the imaginations of Muslim and non-Muslim anglophones. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 01:14, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whether or not an initial reference to Muhammad should include something like "the Islamic Prophet", of course depends much on the context and the subject of the article. Sometimes it might be specific enough to use "Muhammad" only and sometimes not. However I did take a look at what you've been doing so far, and personally I like what I see. I also think your changes of "<i>the Prophet</i>" to "<i>the Islamic Prophet</i>" makes a lot of sense indeed. To say that Muhammad was Prophet is of course Islamic PoV, but to say that he was an <i>Islamic Prophet</i> (in an Islamic context) is a fact and NPoV. I actually think might join your efforts regarding all this tomorrow, when I got some time for it. And regarding making these efforts a part of this project, I think you might be right anyway. After all the name of the project is "the <b>Secular</b> Islamic Information Editors' Guild." -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 17:42, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Changed a couple of others, including <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madeeh.html" title="Madeeh">Madeeh</a>, which I changed from "Muhammad, Allah's prophet", to "Muhammad, who in Islam is considered a prophet". Perhaps that needs to be changed to make reference to the fact that he is not just considered "a prophet", but the final prophet. Regardless, I'm starting to think even "Islamic prophet" is problematic, or any other assertion of anyone's prophethood. Probably better to state who considers them a prophet. i.e., Abraham considered a prophet by Jews, Christians and Muslim (rather than "the Jewish prophet" or "Muslim prophet" or "Christian prophet", and Muhammad, considered a prophet (or "the final prophet" or something of that sort) by Muslims. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 19:18, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think "Muhammad, who in Islam is considered a prophet" is a rather long-wided way of saying something that is so obvious that it need not be said. I would recommend simply writing "Muhammad", and if there is any chance of ambiguity, then write "<a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>" (with the Wikipedia article link tags) - in the hyperlink form, there is no chance of ambiguity for the one in a million people who don't know that "Muhammad" refers to Muhammad the famous medieval bedoiun of that name. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 01:19, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Yes, you're right, I'd arrived at the same conclusion, and have started doing it just that way. "Muhammad" in all cases, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> in any case in which ambiguity could conceivably be claimed. I've had my first revert, which rejected "Islamic prophet" on grounds he is also a prophet to Bahai. So I reverted it back with just Muhammad. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:43, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think an article an individual person should include a visual representation of that person. I realize that some people's religious sensibilities will be stirred by this...as is the case for other Wikipedia articles with potentially offensive images, the image of Muhammad should be low in the article.

<p><i>THE attack on the shrine has doubly shocked people within and outside the country, as both Shias and Sunnis venerated it. The attack occurred less than two weeks after a group of 58 religious scholars belonging to different schools of Islamic thought issued a fatwa (edict) against suicide attacks in the country. The fatwa said Islam forbids suicide attacks on Muslims and those committing such acts at places of worship and public congregations cease to be Muslims.</i></p>
<p><i>The government-backed move was a response to a series of suicide attacks in different parts of the country in the past two years. It took weeks of persuasion by the government for the scholars of various schools to agree on the text of the fatwa. Some of the scholars were opposed to such an order on the plea that it would adversely impact on "struggles" in Iraq, Kashmir, Afghanistan and Palestine. So it was agreed that the fatwa would be applicable only to Pakistan, and Kashmir and Palestine were mentioned as examples where such acts could be condoned.</i> <a href="../../../m/u/w/User%7EMuwaffaq_e293.html" title="User:Muwaffaq">Muwaffaq</a> 22:34, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_SIIEGtalk_75d8.html" title="Edit section: Ironic Edit War at Template:Islam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ironic Edit War at <a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIslam_b728.html" title="Template:Islam">Template:Islam</a></span></h2>
<p>There are two sorts of biases being pushed on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIslam_b728.html" title="Template:Islam">Template:Islam</a> through edit warring and bullying. Ironically, the first bias is of an overtly fundamentalist and puritanical character, while the other bias is of an overtly apologetic character.</p>
<p>Overtly fundamentalist and puritanical POV pushing on Wikipedia is very common. Debates often rage over image at articles relating to human anatomy that show the nude form, for example. In the Islam series, this sort of bias was recently exhibited in <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> where some people wanted to include a Persian minature devotional painting of Muhammad while another group was strongly opposed to including the painting because it was "offensive" to some Muslims. Why was is it offensive? Because fundamentalist shariah interpetations prohibit drawing pictures of mammals, especially prophets. Another place where this bias has historically occured is in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIslam_b728.html" title="Template:Islam">Template:Islam</a>, where the debate over the cresent moon symbol has been raging for quite some time and is has recently become active again after a long period of suppressing the symbol. The cresent moon is, of course, the universally recognized symbol of Islam; over a dozen Muslim countries include their symbol in their flags, and the symbol appears at the holy mosque of the Kabba in Mecca. But certain fundamentalists who are opposed to <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bidah.html" title="Bidah">bidah</a> (any sort of innovation or change "in Islam") do not like this cresent moon symbol. The <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salafi.html" title="Salafi">Salafis</a> were particularly famous for their opposition to this symbol - the salafis destroyed all cresent moon symbols in Mecca and Medina and also destroyed and flattened to the ground Muhammad's tomb in Medina, due to the Islamic regulation requiring unmarked graves. It might be true that the cresent moon was not used in early Islamic or pre-Islamic times and is some sort of new invention that maybe the Ottomans introduced (though I've yet to see someone source this), but is Wikipedia going to delete important and relevant content just because it is considered "bidah" in Islam and some puritans have historically gone around destroying cresent symbols on mosques? This little moon symbol might seem a trivial issue, but I think it raises some interesting questions about Wikipedia and the direction it will take.</p>
<p>The second bias being pushed in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIslam_b728.html" title="Template:Islam">Template:Islam</a> is to remove the <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a> link from the "Fundamental Principals" section of the template. The "Fundamental Principals" section was originally called "the Five Pillars of Islam" and "Jihad" was included with a note that Jihad is sometimes called the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_pillar_of_Islam_eb5a.html" title="Sixth pillar of Islam">Sixth pillar of Islam</a>. Then it was pointed out that Shiah Muslims don't believe in the whole "five pillars" thing, so "Fundamental Principals" would be more neutral. Military obligations are obviously an important part of Islam, and large portions of the Qur'an dwell on the subject of Jihad, and Jihad is considered the greatest deed in Islam. Dr. <a href="../../../a/z/z/Azzam.html" title="Azzam">Azzam</a> wrote a fatwa titled "Jihad: the first obligation after faith." The apologists would rather that people just not read or think about Jihad, because the whole topic puts Islam in a dim light from most secular and non-Muslim perspectives. So some users are edit warring to remove the Jihad link (this is also a recurring edit war on the template). --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 15:46, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As you might have noticed, <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a> is trying to delete SIIEG. I invited Striver to join SIIEG (and still hope that he does) because Striver is quite knowledgable about Shiah beliefs; in particular, Shiahs have a lot of critical information and opinions about certain companions of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>. Striver did not take up the invitiation, but decided to imitate the SIIEG idea by starting a number of new "guild" Wikiprojects:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that the paranoid conspiracy theory "guilds" drew the ire of a number of editors, and are well into the process of deletion. In response to this, Striver has put up SIIEG for deletion. I don't think we really have anything to do worry about. But those members who inclined to not see SIIEG deleted might eventually have to vote to keep SIIEG. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 04:52, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Real history and evidence needs to be assessed in certain accounts. If the only evidence is in the Koran, it needs to be stated as such. If the evidence is much later, it also needs to be stated (this is the way it is on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> sites). Also, involvement in massacres and wars should be discussed (just as <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a>'s involvement in murder and God's disapproval as stated in the Bible is discussed). For instance, this is terrible history, it looks like pages out of a religious text: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bassorah_85f6.html" title="Battle of Bassorah">Battle of Bassorah</a>.

<dd>Just STOP, dang it. It's one thing to remove "the Prophet Muhammad, PBUH" -- I do that myself. But "the prophet Muhammad", used descriptively, is NOT an endorsement of Islam. When I talk about the Jewish prophets, Amos and Hosea and the like, I'll say "the prophet Amos" without feeling in any way that I'm endorsing his message. Heck, I'd even describe Joseph Smith as "the Mormon prophet" without feeling that I thereby become LDS! As a writer, I want to be able to use descriptives to vary the style. An article in which Muhammad can only be referred to as "Muhammad" or "he" is going to sound terrible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just removing "prophet" from any proximity to "Muhammad" is POV, unless you're going to remove "prophet" from Wikipedia entirely. I think if you tried to do that, you'd be banned in a heartbeat. So use some judgement! It's usually enough to remove the caps and the PBUHs, and alternate between using "Muhammad" and "the prophet". <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:31, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jews and Freemasons controlled war on Iraq, says No 10 adviser By Toby Helm (Filed: 12/09/2005)</p>
<p>Tony Blair decided to wage war on Iraq after coming under the influence of a "sinister" group of Jews and Freemasons, a Muslim barrister who advises the Prime Minister has claimed.</p>
<p>Ahmad Thomson, from the Association of Muslim Lawyers, said Mr Blair was the latest in a long line of politicians to have been influenced by the group which saw the attack on Saddam Hussein as a way to control the Middle East.</p>
<p>A Government spokesman confirmed last night that ministers and officials consulted Mr Thomson on issues concerning Muslims but refused to be drawn on his views. "We talk to a lot of people, including many whose views we do not necessarily agree with," she said.</p>
<p>Mr Thomson said: "Pressure was put on Tony Blair before the invasion. The way it works is that pressure is put on people to arrive at certain decisions. It is part of the Zionist plan and it is shaping events."</p>

When that didn't work, he said that the source I had listed as a reference (from a book by a central figure from the 19th century, who found an Hindu organization with over a million members today), was derogatory and childish, and the author was "completely insane." He also keeps asserting that since Hinduism and Islam are very different, Hindu criticism of Islam is irrelevant.

<p>The article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_economics.html" title="Islamic economics">Islamic economics</a> shouldnt even exist. Islam does not have a theory of economics. A primitive set of illogical prohibitions, based on nothing more than the "God says so" argument, does not amount to a theory of economics. Notably there are no Christian economics or Jewish economics articles even though there is not a single related legal precept in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shariah.html" title="Shariah">shariah</a> that cannot be found in ancient Jewish or Christian laws. To call this "Islamic economics" is a systematic bias. The article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_economics.html" title="Islamic economics">Islamic economics</a> should forward to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_finance.html" title="Islamic finance">Islamic finance</a>. Similarly, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_banking.html" title="Islamic banking">Islamic banking</a> should forward to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_finance.html" title="Islamic finance">Islamic finance</a>, merging both Islamic banking and Islamic economics. There is in fact no economic theory at all, it is only a set of laws about finance (i.e. about what kinds of financial transactions are "<a href="../../../h/a/r/Haram.html" title="Haram">haram</a>").</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a lot of information missing from these two articles (or what should, in fact, be a single article under the heading <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_finance.html" title="Islamic finance">Islamic finance</a>). Specifically, there is no discussion of stock markets, speculation, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_derivatives.html" title="Financial derivatives">financial derivatives</a>, and insurance. Funamentalist Muslim scholars generally hold that all of these manifestly important activities are "haram" (prohibited sin).</p>
<p>For example, in June 2005 the President of Iran declared, "Stock exchange activities are a kind of gambling and we are against them." <a href="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4208" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4208" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> This caused investors to panic and move their investments to other countries. In the four months that followed, the Tehran Stock Market lost 20% of its value. On October 30, 2005, a few days after calling for Israel to be "wiped off the map," the President of Iran suggested that the solution to his country's economic problems is to start hanging stock market speculators, saying "if we were permitted to hang two or three persons, the problems with the stock exchange would be solved for ever." The Quran does indeed prohibit gambling. Speculative investment is indeed a type of gambling. In fact gambling is nothing more than financial risk and all activities involving money are a gamble. Speculative investing, or "prop trading" as it is called in finance, is indisguishable from gambling. Thus the notion that stock trading is "haram" is prevelant in the Muslim world.</p>
<p>Derivatives (eg stock options) are another financial activity that the doctors of Islam commonly deem to be "haram." In the same line of reasoning, the Muslim scholars have declared insurance to be haram (note that derivates can be seen as a type of insurance).</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Islam also prohibits the collection and payment of interest ("usury") - a vital component of the economy and financial markets. Consider, for example, the following excerpt from a June 26, 2004 article reported in a Pakistani newspaper <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2004/06/17/top2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dawn.com/2004/06/17/top2.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ISLAMABAD, June 16: Opposition members in the National Assembly belonging to the MMA and the PML-N staged a protest walkout on Wednesday against what they termed derogatory remarks by a minority member on interest on bank loans. Taking part in the budget debate, M.P. Bhindara, a minority MNA belonging to the PML, referred to a decree by an Al-Azhar University's scholar that bank interest was not un-Islamic. He said <b>without interest the country could not get foreign loans and could not achieve the desired progress. A pandemonium broke out in the house over his remarks</b> as a number of MMA members, including Hafiz Hussain Ahmed, Liaquat Baloch and others, rose from their seats in protest and tried to respond to Mr Bhandara's observations. However, they were not allowed to speak on a point of order which led to their walkout which was also joined by Mehmud Khan Achakzai and Imran Khan. The members belonging to the PPP Parliamentarians, however, did not take part in the walkout. Later, the opposition members were persuaded to by a team of ministers sent by Speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain to return to the house. During its talks with the opposition members to bring them back into the house, the government team accepted the right of the MMA to respond to the minority member's remarks and it was decided that Sahibzada Fazal Karim of PML-N and Maulana Shirani of MMA would make brief statements. Sahibzada Fazal Karim said <b>the Council of Islamic ideology had decreed that interest in all its forms was 'haram' in an Islamic society. Hence, he said, no member had the right to negate this settled issue</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not an economic theory. Economic theory shows that interest is a natural phenomenon caused by the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_value_of_money.html" title="Time value of money">time value of money</a>. The idea that an economy can function without interest is wholely unfounded, impossible, and does not corroborate with emperical evidence. Yet the article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_economics.html" title="Islamic economics">Islamic economics</a> attempts to lead the reader into believing that banning interest can be intellectually justified. But what has been ommited entirely from the wikipedia articles is that this is a bigger issue. The economic "theory" of the Muslim doctors is one which all financial instruments (stocks, bonds, and derivatives) are banned, all interest bearing transactions are banned, and the whole concept in insurance is abolished. For those who are unaware, pension and insurance companies are the largest investors in the financial markets and often pension and insurance is handeled by the same company. Pensions are funded, in a large part, through long-term interest bearing loans: save money now, get it back later. If you don't collect interest, then inflation eventually causes your money to become worthless. Allah knows how many Muslims collect a negative real interest rate by leaving cash in the bank and refusing to accept interest on it, without even realizing the disasterous consequences of their "divinely guided" financial plan.</p>
<p>"Islamic finance" is a "truly Islamic" (i.e. imaginary) world where stocks, derivatives, bonds, interest, speculation and insurance are all banned. This would take us back to an age of barbarism where most people would suffer terrible poverty in the absense of basic needs due to a lack of insurance, pension, and loans. Meanwhile, the whole economy would soon collapse with the banishment of trade and lending. The article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_economics.html" title="Islamic economics">Islamic economics</a> only briefly mentions the adverse effects that <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_finance.html" title="Islamic finance">Islamic finance</a> has had and can potentially have. The headings <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_economics.html" title="Islamic economics">Islamic economics</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_banking.html" title="Islamic banking">Islamic banking</a> are themselves inappropriate. Insurance, for example, is neither economics nor banking. And shariah is not an economic theory, nor is it a banking system, it is a set of laws (on financial transactions, in this case). This set of laws is not based on any theoretical, ethical or emperical grounds. It is a telling fact that every country in the world (including every Muslim country) has interest based banking systems, stock market "gambling" exchanges, insurance companies, etc. So this set of laws cannot be presented as some sort of intelectually respectable theory, any more than an encylopedia can describe the Church's bans on interest as some sort of competing theory of economics. I am followed around by POV warriors and have given up on editing, but I hope somsone else decides to research this issue and do something about the systematic biases present in the current articles. -- <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 09:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Irishpunktom, you're just going around and tagging everything I edit. I did say I was going to stop editing while I was drunk one night, I also said a lot of other things which are mostly accurate. You will notice that a current event article is very different from an article such as <a href="../../../d/h/u/Dhul-Qarnayn_4857.html" title="Dhul-Qarnayn">Dhul-Qarnayn</a> which I'm not editing anymore. As you can see, I am done editing Islam articles so long as there are POV warriors like you chasing me around deleting my edits and putting ridiculous batteries of tags into articles I edit or create. I predict that you'll have less success in articles that are in subject categories other than Islam. -- <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 10:54, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Where you "drunk" earlier today when you said that you "<i>have</i> stopped editing wikipedia articles"?. As for the Paris Riots I had contention with your summary of the BBC article, but instead of duscussing it and going over it, you revrted back to your POV addition. Had you not been so militant in your determination to keep this POC entry there would have no need to tag it. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 15:05, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sup Zeno, I propose redirecting Islamic Economics to <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_Oil_a7ee.html" title="Peak Oil">Peak Oil</a> <b>:-)</b>, but on a more serious note, The subject of economic relationships in sharia is a legitamate one, especially when contrasted with economic relations in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halacha.html" title="Halacha">Halacha</a>. The main difference is that sharia economics operates in a world where everything occurs because allah wills it, where as "jewish" economics occurs in a world where people are partners with god and his creation. Hence in judaism there is much more acceptance of idea's like insurance, and stocks etc. Infact there is an enourmaous body of law dealing with the proper valutation of partnerships and investment relationships. The Islamic prohibitions on interest (<a href="../../../r/i/b/Riba.html" title="Riba">Riba</a> ) come from a strict reading of Halachic prohibitions on interest (<a href="../../../r/i/b/Ribbit.html" title="Ribbit">Ribbit</a>). If you read <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Warraq_acf5.html" title="Ibn Warraq">Ibn Warraq</a>, you will learn that at alot of sharia is based on a mishmash of misunderstood Jewish law and pagan Arab customs. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 20:45, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm thinking of registering a domain name and starting a new website. My idea is to start a kind of 'encylopedia' about Islam, based on the wikipedia software and articles. I would setup the wikipedia software on a server, and then copy every single wikipedia article that relates to Islam. In other words, it would be a subject-specific wikipedia fork. What will make it different from wikipedia is that anonymous users will NOT be able to edit it as we will be free to set the rules and software ourselves. Such a website would allow us to deal with the problem of apologist POV pushing in a highly effecient manner. It will also solve the problem of the vast and totally ineffectual wikipedia bureaucracy. Most importantly, it will be an encylopedia of Islam, a subject-specific encylopedia and not merely a generalist encylopedia, which means that the main page will be about Islam. The specialized nature of the website will allow for original research. Some people might say or feel that it is more beneficial to edit wikipedia because wikipedia is one of the most visited websites on the net. However, I would point out that Islam category articles probably make a very very small portion of the total hits to wikipedia. Also, an effective website can gain google recognition on searches just as wikipedia has done. I'm wondering what you guys think and if you would be interested. I'm also wondering if anyone knows if anyone has ever made a subject-specific wikipedia fork website before. We could introduce some new technology for this, such as a system for marking "reviewed" and "unreviewed" articles, and an indicator of how similar or different the article is from the latest wikipedia version. Also, I would appreciate suggestions for a domain name. -- <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> 02:44, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On a related note, one of the reason's wikipedia is pretty good overall, is that there is an intereaction from many POV's that leads to quality articles.

<p>Street Scholar has done pov-warring/deletions in these and other articles. It therefore makes me wonder that he puts such comments on a public wikipedia page to encourage others to aid him in his pov-warring. South Asian articles that are related to Islam get very much vandalism. This ranges from deletions, pov-warring, vandalism, whitewashing, inserting false and unsourced claims, revisionism, apologism and much more. Just a note: the two articles mentioned above have always been if anything at least partly apologetic, very incomplete, etc. and in fact they are not without a pro-islamic bias, so Street Scholars comment is a bit ironic.</p>

<p>That is what actually happened. And anyway, lets look at my sources and then look at your sources to the article. You're getting all your information from Infinity-foundation, a website owned by a racist hintutva Ideology follower. Who in the paste have been known to lie. Like the claim about the Barbari Masque they said the masque was built on the birth site of the MYTHological god Krishna. And I put a big emphasis on the word myth, which resulted in the desecration of the masque and the death of many Muslims in India. And you are using information from this guys website. This is like writing an article on the Holocaust and getting your information from Nazi sources. I wouldn't be surprised if you were a Nazi, because you clearly are an anti-Semitic.</p>

<dd>Street Scholar, if you're going to have an argument with Kefalonia, you might as well argue with <i>him</i>, rather than with another user (Dangerous Boy) who you have differences with. Regardless, the issue around <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_bin_Qasim_417d.html" title="Muhammad bin Qasim">Muhammad bin Qasim</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_conquest_of_South_Asia_4dab.html" title="Islamic conquest of South Asia">Islamic conquest of South Asia</a> seems to be whether or not to include material that is critical of Qasim, or to include only hagiographic material that glows about how wonderful and benevolent he was. Let's just focus on keeping the article balanced, and avoid the interpersonal wars (with Dangerous Boy, or anyone else). <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 13:50, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't bring up any posts outside Wikipedia, I just said that you should respect Kefalonia's autonomy and not denounce him for comments made by another editor.

<dd>Well I think we just need to hear where this notion of a consensus for redirect is coming from. Numerous people have said it now. I don't know where it's coming from, but it's got to be coming from somewhere.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mel isn't going to explain anything, I would bet $5 to the wikimedia foundation that Mel can't show a credible source for the existance of the concensus that he claims exists. The only concenus emeged when Mel, Lee, and Yube deciced to create Neofascism and Religion so that they could get rid of the Islamofascim article by merging it into that. I eventually got tired of edit warring with the Islamosypathists on wikipedia, so I moved on to other things.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now that GWB has used the term twice in speeches, it's going to be very hard for Mel to continue to claim that this isn't notable enough for it's own article. Lee and others will continue to try and dilute the article, and especially to prevent any attempt at coming up with an empirical defintion of "Islamofascism".</dd>

<dd>I am a little annoyed that Mel just showed up, reverted to redirect, protected it, and wandered off without any explanation other than "there was a clear consensus for redirect" when I and other editors had already questioned where exactly this consensus formed, since it's not on the talk page or the AfD page. I would have liked a little more input from him to go with his decision.

It's a temporary thing so read it quick.</p>
<p>I'm going to be very frank. Self-delusion and fear of the truth had eventually cost us too many beautiful lives on that grim Wednesday night. But unless we face the distressing facts, we should expect more terrible surprises. ( <a href="../../../u/b/e/Uberrima_fides.html" title="Uberrima fides">Uberrima fides</a> anyone?)</p>

<dd>Mr. Nabulsi is calling for an undoing of centuries of Muslim "literature" in order to turn Islam into a "religion of peace." The assumption here is that it began as a "religion of peace" but was then perverted over centuries. This is a false assumption and this process of undoing the past would inevitably and very quickly lead to debasing the "two legs" of Islam, namely the Quran and hadith (both of which would have been banned as hate literature and incitement of violence had they been published in this enlightened age). It is mass religioisity in Muslim societies that leads to the rise of political Islam in society, and the rise of political Islam in a society always leads to militant Islam and gross oppression of women, children, non-Muslims, and eventually the "moderate" Muslims themselves (ironically). And what is driving the deep religiosity amongst the masses in Muslim societies? It isn't the mujahideen who drive this religiosity, it is the so-called "moderates" who dress up the creed of the mujahideen as "the religion of peace." It is these self-appointed "moderate" mullahs who try to paint the black flag of Islam white, who try to legitimize their fundamentalism and anti-secular, theocractic ideals by trying to excommunicate and delegitmize those who have shown the true face of Islam. We are told by these moderate Muslims that it is not Islam that is the danger, rather it is some supposedly crazy people who have supposedly "perverted" Islam with an ideology of hatred, warfare, and oppression and "turned" it into the enemy of freedom and peace. This is no different than modern-day Communists who try to gloss over the bloody consequences of Communism by insisting that everyone from Lenin and Stalin to Mao and Pol Pot were not representative of a "truly Communist state," just as "moderate" and "radical" Muslims, alike, speak of a "truly Islamic state." But those who are wise know that Communism, an ideology that holds class warfare as a fundamental principal, will always lead to the sort of misery that was unleashed onto humankind by the likes of Pol Pot. Fortunately, those foolish people who try to paint the red flag of communism white are an insignificant minority in a world where communism is widely accepted as a failed and abandoned ideology. However, the "moderate" mullahs are not insigificant. On the contrary, they plant the trojan horse of "moderate" political Islam into society, into the minds of Muslims and non-Muslims, and into the political systems of Islam-conquered nations. They are Public Relations managers and propogandsits for the very same Islam to which the militants and terrorists adhere. It is in the interest of the terrorist that "moderate" mullahs go about telling Westerners and Muslim youth that Islam is a reasonable religion, that (despite appearances) it is NOT a crazy, dangerous and violent political ideology whose grasp over the Islam-conquered nations, cultures and societies needs to be defeated. Therefore, it is the self-appointed, so-called moderate Muslims who rank amongst the greatest allies of the terrorists and in some cases (such as <a href="../../../c/a/i/CAIR_c159.html" title="CAIR">CAIR</a> or the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Brotherhood_ed9f.html" title="Muslim Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a>) they secretly ARE terrorists. -- <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_of_Elea_061f.html" title="User:Zeno of Elea">Zeno of Elea</a></dd>

<p>“The Qur’an has specified a considerable deal of its verses to talking about Jews, their personal qualities and characteristics. The Qur’anic description of Jews is quite impartial; praising them in some occasions where they deserve praise and condemning them in other occasions where they practice blameworthy acts. Yet, the latter occasions outnumbered the former, due to their bad qualities and the heinous acts they used to commit.</p>

<p>Almost everything that is now written about Iraq rings not quite right: It was a “blunder”; there should have been far more troops there; the country must be trisected; we must abide by a timetable and leave regardless of events on the ground; Iraq will soon devolve into either an Islamic republic or another dictatorship; the U.S. military is enervated and nearly ruined; and so on.</p>
<p>In fact, precisely because we have killed thousands of terrorists, trained an army, and ensured a political process, it is possible to do what was intended from the very beginning: lessen the footprint of American troops in the heart of the ancient caliphate.</p>

<p>(1) Do I understand the meaning of "Islamic apologetics" differently from the sense used in this Wikiproject?</p>
<ul>
<li>Islamic apologetics would be to <i>make the case</i> that truths of Islam can be known by human reason or, conversely, the truths of Islam are not contradicted by human reason.</li>
<li>The apologetics propositions <i>detailed</i> are referenced back to an <i>author</i> of a book, article, or Internet page, and his or her work <i>cited</i>.</li>
<li>That's how I would expect Islamic apologetics to be presented in the Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I understand the mission statement correctly, this project has as its mission to suppress the presentation of Islamic apologetics <i>otherwise conforming</i> to the Wikipedia policies. Is that correct?</p>
<p>(2) For the sake of discussion, using my definition of Islamic apologetics, and not the definition used by the project members, is this the content that you seek to delete from the Wikipedia? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 03:10, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pat, obviously there is nothing wrong with presenting a very enthusiastic and pious POV about Islam, assertions that "Islam is True" and so forth, so long as these are cited as the view of a particular author. Most members of this project object only to when these POVs are presented as objective truth, rather than as a particular POV. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 03:28, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The objection you mention here is not the one in the mission statement. It is specifically Islamic apologetics <i>there</i> but <i>here</i> you've modified it to be a point of view that is presented in the Wikipedia without conforming to its policies of verifiability, attribution, and citation. Is the mission statement wrong? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 04:06, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The mission statement is completely consistent with what I wrote. SIIEG's goal is to see Islam covered in an NPOV, non-pious, non-apologetic manner. <i>Describing</i> apologetic viewpoints is not itself apologetic...presenting those viewpoints as plain reality is apologetic. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 04:43, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
