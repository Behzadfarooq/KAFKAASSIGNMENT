<p>Re: "Tucker" vs. "Max" Maybe I'm wrong, but I just feel like calling him "Max" like that can cause some confusion regarding his first name. Is there something wrong with using "Tucker" instead? It will most likely make the article clearer. If it really bothers you either way keep it with "Max", but I felt it would pre-empt confusion. <a href="../../../p/s/a/User%7EPsantora_c464.html" title="User:Psantora">Paul</a><small><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psantora_252c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psantora">C</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../p/s/a/User_talk%7EPsantora_c626.html" title="User talk:Psantora">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></sub></small> 07:31, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't disagree with your take on Tucker, but it was one of the first article's I edited way back when (not surprisingly, to remove vandalism) so I like to keep track of it. The article does need a major clean up, but I don't have the time to even attempt a small part of it... I reverted my small change, I hope you don't mind. <a href="../../../p/s/a/User%7EPsantora_c464.html" title="User:Psantora">Paul</a><small><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psantora_252c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psantora">C</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../p/s/a/User_talk%7EPsantora_c626.html" title="User talk:Psantora">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></sub></small> 16:12, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why do you insist on listing the YTMND site in this article? It doesn't haven't any meaningful content, unless you can call a repeating sound clip and the word "<b>jews</b>" in the middle of the page meaningful. Does it "provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose"? No. "Sites that require external applications" shouldn't be linked to. If you operate that page, please don't link it from Wikipedia. If you haven't already, you should familiarize yourself with <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>. <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtea_ee58.html" title="User:Mrtea">Mrtea</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/t/User_talk%7EMrtea_12d6.html" title="User talk:Mrtea">(talk)</a></small> 01:09, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also there's no reference of The Office (UK version) in the Dwight Schrute article either. That external link comparing the two versions would be unhelpful to the reader. The web site is already appropriately listed in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Office_1cc2.html" title="The Office">The Office</a> article where there is a comparision between the versions and characters. I'll revert the changes for now, unless you can bring up some valid points from <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> for the sites to be listed. Just because an article has a paragraph about Dwight doesn't mean it should be listed. <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtea_ee58.html" title="User:Mrtea">Mrtea</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/t/User_talk%7EMrtea_12d6.html" title="User talk:Mrtea">(talk)</a></small> 01:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The word "speechify" is not slang. It is a word that means "to give a speech." It has nothing at all to do with George W. Bush.</p>
<p>The first instance from the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1723:</p>
<p>1723 [implied in SPEECHIFYING vbl. n.]. 1762 FOOTE Orator I. Wks. 1799 I. 193 And have you speechified yet? Ibid. 194, I did speechify once at a vestry. 1806 Naval Chron. XV. 19 Jack made..attempts to speechify. 1833 MOORE Mem. (1854) VI. 341 Lord Lansdowne began to speechify to the German and Frenchman. 1862 THACKERAY Philip vii, We were free to speechify,..and be as young as we liked.</p>
<p>I still think "speechifying" was the right word to use. I wanted the sentence to refer to the actions taken by Ferrell/Frenkle, not the result of those actions. In general, I dislike your edit, but I'm not going to engage in changing and changing back.</p>

<p>With all due respect, the assertion that Larry Bird may well be the greatest white athlete of all time is a view shared by a large portion of the populous. If you can think of a more accomplished white athlete, in any field, then I would be more than happy to humor you. If, in the meantime, as a compromise, you would be willing to allow me to post that he is, at the very least, the greatest white athlete the NBA has ever known, I would take no issue. Do you mean to suggest that, since Larry Bird happened to be white, his achievements in the sport are any less significant? To me, that discrimination is the very manifestation of what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. fought so hard to destroy.</p>

<p>I feel that turning the "trivia" into a useful sentence is better than a quick reversion. So I commend your choice on reworking the Mercury reference in Cobain. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabuBhatt_d0d9.html" title="User:BabuBhatt">BabuBhatt</a> 03:00, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. Just wanted to explain the reason for the initial reversion: I get frustrated by drive-by edits that throw in a random piece of information that may or may not have significance to the rest of the article. (A few people have tried to drop in notes about other bands that seem to do nothing other than to use Kurt's words and/or their possible influence on Nirvana to elevate those bands.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kurt wasn't notably a Queen fan, and used the Mercury reference simply as a comparison to express his feelings. The edit (which had been done in the past) seems more notable to Mercury than to Cobain. What I mean by that: it acts like it's more important to the editor that Cobain said something about <i>Mercury</i>, not that the mention was important to Cobain's life. (A previous editor a few weeks ago tried to ram in the claim that Nirvana was influenced by Queen, which there's no evidence of.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We can't include every piece of trivia about Cobain in the article. It's just not feasible. And my personal preference is that we should include the most notable elements. That Neil Young was so affected by Cobain's mention of his lyric is significant, given his personal reaction and that he dedicated part of <i>Sleeps with Angels</i> in response. That Kurt mentioned Mercury seems decidedly less so. (An example not in the article: Kurt's mention of Pete Townsend in <i>Journals</i> isn't significantly important to an article about Cobain.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm okay with the current version, but I hate having to rewrite something seemingly unimportant to <i>make</i> it noteworthy just because someone (who has no vested interest in the article) wants to drop it in. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisB_39d0.html" title="User:ChrisB">ChrisB</a> 04:14, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My message was not meant as sarcastic, and I'm not trying to call you out. Based on the Dwight Schrute edit it did not seem that you knew what "rv" meant so I was letting you know. I remember a time when I did not know what "rv" meant. When someone prefaces an edit summary with "rv", that tells me they changed the page to a previous version, if I felt the previous versions of the page were fine then I do not need to look at the edit.

<p>Hi - Thanks for the copyedits to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitch_Gardens_9e52.html" title="Elitch Gardens">Elitch Gardens</a>. I knew the crack about "as featureless as a parking lot" was POV, but really, have you been there? Seriously, I'm not sure how to say it in a NPOV sort of way but the shocking difference between the 100-year old landscaped park and the new, completely barren one was (IMO) a significant contributing factor to the "less-successful" (and I don't think "relatively disastrous" was out of line) first two seasons leading to the park's sale. Not a big deal, and I'm certainly not going to make an edit war out of it, but things that are POV but simply the truth seem OK to me.

<p>We are quoting the publication that interviewed Novak. In transcribing the spoken words of anyone there is always going to be some degree of subjectivity on what to write. The publication has done this job, and we don't have access to audio recordings of Novak's words, so we can't interpret them ourselves. In quoting from this publication we are relying on their reliability in quoting a person accurately, to take their interpretation of Novak's words and reinterpret them without the original audio means that we are no longer quoting anything but making up our own things. Style guides apply to your own writing or words, no to the words of other people. Accuracy should not be sacrifaced just to conform to a certain style. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 04:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Edit conflict) I started a discussion on the article's talk page about this; not having seen your comments on Qutezuce's talk page, I wrote a lengthy paragraph for which your comment on Qutezuce's page is an excellent and clear ex ante recapitulation (I hope you'll permit my essaying an oxymoron; if not, I'm left saying that, ignorant of what you'd written, I simply found a more verbose and muddied way of saying it!). His/her point apropos of transcription would be persuasive, inasmuch as we haven't an audio copy of Novak's comments, but we can say with certainty, I think, as you noted in an edit summary, that Novak didn't say "percentage sign", whereupon we are altogether correct, I think, to format the quote in a fashion consistent with that prescribed in the MoS. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:49, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And because Novak didn't say "percentage sign" thats why we didn't write "percentage sign" or "%age sign" or "% sign" or "percent sign". Re: MoS, please read my comment on the talk page, the MoS doesn't specify to use "percent" over "%". <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 05:16, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I noticed a page I'm fairly certain is a joke page created by <a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFather_McDouglas_bd8e.html" title="User:Father McDouglas">User:Father McDouglas</a>. It is Armenian Mom!. I followed the "what links here" link and found that he was vandalising other articles by including links to this page (among other things). Before I could rv, I noticed you had beat me to it. I was going to ask that you block him, but I sent the fake article to AfD and he should have a chance to refute this if indeed it really is an Armenian TV show (which I highly doubt, but nevertheless, he should have the opportunity to defend himself). Please take a look at the page and see for yourself. Maybe I should have sent it to "Speedy Deletion" instead. I haven't requested admin priveledges yet so I'm not sure which would have been better. Anyway, thanks for your work. Funny name, by the way.

<p>I was trying to fix the external link to The Phish Website from [www.pheesh.com] to [www.phish.com], which some anon had changed to the former. Your brackets might have gotten undone because if you had taken the trouble to check the history for the page my edit is one minute after yours. No need to get all worked up, you can put the brackets again. I am sure it wont take long for an editor of your mighty callibre. The "Newbie".</p>

<dd>Apologies about the rather brusque tone of my previous message. I was trying to revert the vandalism and hence very surprised to see your message. I guess both edits happened near-simultaneously with the unfortunate result of the de-wikification.

<dd>Yes. The admin also commented on that user's talk page, and while essentially it's simply disagreement over the big recent changes, when the reverts destroy so many other changes since that time, it feels like vandalism. It would be much better for the user to explain what he/she disagrees with. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabuBhatt_d0d9.html" title="User:BabuBhatt">BabuBhatt</a> 03:22, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
