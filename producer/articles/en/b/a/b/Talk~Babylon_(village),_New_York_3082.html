<p>Please be certain your edits are accurate and relevant. For example, LaGrange Inn is in West Islip and is and always was in Islip Town. It was called East Babylon but was never part of the town or village of Babylon. Also, please don't remove accurate material (such as the list of hotels) without firm reason and explanation. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 15:23, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I actually added the hotel listed last night. Today I moved it under the hotel section; I originally placed it under history. As far as the La Grange Inn, I have several old books and even new books on Babylon's history which mentions it was considered part of Babylon Village. Furthermore, I have a postcard from the La Grange Inn labeled La Grange Inn, Babylon Village, LI</p>

<dd>Well, OK, I understand. But if we make mention of the "popular" names of West Islip, we need to remember that political boundaries exist, that East Babylon/West Islip is not part of Babylon Town and the incorporated village of Babylon never went east of the Babylon/Islip Line. So I think it is a question of accurate wording.</dd>

<dd>It's kind of like areas along Route 110 near Republic are called "Farmingdale" but they are properly "East Farmingdale." One is a village in Nassau, the other a hamlet in Suffolk. If someone told me to buy something at the Borders Books in "Farmingdale," I would know where they meant, but I wouldn't put that description in an encyclopedia w/o explanation. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 18:36, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gotcha, that is understandable. I like the way you re-worded those spots. The bullets I listed above, do you have any sources we can obtain information from? I have the books I mentioned and ordered a new book so hopefully that will be helpful for us. Also I have some pictures of the village we can add yet I am not the best at uploading to Wikipedia, so if you would kindly be able to help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Most are my pictures, some are postcards that are not copyrighted or so I believe.</dd>

<dd>I found the school information on the school's websites. I don't know of any general source for these things other than the things you seem to have already found. However, you might like at: <a href="http://arrts-arrchives.com/whatsnewpage2.html" class="external text" title="http://arrts-arrchives.com/whatsnewpage2.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. It has information mostly about the railroads, but other good stuff as well. As to uploading pictures, you have to create them on your computer and then upload them using the "Upload file" command from the toolbox. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 04:18, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you have a reference for the name? And since Oak Beach is on the main barrier beach (often called Jones Island) does Muncie Island only refer to the area around Oak Beach or to the entire barrier beach? I know that's a lot of questions but I can find no reference to "Muncie Island." -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 15:06, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Originally I believed Muncie Island to be what is presently Oak Beach on Jones Beach Island; this was after I was looking at an old map. Then when I took a second look I realized it was its own island, near Oak Island and Oak Beach (Jones Beach Island). I read three different stories but both with the similar endings, a demise to the island. One is that the island was lost after 1938 Hurricane, second was during dredging for the NY State Boat Channel, (Captree Channel) the island was buried under mud/sand <a href="http://www.savethebeaches.org/heritage.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.savethebeaches.org/heritage.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a>, and lastly this island was destroyed so that its sand (resources) could be used to widen Jones Beach Island during the construction of Ocean Parkway.</dd>
