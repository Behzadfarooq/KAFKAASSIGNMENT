<p>Statements such as "The Babson campus consists of 370 acres (1.5 km²) of woods, rolling hills, and carefully landscaped grounds" are likely true, but need to have a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">source</a> cited for them.

This sort of statement is an opinion or judgement, ditto soaring, light-filled atria, etc. It happens to be a very reasonable opinion, but Wikipedia does not report the opinions <i>of editors.</i> It's a secondary source. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:13, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>P. S. If you're wondering, I came across this page because I wanted to find out the status of the Babson Globe and the Coleman Relief Map. The Babson Globe was apparently restored in 1994, having literally deteriorated into nothing but a rusty ball, but I can't find out whether it actually rotates. The <a href="http://www3.babson.edu/Archives/babsonworldglobe.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www3.babson.edu/Archives/babsonworldglobe.cfm" rel="nofollow">Babson website</a> , describes it as "capable" of rotating—suggesting to me that it in fact it doesn't; but <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/MAWELworld.html" class="external text" title="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/MAWELworld.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a> seems to say that it does.</p>
<p>The Coleman Map Building at one time housed a giant relief map of the United States. From the fact that it is now called Coleman Hall I suspect it doesn't any more. Anyone know anything more about this... and if it doesn't exist, what happened to it? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:25, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The US map housed in the building was removed several years ago. I'll see if I can find where it's gone to. DEddy 18:05, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just noticed that the Roadside America article says:</p>

<p>I've been trying to figure out a snappy yet accurate way to phrase the Babson Globe's current claim to fame. Babson's website calls it "one of the world's largest free standing globes (28 feet in diameter, weighing 25 tons) capable of revolving on its base and spinning on its axis" but since it is, in fact, <i>not</i> capable of doing this any more, this does not seem right.</p>
<p>My wife humorously suggested "The largest <i>formerly-rotating</i> globe in the world" (<a href="../../../e/a/r/Eartha.html" title="Eartha">Eartha</a>, of course, not counting because it still does rotate). I'm settling for:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was for many years the largest rotating globe in the world and, as of 2005, the second-largest one ever built. (For the largest, see <a href="../../../e/a/r/Eartha.html" title="Eartha">Eartha</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I contacted Babson via their website about the exact status of the globe and relief map and received the following email from rybnikar@babson.edu:</p>
<dl>
<dd>When the globe was built it did revolve but time has taken its toll. "Capable" simply means that it was built to move even if it no longer does. It used to be the world's largest globe capable of such movement. The current largest is Eartha built by DeLorme of Freeport, ME. A large static globe would be something different.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The map was destroyed in 1997/8 to allow the conversion of the building into residences for students.</dd>

<p>A user without an account recently made some unexplained edits to the Babson Globe section. With regard to the globe's deterioration, it documented in the references provided.</p>
<p>With regard to the Coleman Relief Map's disposition, the word "destroyed" is the word used by a Babson representative, rybnikar@babson.edu , as noted above. If, in fact, the map was removed but <i>not</i> destroyed, i.e. if it was in fact <i>preserved,</i> it would be interesting to know where it is and what, if any, future plans there are for it. If it was in fact destroyed, as Babson College says, then I don't know what the point would be of using imprecise language. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:46, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><small>In <a href="http://www3.babson.edu/Archives/research_publications/upload/A&amp;RCh22-24.pdf#xml" class="external free" title="http://www3.babson.edu/Archives/research_publications/upload/A&amp;RCh22-24.pdf#xml" rel="nofollow">http://www3.babson.edu/Archives/research_publications/upload/A&amp;RCh22-24.pdf#xml</a> Roger Babson himself wrote that "its horizontal scale is four miles to the inch [1:253,440], while its vertical scale is four miles to the foot." Babson also claimed that the map "performed great service during World War II, supplying vertical data to aviators and weather stations. This saved thousands of lives."</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small>This reminds me that during or shortly after WW-II, the Army Map Service (AMS) went to considerable trouble to make plaster of Paris molds of every USGS 1:250,000 topographic quadrangle which has any significant relief (e.g. Appalachian and Rocky Mountains). The molds became privately owned several decades ago and are still the basis of vinyl relief maps sold to the public. See <a href="http://www.shnta.com/Other_Maps/Raised_Relief_Maps/usgsMain.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.shnta.com/Other_Maps/Raised_Relief_Maps/usgsMain.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shnta.com/Other_Maps/Raised_Relief_Maps/usgsMain.htm</a>.</small></dd>

<dl>
<dd><small>There is an interesting history here for someone to research and compose, i.e. the history of pre-computer relief maps. Babson College archives must have volumes of plans and photos concerning the "great map." Maybe you or someone could request that the college put at least one good image of the map on-line. (I once asked the Virginia Military Institute about a trophy bell which used to hang on campus, and the archivist not only scanned a photo for me but immediately put it on-line. See <a href="http://www.vmi.edu/archives/archivephotos/Details.asp?ACCNUM=4415&amp;rform=search" class="external free" title="http://www.vmi.edu/archives/archivephotos/Details.asp?ACCNUM=4415&amp;rform=search" rel="nofollow">http://www.vmi.edu/archives/archivephotos/Details.asp?ACCNUM=4415&amp;rform=search</a>.)</small></dd>

<p><small>I made that last addition. Doesn't it fit nicely? I'm surprised it wasn't there originally. So much for the Trumps and that Wharton school they brag about. -Amit</small></p>

<p><small>pending an explanation of why he's notable, and a good source citation showing he is a Babson alumnus. The cited web page doesn't mention Babson, and I don't think a myspace website meets the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">guidelines for source citations</a>. He does appear to be a "staff member" of the Babson <a href="http://www3.babson.edu/offices/campuslife/ugrad_housing/staff.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www3.babson.edu/offices/campuslife/ugrad_housing/staff.cfm" rel="nofollow">Office of Residential Life</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:00, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

</ul>
<p><small>I don't think a student is considered an alumnus unless after he has left; the citation is to non-English content, which I can't read, but since his name does not even appear on the referenced page I don't see how it establishes that he is a notable rap artist; but in any case a web forum would not usually be considered a good source for such a claim.</small></p>
<p><small>I'm inclined to think this is vanity or self-promotion but am willing to be convinced otherwise. Has anyone got a good, verifiable source citation from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">good source</a> that says he is an important rap artist? If the source is not in English, please give a translation. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:34, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
