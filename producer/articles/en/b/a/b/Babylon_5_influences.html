<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5_influences.html" title="Edit section: Babylon">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Babylon</span></h3>
<p>The most prominent influence is presented by the title itself. According to <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Michael_Straczynski_0092.html" title="J. Michael Straczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I picked "<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>" for the station, because a lot of what happens in the</i> Babylon 5 <i>story comes out of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamian_mythology.html" title="Mesopotamian mythology">Babylonian creation myth</a>, which says that the universe was born out of the conflict between order and chaos.</i> <sup id="_ref-chrys-comment_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chrys-comment" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unusual for a television series, this central theme, planned well before the show's production, develops only slowly and takes several seasons to become clear.</p>
<p><a name="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" id="The_Lord_of_the_Rings"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5_influences.html" title="Edit section: The Lord of the Rings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></span></h3>
<p>Several elements in <i>B5</i> seem a lot like elements in <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._R._R._Tolkien_236d.html" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s fantasy novel (first published in three volumes), <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>. For instance, in the first volume, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring_4276.html" title="The Fellowship of the Ring">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></i>, the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazg%C3%BBl.html" title="Nazgûl">Black Riders</a> first appear singly, then in progressively larger groups; B5 repeated this tension-building pattern early in its first season, when enemy forces known as the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_%28Babylon_5%29_0099.html" title="Shadow (Babylon 5)">Shadows</a> appear first singly, and then in vast numbers. Additionally, the Shadows, like the Black Riders, strike a deep primal fear in everyone who sees them. The way the Shadows are spoken of, as the Darkness and the Enemy is reminiscent of how Sauron is spoken of in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>
<p>The most obvious reference from the book is the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranger_%28Babylon_5%29_6a36.html" title="Ranger (Babylon 5)">Rangers</a>, who share their name and mission with <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangers_of_the_North_5add.html" title="Rangers of the North">one group</a> of Tolkien's <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranger_%28Middle-earth%29_b858.html" title="Ranger (Middle-earth)">Rangers</a>. Both are secretive orders that work covertly to protect a populace that is either unaware or openly hostile to them, and both are led by individuals of mixed race — <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragorn.html" title="Aragorn">Aragorn</a>, who had blood of Men, Elves, and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maia_%28Middle-earth%29_999f.html" title="Maia (Middle-earth)">Maiar</a>, and the half-human, half-<a href="../../../m/i/n/Minbari.html" title="Minbari">Minbari</a> <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delenn.html" title="Delenn">Delenn</a>. Just as the marriage of Aragorn and Arwen reunited the Humans and Elves, whose blood flowed through them both, the marriage of John Sheridan and Delenn reunited the Humans and Minbari, who shared each other's souls.</p>
<p>The code of the Rangers, as stated by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Cole_101f.html" title="Marcus Cole">Marcus Cole</a> in the episode "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_17_is_Missing_41fa.html" title="Grey 17 is Missing">Grey 17 is Missing</a>", is: <i>"We walk in the dark places that no one else will enter. We stand on the bridge, and no one may pass."</i> This is reminiscent of two scenes from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. The first is Aragorn's description of his Rangers during the Council of <a href="../../../e/l/r/Elrond.html" title="Elrond">Elrond</a> in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>: "<i>Lonely men are we, Rangers of the North, hunters — but hunters ever of the servants of the Enemy</i>"; and the second is <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>'s confrontation with the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balrog.html" title="Balrog">Balrog</a> over the abyss in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29_7b44.html" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a>, in particular his cry of "<i>You cannot pass!</i>" before he shatters the bridge. Furthermore, Gandalf has previously been warned (by Aragorn, no less) that he will die if he enters Moria (also known as Khazad-dûm); in B5, captain <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheridan_%28Babylon_5%29_aab9.html" title="John Sheridan (Babylon 5)">John Sheridan</a> is warned that he will die if he goes to a planet called <a href="../../../z/27/h/Z%27ha%27dum.html" title="Z'ha'dum">Z'ha'dum</a>. Both men sacrifice themselves, fall into an abyss, and return in an altered form to unite the forces of good against the forces of evil. Kosh could also be compared to Gandalf, in that both are powerful beings who help gather the forces of Light together and act as a mentor towards the main heroes, Sheridan and Aragorn. Both also die in their duties, and both return, though Kosh's return was brief.</p>
<p>Also, B5 takes place at "the dawn of the third age", and the defeat of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron.html" title="Sauron">Sauron</a> in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is considered to be the ending event of the Third Age of Middle-earth.</p>
<p>The third season of Babylon 5, the Shadow War, is depicted less as a typical science-fiction war than as a conflict between Darkness and Light comparable to the War of the Ring. The Shadows, like Sauron, were defeated before, but over time regained their strength and returned to start a new war. The First Ones were leaving the Galaxy to out beyond the Rim, just as the Elves were leaving Middle-earth to go to <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valinor.html" title="Valinor">Valinor</a>. After the Shadow War, all the First Ones leave for beyond the Rim. Likewise, after the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Ring_82c8.html" title="War of the Ring">War of the Ring</a>, the Elves leave for Valinor. Both universes have difficulty getting all the various races to work together to stop the Enemy, since many of these races are suspicious and distrustful of one another.</p>
<p>Aragorn was the rightful heir to the thrones of the sister realms <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnor.html" title="Arnor">Arnor</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondor.html" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>. Arnor had long since fallen, and Gondor's own royal line (Aragorn's relatives by blood) had ended. He was hated by the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewards_of_Gondor_dc2b.html" title="Stewards of Gondor">Steward</a> Denethor who ruled Gondor in lieu of a king, and feared for his position if Aragorn returned to claim his birthright. Sheridan, comparatively, had to breakway from Earth and was declared a traitor by President Clark. Both Denethor and Clark committed suicide at their end.</p>
<p>The Shadows, like Sauron, also have many servants and races working for them, that they summoned when they prepared to make war again. Both also infiltrated and influenced other rulers and nations, through Emperor Cartagia, President Clark, just as Sauron worked through Saruman and other forces of evil. The Shadow's Mr. Morden is their smooth-tongue advocate, just as <a href="../../../g/r/%C3%AD/Gr%C3%ADma.html" title="Gríma">Gríma</a> "Wormtongue" was in Rohan for Saruman. Additionally, the Shadows use living beings as the central operating system of their warships. This theme of domination and alteration if similar to Sauron's desire to dominate life in Middle-earth and bend all to his will.</p>
<p>Delenn's role is not dissimilar from Arwen's. Also, the Centauri and the Narns stand at different technological levels, just as Gondor and Rohan do in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Gondor itself is described in Roman-like terms, whereas Rohan is more Anglo-Saxon. Gondor and the Centauri Republic are soldier states, whereas Rohan and the Narn Regime are more warrior-oriented. The former are older civilizations and the latter are younger civilizations, still imbibed with a spirit of dashing, even reckless, bravery and warrior heritage that is lacking in the former.</p>
<p>The name <i><a href="../../../n/a/r/Narn.html" title="Narn">Narns</a></i> might be derived either from <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._S._Lewis_2694.html" title="C. S. Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_ad70.html" title="The Chronicles of Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></i>, or from Tolkien's <i>Narn i Hîn Húrin</i> in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Silmarillion_7dd6.html" title="The Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></i> which was itself almost certainly the inspiration for the name Narnia. The name of Tolkien's heart of elvendom, "<a href="../../../l/%C3%B3/r/L%C3%B3rien.html" title="Lórien">Lórien</a>" (or "Lothlórien") is given to the first of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Ones_9204.html" title="First Ones">First Ones</a> in B5. (See "<a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorien_%28Babylon_5%29_8b27.html" title="Lorien (Babylon 5)">Lorien</a>") The name of the Shadows' agent, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morden_%28Babylon_5%29_ed25.html" title="Morden (Babylon 5)">Mr. Morden</a>, may also reflect Tolkien's <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordor.html" title="Mordor">Mordor</a>. The similar nature of the names Khazad-dûm and Z'ha'dum has been noted earlier.</p>
<p>The creator of B5, <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Michael_Straczynski_0092.html" title="J. Michael Straczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> (JMS), acknowledges Tolkien when a "techno-mage" loosely quotes <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, where the character <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gildor_Inglorion_0846.html" title="Gildor Inglorion">Gildor Inglorion</a> says, "Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."</p>
<p>JMS has stated that people misunderstand the similarities between the two different stories. He often says that B5 is "greatly informed by" but "is not" any particular preceding work of fiction or history.</p>

<p>A plethora of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespearian</a> quotes and misquotes peppers Babylon 5 dialogue, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> being a notable favorite.</p>

The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Line_e7cc.html" title="Battle of the Line">Battle of the Line</a> is an analogy of King Arthur's final battle. Delenn is associated with the <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_of_the_Lake_391d.html" title="Lady of the Lake">Lady of the Lake</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheridan_%28Babylon_5%29_aab9.html" title="John Sheridan (Babylon 5)">Sheridan</a> is unquestionably King Arthur, gathering the disparate alien races under one alliance. <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lennier.html" title="Lennier">Lennier</a> reveals himself as <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancelot.html" title="Lancelot">Lancelot</a> when he betrays the Rangers over his feelings for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delenn.html" title="Delenn">Delenn</a>, and <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosh.html" title="Kosh">Kosh</a> may literally or figuratively be <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merlin_%28wizard%29.html" title="Merlin (wizard)">Merlin</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Cole_101f.html" title="Marcus Cole">Marcus Cole</a> suggests that Kosh, like Merlin, might see the future by remembering it, and that Kosh may have visited Earth and modeled the Round Table after his acquaintances on Babylon 5.</p>
<p>In fact Kosh may not have needed to remember the future through some unusual unexplained means as Marcus theorises: it is well established that Kosh knew <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valen.html" title="Valen">Valen</a>, the Minbari religious leader responsible for founding the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Council_d6b2.html" title="Grey Council">Grey Council</a>. Valen was in fact <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Sinclair_6f58.html" title="Jeffrey Sinclair">Jeffrey Sinclair</a>, a Human sent back into the past, and Kosh may easily have become aware of future events through Valen/Sinclair, especially since he was a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepath.html" title="Telepath">telepath</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/x/c/Excalibur.html" title="Excalibur">Excalibur</a> appears three times in the series: once as a ship involved with the battle against General Hague, an actual sword and again as <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excalibur_%28Crusade%29_242f.html" title="Excalibur (Crusade)">the ship</a> charged with finding a cure for the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drakh.html" title="Drakh">Drakh</a> plague and saving Earth, the second <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victory_class_destroyer.html" title="Victory class destroyer">Victory class destroyer</a> (the <i>Victory</i> herself, and the shipyards to construct more vessels of her class, were destroyed shortly after Victory was launched). Note the episode: "<a href="../../../a/_/l/A_Late_Delivery_from_Avalon_7f3d.html" title="A Late Delivery from Avalon">A Late Delivery from Avalon</a>."</p>
<p>Finally, there also is the obvious reference to the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Grail_c5ce.html" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a> in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grail_%28Babylon_5%29_3672.html" title="Grail (Babylon 5)">eponymous episode</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Original_Series_61be.html" title="Star Trek: The Original Series">Star Trek</a> certainly played a major part in the formation of the Babylon 5 Mythos, especially since JMS originally pitched it to Paramount (although it is unclear whether it was pitched as a Star Trek Spin-off or not). Paramount rejected the pitch and then stole the idea to create DS9. The parallells between the two series are striking. The almost monk-like Minbari and the Vulcans, the romanesque Centauri and the Romulans, the warrior Narn and the Klingons are all clear pairings. The Dominion and the Shadows, the Precursors and the First Ones, The Q and the Vorlon are less clear, but certainly plausible. Its clear that Paramount was not at all comfortable with having the proud Klingons so totally enslaved by the Romulans (there is evidence, somewhere in the vast Star Trek Canon and apocrypha, that the Romulans had at one point or another conquered or at least exerted consderable influence over the Klingon Empire, but thats for Star Trek fans to argue about). So they created the Bajoran/Cardassian conflict.</p>

<p>Neville Chamberlain at Heston Airport in September 1938. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My good friends, for the second time in our history, a British Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honour. I believe it is peace for our time."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"There will be peace in our time," remarks a human diplomat after signing a treaty with the Centauri, who later invade many planets surrounding their own territory.</p>
<p>Sheridan ponders Churchill's Coventry dilemma. This is the classic 'Do I save lives now, knowing that it will give away to the enemy, that we have broken their code/have spies in place and will likely cost lives in the future and extend the war' dilemma. Churchill himself only faced this dilemma generally. After all, how would he know how bad the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry_Blitz_ccd0.html" title="Coventry Blitz">Coventry raid</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">14 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>) would be, beforehand. Unfortunately for Sheridan, this widely believed tale is an urban myth - the truth is that Churchill was made aware that a German bombing raid was planned but it was assumed that the target would be London. It was only minutes before the attack took place that Coventry was identified as the true target.</p>

<p>Despite JMS's professed atheism, Babylon 5 contains many references to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> ideas. Several episode titles refer, directly or indirectly, to elements of the Christian faith, notably the third season episode "<a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing_Through_Gethsemane_a977.html" title="Passing Through Gethsemane">Passing Through Gethsemane</a>", but also "<a href="../../../a/_/v/A_Voice_in_the_Wilderness_b657.html" title="A Voice in the Wilderness">A Voice in the Wilderness</a>" and "<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Rock_Cried_Out%2C_No_Hiding_Place_ecc7.html" title="And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place">And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place</a>" (which is also the title of a lively gospel song). Moreover, the monks led by <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brother_Theo_6dbc.html" title="Brother Theo">Brother Theo</a> may not be explicitly Christian, but certainly seem based on Christian monastic orders. Overall, Babylon 5 strove for even-handedness in its treatment of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religions</a>, notably in the multi-faith gatherings in the episodes "And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place" and "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Parliament_of_Dreams_c8df.html" title="The Parliament of Dreams">The Parliament of Dreams</a>", although arguably the appearance of <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosh.html" title="Kosh">Kosh</a> in the guise of a Christian angel was intentionally subversive.</p>
