<p>Your continuous removal of the Persian language from Iranian province pages can be considered vandalism. On what basis do you remove this information? It is a known fact that Persian is spoken through out Iran, and many people speak Persian as well as their mother tongues.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 15:32, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We speak here about a language which is spoken by a substantial part of the population as their language. Persian is defintely not spoken at this level all over Iran. BTW do you know, who is the guy who is removing all non-Persian languages from Iranian provinces? Is that not worse to remove a native language of a substantial part of the residents? Babakexorramdin 16:36, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I was not there when that was happening. You cannot say that Persian is not spoken because Persian IS spoken in all provinces of Iran. Do you have some kind of agenda? Have you even been to Iran? I have, Persian is spoken in every Iranian city, along with the local languages. Everyone in Iran knows how to speak Persian and they do speak it.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 17:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not say that persian is not spoken on the national level./ I ask the question from you, if you have a national agenda? Why are there people here to create ethnic tension, by acting as intolrant towards non-Persian Iranians? Why dont you take action towards those who run a crusade towards ethnic groups of Iran? Why so selective? I personally am at odd with both, with the separatists and their masters and idelogues (Brenda Shaffers etc...)and towards the Tehrani arrogants and Fars chauvinists, all these people are doing their best to make a Yugoslavia out of Iran. Iran has been a pluriform country for 1000s of years, we are happy about it, and take pride in it, and I assure you that the overwhelming majority of Iranians wants to keep it this way.Therfoer all these attempts by the separatists and fars chauvinists/ tehrani arrogants are doomed to fail, but they cost us too much energy and are likely to cause conflicts&#160;:( Babakexorramdin 18:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only one with an apparent "agenda" here is you, claiming that Persian is not spoken throughout Iran. Persian is spoken all over Iran, <b>and there is nothing wrong with this</b>. All of this "who speaks what and who is who" are all political tools used against Iran. <b>Persian is spoken all over Iran by all the different ethnic groups, along with those ethnic groups' mother tongues</b>. And by the way, Tehrani's are made up of all the people from all over Iran. Infact, at least 1/3 of the city's population is Azeri, and there are Persians, Kurds, Arabs, etc... all living there also, so how can you claim that Tehrani's are "Fars chauvinists"? The only one trying to incite ethnic tension here is you. Lastly, why would "Fars chauvinists" want to break up Iran? In fact, the term "Fars chauvinist" in my opinion, is also a political tool used against Iran, simply because they make up the majority. If you are Iranian, you would know that Khamenei is Azeri, not Persian, and Iran's parliament as well as the cabinet of the president are made up of people from all corners of Iran. Our defense minister used to be Arab under Khatami. <b>Infact, The minorities in Iran have far more cultural and linguistic rights than those in Turkey, or Baathist Iraq, or Afghanistan under the Taleban, etc...</b> I laughed so hard when people from Turkey and Azerbaijan Republic were claiming that the cartoon incident showed "Fars chauvinism" when in fact <b>the cartoonist who made the cartoon was Azeri himself!</b> You have to be careful not to get sucked into the political tools of people who are trying to split up Iran. You claiming that Persian isnt spoken in the provinces of Iran is like claiming that Russian is not spoken in all the provinces of Russia, or that Turkish isnt spoken in the Kurdish regions of Turkey, or that Azeri isnt spoken in the Talysh regions of Azerbaijan Republic.

<p>Some of his removals were fine, such as "Swahili" in Hormozgan (simply absurd to call it a "main language"). Also, it appears that there are multiple IPs on both sides of these conflicts. Are you also editing under the IP 86.86.252.228? The anonymous guy's IPs appear to be 83.250.67.40 and 83.250.75.190 . If you really think you have a good case for persistent vandalism, you can try <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, but you may prefer to go through <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>.

<p>Yes I sometimes edit without being registered. On Swahili I have mixed feelings. The reports are conflicting. Probably there is a Pidgin spoken by the Zangis who speak a mixture of Hormozgani Persian, Arabic and Swahili. I think we should replace languages, by ethnic groups:, it will solve some problems. Usually ethnic groups who do not speak certain langauge still retain an ethnic identity. But then we should be consisten about what is a regional, and what is a purely ethnic identity. It remains arbitrary. Baut how should I report the guy? BTW how can we know from which country he posts? Can we see it from his IP? Babakexorramdin 20:03, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You must understand that Persian is spoken everywhere in Iran, it is the official language if you din't know that. I deleted what Babakexorramdin was writing as wrong information such as that Georgian and Armenian is spoken in Markazi and Isfahan province etc.. And who can be so ingnorant to write that Swahili is spoken in Hormozgan province? (anonymous)</p>

<dd>Georgian and Armenian is spoken in Esfahan province. Armenian only in Markazi. That is what I said. and you better stop vandalize ifo,. I said where in Esfahan Georgian is spoken and where in Hormozgan and Kerman Baluchi are spoken. I also said that there exist a Pidgin language, of which one of the components is Swahili. Have you ever heared of the Zangi of Hormozgan? And still you did not register, which shows your lack of courage. Babakexorramdin 20:56, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not delete Persian from every province. But Persian is defintely not the native lanhguage of certain provinces in Iran. And your knowledge is limmited. What is your problems, with georgians and Armenians, Azeris, Kurds and Baluchis? And you have not been to Iran seemingly. The biggest share of Qomi population is consisted of migrants from all parts of IUran, a big portion of whom speak Azeri. Have you ever asked yourself where those Azeri clergy has studied?

<dd>I took Balouchi out because you did not provide a source that it is a main language. I doubt the population is that significant in that province.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 22:58, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I pronided a link. I did not intentionally quoted the baluchi site, but it could be read in the article about the music, moreover you see the distribution of Baluchi in these maps <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Iran_peoples.jpg" class="external free" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Iran_peoples.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Iran_peoples.jpg</a></p>

<p>Although I do not want to popularize these maps which are made by non-Iranians and contain much inaccuracies (eg. Kurds in Xorasan are shia and not sunni! Not Arabs in Hormozgan, but black population speaks a pidgin based on Persian, Swahili and Arabic, etc...), I say that one shouuld rely more on original research than the secondary material because it is more reliable, but ok you wanted that I play the game, and I did, so it is on you not to get involve in an unnecessay and detrimental virtual ethnic war!

<p>Babakexorramdin you are stupid, so there are about 10-15 azeris that have studied in Qom so it is not one of the main languages of Qom, there are even more arabs in Qom than there are azeris. I DONT have any propblems with armenian or kurds or azeri etc... I am just writing the right information. And persian is one of the main lanuages in every province just like Azerbaijani has said.Mohammed180</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments. َAbout Esfahan the overwhelming language is of course Persian speaking but as you mentioned there are Georgian, Armenian, Qashqai and Bakhtiari. I think in such articles we should mention the overwhelming language and then put also Georgian, Armenian, Qashqai, Bakhtiari.. به ویکیپیدا خوش آمدید.</p>
