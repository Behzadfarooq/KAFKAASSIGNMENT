	    <p><b>Babylon 5 CCG</b> is a discontinued <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collectible_card_game.html" title="Collectible card game">collectible card game</a> set in the universe of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sci-fi.html" title="Sci-fi">sci-fi</a> television series <i><a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a></i>. This CCG is distinct from most others of the genre for being specifically designed to be played by more than two players. The gameplay tends to have strong political elements, appropriately for a game based on a series with such a strong element of political intrigue. The CCG was released by Precedence Entertainment until late 2001 when Warner Brothers chose not to renew Precedence's licence to produce the game. The company went out of business in 2002. Precedence also released CCG's based on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Jordan_3ca0.html" title="Robert Jordan">Robert Jordan</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wheel_of_Time_a73a.html" title="The Wheel of Time">The Wheel of Time</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomb_Raider_96ef.html" title="Tomb Raider">Tomb Raider</a></i> computer game, among others.</p>

<p>Each player in the game assumes control of a specific faction, represented by one of the four main races in the TV series - <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_%28Babylon_5%29_f150.html" title="Human (Babylon 5)">Human</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minbari.html" title="Minbari">Minbari</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centauri.html" title="Centauri">Centauri</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narn.html" title="Narn">Narn</a>. Later expansions allowed people to control the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Non-Aligned_Worlds_e4c3.html" title="League of Non-Aligned Worlds">League of Non-Aligned Worlds</a> as well as separate "Home Factions" of the four main races. The <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorlons.html" title="Vorlons">Vorlons</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_%28Babylon_5%29_0099.html" title="Shadow (Babylon 5)">Shadows</a>, although not a playable race in their own right, are available as supporting characters and fleets, as are <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a>, the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drakh.html" title="Drakh">Drakh</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstellar_Alliance_%28Babylon_5%29_46ae.html" title="Interstellar Alliance (Babylon 5)">Interstellar Alliance</a>. The object of the game is to use various agendas, events and conflict cards to build power and influence points for your faction. Actions in the game have to be carried out by the characters that you control, for example if you only have one character in play you can only initiate one action per turn. Unless otherwise stated, Characters can only perform one action per turn. Politics and alliances between players become very important in a multiplayer game, in fact there are certain cards which require the calling of a player vote in order to pass. If one person seems to be surging ahead, the other players will often band together to prevent him from winning. The makers of the game deliberately incorporated roleplaying elements into the game to try and give the feel that the participants are telling the story of Babylon 5. Although not strictly necessary, players are encouraged to take on the persona of their Ambassador and develop an in-game narrative to explain why they are playing the cards they are.</p>
<p><a name="The_Round" id="The_Round"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5_Collectible_Card_Game_6fc1.html" title="Edit section: The Round">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Round</span></h2>
<p>Each player begins with a starting hand which includes their Ambassador and 3 other cards of the players choice, a draw deck of cards (45 or more) and 4 influence points. Each player takes it in turns to initiate conflicts and spend influence points to bring different cards in their hand into play, then uses those cards to try and either build up more influence for themeselves or prevent other players from building up influence. When everyone has done everything they want to do, any conflicts in play are resolved, points are allocated and players have the opportunity to play Aftermath cards. Finally, all players draw a card from their draw deck and take it into their hand.</p>
<p>Example: A Narn player decides to play a Diplomacy Conflict against a Minbari player. The card specifies that if the Narn player wins, he will gain 1 influence point. In order to win, the Narn must put more diplomacy points into the conflict than the Minbari. The Minbari player, not wanting the Narn to gain the extra influence, chooses to oppose the conflict. The characters available to the Narn player have a combined diplomacy of 8, whereas the Minbari players available characters have a combined diplomacy of 10. The Narn player puts all his diplomacy points into the conflict, but the Minbari is still winning by 2 diplomacy points. The Human player decides to help the Narn and supports the conflict with 4 of his own diplomacy points. The Narn player wins by 2, and increases his influence rating by 1 point.</p>
<p>Play continues in this manner until one player either reaches 20 power/influence points or fulfills a specific game-winning criteria.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Aftermath</dt>
<dd>Cards which are played at the end of the round by any players who won a conflict. Aftermaths can be played either on yourself to raise your own cards abilities, or on your opponents cards to lower their abilities</dd>
<dt>Agenda&#160;</dt>
<dd>These cards often contain text stipulating what a player must achieve to win the game. They also grant bonuses to your own cards, for example giving characters a stat bonus or increasing the strength of a players fleets</dd>
<dt>Character&#160;</dt>
<dd>Each card features a character from the TV series and includes a short explanation of what the character can do in the game as well as a side bar indicating what stats they possess. A characters stats are based on 4 values - Diplomacy, Intrigue, Psi, and Leadership. The main character in a deck is known as the Ambassador, and acts as the players avatar in the game.</dd>
<dt>Conflict&#160;</dt>
<dd>Conflicts are the main way in which players build up influence points. At the start of the round, Players can declare a conflict either on one of their opponents or (if the card allows) on themselves. There are 4 main types - Diplomacy, Intrigue, Psi and Military. Each conflict can only be supported or opposed using it's specified stat ie: Diplomacy conflicts use a characters Diplomacy stat. Military conflicts can only be supported by Fleets.</dd>
<dt>Contingency</dt>
<dd>A special type of card that is played on a card already in play and usually remains hidden until the card it is played on is affected. These cards usually negate the action that an opponent has played on that card, such as preventing a character from being neutralised. Sometime the card will state that the effects of the opponents action are reversed</dd>
<dt>Enhancement</dt>
<dd>Improves a targeted card of the specified type, usually with a stat bonus. Most cards that remain in play (characters, agendas, fleets etc) can be enhanced.</dd>
<dt>Event</dt>
<dd>Can be played at any time during the round, by any player. Event cards are usually played in order to disrupt an opponents current playing strategy or enhance your own.</dd>
<dt>Fleet</dt>
<dd>Military conflicts can only be initiated by an available Fleet card. Fleets, like characters, can also be used to target an opponents fleets and characters in order to try and damage them, impairing their abilities or removing them from play.</dd>
<dt>Group</dt>
<dd>Similar to Characters, groups are often used to enhance the stats of characters</dd>
<dt>Location</dt>
<dd>Locations are planets or space lanes that grant bonuses to the faction as a whole. For example, Homeworld locations can be used to double the amount of influence gained from winning a conflict. Locations have a military value and can oppose Military conflicts if they are the targeted.</dd>
