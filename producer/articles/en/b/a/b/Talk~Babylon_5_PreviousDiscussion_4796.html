	    <p>I think the section regarding the use of language is not particularly well written and of disputable accuracy (with regard to the pronunciations of 'Garibaldi' and 'Ivanova', and also with the incorrect assertion that 'Michael' is exclusively an English name). I think it should be heavily trimmed, or simply have what useful commentary it contains moved to other sections (such as the bio's of the relevent characters. I'll leave it up to others to see if they agree with me on this though. FridayUK</p>
<p>I think the diversion into B5's story relationship to LOTR is excessive and rather pointlessly off-topic. I am strongly inclined to edit it down to 1 paragraph or less. MartinSpamer</p>

<p>This is a general topic, but I figured this is where to start. I've begun working on a couple of character pages slowly (Refa and Morden so far), but many of the character pages could really use some attention. G'Kar or Londo, for example, are practically stubs.

<p>I moved the new <b>Music scoring</b> section down to just before <b>The episodes</b> because it had been added illogically within the section on <b>Cast and characters</b>, which includes <b>Babylon stations</b>. After looking over the current state of the article, it seemed to me that the flow from characters to stations to civilizations to themes seemed to work well. The episodes section seemed like a change of subject and a logical place to add the new music section. I hope this suits everyone. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 20:52, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Visual evidence trumps any discussions, regardless of who is doing the discussing. I will provide such evidence to the page shortly. To put it quite simply, JMS lied so that geeks who think widescreen is cool would buy the DVDs. Legend of the Rangers is the only B5 that was intended for widescreen from the start.</p>
<p>Ibuki 18:12, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to my recollection of forum discussions at the time, the live-action portions of B5 were filmed in widescreen, with the pictures composed so that no significant action occurred outside the normal 4:3 format window, while the CGI was recorded in 4:3 only.</p>

      normal aspect ratio; from day one, the series has been shot in widescreen

Are the computer Fx also in widescreen?   I know Foundation used
LW and the PAR device to put the graphics to tape.   But as far as
I know the PAR can't put down widescreen stuff unless you screw
around with the output resolution?

      We'd pretty much have to re-render the CGI for important shots,
while more mundane stuff where there's nothing in the upper and lower
parts of the frame could be safely cropped and lose nothing.

All of these references are written by JMS or by fans operating under JMS, Babylonian or WB's misinformation. To paraphrase a cliché, video doesn't lie. It'll be a few days before I have time to capture the appropriate footage for the side-by-side comparison, but I'll put it up soon.</p>

<dd>I've removed the other paragraph, which read</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The DVD releases of Babylon 5 are matted for a widescreen presentation. This effect is achieved by deleting the top and bottom portion of the video frame to conform to a 16x9 aspect ratio. In cropping Babylon 5, shot composition was in many cases destroyed. Characters are often conversing without the tops of their heads or chins in frame, and in one scene-damaging example, a fighter placed along a huge explorer ship to provide a sense of scale has been matted out of the frame.</i></p>

<p>I was the poster of that paragraph. I've tried to make it less confrontational and made my description of the evidence clearer.(see below), and I will produce some screenshots tonight. Unfortunately, I do not have a DVD copy of "A Distant Star", so my screenshots will come from a first season episode.</p>
<p><i>Whether it results from an error in the DVD production process or that false assertions were made concerning the show's being filmed in widescreen, an examination of off-air recordings from the original run or early VHS releases as compared to the 16:9 DVD releases will show that the 16:9 footage is simply a matted version of the original 4:3 footage. This has the effect of damaging shot compositions cutting the tops of characters' heads and their chins out of frame in closeups, and in the episode <a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Distant_Star_cf19.html" title="A Distant Star">A Distant Star</a>, a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfury.html" title="Starfury">Starfury</a> that was shown flying below the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explorer_class_starship.html" title="Explorer class starship">Explorer class starship</a> to give a sense of the immense size of the latter vessel is matted out of the frame.</i></p>
<p>Also, I don't believe this is original research. Anyone with a warner home video VHS release from the 1990s and a recent DVD release can view the evidence for themselves. If I tell you the sky is blue, you can verify my statement by looking out your window. All the skeptic needs to do is to look at the evidence and the facts become clear.</p>

<p>It's not "False" to say that a program is shot in widescreen when the original negative is 4:3. This is common practice for cinema. The Back to the Future movies are shot like this too, and would fail the "side by side' comparison test that is mentioned above. When producing a 4:3 version of a film, it is far better (when possible) to expand the image into areas not seen on the movie screen then to crop out the sides that were seen. Pan-and-scan solutions are only necessary if the original negative is not 4:3, or if the expanded areas were not monitored and include cables, microphones and the like. Ironically, my criticism of the B5 widescreen version was precisely the opposite of the poster above. Studio shots were expanded into useless empty areas when they ought to have been cropped to compose the actors better.</p>
<p>HD Net showed widescreen HD versions of Hogan's Heros! (yes, the '60s TV show) It was surreal how well this worked. It must have been done entirely by cropping the 4:3 master, but visually I couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. I think that the B5 re-master just didn't get the same effort. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 15:59, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a piece of trivia in the article, about the fact every alien race has developed a dish similar to our Swedish Meaballs. I'm not saying it's not interesting, but... could anyone tell me how it fits in the "Love and true seekers" subsection of the show's themes?</p>
<p>Also, Lenier mentionned that a word occured in every alien vocabulary, but with a different meaning every time. I forget the word. If anyone wants to look it up, it was in a discussion between Lenier and Molary in the Season 1 episode where Molary tries to improve relations with the Membari by taking Lenier out drinking and playing poker. My point is, shouldn't both pieces of trivia be mentionned together?</p>

<p>Maybe I'm begging for a beating by asking this here, but: as a user of wikipedia, I think the "One article per each episode" is sort of overwhelming. I don't like it for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It clutters up the namespace (example: while searching for "The Summoning", the video game, I end up at "The Summoning", the Bab5 episode. Given the huge number of episodes, that's significant.</li>
<li>Each individual article doesn't contain all that much data, but has lots of metadata.</li>
<li>The entire project is <i>completely duplicative</i> of The Lurker's Guide. If this was on a Bab5 wiki it would make sense, but I think it's a hell of a lot of overhead to jam into a general-purpose encyclopedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I entirely alone in this, or are there other people who think that this might be overdoing it a bit? If there's consensus on this, I'd like to propose the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change all wikilinks in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Babylon_5_episodes_eb58.html" title="List of Babylon 5 episodes">List of Babylon 5 episodes</a> to point to their corresponding Lurker's Guide entries.</li>
<li>Mass delete all of the wikilinked per-episode articles, perhaps making an exception for the pilot movie.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts?

<dd>As a B5 fan myself (well, a fan of at least seasons 2-4) I'm personally happy to see an editable mirror of the Lurker's Guide material. Much of that site was written in "real time" as the episodes originally aired, and it's interesting to see what people have to add to descriptions of the episodes in retrospect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, as a Wikipedia editor, I'm not sure <i>Wikipedia</i> is the best place for an episode-by-episode guide to Babylon 5. This is an encyclopedia, and though I personally rather like B5, to someone else it's fancruft. Perhaps the episode pages should be "transwikied" into Wikibooks or another Wikimedia project.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>They shouldn't be deleted wholesale -- it's certainly useful to have such articles around. If they can't be arranged to be moved to Wikibooks or some other wiki, they should stay. But if they <i>can</i>, it would probably be better. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 19:40, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry for the late reply, I only saw this today... I'd have to say that I totally disagree with changing wikilinks to point off Wikipedia because since there is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> on Wikipedia everything here is already out there somewhere. The point of Wikipedia is collate useful information here rather than simply point people elsewhere. That said, I also don't think it's particular useful to have one article for each episode. What I think would be best is to organise the episodes into omnibus articles (as per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>) for each season, rather like they have for <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episodes_of_Lost_%28Season_1%29_8859.html" title="Episodes of Lost (Season 1)">Lost season 1 episode guide</a> then put the Lurkers guide in as an external link at the end. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 13:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I like the idea of making episode guides into wikibooks. I don't see a pressing need to remove the episode articles, especially considering how common it is; Babylon 5 is hardly a serious offender if it is a concern. Episode articles also exist for both <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate.html" title="Stargate">Stargate</a> series, and all six series from the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> franchise. If a decision to move away from per-episode articles is made, it seems consistency would encourage doing the same for other TV series as well. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattmcc_1527.html" title="User:Mattmcc">Mattmcc</a> 22:00, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I vote to keep them all. To address the original points: 1) the namespace impact is minimal: there are millions of articles. 2&amp;3) They may have once been duplicative, but through the magic of Wikipedia, content has been added, corrections made, etc. Overall, I think B5 is fairly well organized and data-rich on Wikipedia: there are far worse offenders out there. B5 episodes also tend to *matter* a lot more than other shows (due to their serial nature and complexity), so if any series deserves individual pages, B5 surely does. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 23:03, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This clearly occurred <i>before</i> Sinclair was captured in the Battle of the Line, where the Minbari took Sinclair aboard ostensibly to examine one of the race they were about to exterminate. I don't have the DVDs of <i>B5:ItB</i> and B5 Seasons 1 and 2 (where the Sinclair incident is first described within the actual series) handy to check on the apparent discrepancy.

<dd>No Sinclair was the first human the Minbari ever interrogated/examined not contact. The war had been going on for years by this point so it seems unreasonable that no contact would have been made (especially since there was ground combat going on between the two sides). Sinclair was the first human they used a triluminary on, and hence the first time they ever had the oppurtunity to see that they had Minbari souls. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 06:59, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It is possible that the scan showed up specifically in Sinclair due to him having Valen's soul and thus it being more obvious (especially since Valen was the one who provided the triluminaries in the first place). However Delenn does state that they brought more humans on board and they all the scans showed the thing, that Minbari souls were being reborn in Humanity. Sheriden was never scanned with the triluminary, Sheriden was the first one scanned hence they didn't find out until that point. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 09:57, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Sinclair was the first human the Minbari (or at least the Grey Council) had ever met, having come this far for the final victory. The Earth Explorer vessel was part of a military fleet that encountered a Minbari convoy, there was a miscommunication, a misperceived threat, and our ships opened fire. There was no person-to-person contact.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I suggest that we can interpret the show's creator's statement, along with the events portrayed in <i>B5:ItB</i>, to infer that the <i>Grey Council</i> had had no direct contact with humans until Sinclair, and that although the Minbari were later (our time) shown to have had direct contact with humans (<i>B5:ItB</i>), it was brief and unrevealing (as you point out about the triluminary).

<p>I wanted to post this personal observation but didn't think I should do so in the main article area.</p>
<p>When I was learning about writing styles in college, we were told to choose a number of interweaving story threads depending on the target audience (lower for children). For example, on most TV sitcoms the number is usually 2 or 3, although some shows like Seinfeld were higher. In a 2005 Arthur C. Clarke novel (Sunstorm) it seemed to vary between 4 and 5. When watching episodes of Babylon 5 I have counted up to 6 threads (but there may have been mini threads I missed) so I must infer that this program was definitely targeted to adults.</p>

<dd>Interesting. Did your course make any attempt to differentiate between the ages and development stages of the child audience? It sounds like it undersells the ability of children (especially non-preschoolers) to absorb complex stories, just like they must absorb life itself, which is very complex. This ought to be even more true for a story like <i>Babylon 5</i>, which goes to great lengths to weave its many storylines together, rather <i>unlike</i> life sometimes. ☺ Kids can't be expected to understand everything they read or watch, but unlike adults, they tend to have a much higher tolerance for and adaptability to things they don't fully understand, probably out of sheer necessity. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 06:55, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No the course did not mention differentiation but I should also point out that I was in college studying to become an Electronic Technologist and maybe professional writers would have receviced more training in this area. On the flip side, you can see a limited number of threads in general TV programs which makes you wonder what the networks think about general public's IQ level. On a related point, a Lutheran minister recently told me that he enjoys preaching at a local university more than in his own pulpit; I asked him to elaborate on this and he told me that they are taught to speak to the common literacy level of the target audience which is usually grade 8 for the general public (this included things like: children in the audience, immigrants still mastering English, functional illiteracy in adults, etc.).</p>

<li>I am thinking of removing this section entirely. It seems to be a combination of stuff repeated elsewhere and unverified stuff.

<p>There are some serious issues with how this article has been written. It's so obviously written by someone who adores the show that it strays perilously close to being NPOV. Now it's a fine show, but this article sounds more like an advertisement for the DVD set than an encyclopedia entry. It needs to be throughly cleaned up. RossTaben 3:55pm PST 12.20.2005</p>

<p>I'm a fan of "Babylon 5", so I haven't read the article in its entirety until now. Since the person who started this topic wasn't kind enough to point out where this article should be improved but instead gave a "thumbs down", I'm going to give specifics. If I don't comment on a paragraph, it is good (or I missed something ;-)).</p>
<ol>
<li>Opening paragraph should summarize what is covered in more detail later. In this case, the overall summary of the series. The second paragraph should have the airing history. The awards should be mentioned in one of the two paragraphs, probably the second one.</li>
<li>"Concept" section: I don't think that there is enough information in this section to warrant the "spoiler" warning. The third paragraph seems to be a near-quotation from JMS. Find references to this, and put quotations around it if it is an actual quotation. The rest of the section also seems to need references to JMS's postings to Usenet and the internet.</li>
<li>"Cast and primary characters": Since there are some sections below this that belong ("Ethnicity and language of characters" and "Usage of English"), I think that this section should be named "Cast and characters" with "Cast and primary characters" the first subsection underneath that. The section "Civilizations" should also be moved under this section. "Babylon 5 stations" should be moved up in to "Concept" section. The "Babylon 5 stations" third paragraph needs a reference. "Ethnicity ..." section has a colon that should be a period. "Usage of English": The first "speak" should be "vocalize" or something like it.</li>
<li>"Civilizations" has been cut down too much. The five main civilizations should at least be listed.</li>
<li>"Themes" section needs to reexamined to see if it needs to be here, and rewritten if it is to stay. This is good for followers of the series, but confusing for people who haven't seen it.</li>
<li>"Authoritarianism ..." section is a bit chaotic. I understand what you're saying because I watched the show. But someone reading the article won't understand it.</li>
<li>"War and peace" section doesn't flow well. The final three paragraphs need to be reworded. The third from the last sounds like a quotation, so it should be properly referenced. And how do we know about these future wars if they were outside of the duration of the series. (I know about the made-for-television movies and the final episode, but readers of this article won't.)</li>
<li>"The Five Questions" section is very good. It stands out so much that I thought that I'd mention it. The only thing is that maybe the transitional question should be last, unless there is a reason to keep them in this order.</li>
<li>"Novels ..." section says "per Straczynski's own remarks", so this should be sourced.</li>
<li>"DVDs" section should have "Mastering problems" as a subsection.</li>
<li>Perhaps, "DVDs", "Video games" and "Other merchandise" should all appear as subsections under another section title.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that these suggestions are taken as they are meant, as suggestions to improve this article. I am familiar with having to find the quotations from JMS himself. I remember some of the things that he said, but I couldn't find quite what I remembered. But I did find enough to be able to put in JMS's information about DS9 (Paramount executives not Berman and Pillar) "borrowing" from the B5 concepts that he'd shared with them. Also, I don't have the DVD's to look up some of the things that are in the series itself.

<dd>How so? How can an article that states numerous positive aspects of a show, without mentioning a single negative, aside from a trivial complaint about the remastering done on the dvd, be considered neutral. To be neutral the article must either completely shun any comments on the quality at all, or provide a balanced viewpoint. In fact I do not seem to be the first person to question the neutrality of this article. Perhaps my concerns do have more merit than you think. I suppose this really is a subjective issue, I should not have spoken in absolutes.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Particularly I have trouble with the following paragraph:</p>
<p>'Having long been a science fiction fan himself, Straczynski was determined to produce a science fiction series for adults where, for once, things would be done properly: consistent technology, "no kids or cute robots", no new "particle of the week" to tie up a plot. It was not a utopian future — there is greed and homelessness. It was not a place where everything was the same at the end of the day — main characters grow, develop, live, and die. An unabashedly political show, it was always ready to deal with politics, sex, religion, and philosophy.'</p>
<p>This comment is clearly a slight at the Star Trek franchise, and it should be removed as it could hardly be considered neutral. Also I would like to point out that none of the authors of the Wikipedia articles regarding Star Trek felt it necessary to poke fun at Babylon 5, or any other shows for that matter.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a slight at Star Trek at all, unless you are obsessed with it yet have a very low opinion of it coupled with a severe victim complex. Nowhere does the passage say, or even hint at Trek or any other show. Just like Trek articles don't "poke fun" at B5, this article follows the same standard (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babylon_5&amp;diff=32950392&amp;oldid=32771741" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babylon_5&amp;diff=32950392&amp;oldid=32771741" rel="nofollow">though the same cannot be said for certain Trek fans...</a>). --Jeffrey O.

<dl>
<dd>Fair enough, however I am not certain that a comment comparing B5 favourably to any other sci fi show (the comment may not have been directed at any one show, but they are targeted at other sci fi shows in general.) is central to understanding what the show is about. Especially not comments that seem designed to portray other shows in a negative light. (I think it would be difficult to deny that this comment does attempt to point out negatives in other non-specified shows)
<dl>
<dd>That is one interpretaion of the text, though I believe it simply highlights positive aspects of the show rather than targeting anyone. --Jeffrey O.

<p>If this is a reprhasing of a quote from one of the creators, or of a legitimate television critic, it should be cited as such. If it is simply the opinion of the author, it has no business being in the article, and should be removed or reprhased.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is a quote from <i>the</i> creator, executive producer, and writer of <i>91</i> episodes.

<p>Also I am surprised that there is no criticism section to the article. I'm sure it is an excellent show, but I somehow doubt that absolutely no one had anything negative to say about it at all.

<p>As first, why is the Babylon 5 station sometimes shown as blue coloured (mostly), and sometimes a green-white coloured, similar to Babylon 4 (only few times; for instance in the 1 or 2 episode) ??</p>
<p>And as second, do you know that part, when Sheridan throws the teddy-bear (with "JF" initials) out of the station ... Why did it do that ?? I somehow speculated that because JF could also mean Jeffery Sinclair (beside John Sheridan), and that this has made Sheridan mad/jealous. Any thoughts ??</p>

<p>As a fan of primarily star trek, i'm certainly familiar with the idea that the science in science fiction is <i>wischi waschi</i> at times, but this doesn't offer sufficient context, as the page to which it refers does not make immediately obvious what the sentence is talking about. I believe it's referring to something about the fact that sound does not technically carry in a vacuum; I'm not familiar enough to elaborate myself. Perhaps adding clarification here or adding a section to one of the relevant science-related pages (<a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtonian_mechanics.html" title="Newtonian mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a>?) could help clear things up. --<a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedek_Dukat_38e9.html" title="User:Vedek Dukat"><span style="color:blue;">Vedek Dukat</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/e/d/User_talk%7EVedek_Dukat_538f.html" title="User talk:Vedek Dukat"><span style="color:green;">Talk</span></a></sup> 18:59, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>From my experience, it tends to be about half and half (in terms of learning British or American English in school). Most Western Europeans I know speak British English, while most people from East Europe and elsewhere speak American English. Regardless of the actual wordwide statistic, the comment should be taken out. B5 takes place 250 years in the future, so modern day language demographics aren't applicable.

<dd>True, Russia does technically extend into Asia... John Matheson isn't Babylon 5, and Takashima was not really a central character to the series. Ivanova, though, probably applies.RowennaG 07:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone have any examples of people citing Babylon 5 as raising the bar for scifi television? I did a search but did not find anything relevant. Ideally I would like to see something from someone independent of the production. <a href="../../../e/i/l/User%7EEiler7_942b.html" title="User:Eiler7">Eiler7</a> 19:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
