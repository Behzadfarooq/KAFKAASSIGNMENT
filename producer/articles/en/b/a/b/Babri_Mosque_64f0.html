<p>The <b>Babri Mosque</b> (<a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu_language.html" title="Urdu language">Urdu</a>: <span lang="ur" dir="rtl" style="white-space: nowrap;" xml:lang="ur">بابری مسجد</span>‎, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi_language.html" title="Hindi language">Hindi</a>: <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">बाबरी मस्जिद</span>), or <b>Mosque of Babur</b> was a <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a> constructed by order of the first <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal.html" title="Mughal">Mughal</a> emperor of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>, in <a href="../../../a/y/o/Ayodhya.html" title="Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a> in the 16th century. Before the 1940s, the mosque was called <b>Masjid-i Janmasthan</b> ("mosque of the birthplace").<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The mosque stood on <i>Ramkot</i> ("Rama's fort") Hill (also called <i>Janmasthan</i> ("Birthplace"). It was destroyed by <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> activists in a riot on December 6, 1992.</p>
<p>It is believed that <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>'s commander-in-chief <b>Mir Baki</b> destroyed an existing temple at the site, which Hindus believe was the temple built to commemorate the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthplace_of_Rama_0744.html" title="Birthplace of Rama">birthplace</a> of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Rama</a>, an incarnation of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> and ruler of Ayodhya (<i>See <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram_Janmabhoomi_bec9.html" title="Ram Janmabhoomi">Ram Janmabhoomi</a>.</i>). Interestingly the mosque shared a wall with a <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Rama</a> Temple. The Babri Mosque was one of the largest mosques in <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttar_Pradesh_a21c.html" title="Uttar Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, a state in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> with some thirteen million <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a>. Although there were several older mosques in the city of Ayodhya, an area with a substantial Muslim population, including the Hazrat Bal Mosque constructed by the Shariqi kings, the Babri Mosque became the largest, due to the importance of the disputed site.</p>

<p>The rulers of the Sultanate of Delhi and its successor <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mugal_Empire_42f3.html" title="Mugal Empire">Mugal Empire</a> were great patrons of art and architecture and constructed many fine tombs, mosques and madrasas. These have a distinctive style which bears influences of 'later Tughlaq' architecture. Mosques all over India were built in different styles; the most elegant styles developed in areas where indigenous art traditions were strong and local artisans were highly skilled. Thus regional or provincial styles of mosques grew out of local temple or domestic styles, which were conditioned in their turn by climate, terrain, materials, hence the enormous difference between the mosques of Bengal, Kashmir and Gujarat. The Babri Mosque followed the architectural school of Jaunpur.</p>
<p>Babri is an important mosque of a distinct style, preserved mainly in architecture, developed after the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi_Sultanate_d051.html" title="Delhi Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> was established (1192). The square CharMinar of Hyderabad (1591) with large arches, arcades, and minarets is typical. This art made extensive use of stone and reflected Indian adaptation to Muslim rule, until Mughals art replaced it in the 17th century, as typified by structures like the <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Mahal_9d41.html" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional hypostyle plan with an enclosed courtyard, imported from Western Asia was generally associated with the introduction of Islam in new areas, but was abandoned in favour of schemes more suited to local climate and needs. The Babri Masjid was a mixture of the local influence and the Western Asian style and examples of this type of mosque are common in India.</p>
<p>The Babri Mosque was a large imposing structure with three domes, one central and two secondary. It is surrounded by two high walls, running parallel to each other and enclosing a large central courtyard with a deep well, which was known for its cold and sweet water. On the high entrance of the domed structure are fixed two stone tablets which bear two inscriptions in Persian declaring that this structure was built by one Mir Baqi on the orders of Babur. The walls of the Babri Mosque are made of coarse-grained whitish sandstone blocks, rectangular in shape, while the domes are made of thin and small burnt bricks. Both these structural ingredients are plastered with thick chunam paste mixed with coarse sand.</p>

<p>The Central Courtyard was surrounded by lavishly curved columns superimposed to increase the height of the ceilings. The plan and the architecture followed the Begumpur Friday mosque of Jahanpanah rather than the Moghul style where Hindu masons used their own <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trabeated.html" title="Trabeated">trabeated</a> structural and decorative traditions. The excellence of their craftsmanship is noticeable in their vegetal scrolls and lotus patterns. These motifs are also present in the Firuz Shah Mosque in Firuzabad (c.1354) now in a ruined state, Qila Kuhna Mosque (c.1540, The Darasbari Mosque in the Southern suburb of the walled city of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaur%2C_West_Bengal_78d2.html" title="Gaur, West Bengal">Gaur</a>, and the Jamali Kamili Mosque built by Sher Shah Suri this was the forerunner of the Indo Islamic style adopted by Akbar.</p>
<p>The Babri Masjid with its bold and graceful style was universally praised and widely followed.</p>

<p>"A whisper from the Babri Masjid Mihrab could be heard clearly at the other end 200 feet [60 m] away and through the length and breadth of the central court" according to Graham Pickford architect to Lord William Bentinck (1828–1833) The Mosque's acoustics were mentioned by him in his book 'Historic Structures of Oudhe' he says “for a 16th century building the deployment and projection of voice from the pulpit is considerably advanced, the unique deployment of sound in this structure will astonish the visitor”.</p>
<p>Modern Architects have attributed this intriguing acoustic feature to a large recess in the wall of the Mihrab and several recesses in the surroundings walls which functioned as resonators; this design helped everyone to hear the speaker at the Mihrab. The sandstone used in building the Babri Mosque also had resonant qualities which contributed to the unique acoustics.</p>

<p>The Babri mosque’s Tughluquid style integrates other ingenious design components and techniques, such as air cooling systems disguised as Islamic architectural elements like arches, vaults and domes. In the Babri Masjid the high ceiling, domes, and six large grill windows (see picture) all served as a passive environmental control system that brought down the temperature and also allowed in natural ventilation as well as daylight.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babri_Mosque_64f0.html" title="Edit section: Legend of the Babri Mosque’s miraculous well">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legend of the Babri Mosque’s miraculous well</span></h2>
<p>The reported medicinal properties of the deep well in the central courtyard have been featured in various news reports such as the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> report of December <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> and in various newspapers. The earliest mention of the Babri water well was in a two line reference to the Mosque in the Gazette of Faizabad District 1918 which says “There are no significant historical buildings here, except for various Buddhist shrines, the Babri Mosque is an ancient structure with a well which both the Hindus and Mussalmans claim has Miraculous properties.”</p>
<p>Ayodhya, a pilgrimage site for Hindus has an annual fair attended by over 500,000 people of both faiths, many devotees came during the annual Ram festival to drink from the water well in the Babri Courtyard. It was believed drinking water from this well could cure a range of illnesses. Hindu pilgrims also believed that the Babri water well was the original well in the Ram Temple under the mosque. Ayodhya Muslims believed that the well was a gift from God. Local women regularly brought their new born babies to drink from the reputedly curative water.</p>
<p>The 125 foot (40 m) deep well in question was situated in the South Eastern Courtyard of the large rectangular courtyard of the Babri Mosque. There was a small Hindu shrine built in 1890 joining the well with a statute of Lord Rama. It was an artesian well and drew water from a considerable distance below the water table. Eleven feet (3 m) in radius the first 30 feet (10 m) from ground level were bricked. It drew water from a reservoir trapped in a bed of shale sand and gravel; this could explain the unusually cool temperature of the water. The water contained almost no sodium explaining its reputation that the water was ‘sweet.’ To access the well one had to climb on to a three foot (1 m) platform, the well was covered with planks of thick wood with an unhinged trapdoor. Water was drawn by means of a bucket and long lengths of rope and due to its claimed ‘spiritual properties’ used only for drinking.</p>

<p>Even though the medicinal properties of artesian wells can be explained by the high amount of calcium and mineral content in the water it, is significant that Hindus and Muslims in Ayodhya considered the Babri Mosque Complex a haven of peace and spiritual tranquillity. Many people in the area, of both faiths, had a profound belief in the miraculous properties of its cold and pure underground water. Folklore is said to contribute much to the legends of the healing waters.</p>

<p>After this victory, Babar decided to spread terror among the subjugated Hindu population. His general, Mir Baqi was in charge of the region. Mir Baqi came to Ayodhya in 1528 and gave special attention to the main and biggest temple in the town. This was the temple which was built on the place where Samrat Shri Ramachandra(Lord Rama), an ancient King of India was born. Samrat Shri Ramachandra was (and still is) revered by the devout among the Hindus as a god, also referred to as <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Rama</a>, believed by Hindus to be an avatar of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Vishnu_2d39.html" title="Lord Vishnu">Lord Vishnu</a>.</p>
<p>Babar, whose general Mir Baqi allegedly destroyed this temple at Ayodhya, built by the Hindus to commemorate their king Samrat Ramchandra. Mir Baqi built a mosque at the site of the destroyed temple. This was called the Babri Masjid (Mosque), named after King Babar.</p>
<p>The claim of the destruction of this temple and the erection of a mosque in its place is also mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
<p>The advocates say that many Indians - and even many of the educated Indians - are unaware of this truth. Indian History books at School and College do not tell the story in its true detail. The historians so shamefully hidden the facts. Hindu advocates allege that the Government of India has 'shamelessly' pandered to the Muslims in this and other issues in order to secure the minority electoral bloc as part of their partisan <a href="../../../v/o/t/Vote_bank.html" title="Vote bank">vote bank</a> politics, the <a href="../../../v/h/p/VHP_8430.html" title="VHP">VHP</a> especially voicing this concern.</p>
<p>Advocates also allege that the excessive sypmathy for Muslims in this issue is due to a zeitgeist of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo-secularism.html" title="Pseudo-secularism">Pseudo-secularism</a> in Indian society brought about by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> thinking, where struggles between Hindus and Muslims are viewed as a "class struggle" rather than a communal one. This identification of Muslims as an "oppressed underclass" are viewed as fallacious, since many Indian Muslims are quite wealthy and well-represented in many walks of life.</p>
<p>They claim that the Muslims claims to the region are unfounded, in violation of common law and based on the beliefs and practices of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fundamentalism_561c.html" title="Islamic Fundamentalism">Islamic Fundamentalism</a>. They allege that this is part of a malicious agenda of hate against Hindus and is an attempt to delegitimize the Hindu ethos in India.</p>
<p>Until 1989 when the BJP made into a political issue there had been no question about the site’s history <a href="http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/ayodhya/foundnlost.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/ayodhya/foundnlost.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. All the written sources, whether Hindu, Muslim or European, were in agreement about the pre-existence of a Rama temple at the site. “Rama’s birthplace is marked by a mosque, erected by the Moghul emperor Babar in 1528 on the site of an earlier temple”, according to the 1989 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, entry “Ayodhya”. However, this text was changed in subsequent editions. Neither was there any document contradicting this scenario: no account of a forest chopped down to make way for the mosque (already unlikely in the centre of an ancient town), no sales contract of real estate to the mosque’s builder, nothing of the kind. By contrast, there were testimonies of Hindus bewailing and Muslims boasting of the replacement of the temple with a mosque; and of Hindus under Muslim rule coming as close as possible to the site in order to celebrate Rama’s birthday every year in April, in continuation of the practice at the time when the temple stood.</p>
<p>In case authors of testimonies may be unreliable, there was also the archaeological evidence: in the 1970s, a team of the Archaeological Survey of India led by Prof. B.B. Lal dug out some trenches just outside the mosque and found rows of pillar-bases which must have supported a larger building predating the mosque. Moreover, in the mosque itself, small black pillars with Hindu sculptures had been incorporated, a traditional practice in mosques built in forcible replacement of infidel temples to flaunt the victory of Islam over Paganism.</p>
<p>The only remaining question about the site was its status in the period 1192-1528. In 1192 and the subsequent years, practically all the Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries in North India were demolished by Mohammed Ghori and his Turkish invaders. It is impossible that the medieval temple at the site could have survived until 1528. The most likely scenario is the one well-attested at another famous temple site: the Somnath temple in Gujarat. No less than nine times did Hindus reclaim it as a temple, until Muslims retook it and turned it into a mosque again. Since Ayodhya was a provincial capital of the Delhi Sultanate, opportunities for wresting the site from Muslim control were certainly more limited than in the case of the outlying Somnath temple. Then again, the frequent infighting among the Muslim elite may have given rebellious Hindus some opportunities too. From peculiarities in the architecture of the Babri Masjid, art historians on both sides of the debate (Sushil Srivastava, R. Nath) have deduced that the main part of the structure had been built well before the Moghul invasion, probably in the 14th century. In that case, the tradition that it was built by Mir Baqi may be based on the following scenario: towards the end of the Sultanate period, Hindus may have managed to recapture the site and to turn it into a functioning temple, until Babar and his lieutenant Mir Baqi firmly imposed Muslim control again and gave some finishing touches to the mosque architecture in replacement of any Hindu elements that had come to adorn it. But this must for now be kept inside speculative brackets. What is certain is that a major Hindu temple at the site was demolished by Islamic iconoclasm and replaced with a mosque symbolizing the victory of Islam over Infidelism. Of that, evidence is plentiful and of many types.</p>

<p>Muslims and Muslim partisan sources claim that neither history nor fact can come to prove the Hindu case as claimed above.</p>
<p>They claim that is clear that the allegations, on which, the demands of RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad &amp; Hindu Munnani are based for laying claim to Babri Masjid are biased against Islam.</p>
<p>According to the District Gazetteer Faizabad 1905, it is said that "up to this time (1855), both the Hindus and Muslims used to worship in the same building. But since the Mutiny (1857), an outer enclosure has been put up in front of the Masjid and the Hindus forbidden access to the inner yard, make the offerings on a platform (chabootra), which they have raised in the outer one."</p>
<p>Some Hindus in 1883 wanted to construct a temple on this chabootra, but the Deputy Commissioner prohibited the same on Jan. 19, 1885. Raghubir Das, a mahant, filed a suit before the Faizabad Sub-Judge. Pandit Harikishan was seeking permission to construct a temple on this chabootra measuring 17 ft. x 21 ft. the suit was dismissed. An appeal was filed before the Faizabad District Judge, Colonel J.E.A. Chambiar who after an inspection of spot on March 17, 1886, dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p>A Second Appeal was filed on May 25, 1886, before the Judicial Commissioner of Awadh, W. Young, who also dismissed the appeal. With this, the first round of legal battle fought by the Hindus came to an end.</p>
<p>During the "communal riots" of 1934, walls around the Masjid and one of the domes of the Masjid were damaged. These were reconstructed by the British Government.</p>
<p>On mid-night of December 22, 1949, when the police guards were asleep, idols of Rama and Sita were quietly brought into the Masjid and were planted. This was reported by constable, Mata Prasad, the next morning and recorded at the Ayodhya police station.</p>
<p>The following morning (Dec. 23, 1949), a large Hindu crowd made a "frantic attempt" to enter the Masjid on in order to offer puja to the deities. The District Magistrate K.K. Nair has recorded that "The crowd made a most determined attempt to force entry. The lock was broken and policemen were rushed off their feet. All of us, officers and men, somehow pushed the crowd back and held the gate. The sadhus recklessly hurled themselves against men and arms and it was with great difficulty that we managed to hold the gate. The gate was secured and locked with a powerful lock brought from outside and police force was strengthened (5:00 pm)."</p>
<p>On hearing this news Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru directed UP Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant, to see that the deities were removed. Under Pant's orders, Chief Secretary Bhagwan Sahay and Inspector-General of Police V.N. Lahiri sent immediate instructions to Faizabad to remove the deities. However, K.K. Nair feared that the Hindus would retaliate and pleaded inability to carry out the orders.</p>
<p>They have taken to arguing about the law, where they allege that Hindus have been hypocritical in the issue of the Babri Masjid, claiming adherence to common judicial law while allegedly breaking it during the demolition.</p>

<p>It is generally thought that the Mosque was built by <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> after demolishing the Rama temple, because an inscription on the mosque records his name. Although we have a detailed account of the life of Babur in the form of his diary (<a href="../../../b/a/b/Baburnama.html" title="Baburnama">Babur Nama</a>), the pages of the relevant period are missing in the diary. But it is also alleged that the Mosque already existed before Babur, who may only have renovated the building. The contemporary Tarikh-i-Babari records that Babar's troops "demolished many Hindu temples at Chanderi".</p>

<p>The summary of the ASI report <a href="http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> showed definite proof of a Hindu temple under the mosque. In the words of ASI researches they stated "discovery of distinctive features associated with... temples of north India".The temple suspected to be under the mosque though, was surmised to be a Shiva temple. The Muslim's attacked the report, stating that it pandered to certain interests and made no remarks on evidence in support of Muslims such as bones unearthed with tool markings on them. The VHP grew emboldened by the ASI's conclusion of a mandir under the structure and stepped up demands for Muslims to restore the three holiest North Indian mandirs to Hindus. Muslims point to the fact that the ASI made no mention of a temple in three interim reports, however, when the final draft was submitted the structure beneath was declared to be a temple.</p>

<p>The date of the construction of the Babri Mosque is disputed. Before the 1940s, the Mosque was called <i>Masjid-i Janmasthan</i>. It is presumed that Babur built the mosque, based on an inscription. Although we have a detailed account of the life of Babur in the form of his diary, the pages of the relevant period are missing in the diary. But it is possible that the mosque already existed before Babur, who may only have renovated the building. However, the construction of the mosque must have been between 1194 and 1528. The <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghorid.html" title="Ghorid">Ghorid</a> conquests reached Ayodhya in 1194.</p>
