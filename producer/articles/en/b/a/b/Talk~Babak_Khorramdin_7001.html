<p>The ethnicity debate should be taken out of the article. Everyone knows he was Persian. What a few Turkic nationalists say should not be taken seriously. Their propoganda and lies does not belong in a encyclopedia article. That section makes the whole article seem silly. I really think it should be removed. The support and evidence that he was Persian is all there. Dariush4444 18:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, there is no need to have his name in "azari" as well. He was not "azari" and his name is PURE ancient Persian. Besides, almost all "azari" names are Persian anyways. Please remove the POV...it is just Ridiculous.Dariush4444 18:49, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The mention of Azeri painter is getting to be reverted by pro-Iranian editors.

<p>The reason I reverted the painters name is that I think the phrase "Artist's impression" should be mentioned in the text since no one knows what Babak khorramdin looked like. And also the nationality of the painter is irrelevent for this article. So I suggest this image description: "Artist's impression of Babak (by Sadiq Sherifzadeh 1944)" I also suggest that people that know more than I do, start an article about the painter and link it to this page. I do not want to enter a revert war here. So please state your objections before any changes.</p>

<p>No serious book or scholar (from whatever background except Turkish) today even mentions that silly, artificial, politically driven "dispute", which in fact is nonexistent amongst serious people.

<p>The article talks about the ethnicity of Babak not like it is an article in an unbiased encyclopedia but like if it is an article DEFENDING the FACT that Babak was not a Turk in any way. OK, but isn't this website an encyclopedia? That part of the artcile is just too emotional and nationalistic and does not have its place in an encyclopedia. The article should mention that "Turks also pretend that Babak was a Turk and bring this argument and that, and Persians say that he was Persian and they bring this argument and that."

<dd>Not really. What scholars say about the issue is important. Babak Khorramdin is a clear Persian name just like the city Balal-Abad where he was born. Plus two ancient chroniclers have directly called him Persian. The name of his master was also Javidan Poor Shahrak. Khorramdins were a Mazdakite sect (an off-shoot of Zoroastrianism). Turks enterted the area around the time of Seljuqids and their previous religion before Islam was mainly Shamanism and somtimes Judaism (Khazars). --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 09:28, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Alidoostzade, in none my edits were any mention about any Turk. Was there? Did I say that it is not a Persian name? What I added said nothing about Turks. Why do you mention the word "Turk" when removing my edits? What I has written was about being more informative according to current accepted views. You removed Azerbaijan (that I had addes). Why? Babak's ethnicity was somewhat a mixture of many ethnic groups, but he was from Azerbaijan, so writing "Persian family" is not being impartial becasue his family was from Azerbaijan, so if those who lived in Azerbaijan at that time were Iranians (known as Persian at that time as being part of the Persian empire) that does not mean they were ethnic Persians as we now know. No-one denies him being from Azerbaijan, which was a part of Persia, so let's leave it to this, and that says nothing about Turks. Please bring your argument, or let's have the changes, which have nothing to do with Turks or Turkics or alike. Bm79 17:42, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Babak is explicitly mentioned as being Persian in sources (Armenian and Arab). Thus this makes him a "Persian family". At that time there was some Arabs, Armenians ..in Azerbaijan. The Arabs came during the Ummayad era. Some other source even mention his family was from Mada'in. But we know he was born in Balal-Abad near Ardabil. Thus Azerbaijan is mentioned through Ardabil. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 17:46, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, some sources that say he was "Persian" did they mean him in an ethnic way, or being a man from Persia (Persian Empire)? I am trying to be balanced and impartial here. Why did you take out reference to Azerbaijan? That territory back then was still called Azerbaijan, or Atropetene, so it is OK to mention this. The ETHNIC background os his family may also be mentioned but then we shall write who his mother and father were so that the reader makes up his mind. Bm79 11:25, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Babak was both from the ancient Persian Empire and an ethnic Persian. His name - Bābak (actually Pāpak, "littel father", a reference to the founder of the <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sassanid.html" title="Sassanid">Sassanid dynasty</a>) - underlines his Persian origin. His entire biography, his rebellion, his followers, himself being a follower of <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Muslim_1876.html" title="Abu Muslim">Abu Muslim</a> ... everything points toward a Persian origin. Honestly, I have never seen ANY reliable or scholarly source disputing this. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 12:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, we are repeating the same thing again. Please, pay a bit attention to what I am writing please! Babak was from the land of Atropatene (as Azerbaijan was known then, or Azarabadagean), so I suggested to mention the his homeland, which was delted. I asked why, and I was responded like above. He was FROM Atropaeten or Azerbaijan, as we want to name. It is suggested that his father came from somewhwre and some sources suggest that his father war Persian. I did not disagree. His mother was a native of Azerbaijan, right? And he was born in Azerbaijan, right? It is very important to mention this. Agree? We want to inform the readers, right?

<dd>It is such a pity that so many of my fellow Iranians are so much anti-Azerbaijani, which is also an Iranian region. Such a pity! Wherever is written something about Azerbaijan or Azerbaijani people come out and change Azerbaijan to Persia and Azerbaijani to Persian. Wikipedia defines Persian as an ethnicity, not the Persian Empire or the country, so we shall respect other people's heritage and history if we want to be respected. What do we gain from these wasting attempts. We will never change history but we are making fun of ourselves, of Iran, in front of the English-speaking world. Babak was from Azerbaijan (Atropatene) of the time, and I wrote Atropatene, it was removed. Babak's castle is located in Iranian Azerbaijan and every history book mentions that he was from Azerbaijan. His family was Persian? His family was from Azerbaijan. His ethnicity? Please bring me a source in which it is written that Babak was Persian in its ethnic sense! Babak's mother was native from Azerbaijan as yourselves said, and he lived in Azerbaijan. Please people, be balanced and impartial! Bm79 14:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Second: whether his mother was a native of Azerbaijan or not does not change the fact that he was born to a Persian family. A "native of Azerbaijan" does NOT mean that she was not Persian. Ethnic Persian settlements in Azerbaijan and surrounding areas, most of all around Lake Urmia, is attested in many ancient sources! His father was - according to the most reliable sources - a Persian from <a href="../../../c/t/e/Ctesiphon.html" title="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a> (the former capital of the Persian Empire and a "Persian land" up to the 15th century, as attested by the Arab scholar <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Khaldun_a947.html" title="Ibn Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a>!).</dd>
<dd>If you want to mention the name "Azerbaijan", than it's fine with me. But you not only added the name, but also deleted the word "Persian" without any good reason!</dd>

<dd>To Bm79 I have no problem about writing Azerbaijan. Indeed we can Balal-Abad, near Ardabil,Azerbaijan in Iran.. Armenian sources clearly say "Of Persian Race". So does Ibn Hazm who puts him in a sect of Majus. As for sources, here are two one in Armenian and one in Arabic <a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/famous/babak_khorramdin/babakpasokhbehanirani.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/famous/babak_khorramdin/babakpasokhbehanirani.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Note the french translation says "a man from the Persian race". Unfortunately pan-turkists in wikipedia have claimed Azerbaijanis as a Turkic speaking group. Thus Babak Khorramdin and Javidan Poor Shahrak would not fit under this description. Babak was from Azarbaijan, just like the name Atropatene is Iranian name like Azerbaijan and there are many Kurds, Talysh, Armenians, Assyrians, Tats.. etc from Azerbaijan. But at that time turkification of Azerbaijan did not start so to say he was azerbaijani (when its primary meaning in wikipedia is defined as Turkic speaker) is incorrect in that sense. But yes he was from Azerbaijan just like Rostam Farrokhzad who is mentioned in Tabari/Shahnameh. Also many sources say the language of Azarbaijan was Persian, Pahlavi, Ajami and etc but that is not all. In the case of Babak we have at least two direct referencs to his origin. Note also what the Oxford scholar says: <i>Azerbaijan was the scene of frequent anti-caliphal and anti-Arab revolts during the eighth and ninth centuries, and Byzantine sources talk of Persian warriors seeking refuge in the 830s from the caliph's armies by taking service under the Byzantine emperor Theophilos. [...] A<b>zerbaijan had a Persian population</b> and was a traditional centre of the Zoroastrian religion. [...] The Khurramites were a [...] Persian sect, influenced by Shiite doctrines, but with their roots in a pre-Islamic Persian religious movement</i>. Babak's mother name in the sources is "Mahru". His dad is called "Mardaas" (name in the Shahnameh. Note there was no persian empire at the time of Babak and Iran was under the control of Caliphates of Baghdad. But Babak Khorramdin and Maah-yazdyaar (Maaziyaar) of Tabarestan and Ali Mazdak of Esfahan and other zoroastrian/mazdakite sects tried to free Iran from caliphate rule. They were brave and belong to all Iranian people. BTW an old manuscript of Safina Tabriz is an excellent mirror of the culture of Azerbaijan in the Ilkhanid era. As can be seen from this text, even during the Ilkhanid era, Turkish did not yet take root in Tabriz. <a href="http://www.safinet.blogfa.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.safinet.blogfa.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. And note I am one of the biggest proponents of language replacment and not starting history from zero when a language of a region changes. But unfortunately some other users in Wikipedia have pushed some other theories and thus it may lead to confusions. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 03:01, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I've made a few additions and changes based on at Tabari's History. I've only so far drawn on at Tabari's account of the reign of al-Mu'tasim. This covers only the last few years and the death of Babak. At Tabari may not have as much about the earlier years, but he does have something. I'll check this and add what seems good later. Peace. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGallador_6c29.html" title="User:Gallador">Gallador</a> 19:06, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
