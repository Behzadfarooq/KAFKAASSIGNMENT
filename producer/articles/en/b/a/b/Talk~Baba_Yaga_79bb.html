<p>I do not understand why my recent edits about Baba Yaga's roots in Slavic mythology have been promptly deleted. These are well documented in virtually every serious Russian-language work on pre-Christian Russia, and these theories are supported both by archeological and folkloristic research. I'm especially dumbfounded as these changes came from a user who appears to have little to no background in the subject. The current article is little beyond a word for word translation of the first Russian-language web search for 'Baba Yaga' - which happens to be the most amateurish and poorly written article even on the first page of search results. (by 24.168.64.231, who is User:Luthier now. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 05:50, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC))</p>
<p>Below is the piece in question, false from top to bottom. <i>She is always described as having a 'bone leg', i.e. one leg having decomposed to the point where all flesh is lost. Her traditional dwelling almost perfectly describes a classic pre-Christian Slavic burial, which looked like a small house on top of a tree stump. In all the fairy tales she also invariably attemps to devour the hero. All combined, she could be understood as at some point being a cannibalistic corpse that inhabits her crypt. Some of the apparently more ancient tales appear to hint at related rituals, with her being calmed by food offerings or incantations.</i></p>

<p>It was always my assumption that the character Yubaba in <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirited_Away_a468.html" title="Spirited Away">Spirited Away</a> was based on Baba Yaga, tho I have no proof.

<dd>I agree. I thought of the scene where Yubaba changes into a bird and flies off just like how Baba Yaga turns into a crow like in the Vasilisa story.--<a href="../../../l/z/y/User%7ELzygenius_7b95.html" title="User:Lzygenius">Lzygenius</a> 13:57, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know... The way the article puts it seems a bit far-fetched. Though there may be similarities, saying that Spirited away is a retelling of the Vasilisa story is a bit too presumptious, if you ask me. I have read some Japanese sources on the anime, including a couple of interviews with Hayazaki, and none mentioned Jaga baba. In fact, contrary to most of his anime, this particular one is profoundly Japanese in nature - along with The princess mononoke, of course. You've got to understand that "baba" in Japanese means the exact same thing it does in Slavic languages - a hag, so Yubaba's name cannot be taken as a hint at Jaga baba. I'm neutralising the entry in the article - making into something along the line of "these two stories have some similarities". --213.172.254.15 08:32, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thou I am Hungarian I never heard of Baba Yaga being part of the Hungarian folklore. So the sentence that according to it she was once a fairy who later became a witch sounds noncence to me. Still, I might be undereducated in spesific areas and naturally I can't know all Hungarian fairy tales, so I would like to see references to this statement. Can anyone provide it?

<p>While I agree that the depiction of Baba Yaga in the <i>Fables</i> series is very different from that of the usual folk tales, I must point out that the entire point of <i>Fables</i> is to take established folk characters and place them in very different circumstances so you can see how different they act. The <i>Fables</i> character of Baba Yaga is clearly intended to be the same as that of the traditional folk tales, with the implication that had Baba Yaga truly existed, this is what she may have gone on to do. Its inclusion in the <b>no relation to the "real" Baba Yaga but the name</b> list seems to imply that <i>Fables</i> merely co-opted the name for a different character entirely. I think this is misleading at best. - 70.49.33.51 00:21, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, I'd have to agree with you here. If they're going to include the appearances of Baba Yaga in Hellboy and such, I'd say the one from Fable is as good as any other. Witch? Check. Chicken-legged House? Check. Three Riders? Check. Powerful? Check. Evil? Check. The only difference was that she made herself look like Red Riding Hood as part of a plot. As valid as the others, in my opinion.- --LightWarden 22:31, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>Some western author's fantasies is just a marketing ploy to sell, a trick ages old. BTW the actual text says <b>"little or no relation"</b>, so there is some slack. Still there is no was to "prove" that in Fables is the "same" Baba Yaga or it is "different one". The basic understanding is that a "Real" baba yaga is a body of authentic folklore. If she is taken out of the traditional context, baba yaga is "different" by default, unless an expert writes otherwise and wikipedia quotes him. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 06:47, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I originally came to wikipedia to look up Baba Yaga as I liked the myth and wanted to explore it in all it's forms, and see what else it had inspired. . . so I was quite concerned when I discovered that half of the entire article that must have taken users much time and effort to compile had simply been deleted.</p>
<p>If the "baba yaga in arts" references section is "executed without trial" like this, new seekers of that knowledge will no longer be able to explore and learn for themselves as I did.</p>
<p>That's the whole beauty of an encyclopedia such as this - That it allows everyone to learn and explore in their own way! Please do not simply delete large chunks of work that other users have spent a lot of time and effort adding.</p>
<p>Nothing detracts from the article more than deleting the single largest portion of said article!</p>
<p>If someone does not wish to explore that aspect of "Baba Yaga" they don't have to use the links, but please at least give them the freedom of choice.</p>

<p>some discussion on where such legends come from might be good. I stumbled across this link: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A823402" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A823402" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A823402</a> but I'm not nearly knowledgable enough to guess if it's accurate.</p>

Therefore it cannot be a valid reference. At best it may give some clues for further research. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 05:50, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ok, but so it may simply be one theory, and not an accurate one at that... however do archeologists/anthropologists have any idea where the concepts came from aside from an etemology of the name?<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarker_Dreams_6a0a.html" title="User:Darker Dreams">Darker Dreams</a> 17:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, and with things like this, we have to be bold and put the onus on the editor to find a source and not simply add what <i>might</i> be original research and just hope someone will source it later.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 06:49, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Funny how this is still alive and well in modern Slav traditions. I'm Macedonian. During my childhood, my parents (and grandma, at times) would usually taunt me with myths of Baba Roga, the old lady that hid in the closet and ate little kids that misbehaved and didn't listen to their elders. I remember a few other characters, Baba Meca (Bear), and some local ones. However, I didn't know until recently that this was such a widespread tradition among Slavs. Interesting, very interesting. There so much detail to this folklore that totally flew over my mind, partially because of constant, yet unexplained, exposure to such myths. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jotsko (<a href="../../../j/o/t/User_talk%7EJotsko_50c2.html" title="User talk:Jotsko">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jotsko_6e93.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jotsko">contribs</a>) 04:04, 30 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
