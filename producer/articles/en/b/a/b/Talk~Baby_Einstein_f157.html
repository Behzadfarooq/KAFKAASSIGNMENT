<p>Does anyone know if the mention of royalties to the Estate of Albert Einstein is true? It seems kind of ridiculous -- not impossible, just ridiculous -- and the link leads to an article on Kurt Cobain. — &#160;<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicMaker5376_f27b.html" title="User:MusicMaker5376"><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);">Music</span></a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusicMaker5376_b74b.html" title="User talk:MusicMaker5376"><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Maker</span></a> 03:05, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article mentions that Albert Einstein is in the top 5 of "Most earning dead celebrities", mostly due to these royalties. But I was as surprised as you are, reading that articles title. Perhaps I can edit and make the connection clearer. I'll try. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.172.180.130_6372.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.172.180.130">193.172.180.130</a> (talk) 08:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Someone cited a pediatric group as stating that children below 2 years of age should not be allowed to watch t.v. This was interesting. Should they be allowed to listen to it? Children from a very early age learn by listening, and also I am sure by visual cues.</p>
<pre>
Aaron Stern, author of THE MAKING OF A GENIUS and its sequel THE JOY OF LEARNING taught his daughter Edith from the time she was a very young infant using travel posters, classical music, and dolls of different ethnicities.  He challenged her mind with talks about anything that caught her attention, from the sound of a car passing in the street to explaining basic concepts of physics such as leverage at a construction site they were passing as he pushed her in a stroller. 
</pre>
<pre>
His wife was very worried because the pediatric "experts" were all telling her that he would rob her of her childhood and turn her daughter into a socially maladjusted individual who could not relate comfortably to society.
</pre>
<p>Years later, she acknowledged that far from having harmed the mind of her daughter, he had helped her to become a very mature, well-adjusted, kind and very, very bright young lady, who at age 15 was given the position of assistant professor of abstract mathematics at Michigan State University. Edith tested at between 196 and 205 I.Q. at the age of 12 or 13, and later became a V.P. at IBM in the Research and Development Department according to her father.</p>
<p>There are basicly two ways to spike the intellectual development of a child at an early age. One is the John Mills/James Siddis method, which uses fear and force-feeding information, and the other is the much saner and healthier method using love, encouragement, and affection, which leads out the innate genius within each child to full expression.</p>
<p>The Montessori Schools, when properly conducted, and the Total Education Submersion Method used by Aaron Stern are examples of the healthier second way.</p>

<p>In 1973 a book came out called THE MAKING OF A GENIUS, by Aaron Stern. It was about the Total Education Submersion Method which is the term he used for the method he used to make everything that caught the interest of his children into an opportunity for learning and developing their minds. At the earliest opportunity, he began using travel posters, classical music, ethnic dolls, counting and spelling blocks and many other things to engage the attention and interest of his daughter Edith Ann Stern when she was just a few weeks old, and still in her play-pen.</p>
<pre>
 Using these as a focus, he would explain many concepts of life in very simple terms, teaching her ethics and compassion for all races, elementary mathematics, simple concepts of physics such as leverage, auto mechanics and a wide range of other mind expanding experiences of everyday life.  When they would go out for a walk, he would push her in her baby carraige and explain what different signs meant, and when they would pass a construction site, he would explain simple concepts of physics like leverage, and how it was being used there.  When they passed a picket line, he would use this as an opportunity to explain labor-management relations concepts. EVERYTHING that caught her attention was used as an opportunity to further educate her, and expand her understanding of concepts and how her world worked.
</pre>
<p>At age 12, she was tested for her intelligence level. She tested at between 196 and 205 I.Q. At age 15 she was given the position of Assistant Professor of Abstract Mathematics at Michigan State University. Later she went to work for IBM as a computer consultant, and eventually became a V.P. in the Research and Development Dept. of IBM, according to her father. She married, and I believe had one child. Her mother, who had been filled with fear by her husband's methods because the pediatric "experts" were all telling her that he would ruin the mind and social life of her daughter, later acknowledged that far from ruining her daughter, he had turned her into a very mature, compassionate, kind, intelligent and wise young woman of whom she was very proud.</p>
