<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>The biography here is seriously flawed. Babur is considered a descendent of Genghis Khan and Timurlane, both of whom are Mongol. The term turkic that most historians use represent dialect and not ethnicity as there is a wide swath of peoples who speak a Turkic tongue (either by adoption, through assimilation, or through force) but are ethnically divergent.Steelhead 01:17, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The claim of descendancy from Genghis Khan is considered doubtful by most historians. Timur claimed Mongol heritage, but it is more accurate to describe his people as "Turco-Mongols" -- Turkic-speaking people who adopted the nomadic warrior lifestyle of the Mongols. It is doubtful that they are genetically related to Genghis Khan's Mongols. <a href="../../../a/c/s/User%7EAcsenray_d459.html" title="User:Acsenray">Acsenray</a> 12:58, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>where are you getting your information? Nobody ever speaks of a Turkco-Mongol empire. Babur is considered in most sources to be Mongolian and his empire is called a Moghul empire (mongolian). All the books that are written about him and the encyclopedias that cite him speak of him as a Mongolian conquerer. Get your facts straight.</p>
<p><a name="Babur_as_a_.27Mongol.27" id="Babur_as_a_.27Mongol.27"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Babur as a 'Mongol'</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Babur himself considered the term 'Mongol' (مغل) to be somewhat derogatory, and it was in fact a misnomer applied by sixteenth century Europeans to the rulers of India, possibly because of memories of the earlier Mongol invasions. Thackston writes:</li>
</ul>
<p>"History has conspired to rob Babur not only of his fame as a Central Asian sovereign over the kingdom of Kabul for much longer than he was in the subcontinent, but also of his primary identity as a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timurid.html" title="Timurid">Timurid</a> [ie. a Turco-Mongol dynast from the settled regions of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkestan.html" title="Turkestan">Turkestan</a> ] by labelling him and his successors as 'Mughals' - that is, Moghuls, or Mongols - an appellation that would not have pleased him in the least. In India the dynasty always called itself Gurkani, after Temür's title Gurkân, the Persianised form of the Mongolian <i>kürügän</i>, 'son-in-law', a title he assumed after his marriage to a Genghisid princess. Nonetheless, Europeans, recognising that there was some connection between Babur's house and the Mongols but ignorant of the precise relationship, dubbed the dynasty with some variant of the misnomer Moghul (Mogol, Mogul, Maghol etc.) and made the name synonymous with greatness." Wheeler M. Thackston <i>The Babur-nama</i> (New York) 2002 pxivi</p>
<p>Thackston uses the term 'Turco-Mongolian' throughout to describe Babur's ethnicity, insofar as that is relevant. He certainly spoke and wrote in Turkish. The term 'Moghul' properly refers to the ruling dynasty of <a href="../../../m/o/g/Moghulistan.html" title="Moghulistan">Moghulistan</a> or Jatah (roughly speaking northern Chinese Turkestan, or <a href="../../../d/z/u/Dzungaria.html" title="Dzungaria">Dzungaria</a>), which was ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan's son <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chagatai.html" title="Chagatai">Chagatai</a> and is hence sometimes known as the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chagatai_Khanate_f57a.html" title="Chagatai Khanate">Chagatai Khanate</a>. Its history is somewhat obscure, but the principal source is Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat's <i>Ta'rikh-e Rashidi</i>. The author of this work was Babur's cousin, and on pxliii of Thackston's introduction to the <i>Babur-nama</i> he quotes from p97 of the Elias &amp; Denison-Ross translation, which illuminates at once the unity of culture amongst the Turco-Persian Timurid elite, and the meaning given by contemporaries to the name 'Moghul'</p>
<p>"I heard that Yunus Khan [one of the sons of the lord of Moghulistan] was a Moghul, and I concluded that he was a beardless man, with the ways and manners of any other Turk of the desert. But when I saw him, I found he was a person of elegant deportment, with a full beard and a Tajik face, and such a refined speech and manner, is seldom to be found even in a Tajik."</p>
<p>A distinction thus has to be made between notional ethnicity, (turco-mongol) and culture &amp; language (turco-persian). <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">Sikandarji</a> 11:01, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shiladitya, the rajput general</span></h2>
<p>What James Tod says in connection with the rajput general Shiladitya's betrayal is that Babur was able to bribe him over with offers of lands and wealth. The remaining stuff about a pilot group of 1500 cavalry being butchered etc is not found here. The "sleepless nights" stuff is not encyclopaedic. This fairy-tale seems to be taken from from the comic-book "Amar Chitra Katha", and as it is not correct history, the fiction may be copyright!!! I will revert in a day unless verifiable references are cited. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> 01:00, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You need to brush up your history. Research why babur took steps he did (breaking goblets) and the vows of jihad he took from each one of his army before the war. If you get a chance read how this war is described in baburnama and then corelate these passages with appropriate passages from kuran (hint they are identical). Annhiliation of his advance guard, if this is beyond your historical horizon then I have no idea what to tell you.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>You will not revert anything on this page. BTW if you have not already heard, Rani Durgavati and Gayatri Devi are rajputs. Feeling good about one's posts is one thing but spreading lies on WP is not acceptable. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShivraj_Singh_2774.html" title="User:Shivraj Singh">Shivraj Singh</a> 06:01, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The text seems to have a biased tone and I think this particular section does need some work. I need to brush up on Babur's life; I'll be back. Would it be acceptable to post a POV sign on this page till we can work out a mutually acceptable version? 220.227.249.162 11:16, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h2>
<p>"Babur's name was derived from the Persian "Babr" meaning "leopard"." Actually, Thackston writes "Babur's name has also appeared as Baber and Babar. There is not the slightest doubt, however, that the name is Babur (BAH-boor), which is ultimately derived from the Indo-European word for beaver. Although it has often been suggested that Babur means tiger, it has, in fact, nothing to do with the Persian word <i>babr</i> 'tiger' " Wheeler M. Thackston <i>The Babur-nama</i> (New York) 2002 note 1, pxvii</p>
