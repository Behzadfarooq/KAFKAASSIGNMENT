<p>What if I know a "foreign" language (English) better than my "native" language (Chinese)? Perhaps "native" and "level-3" should be merged together, the same that's done on Commons. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 19:46, Apr 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think we need to clarify what "Native speaker" means, since a lot of people (children of immigrants, for example) know "foreign" languages much better than their "maternal" or "native" languages. Simply asking if a language is "native" to someone may not be a good gauge of how proficient they are in it.</p>
<p>I'm going to change the descriptions of the "native" label on <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_d383.html" title="Wikipedia:Babel">Wikipedia:Babel</a>. All comments are welcome.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 13:44, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess it should be obvious, but the article talks about <i>spoken</i> language and we are of course reading and writing, not speaking here. I might almost get away with 'th-1' when speaking to someone and with some time when reading, but I can't write. Similarly I may be no-2 for reading and speaking but I wouldn't trust my spelling. I guess that what we're interested in is <i>written</i> performance in the language. <a href="../../../k/a/y/User%7EKayEss_94c2.html" title="User:KayEss"></a> — <a href="../../../k/a/y/User%7EKayEss_94c2.html" title="User:KayEss">KayEss</a> | <a href="../../../k/a/y/User_talk%7EKayEss_d389.html" title="User talk:KayEss">talk</a> 06:50, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm thinking more on similar questions - are the levels primarilly about <i>reading</i> or <i>writing</i>? The question is important, as there are quite a lot of languages that are so similar, that if you know one of them, you might understand all of them, even at a very-close-to-native-level, but you might not be able to write a single sentence (caused by non-existent grammar and spelling knowledges) - you'd just use your own language, and hope whoever you're writing to is okay with that too.</p>
<p>For an example - I'm myself Swede - take the scandinavian wikipedias. There is quite a lot of flow of information even between them - even if you perhaps can't really write in the article, you might be able to check facts etc, and help with images etc. Sometimes content is copied over in the 'wrong' language and translated afterwards. Another example is plattdütsch - as I am a de-3 (living and studying in northern Germany at the moment, and platt being similar to both german and the scandinavian languages) I can understand it at level 1 too. But I would answer in german...</p>
<p>What is the right level to indicate? Right now, the answer is "none". I expect norwegians and danes to understand me, just because I know swedish natively...</p>

<p>Well, since I'm better at the language I <i>wasn't</i> raised in (in this case, the language I was raised in was Malay, and I speak and write fluent, almost-native English), I'm going to put myself as en-4 (not a native speaker, but damn well as fluent as one) and ms-3 (oh, the spirits of my ancestors are rolling, they are...).

<dd>Works for me. I'll err on the side of caution and keep it at en-4. Thanks! --<a href="../../../t/-/b/User%7ET-Boy_4523.html" title="User:T-Boy">T-Boy</a> 17:47, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It doesn't work for me. I speak good Japanese and can write the language, yet I would consider myself able 'to modify articles and to participate in discussions'. I'm not sure I'd be happy to write articles myself. Yet when I chose this option I came out as someone who 'knew a certain amount of Japanese'. This is ridiculous. When I went one up the the scale, I became a 'fluent speaker'. But I rather shudder at this characterisation: 'or advanced or fluent understanding (the ability to write articles in this language without difficulties, minor errors may occur'. There is a mismatch between the description on which the numbering is based and the way that is expressed on the user page.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Language box</span></h2>
<p><b>Proposal</b>: What about introducing few more templates?&#160;:o) Namely language box template, so it's just one template to call in user page and all user languages are ready formatted. I copied the idea from <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_d383.html" title="Wikipedia:Babel">spanish wiki</a> and here how it would look: <a href="../../../t/a/r/User_talk%7ETarmoK_Babel-5_a5e4.html" title="User talk:TarmoK/Babel-5">User talk:TarmoK/Babel-5</a> (for 5 languages). So by calling template (template number will define how many languages) user inserts as parameters the language codes.</p>
<p>this approach will require to make n-number templates, one template for every number of languages, i.e. "Babel-1", "Babel-2" etc. I think up to 10 should be more than sufficient. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarmoK_7938.html" title="User:TarmoK">TarmoK</a> 09:37, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I see you have copied one template from Spanish wiki and multiplied it. Great work, now we can hope it is (a bit) easier to see these language boxes. Unfortunately I have to point out that, their version needs a little bit improvements HTML-wise, like the width which is somewhere around 250px not 242px, and I think it will be "lighter" (HTML-wise) just to put all language boxes to one cell, as table width would "force" them anyway to "pile up". I didn't start to make changes as there maybe be more opinions about how it should look. In Meta there's a bit different way "coded" it. (I made my example based on example there, and updated code according my taste, but as it's my work I can't propose this look&#160;:o) --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarmoK_7938.html" title="User:TarmoK">TarmoK</a> 20:32, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

But I would still say zero and not non-existant (e.g., <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>) because I <i>could</i> understand it using a dictionary, and wouldn't also have to try to decipher the grammar. (It would be like asking someone who knew absolutely nothing about English to look up the word 'went' in an English-Native Tongue dinctionary.

Of course, I have been unsuccessful in making the Old English-Zero template work--perphaps it's not been created?

<dd>I think this originated on WikiCommons. So at one point they had to have started this page here, and then started copying some of the stuff. Starting templates is easy -- I've done it. The markup will be the same on all Wikis, it's just the text that you'll have to translate. But that comes <i>after</i> you've started the categories. Why don't we start a Babel page on the French or German sites (you pick) with just one category: English. Then we can add German and French, and you can put the tags on your userpage there. It won't take long before people start filing in to add other languages and improve it. I'll help with the formatting issues, but you'll have to do the translating since I know very little French or German.--<a href="../../../j/p/b/User%7EJpbrenna_8d3a.html" title="User:Jpbrenna">Jpbrenna</a> 20:40, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Capital letters</span></h2>
<p>Before I go changing most of the templates: is there any specific reason why many of the templates do not capitalise the initial letter of the languages mentioned?

<ul>
<li>The templates are in the concerned language; and in many languages (but not in English and in some other Germanic languages) language names are not capitalized. So: "Cette personne parle français" (lowercase) but "This user speaks English" (language name capitalised) and "Dieser Benutzer hat [...] Deutschkenntnisse" (all nouns capitalised). <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 05:27, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dialects</span></h2>
<p>Specifically for English, and possibly for other languages, I think the templates and categories should allow for dialects. I'm thinking primarily of English here: I might some time need to contact someone fluent in, e.g., New Zealand English, and these templates and categories should allow for that. We'd thus have en-US, en-GB, en-NZ, etc. What think you all?<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsh210_2d23.html" title="User:Msh210"></a> —<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsh210_2d23.html" title="User:Msh210">msh210</a> 17:18, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You don't need separate tags for that. The dialects of languages like English, Spanish and Arabic are mutually intelligible. It's not impossible for a Briton or an American to become "fluent" in New Zealand English. Take a Castilian Spanish speaker and plop him down in Argentina, and he'll pick up the slang and realize that you pronounce "ll" as "j" in no time. It might be harder for, say, a native Chicagoan to figure out what a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_language.html" title="Scots language">Scotsman</a> is saying, but I still regard it as a dialect of English, not a separate language. Now for Kurdish, or some of the Low Countries languages where you have <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect_continuum.html" title="Dialect continuum">dialect continua</a>, you could make a case for having a separate category - and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisian_language.html" title="Frisian language">Frisian</a> already does, while most people would look for a Kurmanji speaker under Kurdish.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think having these national dialect tags would just complicate matters too much. Pretty soon you'll have subnational, regional dialect and sociolect tags being proposed next: "California surfer dude American English", "Sheep drover Australian English", "Newfoundland codfisherman Canadian English" and "Working-clas Irish-Catholic-turned professor at a Midwestern American university Boston English." And despite my occasionally inability to fathom what my father or some of my friends from California are saying (As a boy, I was always perplexed when the old man told me to "get some padayduhs" and peel them for my mother), I really don't think we should start creating language tags for them. How many drovers and codfisherman are logging into Wikipedia? They're too busy <i>working</i>.

<dd>Face it, even an entirely uneducated Aussie or New Zealander has no problem conversing with a Briton or American.

<dd>Actually the difference between en-US and en-GB is more than just the difference between two dialects. Both are "standards" of the English language and follow different spelling and grammar rules, as well as different vocabularies. In de-DE and de-AT this is a smaller problem, but still existant.</dd>
<dd>The problem can be ignored for non-native speakers, tho, as that tends to create even more problems -- in Europe schools traditionally teach en-GB, but pop-culture (e.g. music and the internet) usually water that down with en-US: the result being a sort-of "European English" representing a mix of both variations.</dd>
<dd>I think the difference is still too subtle as that it absolutely HAS to be noted and usually the user pages give enough information as that one can guess which variation the user speaks and writes.</dd>
<dd>Since Wikipedia EN has a policy on en-GB vs. en-US already and most other Wikipedias where this became a notable issue probably adopted similar conventions, I don't think this is particularily important in the first place. -- <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 09:28, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">creoles, natural languages, and dialects</span></h3>
<p>i. The languages list is currently divided into "natural languages," "language-related," and "other." A number of the languages listed as 'natural' are in fact <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creole_language.html" title="Creole language">creoles</a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>--I <b>propose</b> that either the languages list be reorganized: 1. natural languages, 2. creoles, 3. related, 4. other; or that "natural languages" be replaced with "languages."</p>
<dl>
<dd>In what way are <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creole_language.html" title="Creole language">creoles</a> not natural languages? Separating them from "natural languages" is misleading, to say the least. I assume you're confusing creoles with <a href="../../../p/i/d/Pidgin.html" title="Pidgin">pidgins</a>? I agree, though, that a reorganization is needed, considering that some of the languages under "natural languages" are patently not natural languages--I speak mainly of constructed languages. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 15:51, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ii. While the list of dialects of a given language cannot be set, there are some dialects --not too encompassing and not too narrow-- that can be said to be useful in situations like this. The "Selected list of articles on dialects" at the bottom of the "<a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a>" page has a useful list of such dialects for Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, English, Flemish, French, German, Greek, Irish, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Persian, Portugese, Serbo-Croatian, Sicilian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish. Given those suggestions, it should be possible to choose some dialects to include. Should this be done?</p>
<ul>
<li>One argument made against the inclusion of dialects is the slippery slope problem. With an understanding of the considerations made by linguists (see, again, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>) this can be warded off.</li>
<li>Another argument is that dialect speakers also speak standard forms of their language. This is by no means necessarily true... Indeed, those people who are sufficiently exposed to a dialect to become fluent in it may well be people whose environment does not expose them to the standard form (<i>not</i> to say that being fluent in a dialect <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entailment.html" title="Entailment">entails</a> non-fluency in the standard variety). As far as <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_intelligibility.html" title="Mutual intelligibility">mutual intelligibility</a> goes, which would allow those dialect speakers not familiar with the standard language to "figure it out," this is also not guaranteed (e.g. <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highland_English_d488.html" title="Highland English">Highland English</a>, which is based on Scottish English with liberal borrowings from (a particular dialect of) Gaelic, is worlds apart what you might hear on Fox News).</li>
<li>The Babel project serves two functions: it brings together/helps out users based on language; it also gives us a picture of who uses wikipedia. This is, after all, en.wikipedia, and the en-0 level has as of this writing only 28 users. Yet we don't cut the levels down to "fluent" and "near fluent," as we would if the only purpose was to help non-speakers read pages. While the first cause is certainly the more noble, the second may (in this world of online multilingual dictionaires) turn out to be the more driving.</li>
</ul>
<p>--I <b>propose</b> that major dialects be added to the list (1. nat's, 1.b. dialects, 2. creoles...) with the inclusion of a reminder that users list not those (many) dialects which they <i>could</i> understand, and not those they might pretend to speak in when joking around with friends, but those which they actually run across regularly. Dialects could be incorporated into the Babel box as a sub-entry below the standard language. As the opinions voiced thus far are primarily anti-dialects, another option would be to let a "spoken languages" userbox ("Who would have thought? 407 users of wikipedia speak <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manx_English_2356.html" title="Manx English">Manx English</a>!") grow out of the Babel project, with Babel remaining as a strictly-standard-language "languages I can field questions in" tool. <a href="../../../e/i/t/User%7EEitch_6988.html" title="User:Eitch">Eitch</a> 13:25, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there is a difference between Filipino and Tagalog, then they ought to remain in their own articles. They are in their own articles because there is no one opinion on the definition of Filipino, as there is no definition provided for in the 1987 Constitution. I know for a fact that Filipinos in Cebu and other provinces DO NOT refer to the language as Filipino, but Tagalog, except in school when the name of the subject is clearly Filipino. Tagalog did not cease to be a national language of the Philippines because the Filipino language is still Tagalog (in a sense). On another argument, Tagalog did not cease to be the national language because it never was declared officially as one in the Philippines at all (being officially called Pilipino or Filipino).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but there are loan words in every language and a handful cannot make it a different language, especially if the loan words are in use in Manila (a native Tagalog-speaking area). While they might not be in use some years ago, I believe all Tagalog speakers refer to siomai as siomai, and an imam as imam. English itself even uses siomai and imam! This doesn't make it Filipino, the same way the sentence "I savored filet mignon at the soiree" CAN still be considered American English. No one considers that sentence as in a different language as compared to "I enjoyed steak at the party." There's a mere difference in word choice, and no native English speaker is going to mistake it for French. French-influenced maybe. --<a href="../../../w/n/g/User%7EWng_9140.html" title="User:Wng">Wng</a> 08:41, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If I try putting <b>xx-4</b>, it doesn't work for all languages. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 19:07, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IIUC, level 4 is a new addition. The templates and categories for it are progressively being made. For instance, when I first built my user page a few days ago, there was no eo-4 template. Now there is (and I didn't even make it). If you put <b>xx-4</b> in the Babel entry on your user page, and it results in a "missing link" instead of a template, then you can either create the template and category yourself; or if you are not <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">bold</a> enough, you can ask that someone help you do it. -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 03:55, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Skills other than languages</span></h2>
<p>I may be alone on this one, but I think it could be handy to be able to extend this template model to other skills outside spoken language. For example, ability to use computer programming languages or to play musical instruments. While this might not be as directly 'useful' as the current system is in facilitating multilingual communication between users, it would allow people to set out their non-lingual skills in a concise way on personal pages. Perhaps it could also be extended to subjects in which people feel they have a particular expertise or interest? Obviously for the sake of practicality the interest/expertise categories would have to be reasonably broad to avoid having a separate tag for every article! This would probably be better as a project distinct from Babel - I'd be happy to do some groundwork if people think it's a good idea.

<dd>"<i>Although I had started with musical instruments, my aim was to produce a system similar to the language one which would enable Wikipedians to highlight their interests and proficiencies in a concise way on their user pages. I don't believe this is entirely unnecessary from an encyclopaedic point of view - it would facilitate communication between users about articles in which they have a particular interest; or perhaps might be able to contribute valuable knowledge. For example, a user tagging articles as stubs, finding one about a composer of music for the violin, might be able to bring up the User_violin category, and find someone with an interest in the instrument who would be happy to expand the article. As a secondary function, these templates would also make it easy for people to find like-minded users, and then see what they'd contributed to - an interesting way of broadening one's horizons by inviting exploration of parts of Wikipedia one might not otherwise have visited. I freely admit that the way I've set out the templates I've made so far is probably non-optimal; if the consensus is that I'm causing an unnecessary mess, I'll happily stop and concentrate my efforts on other aspects of Wikipedia. I planned to stop at the 5 categories I've made so far anyway, and to see what people's reactions were.</i>"</dd>

<dd>Creating extra templates is pretty easy, although they should only be used for distinct languages rather than dialects (see above under Dialects). Tamil and Telegu are both worthy candidates though. Here's what you need to do:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Find the <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_639_02b4.html" title="ISO 639">ISO 639</a> Alpha-2 code for each language. This is used to name each set of templates.</li>
<li>Start a new template by typing its name in the search box (eg. for basic Tamil, 'Template:User ta-1' [no quotes]), then clicking on the link in small text at the very top of the Search results page (next to "You searched for "), and then clicking "Start the {{template name}} article".</li>
<li>You can base your templates on the formatting of those already created. The example below is what you'd need for the basic Tamil template:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
&lt;div style="float:left;border:solid #99B3FF 1px;margin:1px"&gt;
{| cellspacing="0" style="width:238px;background:#E0E8FF"
| style="width:45px;height:45px;background:#99B3FF;text-align:center;font-size:14pt" | '''ta-1'''
| style="font-size:8pt;padding:4pt;line-height:1.25em" | This user is able to contribute with a 
'''[[:Category:User ta-1|basic]]''' level of '''[[:Category:User ta|Tamil]]'''
.[[Category:User ta]][[Category:User ta-1]]
|}&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Obviously you'd need to translate the above text into Tamil, and replace each incidence of 'ta-1' with ta-2 or ta-3 for the intermediate and advanced templates.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>For the Native speaker templates, the only difference from the above is in the colour codes, and the use of (eg.) ta-N in place of a number. Here's the Tamil example code:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
&lt;div style="float:left;border:solid #6ef7a7 1px;margin:1px;"&gt;
{| cellspacing="0" style="width:238px;background:#c5fcdc;"
| style="width:45px;height:45px;background:#6ef7a7;text-align:center;font-size:14pt;" | '''ta'''

'''[[:Category:User ta-N|native]]''' speaker of '''[[:Category:User ta|Tamil]]'''
.[[Category:User ta]][[Category:User ta-N]]
|}&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>You'll also need to create the relevant categories as specified in the templates. This is done in a similar way, you might want to have a look at the source of some existing categories to get the idea.</li>

Since this is hard to explain as in english there is only one letter, in indian languages two letters r combined, however the combination isn't properly reflected only in the template box. in regular articles of the tamil wikipedia there seems to be no problem. maybe a problem with the template box? i don't really know. --<a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 10:11, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Subst or not?</span></h2>
<p>I think that proposing the template without 'subst:' should be the 'standard policy'. I understand that expanding eases the load on servers, but it has some drawbacks: if the template is changed in the future, it will lead to different results between pages that used the same template. Of course, it allows for more 'personalisable' pages, and it's ok if that was the intent. But I think this ois an encyclopedia, not a homepage hosting service, and uniformity allows the reader to have quick visual references. Anyway, is this load increase considerable, can it be measured? Couldn't it be managed buying more servers or optimizing the code? <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkiss_154b.html" title="User:Akiss">Akiss</a> 22:42, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

Any popular meta-template (that is a template that calls other templates) only compounds this problem.

<p>For the levels of proficiency in each language, is it relating to the level of proficiency in speaking the languages or to the level of proficiency at writing each language?

<p>I see another problem: competence levels for various languages may differ according to common expectations about the average learner of a particular language. For English expectations are usually very high, whereas I doubt if Japanese-3 of most users could be compared with English-3 of others. Unless we do not introduce accredited unified proficiency tests for the various levels, the distinctions will stay somewhat blurred. I plea for intuitive self-rating accompanied by some explanatory notes about the rough meanings of the levels. <a href="../../../h/v/_/User%7EHV_b97d.html" title="User:HV">HV</a> 08:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with Bart133 to define xx-1 like he wrote as a bottom-line for multilingual Wikipedia participation. The most difficult problem for me, however, is to define level-3.

<p>We just had the same discussion at the German Babel and came to the following conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>xx the user speaks the language like/being a native speaker</li>
<li>xx-3 the user is able to write articles in this language without any difficulty</li>
<li>xx-2 the user is able to modify articles and participates in discussions</li>
<li>xx-1 the user understands the language well enough to use an article as a source for writings in his own language. He can ask or answer simple questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds quite straightforward and pragmatic to me. What do you think? If you agree, I would put this classification onto the front page. <a href="../../../h/v/_/User%7EHV_b97d.html" title="User:HV">HV</a> 18:56, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

And more, even inside Category:User_en, the boxes in the individual knowledge levels aren't following the color code, as you can see green on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_en-N_342e.html" title="Category:User en-N">Category:User_en-N</a> but the same shade of blue on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_en-1_bf0d.html" title="Category:User en-1">Category:User_en-1</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_en-2_8aea.html" title="Category:User en-2">Category:User_en-2</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_en-3_366a.html" title="Category:User en-3">Category:User_en-3</a>.</p>
<p>I think it would be a nice idea to get boxes on all the levels and have the different knowledge levels follow the colors and shades of the respective User_xx-y templates, so colors would be more uniform.</p>

<p>I agree with you, but my point is to protest that the current system conflates linguistic ability with some esoteric concept of "nativeness", thus excluding many people and giving them no way to accurately describe themselves. This esoteric concept of nativeness is irrelevant to my ability to contribute to Wikipedia, and I could describe myself as a native English speaker (and I have made similar claims in the past when it was professionally convenient to me as an English teacher), but since English is not my first language and not the language I speak with many of my family, the description grates on me. — <a href="../../../p/e/k/User%7EPekinensis_ce03.html" title="User:Pekinensis">Pekinensis</a> 7 July 2005 19:41 (UTC)</p>

<p>We are not talking about the article space, we are talking about individual user pages.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a difficult question; to be accurate for a wider range of users and to be closer to its purpose, the template should read "This user is able to contribute with a <b>native</b> level of English". However I didn't feel like stirring up a hornet's nest by making that change, so I chose to create a template which would not affect any who do not choose to be affected.</p>

<p>   The question may grate on some; but I believe the distinction between "native language" and "spoken almost like a native" has some usefulness, especially for display on user pages, where a user will probably want to communicate things about him/herself beyond just "of what use can I be to the Wikipedia?". I don't feel awkward when writing in English, and I believe that maybe I talk better English than "some" natives, but I would never call myself a native speaker of English. I speak Esperanto just as well as any other, but Esperanto has very few native speakers and it is not they who set the language norm. So I listed en-4 and eo-4 on my user page; only French got the "honour" of being listed as "my native language".<br />
   The concept of people without a native language may seem strange but it is not meaningless, not only in the case mentioned, but also e.g. for adopted children who have forgotten their biological parents' language, etc.<br />
   I know people with several "native" languages, such as father's language, mother's language, language of kindergarten and grade school schoolmates, etc. This may sound off-topic for the thread, but it has bearing on what the ??-N template should say: In French, for instance, it says literally "French is this person's mother language". That seems to imply that no-one has more than one native language, and also, it reflects on the fact that French has no <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral</a> term for "native language" as distinct from "mother language". Indeed when one of my friends says, in French, "My father language is Arabic and my mother language is French", it makes people smile. And two isn't the limit: I have met people whose children could say "My mother language is Dutch, my father language is Danish and my family language is Esperanto". So I prefer the more neutral text in the en-N template: "This user is a native speaker of English"; but how to say that accurately and neutrally in (for instance) French?

<dd>Regrettable move, in my opinion. When this Babel thing was being discussed in its early days on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/commons:babel" class="extiw" title="commons:commons:babel">commons:commons:babel</a> there were just three levels - "1", "2", "3". Accepting the new idea "0" gives four. Then someone decided that "3" wasn't the same as native so devised the "N" as a 4th or 5th class. Some "native" speakers then had a problem because they were better at another language than in their native language - which was not a problem when "3" covered both. Now the English WP is moving to have a "4" as well, which results in six classes and even more argument about what each one means (not to mention the fact that old templates for "3" will become incorrect in the new terms without their "owners" realising it). Even now there's no "4" on Meta or on Commons, which should be more centralised standard-setters than "en". How about everybody going back to the standards at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/commons:babel" class="extiw" title="commons:commons:babel">commons:commons:babel</a> and working there to get consensus rather than branching out here? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Patterson_109a.html" title="User:Robin Patterson">Robin Patterson</a> 13:22, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that on the esperanto wikipedia, the syntax for the Babel templates was not exactly the same - for a native speaker, you write "en-D" (D for "denaske", native) and not "en". I partially solved the problem by making copies of the "en-D" template into a corresponding "en" template.</p>
<p>I think that it's important for users to easily copy and paste babel templates between languages - if there's a template whose syntax shouldn't vary across wikipedialand, it's this one, since it's users overlaps with those most likely to have multiple user pages.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Other languages</span></h2>
<p>Hello - I created a new template for "other languages" - ie, languages with very few speakers or with no widely used written form (such as deaf <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sign_language.html" title="Sign language">sign languages</a>). Contributors writing <i>about</i> such languages may wish to identify themselves as users of the language, even though they are only writing about it in English. It's not perfect and doesn't work in the Babel template (as it has a nested variable which allows you to specify the 'other language' in question). Here are two examples of how it might look:</p>
<div style="float: left; border:solid darkblue 1px; margin: 1px;">
<table cellspacing="0" style="width: 238px; background: lightblue;">

<dd>Although there isn't any ISO639 language code for "ol" yet, I do find it unfortunate to use it anyway - it may become used in the future.

<p>Thanks all for your input! I agree we should ditch the "ol" code. I like the suggestion of a seperate template for sign languages coded as "sgn" — partly because the template can use a phrase like "native signer" rather than "speaker", and partly because it fits best with this project's convention of using codes from ISO 639. I will go ahead and make it now.</p>
<p>There is still a problem though: if I leave the "language" variable in the template (so the user can specify which particular language they sign), it breaks the Babel template. Anyone more code-savvy than me got any ideas for fixing this?</p>
<p>By the way, according to clause 4.4 of ISO 639-2, other codes can be appended to the "sgn" code to specify different Sign Languages, but there is as yet no widely agreed-upon system in place. I'd prefer to have one template for all sign languages (with a "language" variable in the template). <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 06:39, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like the generic language template because it would allow me to make one for Elvish. (Not that I am likely to do so. But I could. You might want to consider whether major conlangs count. There's already an Esperanto template...) However, I find the wording a little awkward. <i>An other language</i> is an odd phrase. <i>A miscellaneous language</i> would work, although I'm not sure why it needs to say anything at all.

<dd>What is so strange, or so outlandish, about the existence of an Esperanto [set of] templates?

<p>1. I will leave it up to somebody else to make the "mis" template (easy enough to convert from the "ol" template above). The discussion on the "sgn" template will continue on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category_talk%7EUser_sgn_dcdf.html" title="Category talk:User sgn">Category talk:User sgn</a>; there are some problems to be ironed out. I encourage everyone to have a look! I'll paste the above discussion in there.</p>
<p>2. I agree with Aranel ("Sarah"), there is no need to include the phrase "a miscellaneous language" - however, there was a reason I put it in there. When clicking on the phrase "other language" in the template above, you are taken to the category:User ol page, which explains the category and has links to all the users using the template (following the format of the existing user language templates). -- <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 06:17, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>p.s One problem is that the word <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warlpiri.html" title="Warlpiri">Warlpiri</a> in the example above should properly link to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warlpiri_language.html" title="Warlpiri language">Warlpiri language</a> but the template doesn't accomodate this.

<p>No matter how minor the language, if you speak it you can create a template for it. If it doesn't have an ISO 639-2 code, use the ISO/DIS 639-3 code (usually the ethnologue code). If it doesn't have one of those, use an arbitrary 4- or more-letter code, or the whole language name. How am I supposed to indicate, for example, that I am Singlish 2? By writing {{user singlish-2}}, of course. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 17:59, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mapping Babel templates to ALTE/CEF levels?</span></h2>
<p>I was just wondering about this...</p>
<p>Would it be possible to map the definitions of the Babel templates to the language proficiency levels used by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages_8c14.html" title="Common European Framework of Reference for Languages">Common European Framework of Reference for Languages</a> and the <i>Association of Language Testers in Europe</i>?</p>
<p>Under this scheme, Lang-0 would be the ALTE 'Breakthrough' level, when basic concepts have just been learned. Lang-1 would be ALTE level 1, Lang-2 would be ALTE level 2, and so on and so forth. (It would be assumed that ALTE level 5, which represents 'complete native command' of a language, would be the same as Wikipedia's Lang-N level.)</p>
<p>The CEF/ALTE ranking levels have been used by multiple bodies (not just in Europe, here in the US too) to compare language ability, and I think it'd be a good idea for the Babel templates to link to them. I don't think it would involve too much work, since the levels more or less map up already (ALTE 3 / CEF B2 matches up to Babel-3 nicely, and so on and so forth) -- it would just be a way of standardizing what each level means. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 01:58, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Standardizing is a good idea. I was afraid at first that the proficiency levels would correspond to some test, but fortunately it seems that a description is also available.

<dd>I don't know. Maybe (s)he thought "cet utilisateur" ("this user") would sound awkward in French, or maybe sexist: English "user" is gender-neutral, but French "utilisateur" has a feminine, namely "utilisatrice". However, in French maybe even more than in English, "le masculin absorbe le féminin", i.e., when talking of people of both sexes or of unknown sex, or of things of both grammatical genders or of either, French always uses the masculine.<br />
And BTW, here are templates in a few more languages that I've checked. The Russian one starts "This participant", which might be more in line with the way the Wikipedia is (dis)organised; the others have "user" ("User" in Russian might be "использователь", though I don't find the latter in my dictionaries):</dd>

<dd>The fact that it is used on the Russian Babel template is irrelevant: the French Babel templates use "cette personne" (this person) which is not synonymous with "cet utilisateur" (this user). OTOH, участник "participant, member" is obviously cognate with участвовать "to take part" and участие "participation", not with использовать "to use", пользоваться "to use; to avail oneself of", использование "use, exploitation", польза "utility", полезный "useful" etc. Actually, however, (as I stated in <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EBabel_adb3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Babel">Wikipedia talk:Babel</a>) I do regard "participant" as more appropriate than "user" to the casual-editing organization of the Wikipedia.

<dd>P.S. And the use of "участник" for "user" in "Russian Wikipedia user space" doesn't mean that "участник" means "user" either; the Esperanto Wikipedia uses "Vikipediisto" ("Wikipedian") to define userspace, rather than "uzanto" or "uzulo" which would have meant "user". -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 21:05, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>one thing that bothered me when I began on wikipedia is that user account on different languages seems to be totally deconneced. You have to create an account on all wikipedia which are on a language you know. Everytime with the same username. And then everybody creates his user page and says "hello, you can find me on w:fr w:eo, ..."</p>
<p>Why not automate this a bit ?</p>
<p>We have interwiki links on articles, why don't we user them on user's page ?</p>
<p>See my home page : <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Jmfayard" class="external free" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Jmfayard" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Jmfayard</a> If i am <b>{{Babel|fr|de-3|en-2|eo-3|es-1}}</b> It seems quite logical to add in the model <b>[[eo:Vikipediisto:Jmfayard]][[de:Benutzer:Jmfayard]][[en:User:Jmfayard]][[es:Usuario:Jmfayard]]</b></p>
<p>You may notice that I'm not yet registred on w:es. <s>I will have a red link on the "spanish" page</s> (oups, does not work), and if I click on the spanish link, es.wikipedia.org notes would allow me to register for this username.</p>
<p><br />
Just my 2 cents, but they seems to be a logical extension to the Babel and interwiki systems.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What if I speak or read a language, but don't have an account in that language's Wikipedia? You already <i>can</i> add interwiki links to user pages (exactly the same way you add other interwiki links), it just isn't automated with the user langauge templates because it conveys different information. (I also have accounts on Wikipedias where I don't know the language!) -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 15:26, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the information may be a bit different, but they are tightly correlated. What about your accounts on wikipedia where you don't know the language ? Just add <b>ja-0</b> in your {{Babel|fr|de-3|en-2|eo-3|es-1|ja-0}}. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_ja-0_c7f8.html" title="Template:User ja-0">Template:User_ja-0</a> is here exactly for this. What if you speak a language and don't have an account on that wikipedia ? When you will see the link, you may want to create one, so this will encourage cooperation between wikipedias, and that's a good thing. Every user can already do that himself ? Sure, but visit random user account here <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_en-4_eba4.html" title="Category:User en-4">Category:User_en-4</a> to see how many people do it. Not that much.

<dd>I'm not in favour of making it automatic. You may know a language, even know it well, but have no intention of creating pages in it. Or you may have created accounts on several wikipedias but not with the same handle: maybe using the various translations of your given name (as in Johnny, Hanske, Hänschen, Vania, Jeannot, Juanito, Giovanello, ...) or you may have created an account in some language, forgotten about it, then found it again... IMHO there are too many imponderables. -- And BTW, since you mention level-0 Babel templates, if you want to emphasise for political reasons the fact that you don't speak some language -- as with e.g. the ru-0 templates on pages for non-Russian ex-citizens of the defunct USSR -- then you're hardly going to get an account in that loathed language, are you? -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 09:25, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right. They are some corner case which may not represent more than 5% but would make the system bad. On the other hand, I feel it's important. Like I said, the different versions of wikipedia looked like deconnected projects a few years ago. The introduction of interwiki links, then of commons.wikipedia.org were two important steps to improve multilingual cooperation. Some kind of (loosely) unification of users accounts would be a small third step to improve the situation. Ideally, the whole very long and indigest <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_d383.html" title="Wikipedia:Babel">Wikipedia:Babel</a> page could be replaced by a much more simple html form which would allow you to select the languages you know from a list, let you create the corresponding wikipedia's account if needed (and if you want) and tell you to put the corresponding <i>{{Babel|fr|de-3|en-2|eo-3|es-1}}[[eo:Vikipediisto:Jmfayard]][[de:Benutzer:Jmfayard]][[en:User:Jmfayard]][[es:Usuario:Jmfayard]]</i> in your user page. So you would be able to manually edit this information on the cases you cite. Is that possible ? Does it makes sense ? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr:Utilisateur:Jmfayard" class="extiw" title="w:fr:Utilisateur:Jmfayard">w:fr:Utilisateur:Jmfayard</a></dd>

<dd>That's exactly the problem. I don't think that, in any foreseeable future, "all" Wikipedians will someday agree on a common language, be it Classical Latin, Volapük, Quenya, Basic English, or any other language, which "everyone" will master at the xx-4 level. So (IMHO) pluri-Wikipedians will have to maintain user pages in different languages: it would be senseless to redirect all my user pages to the one in my mother language (which, BTW, is not English) since not every reader of every one of them can be assumed to have a good knowledge of the language. Oh, I know, English (or maybe sometimes a kind of Broken English) is, for good or bad, a kind of Internet <i>lingua franca</i>, but I said <b>good</b> knowledge of it; you should see some English-language emails which I get from Italian or Russian people. See above, under <b>Expansion on the user language template idea,</b> about (maybe?) making simili-Babel templates for these interwiki links. The language and username would IMHO have to be specified (but maybe the username can be defaulted to "same as current" if not specified?) -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 10:50, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd be concerned about where to draw the line. Genuine artificial languages such as Esperanto and Interlingua are fine - there is a legitimate and sizable community of people who speak them.

<dd>I would say to allow them, as long as a Wikipedian is actually using them. There are active speakers and users of a number of languages, and we shouldn't set bars for 'language notability' for either real or constructed languages. And besides, isn't allowing Wikipedians to form groups around a common topic, even if it's a 'non-serious' one like being able to speak <a href="../../../l/o/g/Loglan.html" title="Loglan">Loglan</a> or <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europanto.html" title="Europanto">Europanto</a>, a vital part of keeping Wikipedia alive and well? <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 22:47, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say to allow all languages with language codes in ISO 639, a two- or three-letter one. I may seem to be very permissive, but who is to tell what languages are "serious enough"??? Sign languages share sgn as they already do. All other languages, including ALL (sic!) conlanguages would have to share the "mis" miscellanous template, ie they are visible but lumped together. A pity there isn't a separate one for conlanguages though, it would have been good as they ARE a bit special. Also a classification with "miscellanous dead languages" and "miscellanous living languages" would have been great, but I'm going to keep to my first thought proposal. There aren't very many mis-users anyway, at least until someone contacts ISO to correct the problem. ;-) I would be more restrictive with "joke" templates though - actually I wouldn't want to allow <i>any</i> template not using the ISO 639 codes, or at least not a code+locale (en-UK). The babel system is supposed to be helpful - even for people that are non-native speakers who perhaps don't know what <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibberish.html" title="Gibberish">gibberish</a> is. Conlangs as <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">klingon</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quenya.html" title="Quenya">quenya</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">esperanto</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volap%C3%BCk.html" title="Volapük">volapük</a> and even <a href="../../../t/o/k/Toki_Pona_266a.html" title="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</a> would all be allowed with this construction though (under mis if not with its own code). <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETERdON_fab6.html" title="User:TERdON">TERdON</a> 23:36, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Checked the page on <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_639_02b4.html" title="ISO 639">ISO 639</a>, to my great luck there is a special code for conlangs, art (as in artificial). Also, except mis and sgn, there also are quite a few codes that seem to be for language groups. Because of that, I suggest all conlangs without own codes go into art, all sign languages go into sgn, and all other (ie natural) languages go into mis. The language groups could possibly be used to arrange this even more later, but for now I think those three will suffice. Also there is a category und (undecided) for unknown origin. That shouldn't be used as it really doesn't help at all in achieving what we are aiming for. ;-) <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETERdON_fab6.html" title="User:TERdON">TERdON</a> 00:36, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You didn't get what I meant. Against each two- or three-letter code there are two names: one of them is the name of the language <b>in its own writing</b>, the other (here "Hindi") is the English name of the same language. So my question is: why was the <b>hindi</b> name of the Hindi language not left in nagari script, while the Arabic name of Arabic is still in Arabic script, the Chinese name of Chinese is still in hanzi, the Armenian name of the Armenian language is still in Armenian script, etc.?</dd>

<p>Is it possible for someone to have two native languages? Or will one always have precedece over the other?

<dd>It is indeed possible to have more than one native languges: for instance, I have a friend who had a Syrian father and a French mother. His "mother language" is French and his "father language" is Arabic. Both are "native languages" to him. It is even possible to have more than two, e.g., if you spoke one language with Daddy, another with Mommy, another with Nanny, maybe still another with your kindergarten and grade-school classmates, etc. If your Spanish has fallen below "native" level for lack of use, I suppose you should put es-3 or es-2 depending on how good you think it still is. OTOH if you believe that you speak English "just as well as a native or almost" you can mention en-4. If no native English-speaker could, at any level of spoken language, detect that you're not a native English-speaker yourself (not even if you were to give a lengthy speech about politics or science in front of professionals of the matter), <i>then</i> you might perhaps pass yoursef off as a "native" English-speaker. Myself, I don't dare do that, even though I speak English quite fluently. -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 20:19, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's possible to have two languages. And that's reflected in my Babel template in my user page. My parents spoke/speak both <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog_language.html" title="Tagalog language">Tagalog</a> and English - and usually in the same sentence - to me. But since my education was in English and due to the fact that I live in the US, it's my dominant native language. My Tagalog was dormant for many years (though no longer the case), but I still understand it as instaneously I do English, I mean it's not like listening to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan_language.html" title="Catalan language">Catalan</a>, where it's not as instantaneous.</dd>

<dd>I think it would look nicer if yellow was used for en-1, and the aqua color used on en-4. Yellow is like a warning color like red is, so I think it makes sense for it to be above red. Aqua is a cool color resembling green and should be immediately under en-native's green. <a href="../../../j/i/g/User%7EJigen_III_400c.html" title="User:Jigen III">Jigen III</a> 11:28, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

My previous contrib seems very dark compared to the old one, so I made some modifications --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 14:35, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMO, the gradient from blue at en-N to green at en-1 is very well-designed; however a reverse transition may be more appropriate, as green is generally not a warning color. (In fact, it is often used to the opposite effect, as in a traffic light). --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiacc_5519.html" title="User:Wikiacc">Wikiacc</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiacc_9eed.html" title="User talk:Wikiacc">(talk)</a> 22:03, September 2, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think only the zero template should be a warning color. All further levels including 1 point to an ability, it is not a warning that someone speaks some language badly, instead it is the statement that this language is somewhat understood, but far from perfectly. That's why I chose green, but light to signify small ability. Higher levels are darker and gradually change to blue, which may not make sense to everyone, but I like it :) --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 13:23, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current color scheme makes no sense. Why on Earth is en-4 yellow, when en-3 is purplish blue, en-2 is aqua, en-1 is some light-violetish color I don't ever dare to try to name, en-0 is red and en-N is some strange shade of green? IMO a better thing would be light red (#FF3333) for en-0, light yellow (#FFFF33) for en-1, light green (#33FF33) for en-2, light cyan (#33FFFF) for en-3, light blue (#3333FF) for en-4, and white for en-N.</p>

<dd>I also prefer Jigen III's gradated color scheme (the second one, without the yellow band) to the others presented in this section, if any change at all needs to be made. The other proposals either have harsh colors, or are very difficult to read (either because the background is too dark or the contrast between background and foreground colors is too slight). Pastel backgrounds with black text are easiest to read., and a gradation that more or less follows the spectrum makes sense. Maybe someone with more layout skills than I could arrange the proposals side by side and give them designations so that we could call for organized commentary and see if there is consensus for modification. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 04:08, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">xx-N vs xx-4</span></h2>
<p>Why do we have to have seperate categories for native (xx-N) and near-native (xx-4)? As many users have noted above, some people speak a second language better than they know their mother tongue. Surely the purpose of the babel templates is to identify someone's competence in a language, not the order in which they learn them. Have a look at some xx-4 users; their contributions are indistinguishable from native speakers. Many of the languages don't use an xx-4 category, and it seems to me like an unneccesary complication and an unfair segregation. Would anyone support merging these two categories into a "native or native-like" single category? <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 02:25, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would never try to pass myself as a "native" English-speaker; I am too conscious of the pitfalls of that incredibly difficult language. <i>(Now get me right: It is <b>easy</b> to speak the kind of broken English used by a Japanese to ask his way about in Paris; but I don't believe that <b>any</b> non-native could "hold his own" on an equal footing in difficult contexts, such as arguing for or against a legal text or a philosophical thesis, if the discussion has to take place in English against a native speaker of the language.)</i><br />
About Esperanto (my other level-4 language), the situation is different: native speakers of the language are few and far between, and although it is not they who set the language norm, they still have a particular "status", probably due to their rarity.<br />
<b>Summary:</b> I believe the distinction between <i>native</i> and <i>almost-native</i> is useful. The nonexistence of xx-4 templates in many Wikipedias is attributable to the recent introduction of that level. -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 10:50, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Not really. Personally, being a native Spanish speaker, I've been able to debate my way to my teammates' satisfaction. As a result, I can claim myself as a native English speaker. But the way I see it, it's just a matter of personal preference. Some prefer to be called "near-native" while others prefer "native". Keep both, they don't hurt. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a> 22:40, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have to remember that "native" here refers to "native fluency". A native speaker (or writer) has probably been using a language for a very long time, perhaps his/her entire life. A near-native speaker may know the language just as well (or close enough), but may still be more comfortable using another. -- <a href="../../../w/u/r/User%7EWurdBendur_68ca.html" title="User:WurdBendur">WurdBendur</a> 22:48, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tonymec: If you feel your English isn't 'native-like', then put en-3 ("advanced"). It's really a matter of how many gradations we need — some scales of language proficiency have 10 levels. My argument was that, as many users have noted above in this discussion page, the concept of 'nativeness' doesn't always correlate with proficiency. I worked with an interpreter in India who (by her own admission) spoke Hindi and English better than her 'mother tongue' Gujarati. Most deaf people encounter a spoken language first, but develop proficiency in a sign language that far exceeds that of the spoken language. Some wikipedians on this talk page have been confused about whether they are truly 'native speakers' or not, whether they can have two mother tongues, etc. If 'native' and 'native-like' were conflated, it would avoid these confusions. Furthermore, if ability to "argue for or against a legal text or a philosophical thesis" is a test of nativeness, then most people I know have no native language! <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 23:38, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, level 4 has (IIUC) only recently been introduced. Are we going to delete it before it has had time to show its usefulness?<br />
For some people, I suppose that two levels are enough ("I speak xx [my mother language] and if you ask me about yy [anything else], then I don't: yy-0"). For others the numbers of useful distinguishable levels is higher. I would be happy with a couple more than exist:
<ul>
<li>Native: I am a native French speaker from Belgium.</li>
<li>Almost-native: I speak English and Esperanto fluently, with no difficulty; but I wouldn't regard myself as a native.</li>
<li>Fluent: I speak Dutch easily, with little difficulty, but not as well as English or Esperanto. I can imitate a couple of regional accents of it (let's say Brussels vs. Amsterdam).</li>
<li>Good: I understand Spanish and Italian easily, I speak them without too much difficulty but I may inadvertently make errors of lexicon (when the word in the language in question is not etymologically related to the French word with the same meaning) or of grammar (e.g. in conjugation)</li>
<li>Notions: I can speak everyday German. In technical matters I may get lost. I can understand Catalan and Portuguese rather well, helped by analogy with other Romance languages, but I cannot speak them.</li>
<li>Elementary notions: I can speak Russian with dictionary.</li>
<li>Bare Bones Beginner: I can read written Czech, and get a glimpse of what it means by analogy with Russian. I know a few phrases each of Arabic, Chinese, Hungarian, Finnish, Polish, and some Scandinavian languages; those languages interest me, but I can't understand them, except by painstakingly looking up every single word in a dictionary.</li>
<li>Zero: Other languages I don't speak at all.</li>

<dd>Seems to me everyone is fretting about this just a little too much. The point of these categories is not to certify oneself as a UN translator or make any kind of binding representation that someone's going to come quiz you on ( <i>"So! fr-4 are you? Well, conjugate <b>croire</b> in the future perfect subjunctive for me, and be quick about it!"</i> ) - it's just to signal to other editors here your general level of competence in various languages. One person's xx-2 may be another person's xx-3; I don't think it's necessary to obsess about the difference between one level and the adjacent one, or whether you can call yourself xx-N if you didn't actually imbibe the language with your mother's milk. As far as I'm concerned, levels 1 / 2 / 3 plus "native" are probably sufficient, much more by way of fine gradations seems kind of meaningless. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 03:25, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had a feeling the tide of opinion would be against me on this one. I agree with EDM that people are getting confused by finicky definitions — that's precisely why I proposed a simpler system! (And hopefully <i>before</i> xx-4 becomes too entrenched). I guess I don't feel anyone has justified the need for a distinction between xx-N and xx-4.</p>
<p>Anyway, for the record, here's the system I like, which was suggested by <a href="../../../h/v/_/User%7EHV_b97d.html" title="User:HV">user:HV</a> above:</p>
<ul>
<li>xx the user speaks the language like/as a native speaker</li>
<li>xx-3 the user is able to write articles in this language without any difficulty</li>
<li>xx-2 the user is able to modify articles and participate in discussions</li>
<li>xx-1 the user understands the language well enough to use an article as a source for writings in their own language, or answer simple questions.</li>

<dd>This set of xx-3/2/1 definitions is good because it is clearcut and has logical competence boundaries while still leaving each level broad enough for some reasonable overlap. The value of an xx-4 level is that, subtle though it be, there is a difference between the competence of a truly native speaker and one who may be completely fluent in a language but isn't native. For example, a truly native speaker will have an 'ear' for questionable or incorrect constructions that a non-native speaker, no matter how fluent, might miss, and xx-4 captures that. That is not to say that someone couldn't be xx-N in more than one language - as others have pointed out above, that situation is not uncommon in households with parents who speak different languages, or for people raised by foreign nannies, etc. I don't think anyone should hesitate to give themselves two or even more xx-N boxes in appropriate cases. But I think ntennis makes a valid point that having the xx-4 category may introduce some confusion that is undesirable in the context of what these category boxes really are intended for here. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 19:14, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we define <i>native language</i> as a language which you can understand without any effort, regardless of the order of learning, the current scheme makes sense. For example, I classified myself as en-3 because, even if I understand written English like it were Italian, my home language (I still need to look up on a dictionary from time to time, but this sometimes even happens with one's home language, and however I have no problem in using a monolingual English dict), I still make little errors which few natives would. (E. g., I took a little to memorize that <i>vowel</i> was not spelt <i>wovel</i>.) If I didn't make such mistakes, I would classify myself as en-4, but I will never classify myself en-N until I can watch a movie in English without any problem and without having to pay any particular attention.--<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 16:50, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Babel code "zh" ambiguous</span></h2>
<p>Babel code "zh" is ambiguous. Does it refer to the spoken language, or the written language? Officially it is supposed to mean the spoken language, but within the context of Wikipedia, using "zh" to mean the spoken language is rather pointless.</p>
<p>This shows up as an inconsistency in the text that is displayed. On the user page, the Babel code would be displayed as</p>
<pre>
這個用戶的母語是中文。
这个用户的母语是中文。
</pre>
<p>which means "this user's native language is <i>written Chinese</i>"; however, if you click the "native language" link, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:User_zh-N" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:User_zh-N" rel="nofollow">the page that is shown</a> says</p>
<pre>
这些用户的母语是汉语。
這些用戶的母語是漢語。
</pre>
<p>which means "these users' native language is <i>spoken Chinese</i> (and Mandarin in particular)".</p>
<p>To illustrate the vast difference between the two meanings, for the former meaning of zh I would claim "zh" (native "speaker") status, but for the latter I would only be able to claim a "zh-1" (elementary level). For the purpose of reading and writing in Wikipedia, the former meaning would be a useful meaning, while the latter (being able to "speak Mandarin") would be a plus but would not be necessary.</p>
<p>Also, with the existence of code "zh-yue", ability to speak Mandarin should be indicated by code "zh-guoyu".</p>

<p>Ok someone already talked about this in the past, but it seems that the language level descriptions on the main page are still hopelessly unclear.</p>
<p>First of all, right now there is no clear difference between levels 3, 4, and native. Level 3 says fluent but with a few occasional errors, which is exactly what native is. Level 4 also says 'like native, only not native', which brings up the question: Why do we need a level 4?</p>
<p>In any case, I think the ratings should go something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>xx-0 - this user understands the basics of <i>language</i>, but cannot contribute to most articles on <i>language</i>"s Wikipedia.</li>
<li>xx-1 - this user knows <i>language</i> enough to make minor tweaks and answer basic question, but cannot contribute in <i>language</i> in a major way.</li>
<li>xx-2 - this user can make minor and some major edits in <i>language</i> and participate in most discussions.</li>
<li>xx-3 - this user is fluent in <i>language</i> but cannot speak it on a native level, i.e. does not understand most colloquial and/or grammatical quirks of <i>language</i>.</li>
<li>xx-4 - this user is on the level of a native speaker of <i>language</i>, but isn't a native speaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>The wording may need to be changed slightly, but this is the basic idea. It retains lvl 4 as similar to native, but makes a clear distinction between 3 and 4/native.</p>
<p>However, if the majority hear is up for it, I suggest a slight revamp, to make a real difference between level 4 and native. That is, IMO, level 4 should be above regular native. Either that or remove level 4 and make a 'native plus' category - basically a person who has special education or interest in a language which enables them to recognize tiny grammar, style and semantic quirks, and 'high' vocabulary which isn't known to most native speakers (i.e. word <i>spadix</i> in English). But again, this last proposal is only if everyone feels up to it, my way of being bold basically. A lot of user pages would have to be changed (and many users would be better alerted) if this came to pass.</p>

<dd>The biggest problem I see is still the existence of a single "native" level versus multiple "non-native" levels. Not every native speaker is equally good at the language, so just saying "native" rather than "advanced" simply because you learned the language in your early childhood doesn't make sense.</dd>
<dd>I think the "native" label should be seperated from the scale and be combined with a normal level blip for clarification. The level scale should not make any mention of nativeness at all.</dd>
<dd>Either that or we'd have to duplicate the scale for natives so we end up with xx-1 through xx-4 and xx-N-1 through xx-N-4, which is ridiculous.</dd>
<dd>A third possibility would be adding a variable to the template that defines whether a sentence about being a native speaker "This user is a native speaker of x" or not "This user is not a native speaker of x" should be visible on the level template. However that sentence should not be the sole statement about the language proficiency.</dd>
<dd>As for the xx-0 through xx-4 scale I'd suggest the following:</dd>
<dd>xx-0 Does not understand or does not wish to speak this language (some people just assume people speak a language because of the other languages they speak or where they come from, this could be used to indicate that one really does not or does not want to speak the language -- 1337 or French, for example)</dd>
<dd>xx-1 Knows the basics of the language, but not enough for major contributions (e.g. I learned Latin in school and passed it, but I couldn't contribute in Latin without using a reverse dictionary and looking up endings)</dd>
<dd>xx-2 Knows enough to make a point or follow the gist of a conversation (e.g. basic school English, or the cliché Asian tourist trying to speak English: grammar tends to be a problem or the vocabulary is lacking, but it's enouggh for basic communication)</dd>
<dd>xx-3 Knows enough to be considered fluent, only minor mistakes</dd>
<dd>xx-4 Fluent speaker with a wider vocabulary than usual (i.e. additional knowledge of special technical vocabularies rather than just "layman's terms")</dd>
<dd>The average, fluent native speaker would probably classify himself xx-3, attorneys or technical engineers on the other hand might use xx-4. I guess one could add xx-5 for actual linguists who have knowledge of the language well beyond that of modern everyday usage, but I guess that group is almost neglectible. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 06:43, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I pretty much agree with your reasoning. Yes, it would make sense for native not to be on the scale at all. So, how do we remove it? Simply removing the template will cause hundreds of broken user pages.

<p>These are not good ideas. The levels as they are now, with the slightly fluid definitions for them that are given way above somewhere, are working fine and there is no need for the radical revamps these two contributors are discussing. <i>Native speaker</i> has a meaning; we all know what it means; to say "some native speakers are better than others" misconceives what the term is intended to convey. Attorneys or technical engineers should classify at a higher level than other native speakers, because they are familiar with some technical terms as part of their job?

<dd>No need to ridicule my proposal for a proper definition of xx-4 as "beyond average". While English tends to be somewhat clear even if the text is a very scientific one, other languages don't work that way. In German for example, you can't expect most "laymen" to write like, e.g., <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kant.html" title="Kant">Kant</a> -- or at least comprehend his works -- without considerable difficulties. That's not only because of the very specific jargon, but also because of the very complex and precise language they he uses. The same is true for many other philosophers or even scientists.</dd>
<dd>Even an above-average native speaker may and will experience difficulties in cases like that. This is not restricted to natural sciences, mathematics (which, nowadays, usually rely on symbolic expressions instead, because they are even more precise), social sciences or jurisdiction, either. The only ways to express "This user can contribute in a very scienticical and precise language" would either to add another scale for each "field" of language (most possibly based on the general areas where the language is applied) or to generalize it and add it to the existing scale as another level.</dd>
<dd>Linguists OTOH would possibly go beyond that by having fluent "meta" knowledge about the language and thus being able to comprehend anything you throw at them, although reality probably shows otherwise -- which is why I only added that level in a notion.</dd>
<dd>Contrary to what you wrote, "Native language" has more than one meaning, apparently, because many people take it litterally and use it nearly identical to "mother's tongue" (which is in fact what many of the foreign-language xx-N templates translate to: eg. "Muttersprache" for de-N), if that gives you a better image. Its litteral definition pretty much boils down to "language you were born with" (hence: native). While you may be accustomed to using it more widely to describe a general level of language skill that is usually assumed when talking about "native speakers", my above definition and the many critiques on this talk page should be proof enough that the term is a bad choice to get this particular meaning across.</dd>
<dd>Given the critique on what meaning the term does convey, I repeat my statement: Some native speakers speak their native language better than others. If this sentence breaks in your opinion because your definition of "native" is detached from the meaning the word as such implies, that means nothing but that the term is not a good choice to convey the meaning you intend.</dd>
<dd>By your definition "xx-N" could easily be replaced by "xx-5" (de facto, since we already have a level xx-4 that is NOT equivalent to "native", apparently) because it does not require the speaker to speak the "native" language as his mother's tongue. Thus I would like to ask you, if the notion of whether or not a person was raised in a particular language is irrelevant, then why use an ambiguous "level" in the first place? Why not drop xx-N altogether and replace it by the non-ambiguous xx-5? If your answer is "because it's established already", then why not remove the notion of "nativeness" altogether? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 15:18, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>In learning your native language you pick up an enormous number of idiomatic expressions automatically because you normally use that language every day of the year during sixteen waking hours as well as your hours spent dreaming in it at night. The daytime use alone works out to nearly 6000 hours a year or, in twenty years, some 120,000 hours. During this time you are constantly practicing your native language. You think in it, read in it, speak in it, hear it, and you are constantly updating and perfecting your knowledge of all of its distinctive features.<br />

<dd>If we use <i>this</i> definition of native language, rather than one about having learnt it as a children/being one's parents' language etc., the en-N template definitely makes sense. En-4 is for someone which knows English language perfectly well, but does not normally use it, i.e., does not live in an English speaking place. Of course it is possible that a highly educated en-4 person is more proficient in <i>formal written</i> English (which is the language in which Wikipedia is written) than an average en-N person. But by writing en-4 in your BabelBox you let know that you don't usually <i>think</i> in English, therefore you might not e.g. get subtle jokes, understand slang, that you have to pay particular attention in order to understand casual speech, etc. As I see it, an unqualified en-N should be thought to imply an en-3 proficiency in formal written English; and if you are more skilled in it than an average en-N speaker (e.g. if you are a language teacher/a professional writer/etc.), you are en-4. I.e., en-N should be a subcat of en-3; and an English teacher (or similar) should mark themself only as en-4 if they don't usually speak in English in normal situation, and BOTH as en-4 and en-N if they do. (Obviously the description of en-4 would have to be changed if it had to conform this schema.) --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 15:57, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>EDM, if you think the system is fine now, would you be kind enough to explain the current difference between levels 3, 4 and native? And if they're indeed the same as I noted in the original post, why are you opposed to making a clear separation or better clarification?</dd>
<dd>Also, I second what Ashmodai said in the last post. Especially about the technical/high language. In Hebrew for instance, there are some complicated grammar ruled (i.e. rules for <a href="../../../n/i/q/Niqqud.html" title="Niqqud">Niqqud</a>) which most of the native population does not know. There is also a thing called 'high Hebrew', which is basically a set of several thousand (but obviously it's not clearly defined which words form 'high Hebrew') deprecated or Biblical words/expressions which are usually known only to the 'intellectual elite'. Although it's true that some may use a level like this to show off something they don't have/know, it's definitely far above an average native speaker.</dd>
<dd>The 'native' level is also ambiguous, proven by the mere fact that several people already asked about it in this discussion. It can mean the language you were born/grew up with, which is often a language you no longer use, but it can also mean a language you got your education in and know very well, or the language of your country (but not necessarily the one you used most in your life).</dd>
<dd>(Update after Army's post):</dd>
<dd>I agree with such a definition in principle, but this doesn't seem to fit with what other users have said. For instance, by your definition, it's very difficult to have more than one native language, and it's also hard to definte your native language if you grew up and know one very well, but are currently using and thinking in another. Also, this still leaves some ambiguity as to the level, since it's both similar to an average fluent level (lvl 3), and a high fluent level (lvl 4).</dd>

<dd>Actually I agree more with Army's suggestion. We should see the Native speaker level as a disjoint set from level's 3 and 4 (you may reword these if necessary, only slightly), so I could be both Native and at level 3 (or even level 2?), or Native and level 4. Moreover we could add level 5 for high technical speakers -- these two could be native or non-native. Finally, with this model I see no problem for people who are native speakers in more than one language: for example I could be both en-N and es-N as well as en-4 and es-4. (Which I happen to be). Let me be more specific: xx-N would be perfect to determine if a user can understand colloquialisms and subtle nuances, while xx-1 through xx-4/5 would describe the level of grammatical expertise and formal vocabulary the user commands. (An aside: i think level 0 is really not useful at all, as to me it seems redundant.) --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStux_2586.html" title="User:Stux">Stux</a> 16:31, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's even better. We could redefine levels as follows:
<ul>
<li>1. I can read English, but I would not be able to write non-trivial sentences without having a reference book and/or having to look up 50% of the words on a dictionary. (Which is exactly as it is now, as I understand it and use it on my user page.)</li>
<li>2. I can write English well enough to make myself understood, but I am likely to do many mistakes which will let one understand that I'm not a native speaker. (More or less as it is now, as I understand it.</li>
<li>3. I can write English, even if minor errors could happen. This may be due either to the fact that I'm poorly educated, or to the fact that I'm not native. (Notice that there is difference from the errors likely to occour in the former or in the latter: exchanging two homophone but otherwise unrelated words is likely to be done by an uneducated native, wheter using a common verb with a wrong preposition is likely to be done by a learner.)</li>
<li>4. I can write English like an averagely educated native English speaker.</li>
<li>5. I can write English better than an averagely educated native English speaker (e.g. a writer, a language teacher).</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't mean to ridicule the proposals; sorry if it came across that way. What I was trying to say was that I think these proposals are trying to make too finely graded distinctions, without consideration of what the purpose of these templates is. In that sense, these proposals run the danger of being <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feature_creep.html" title="Feature creep">feature creep</a>. I don't believe that these levels are (or should be) intended to act as certifications or licenses or warranties by a user as to some level of competence, as though they were applying for a translator position or something. They're merely intended to signify, generally, that a user is a native speaker of a language (=mother tongue, =raised in it, etc.) with the "feel" for the language that the term "native speaker" implies; or that the user falls somewhere else on the sliding scale of fluency in a language that categories 0/1/2/3/4 suggest.</p>
<p>A linguist's "metafluency" is a completely separate parameter, one that I would suggest is inappropriate for capturing in a template. As I believe most linguists will confirm, knowledge of the <i>structure</i> of a language or group of languages - its syntax, phonology, historical development, and so forth - does not necessarily correlate to competence in the language, though of course often it will.</p>
<p>I disagree that English is "somewhat clear" in all contexts in a way that German or any other language is not. Every language has its noted stylists that the vast bulk of the speaking population can only vainly hope to emulate. German laymen may not write like Kant; most native English-speaking laymen don't write like Shakespeare or Joyce or Hemingway either. That doesn't mean they ought to be classified as less "native" or "fluent" in the language, and certainly not for purposes of contributing to this encyclopedia.</p>
<p>As I understand the current consensus usage of 1/2/3/4 levels, (or at least as I use them) they correspond roughly to (1) "I can read an article okay, but I wouldn't want to try to contribute much" (put another way, "decent passive knowledge, little active knowledge") / (2) "I can read and contribute at a level that I won't get laughed at too much" / (3) "Essentially fluent (maybe book-learnt)" / (4) "Fluent though not technically native." (Level 0 is a different matter and we might as well leave that undefined without adverse consequences.) I think those definitions are working well enough for the purpose the templates are needed for, and I'm just trying to caution against too much definitional fussiness. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 16:50, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well said! I think your description and intention of the levels (as an informal gauge) makes much more sense. As for <i>most native English-speaking laymen don't write like Shakespeare or Joyce or Hemingway either</i> -- don't forget lawyers too! (My apologies to those that practice said profession and are currently reading this entry). Technical knowhow may (or may not!) be too broad to summarize in templates -- well at least in a single templates. Though I'm afraid this might lead to a proliferation of technical language templates. But would that be such a bad thing? Then again, we don't want to have people feel alienated because of their training or lack thereof in a specific subject. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStux_2586.html" title="User:Stux">Stux</a> 17:29, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason I posted this in the first place was because, when editing my user page, I suddenly wondered whether my level of Hebrew (which is native but not awesome) would constitute as a 3, 4 or Native. Also if my English (on a native level, including the 'feel' but not native) would be a 4 or Native. Basically what I'm trying to do is to avoid confusion for other users (and myself) by defining the levels more clearly. Seriously, no one should have to sit there and wonder what they should put for their page. It's not feature creep because it's not meant to be at the expense of something else.</dd>
<dd>Aside from that, I agree that it shouldn't be a 'definite assertion of a level of competence'. However, one of the purposes of the template is to help people using different languages speak to each other, and it doesn't help anyone when the user looks at someone else's 'level 2' and can't understand if that person is fluent or not.</dd>
<dd>Your last paragraph is also strange as it's not the impression I got from reading the main page or some of the other user pages. This is exactly why the levels should be more clearly defined - because even the two of us seem to have a different idea of what the consensus is. But in any case, no matter what numbering system is used, I think several basic levels should be definted: a level where a person is familiar with the language's basics but can't really read/write on a practical level; a level where a person can understand (and write) basic things, but not to make full contributions; a level where a user can read, understand and make full contributions, but doesn't have good mastery of the language's more intricate details; a level where a person has completely mastered the language, even if they don't know 'high language'. That, as well as a possible highest level (a user who knows high/technical jargon). This is why I agreed with Ashmodai that the system would work better without a 'native' level. However, I'm not objecting to a native level as long as every level is clearly defined.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree that the "meta" notion is doubtful, but I already said that twice anyway. I don't fully agree on your definitions though. The language in which you think has been shown to change under certain circumstances (I find it easier to write about certain things in English and think about them "in English", even though I am not a native speaker). Language fluency requires being able to form sentences in that language without having to translate them from your native language anyway.</dd>
<dd>I also think that we can agree that the notion of "nativeness" is not of any interest when it comes to scaling the language proficiency. Although it is not "perfectly" normal, it is possible to acquire a level of language proficiency equal to that of a native in every aspect at a later point than that at which a native did so (which would be very early childhood, I guess). Thus, since "native" implies a general age range at which the language was acquired, I do not think properties of interest for rating the language skill can be restricted to native speakers.</dd>
<dd>I already said it's absurd to attempt to explain the user's proficiency in every aspect of the language. We can't go overboard with this and have scales for poetry, legislation and everything else. That's why I proposed to express that kind of special -- or "advanced" -- language skill as a higher level than "just" being fluent.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, we need to consider other uses of the language templates. They will (and are) not only be used to find out what languages a user can contribute in. They also help judging whether (or how well) a user can understand what you are trying to tell them on their Talk page. That is why the statements these templates make about the user's language skills should be as clear as possible. It should be a scale of the user's language skills, not more (even though that is already quite a complex concept to cover with a very limited linear set of levels). Nativeness, nationality and other concepts should not be part of the scale. We might want to find ways to specify the language variant (in the case of English: en-GB, en-AU or en-US, mostly), though, but having them as seperate scales would be overkill (and certainly not very useful, considering they are mutually intelligable). <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 18:00, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess I just don't see what the big deal is, and maybe that is my own personal failing. What is the actual, real-world consequence of somebody's categorizing themself as, say, level 3 vs. level 4? Do they get some Wikibonus for being level 4? Do they miss out on the cool people's discussions if they call themselves level 2? If someone is sitting at their computer agonizing over whether they are level 2 or level 3, then (with respect and sympathy to Ynhockey) they need to get out more. My personal practice is to put the lower level if I think it could be one or the other, but I really think it's inconsequential if someone else with the identical fluency level puts the higher one.</p>
<p>Think of it like a movie or restaurant review in the paper.

<p>Well, I'll say below <b>how I understand</b> the various levels — and, therefore, how I used them in the Babel template on my user page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only language which I use day in and day out, including with my parents and relatives, is French. I mentioned "native knowledge" of French.</li>
<li>When talking, reading, or writing in English, I don't need to translate to and from French. I use written English for reading novels and on the Internet with no (subjective) barrier. I understand most of the idiomatic expressions I come across, sometimes through the context. But I would feel at a disadvantage if I had to argue verbally in English against someone whose knowledge of English were equivalent to my knowledge of French. I mentioned "en-4".</li>
<li>Similarly, I don't need to translate Esperanto to or from French. But the case of Esperanto is special, since it has much less native speakers (who learnt it from their parents or in kindergarten) than it has speakers "as an acquired language". In particular, the language norm is not set by its native speakers but by its "good" speakers including the <i>Akademio de Esperanto.</i> I mentioned "eo-4".</li>
<li>I can use Dutch passively, or for low-level daily use (for instance, to order a drink in a bar) but my proficiency in Dutch is significantly lower than in French, English or Esperanto. In particular, I don't buy Dutch novels and I (usually) don't listen to Dutch-language radio. I mentioned "nl-3".</li>
<li>I can understand Spanish or Italian passively, but to <b>write</b> in them I occasionally need a dictionary. I mentioned "es-2" and "it-2".</li>
<li>I can understand German with some difficulty, but when writing it I constantly hesitate about the fine points of its orthography, especially now that the rules have recently changed. (In the languages mentioned above I have "good spelling" without the need for a spell checker or dictionary, but with the exception of French and English, which are at the top of my list, they use "phonetic" spelling.)

<dd>As for what the phrase <i>native language</i> may imply, I think we better change it to <i>home language</i> or something like that. (If I went to live in an English speaking country on my own, i.e. with no one from my country (Italy), and almost all of the people I were going to deal with spoke English, as I see it, I would have to change myself from en-3 to en-N within two years or less. And if meanwhile I become significantly less fluent in Italian, I'd have to change from it-N to it-2 or whichever appropriate level I would feel.) --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 16:31, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was all prepared not to like the changes, then I read them and I think they pretty well do capture a reasonable definition of the gradations in levels. Good job, Ynhockey. I may tweak the wordings a little but overall I think they are on the right track. The one major change I'd suggest is recasting them into the passive: instead of <i>a user may use this template when...</i> rewrite to <i>this template could be used when a user...</i> This would avoid the ambiguity of the English "may," which can mean either permission (<i>Congratulations! You may now use this template, as you have satisfactorily demonstrated your competence in the language</i>) or volition (<i>you may care to use this template, or that one, if you like</i>). I don't think the first sense of the word "may" is intended here. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 06:39, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i><b>xx-2</b> [...] A user at this level should be able to coherently translate most articles (if not all) using a dictionary.</i> Does this mean "traslate from their language to xx" or "traslate from xx to their language"?For example, if it means the former I'm fr-1, but if it means the latter I'm fr-2.--<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 20:36, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The sentence, as I meant it, is an additional requirement rather than a lone one. Basically, if a user qualifies for the others but not for this one, they can't consider themselves a lvl 2, or if they qualify for this one and not the others. You're right though, maybe it should be re-worded. But I think it's important to make this clarification since it's very important for languages like Japanese or Chinese. For example, many advanced Chinese learners would have trouble finding some characters, and many advanced Japanese learners are unfamiliar with some common contextual quirks on the JA wikipedia. I guess this applies less to European languages. But basically, you need to both be able to translate with a dictionary, and understand the general idea of an article with some details without a dictionary. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 00:33, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I re-read it more carefully. Since it mentions "ability to modify articles and participate in discussions", I'm definitely not fr-2.

<dd>Yes that would be helpful, but who's going to sit through 200 language templates and change them? They'd need to know the languages in question too. But if no one disagrees, I'm going to change the xx-4 templates of the languages I know to reflect this. Btw, it's not true that xx-2 is for semi-literate people who don't want to have an account on Wikipedia. Actually most of those would <b>speak</b> the language (as the template says) fairly well. I'm mainly talking about people who have left their home country a long time ago and had no occasion to speak the language, thus forgetting it to the point they have trouble with fluency, reading and writing. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 15:26, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Don't change the templates yet, and rethink where this is going</span></h3>
<p>Ynhockey, I strongly suggest you don't go changing templates yet. Particularly, don't change the limited group of templates that happen to be the languages you know, thereby rendering the whole system inconsistent. Many, many Wikipedia users use the Babel templates; only a handful of us have commented here on the rejiggering of the levels and I suspect that most people who use Babel templates aren't even aware that this discussion is going on. Until this discussion has been publicized to the general population who don't have the Babel page watchlisted, and there is broader acceptance of these changes than the four or five people who have posted comments here, you would be altering something that many people have adopted in its existing form and they are very likely not going to notice the change.</p>
<p>What you are trying to accomplish is a clearer definition of the meaning of the various levels. I've stated above that I'm not sure that is necessary, and that this process risks being misinterpreted as a set of <b>requirements</b> rather than <b>guidelines</b> (you keep writing things like <i>if a user qualifies for the others but not for this one, they can't consider themselves a lvl 2</i>); but if I lose that argument, I lose, and that's how it is. Regardless, I think you will achieve your goal by rewriting the description of the levels that appears at the top of the Babel page, as you have done. To go on and fiddle with a small subset of the templates themselves is a bad idea. Someone wanting to know another user's fluency in a particular language is almost certainly just going to check if the user has self-categorized as 1, 2, 3 etc., not rely on the particular wording of the template text. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 17:12, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>After letting things sit for a while, reworking the definitions slightly, and rereading them all together, I have to say, I'm not happy with where this is going with regard to xx-4 and xx-N. Here is how the definitions of those templates currently read:
<dl>
<dd><i><b>xx-4</b> for users who are fluent and knowledgeable in the language in question. This includes a native-like vocabulary and knowledge of idiomatic expressions and other quirks. However, it does not necessarily connote the ability to use literary language or other advanced style.</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>xx</b> for a "native speaker." This template, like the phrase "native speaker" itself, is somewhat ambiguous. It could be used by a monolingual user, or by a polylingual user who chooses to self-identify as a "native speaker" of a particular language. It could also mean the language you grew up with or the language of your current country. Users can have more than one 'native' language. The actual level of language fluency may vary (from xx-4 to as low as xx-2).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Now, granted that "native speaker" is a notoriously imprecise term(<a href="http://neptune.spaceports.com/~words/native.html" class="external text" title="http://neptune.spaceports.com/~words/native.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> has a pretty good though not perfect discussion of the phrase and its ambiguities), I believe it still has the connotation of a certain fluency and a certain "feel" for the language, and that connotation is getting obscured by the changes that are being made in the definitions of xx-4 and xx-N.</dd>
<dd>To me, the "native speaker" is the person the linguist goes to with a sample sentence and asks <i>Is this an acceptable construction?</i> The "native speaker" of xx <b>thinks</b> in xx; he <b>dreams</b> in xx; when he drops a big heavy metal toolbox on his toe, he <b>cusses</b> in xx. You can be a native speaker of more than one language, but probably not of more than two or just possibly three. If you're fluent in six languages and can circulate with ease at diplomatic cocktail parties the length and breadth of the Continent, all but one or two of them are still xx-4. If you moved at the age of 5 from xx-land to yy-land and never spoke xx again, then you're probably not xx-N now even if you spoke nothing else before you moved.

<dd>I often curse in English, and sometimes I have even cursed in Spanish. I think this is not a good indicator. And I often think in English, and sometimes even in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europanto.html" title="Europanto">Europanto</a>. It would be more accurate to explicitly say "<b>usually</b> think". As for dreaming, IMO it's one of the most indicative things to say what your "native" language is (but obviously it'd be ridiculous to claim it to be the most important or to <i>define</i> nativeness in terms of it). --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 22:10, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cursing and even dreaming may not be a definitive criterion. Sometimes I curse in German because I feel that German curses are more "tasty", that they carry more emphatic weight so to speak, than curses in languages with which I am more familiar like French or English. On occasion I have even had dreams with a sentence or two in German in them. Nevertheless my fluency in German is far from native. - <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 18:21, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those were examples, not definitive criteria. No doubt there are others, and some might point in one direction and some in another. I was trying to make the point that what constitutes native-ness is the intersection or preponderance of many different measures, these being three possibilities. And (for those non-<b>en-N</b> here), a fine point: I mentioned cussing, not cursing. Cussing can have, and as I used it I intended it to have, the overtone of involuntariness, or at least reflexiveness. Cursing at someone can involve a well-thought-out phrase which you might well want to choose from another language you know if that gets the precise point across better. But when you drop something on your toe, you cuss, and that's more primal. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 18:42, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I referred to that. (I didn't know the difference between these two terms.) I did not refer to maledictions ("curses") (e.g. "May you go to hell.") but to interjections ("cusses") (e.g. "FUCK!"). I very often happen to yell "Fuck me!" or "Shit!" if I accidentally break something or similar, not much more rarely than I happen to cuss in Italian. (In the very case of dropping something very heavy on my toe, however, I'm more likely to just scream than to say any proper word in any language...) --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 18:37, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if I drop something I may say "merde" in my mother language, or "oh, hell" in English; if I drop something really heavy and hurt myself big time I may shout "A-oo-oo" which is in no particular language. But if I do something wrong and figuratively shoot myself in the foot, I may say "Ach, Scheisse!" which I feel has more "flavour". YMMV. And no, I don't remember ever having had a full dream all in German. Usually in French, sometimes in Esperanto, but not in German. And, OK, replace "curse" by "swear" two paragraphs up. Or maybe not: the "New <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a>" (© 1998-2001) says: <b>cuss</b> informal <b>|&gt; noun 1</b> an annoying or stubborn person or animal: <i>he was certainly an unsociable cuss.</i> <b>2</b> another terme for <b>CURSE</b> (in sense 2). <b>|&gt; verb</b> another term for <b>CURSE</b> (in sense 2). - <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 23:54, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For that reason, I don't like the current definition of xx-4 because it has removed the qualification that was in there previously, that an xx-4 speaker can speak (or understand) at a near-native or practically native level <i>but is not a native speaker</i>. I also think it's wrong to say that an xx-N speaker's fluency can vary anywhere from level 2 to level 4. An Appalachian sharecropper with an eighth-grade education may not use the same vocabulary and syntax as Daniel Webster, but they're both native speakers of English. (Feel free to substitute your local peasant and your local high-flown orator for that example.) I believe I speak and read English a lot better than most of the people I encounter in daily life, but for Wikipedia Babel purposes it would be pernicious to call me xx-4 and them xx-2. The numbered levels ought to be used to denote level of fluency in <i>secondary</i> (non-native) languages.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I'll just say it one more time. These definitions are, or ought to be, <b>guides</b> not <b>laws</b>. Think of the purpose for which the templates are intended: a signal to others, not a trophy for oneself.</dd>

<p>First of all, nobody is changing the templates. I said I would if no one objected, but kind of expected people to object.</p>
<p>That aside, I think you're missing the point regarding the 'native' level. The point is that it's ambiguous: some may interpret it as the language they were born with (but not necessarily spoke a lot), while others may consider it as some high literary level above xx-4. My clarification (and I thought the others agreed on this) aims to define the native level as clearly as possible in the shortest possible amount of words. If you want to paste your above 3-paragraph definition, go ahead, but it won't help anyone.</p>
<p>Regarding the precise definition of 'native', I don't think we agree here either. Using myself as an example: I moved to Israel at the age of 5 from the Soviet Union (Russia), and have spoken Russian relatively little since then. Until about the age of 10 my parents spoke Russian and taught me 'advanced grammar' and things like that, but then switched to English upon our move to Canada. I don't think in Russian, dream in Russian, or any of the other things you listed. Also, my level of expertise in Russian has dropped since then - I rarely use complicated phrases anymore, unless the complicated words are taken from English. However, I can probably never lose my fluency in Russian. Even after 10 years of hardly speaking it at all, I have no trouble talking or writing in Russian. Basically, my level has dropped from xx-4 to xx-3, but it has not prevented me from speaking like a native, including the slang. There are things you just don't forget.</p>
<p>However, we do agree that a native template is only useful as long as it tells something about the user. If the actual level is completely hidden under a 'native' tag, then it doesn't help. This is why I (and several other users at least, read the conversation :)) agree that 'native' is superfluous. But since removing all 'native' templates would cause an unprecedented Wikipedia disaster, there should at least be a clarification of what a native speaker is. I think most people will realize that it means having a 'feel' for the language and being able to express yourself in it, but many will also assume that it's a higher level than xx-4, which it isn't. If you're disagreeing that xx-2 can be native, then feel free to just write 'xx-3 or xx-4' instead of the current explanation. That's not so important.</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 04:08, 2 November 2005 (UTC) Another thing. In very few case, one can have a <i>passive</i> xx-N level but an <i>active</i> xx-2 or even xx-1 level. For example, my parents (with whom I live) are from Campania and almost always speak Neapolitan to each other and to family (including me). I can understand Neapolitan in almost any situation, even if I am very sleepy, and I have watched many movies in Neapolitan with no problem, with almost the same ease as it were Italian. I have some troubles in understanding the most old-fashioned idioms, like some of the ones my grandparents use, but I think that even young people living in Naples would have this problem. However, I very seldom speak in it (mainly jokingly, I can't remember ever having had a real conversation wholly in Neapolitan), and I'm very very little fluent in it (very much less than in English, and more-or-less as much as in French). If there were nap-x templates, I would maybe classify myself as both nap-1 and nap-N, but I would obviously need to explain what I mean on my user page. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 22:10, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reading your reply made me think about something: why not, instead of having the system work one way or the other (with native stuff), have it be some sort of flexible compromise: have xx-N on its own be native, xx-4 on its own be non-native but highly fluent, etc. as they are now. But allow <i>alternate definitions</i> that can be employed by users at will (and must somehow make it evident that this is the method that they are using) to specify special cases such as nap-1/nap-N mentioned above. Or even on their own: when a user sees nap-1/nap-N is it understood by the definition that it is some case like the one described above, and if it spark's the users' curiosity, they can then read the user's page and read the details. Basically this would be an extra set of "combination values" which in it of themselves sport slightly different meanings. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStux_2586.html" title="User:Stux">Stux</a> 00:18, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I just mean that creating "open" templates is not a good idea. My idea is to leave xx-1, xx-2, xx-3 as they are, rename xx-4. As I see it, xx-3 is the level of literacy and proficiency of an average native speaker, xx-4 is the level of a teacher, a writer, etc., i.e. the kind of person whom you ask to know if a sentence is grammatically correct, or to help you reword a sentence if you know it doesn't "sound right" but can't find a better way to rewrite it. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 19:26, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="New_level_descriptions" id="New_level_descriptions"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">New level descriptions</span></h2>
<p>I've been bold and changed the level descriptions by myself. They are like in my previous proposal, but with five levels instead of four. Here they are, in case they are reverted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>xx-0</b> if you might be expected to understand the language (e.g. if you often contribute to articles about it), but you actually don't. You <b>should not</b> use it for every language you do not know.</li>
<li><b>xx-1</b> if you can understand that language well enough to use an article as a source for writings in your own language, but you are unable to significantly contribute to an article in that language.</li>
<li><b>xx-2</b> if you can contribute to articles in that language to some extent, but you are not confident in writing in it and therefore you are likely to make many mistakes.</li>
<li><b>xx-3</b> if you are confident in writing that language, but often minor errors occour.</li>
<li><b>xx-4</b> if you can write articles in that language at the level of an averagely educated native speaker.</li>
<li><i>proposed — not yet implemented</i> <b>xx-5</b> if you have a 'professional' proficiency in that language (e.g. if are a teacher of it, or a professional writer in it), i.e. if you can confidently tell wheter a sentence is correct, find the most appropriate word for a given concept, understand literary and technical words and phrases, etc.</li>
<li><b>xx</b> if you are a native speaker, i.e. if you are used to use that language in all everyday situations, and you have a perfect grasp of it, including colloquialisms. (This means that if you moved from an xx-speaking country to a yy-speaking country at the age of 12, and have never spoke xx language again, you should classify yourself as a native speaker of yy and not of xx, even if you used to speak nothing else as a child. In the case that you moved as an adult, you should decide by yourself, according to your 'feel', and in rare cases you might even have several native languages.) Used alone, it means that your proficiency in written language is xx-4, if it isn't you should use <i>both</i> <b>xx</b> <i>and</i> <b>xx-5</b> <i>(when it gets implemented)</i> or <b>xx-3</b> or whatever. (If it is much lower than xx-4, however, it would be a good idea to explain the reason in your user page.)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These, except xx-N, are mainly focused about writing. This is consistent with the texts of the boxes, "This user is able to contribute with a xxxx level of yyyy" vs "This user is a native speaker of yyyy". This system is completely compatible with the old one (nobody will have to recategorise themself, unless they want to be categorised as xx-5); there is no need to rename level 4 (the definition of level xx-N makes it clear that no-one is supposed to have both xx-N and xx-4 in the same language in their BabelBox); it uses a decent definition of "native language"; and it fulfills the request for a "professional" level. Since none of the other proposals so far has all these features, I decided to use this one. The definition of xx-3 is somewhat vague and could be improved (I can't find how, as I'm not en-5...). Now we just need to create xx-5 templates "This user can contribute with a professional level of xxxxx". <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 13:37, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I like some of these edits, but not others. You basically reverted to the original version with a few exceptions. I mean, the descriptions are more ambigous now, for each level (except native). The reason I started the discussion in the first place was to define the levels clearer so that no one would have any doubt at all when choosing their level. I won't edit this stuff for now and see how the discussion goes, but why did you remove the examples and such? Also, xx-0 isn't just about Wikipedia. A user who lives in Belgium but does not speak French (although he's expected to) would also be xx-0. I won't list all the other examples now, but basically, I think most of the clarifications should be returned.</dd>

<dd>Now I've expanded them, sometimes copying and pasting old descriptions. However, IMO the current description for xx-1 is much more clear-cut than the previous one. If you can understand that language well enough to use an article as a source for writings in another language, then you are xx-1, else you aren't. The previous one is vaguer. For example, using the current one I'm definitely <b>not</b> de-1, with the previous one I might want to be one. Also I did not restore that stuff in xx-0 description about Hebrew, according to it I should add a ja-0 template in my BabelBox just because I can read hiragana and katakana. I can't see the point in this. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 14:27, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>On a side note, isn't it possible to make dynamic templates? As in, just one template for English, but if the user specifies 'en-4', it would automatically find the en-4 description in the template and put it on the page? I'm not proficient enough in MediaWiki to know, but if this can be done in PHP, I don't see a reason why it can't be done in MediaWiki. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> 14:15, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All the explanations I'm going to give are in my several comments above. The version of these templates that I was satisfied with, and the set of definitions that I personally am going to continue to use, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Babel&amp;oldid=26738614" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Babel&amp;oldid=26738614" rel="nofollow">this</a> from 28 October 2005. (Yup, no definition of or reference to <b>xx-0</b>. I and others found that on our own, have used it with possibly idiosyncratic definitions, and Wikipedia hasn't come to a grinding halt. Same goes for <b>xx-N</b>: no long, tortured definition that lurches back and forth trying to accommodate all possible input.) I believe that the changes you and others are making are moving these templates in a completely wrong direction, toward a higher level of bureaucratism and compartmentalization. That ill serves this concept.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, I think the <b>xx-5</b> level is absolutely silly. (Pretty color, though, I'll give you that.) Besides the contortions and wordiness you would have to go through to satisfactorily define "professional" in various fields of endeavor, the only purpose this template would serve is to encourage braggadocio and one-upmanship. As you will learn as you go through life, true professionals, in any field, don't brag about it.</dd>

<dd>As for description, I agree that they are too long. But there seems to be consensus that they should be descriptive.

<dd>The aim why I made that template was not "bragging about" anything. It was about being able to clean up pages with reference to language. It was kinda similar to the reason why some people may be more interested in seeking <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_5425.html" title="Category:Wikipedia articles needing copy edit">Wikipedia articles needing copy edit</a> than other people. In my view the xx-5 category would be similar to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_Taskforce_Members_Members_by_interest_f3d8.html#Languages" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup Taskforce/Members/Members by interest">Wikipedia:Cleanup_Taskforce/Members/Members_by_interest#Languages</a>, except that it is more about <i>using</i> a language than about 'pure' metalinguistic knowledge. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 17:54, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>I think that there should also be a template which says that "This user can use (insert language here) as a second language. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarret_c08f.html" title="User:Tarret">Tarret</a> 00:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know the actual entries don't make much sense; I only used them to demonstrate the template.</p>
<p>To implement this system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babellist should probably be css-ed. I'm not sure if it could be used to replace Babel directly; alternatively it could be used under its current name until older uses have been updated, at which point it could be renamed to Babel, leaving a redirect. It may need extending; currently it's only good for 16 arguments.</li>
<li>The current structure of the language bar templates appears to function with this system as well (though I did wish for a BabelBar template). To use them as they are now is not possible, as Template:User already exists for another purpose. It might be a good thing to move/copy them to BabelUser_etc anyway, since the current name is rather general considering the templates belong to a specific project. Alternatively, the existing User template could be renamed to make room for an empty template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't use the test versions of the language bars, as some were converted from fy: and hence are coded slightly differently. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliter_d5f5.html" title="User:Aliter">Aliter</a> 01:00, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Better Category links?</span></h2>
<p>I notice that when a person uses a Babel template on their user page, a Category link is automatically added to the bottom of the page as well. This is a nice feature but it seems unfortunate that the Category links are named after the Wikipedia node for that language -- i.e. "User en", "User es-1", etc. I think it would be helpful if these links were made "English speakers", "Spanish speakers" and so on.</p>
<p>I see that the templates implement this by making the links say things like [[Category:en-N|{{PAGENAME}}]]. Does this mean that what I want could be achieved by passing a PAGENAME parameter to the {{User en}} template? I'm still trying to understand how to use parameters with templates (and in any case I would prefer that this was the default behavior for the Babel templates).</p>
<p>Any thoughts? I'm sure I'm misunderstanding something fundamental about Wikipedia templates. :-) <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 15:50, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Possible correction in Wikipedia:Babel's Latin.</span></h2>
<p>It's possible that I am incorrect on this, but the Wikipedia:Babel translation for Latin is wrong.</p>
<p>This is the Latin that is found, for example, in the template on the profile of a user who has classified himself as la-1:</p>
<p><i>Hic usor simplice latinitate contribuere potest.</i></p>
<p>This was translated as:</p>
<p>This user is able to contribute with a basic level of Latin.</p>
<p>Potest is not, in fact, the present 3rd singular active indicative form of the Latin for 'to be able (to)'. That word's principle parts are as follows: <i>possum, posse, potui, --.</i> The correct form in this instance would be <i>possit</i>.</p>
<p>Also, the word <i>Latinate</i> is not, in fact, a Latin word. The Latin word for Latin is <i>Latinus, -a, -um</i>, so the correct form for the ablative singular would be <i>Latino</i> for a masculine user, and <i>Latina</i> for a feminine user. The reason for the case in this sentence is because <i>simplice Latina</i> is ablative of means (by which something is done).</p>
<p>The singular of this sentence would thus be:</p>
<p><i>Hic usor simplice Latino contribuere possit.</i></p>
<p>The plural would be:</p>
<p><i>Hi usores simplice Latino contribuere possunt.</i></p>

<dd>You are wrong. The third person indicative present active singular form of <i>posse</i> <b>is</b> <i>potest</i>. And from your explanation of why it should be <i>Latino</i> or <i>Latina</i> I'm getting the impression that you don't really know too much about grammer, no offence meant: <i>Latinitate</i> is an ablative of <i>Latinitas</i>, and is most definitely independent of the gender of the user.

<dl>
<dd>I think the idea for a Cyrillic template is good, but it doesn't require levels. Seriously, it's just an alphabet, something you can learn in one day. I mean, how do you define an 'advanced' or 'beginning' level of knowing an alphabet? (unless it's east-Asian)</dd>
