He was one of the most noted power hitters of the late 1920s and early 1930s, and <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitting_for_the_cycle.html" title="Hitting for the cycle">hit for the cycle</a> a record three times; his .532 career <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slugging_average.html" title="Slugging average">slugging average</a> ranked fourth among hitters with at least 5000 <a href="../../../a/t/_/At_bat.html" title="At bat">at bats</a> in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a> when he retired.

He was also renowned for his varied misadventures as a defensive player and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baserunning.html" title="Baserunning">baserunner</a>, which earned him derision – and eventually affection – among fans.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo, New York</a> and raised in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, Herman signed with a minor league team in <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton%2C_Alberta_dd85.html" title="Edmonton, Alberta">Edmonton</a> at age 18, and spent five years playing for six different teams, including tours in the farm systems of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>. In a 1922 spring training game, he was used as a pinch hitter for <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_Cobb_62bb.html" title="Ty Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>; but the Tigers, with no outfield vacancies, returned him to the minors, where he hit .416. He was signed for Brooklyn in 1925 by a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scout_%28sport%29.html" title="Scout (sport)">scout</a> who said of him, "He's kind of funny in the field, but when I see a guy go 6-for-6, I've got to go for him." He made his major league debut as a <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_baseman.html" title="First baseman">first baseman</a> with the Robins in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926_in_baseball.html" title="1926 in baseball">1926</a>, hitting .319 as a rookie; he finishing fourth in the NL in <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_%28baseball%29.html" title="Double (baseball)">doubles</a> (35), and seventh in home runs (11) and slugging (.500). In 1928 he placed fifth in the NL with a .340 batting mark.</p>
<p>He enjoyed an outstanding year in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929_in_baseball.html" title="1929 in baseball">1929</a>, setting team records with a .381 batting average and a .612 slugging average (breaking club marks of .379 by <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Keeler_abe2.html" title="Willie Keeler">Willie Keeler</a> and .588 by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Fournier_410e.html" title="Jack Fournier">Jack Fournier</a>) while collecting 217 hits, 105 runs and 113 RBI; but the NL was in the middle of an offensive explosion, and he finished behind <a href="../../../l/e/f/Lefty_O%27Doul_603c.html" title="Lefty O'Doul">Lefty O'Doul</a> (.398) for the batting title and was only seventh in the league in slugging. He had two doubles and two <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_%28baseball%29.html" title="Triple (baseball)">triples</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a>, and came in eighth in the 1929 <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_8b7f.html" title="MLB Most Valuable Player Award">MVP</a> voting. He followed up with his most spectacular year by improving his own batting and slugging records, with his .393 batting average again placing second in the league behind <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Terry_d321.html" title="Bill Terry">Bill Terry</a>, who hit .401 – as of 2006, the last .400 season in the NL. Herman was also third in the NL in slugging, behind <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hack_Wilson_dae1.html" title="Hack Wilson">Hack Wilson</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Klein_6ce5.html" title="Chuck Klein">Chuck Klein</a>; the league as a whole batted .303 in 1930, and while Herman's 241 hits were only third in the NL behind Terry and Klein, it was then the fifth highest total ever in the league. Herman broke Fournier's <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924_in_baseball.html" title="1924 in baseball">1924</a> club record of 27 home runs, and tied his <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925_in_baseball.html" title="1925 in baseball">1925</a> total of 130 RBI. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gil_Hodges_ff6a.html" title="Gil Hodges">Gil Hodges</a> would set a new team record of 40 HRs in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951_in_baseball.html" title="1951 in baseball">1951</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Campanella_0d8d.html" title="Roy Campanella">Roy Campanella</a> posted 142 RBI in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953_in_baseball.html" title="1953 in baseball">1953</a>; <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Snider_aad9.html" title="Duke Snider">Duke Snider</a> was the first left-handed Dodger to break Herman's HR and RBI marks. There was no MVP award given in 1930.</p>
<p>Herman was an outstanding hitter, but a below-average fielder who led the NL in <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error_%28baseball%29.html" title="Error (baseball)">errors</a> in 1927 as a first baseman and in each of the next two years playing in right field. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresco_Thompson_ad6a.html" title="Fresco Thompson">Fresco Thompson</a>, a 1931 teammate, observed: "He wore a glove for one reason: because it was a league custom." Herman developed a self-deprecating attitude about his shortcomings; when informed by a local bank that someone had been impersonating him and cashing bad checks, he said, "Hit him a few flyballs. If he catches any, it ain't me." His style of play, along with that of the entire team, led to Brooklyn being dubbed "The Daffiness Boys," with sportswriter Frank Graham noting, "They were not normally of a clownish nature, and some of them were very good ballplayers, indeed, but they were overcome by the atmosphere in which they found themselves as soon as they had put on Brooklyn uniforms."</p>
<p>Herman's name is associated with a baserunning gaffe during his rookie year that was not <i>entirely</i> his fault. During a game on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a> at <a href="../../../e/b/b/Ebbets_Field_6c4d.html" title="Ebbets Field">Ebbets Field</a>, he tried to stretch a double off the right field wall into a triple with one out and the bases loaded; Chick Fewster, who had been on first, advanced to third base – which was already occupied by <a href="../../../d/a/z/Dazzy_Vance_b9ea.html" title="Dazzy Vance">Dazzy Vance</a>, who had started from second base but was now caught in a rundown and was dashing back to third. All three of them ended up at third base, with Herman not having watched the play in front of him, and the third baseman tagged all three just to be sure of getting as many outs as possible. The slow-footed Vance had been a major contributor to this situation, but according to the rules the lead runner was entitled to the base, so umpire <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beans_Reardon_e99e.html" title="Beans Reardon">Beans Reardon</a> called Herman and Fewster out. Thus, Babe Herman was said to have "doubled into a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_play.html" title="Double play">double play</a>"; he would later complain that no one remembered that he drove in the winning run on the play. (Hank DeBerry was on third when Vance was on second and Fewster was on first; when Babe got his hit, DeBerry scored.) This led to the following popular joke:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Dodgers have 3 men on base!"</li>
<li>"Oh, yeh? <i>Which base?</i>"</li>
</ul>
<p>On two occasions in 1930 – <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_30.html" title="May 30">May 30</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a> – Herman stopped to watch a home run while running the bases and was passed by the hitter, in each case causing the home run to count only as a single. And on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a> of the following year, he was thrown out trying to <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">steal a base</a> against the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, even though opposing catcher <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabby_Street_c591.html" title="Gabby Street">Gabby Street</a> was the 48-year-old Cardinals manager, appearing in his first game (as an emergency substitute) since 1912. Pitcher Vance dubbed him "the Headless Horseman of <a href="../../../e/b/b/Ebbets_Field_6c4d.html" title="Ebbets Field">Ebbets Field</a>" for his various mistakes.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931_in_baseball.html" title="1931 in baseball">1931</a> Herman slipped to a .313 average, and although he led the NL with 77 <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra_base_hit.html" title="Extra base hit">extra base hits</a> and was third in total bases, and hit for the cycle on both <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>, he was traded to the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> before the 1932 season. He bounced back with a solid year, leading the NL with 19 triples and tying <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Crawford_4987.html" title="Sam Crawford">Sam Crawford</a>'s <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901_in_baseball.html" title="1901 in baseball">1901</a> team record for left-handed hitters of 16 home runs; <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ival_Goodman_ace2.html" title="Ival Goodman">Ival Goodman</a> would hit 17 in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936_in_baseball.html" title="1936 in baseball">1936</a>. Herman went on to play for the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> in 1933-34, batting .304 in the latter season. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933_in_baseball.html" title="1933 in baseball">1933</a> he hit three home runs, and on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a> he hit for the cycle for the third time, a feat only he and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Meusel_85c3.html" title="Bob Meusel">Bob Meusel</a> have accomplished. After a brief stint with the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in 1935, he was traded back to the Reds, staying with them through 1936. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935_in_baseball.html" title="1935 in baseball">1935</a>, he hit the first home run ever in a major league night game. He played briefly for the Tigers in 1937, hitting .300 in 17 games, and then returned to the minor leagues. Nine years later in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945_in_baseball.html" title="1945 in baseball">1945</a>, he was re-signed by Brooklyn at age 42, and played his 37 final big league games with the team. He received a strong ovation from the Ebbets Field crowd in his first turn at bat, and tripped over first base after hitting a single. After retiring, he worked as a scout for several teams until 1964. Herman ended his major league career with a .324 batting average, 1818 hits, 181 home runs, 997 RBI, 882 runs, 399 doubles, 110 triples and 94 stolen bases in 1552 games.</p>
<p>His son was a mathematics teacher at <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_High_School_%28Glendale%29_c64c.html" title="Herbert Hoover High School (Glendale)">Herbert Hoover High School</a>, the cross-town rival of Babe's high school <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale_High_School_%28Glendale%2C_California%29_f9f0.html" title="Glendale High School (Glendale, California)">Glendale High School</a>, from the late 1960s through the early 1980s.</p>

He died in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_California_2c37.html" title="Glendale, California">Glendale, California</a> at age 84 following a bout with <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and a series of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">strokes</a>.
