<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Carey_0a48.html" title="Edit section: Origin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origin</span></h3>
<p>Off screen, in San Diego, Babe was working as a waitress in a restaurant on a ship at the docks. She met and married rich boy J.R Chandler. Her story in the soap opera started with their arrival in Pine Valley. JR reunited with his wealthy family and his step-father Tad Martin, announcing that he had a new girlfriend. That night Babe (yet unknown to everyone in Pine Valley) attended a party and became very drunk and slept with JR's brother Jamie. The next day JR introduced Babe to his family as his new wife. Jamie was shocked to see that the same unnamed women that took his virginity was his sister-in-law. But Jamie vowed to keep their night a secret. However, his father, Adam, didn't like Babe and planned to separate her and J.R.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Carey_0a48.html" title="Edit section: Pregnancy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pregnancy</span></h3>
<p>Weeks later, Babe discovered that she was going to have a baby. Jamie finally admitted to JR that he had slept with Babe, bringing doubt over who was the baby's father. JR confronted Babe, but she claimed that Jamie had come on to her, and JR cut Jamie out of his life. When Babe discovered that she was 9 weeks into her pregnancy, it eliminated the possibility of Jamie being the father.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Carey_0a48.html" title="Edit section: Marital Crisis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marital Crisis</span></h3>
<p>With that situation almost resolved, Babe revealed another secret: her marriage to JR was invalid, because she was still married to <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cramer_36b8.html" title="Paul Cramer">Paul Cramer</a> from the nearby town of <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llanview%2C_Pennsylvania_07ca.html" title="Llanview, Pennsylvania">Llanview</a> (from another soap <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Life_To_Live_1fde.html" title="One Life To Live">One Life To Live</a>). Tad, JR's step-dad, tracked down Babe's mother, <a href="../../../k/r/y/Krystal_Carey_3564.html" title="Krystal Carey">Krystal Carey</a>, in Texas. After hearing Babe was married to an extremely wealthy man and was pregnant, a proud Krystal, who hadn't seen her daughter in years, decided to travel to Pine Valley to make sure Babe's happiness wasn't jeopardized. Babe was happy to see her mom and confided in her that she still had doubts of JR being the baby's father and that she was still legally married to Cramer.</p>
<p>JR demanded a DNA test be conducted, so Babe called up Paul and promised him money if he would make sure the test proved JR was the father and allow the annulment go through. Babe and Krystal got Paul drunk and sent him away. Paul was angry and vowed revenge on Babe. When Tad found out about Babe's marriage to Paul, he wanted to tell JR, but Krystal was able to seduce him and keep him quiet. Although looking forward to the birth of her child, Babe had to face her next obstacle: Adam and his accomplice Mary Smythe were plotting to get Babe out of JR's life as soon as the child was born. JR found out about his father's scheming and cut him out of his life; at the same time he renewed his friendship with his brother Jamie, and asked him to be the baby's godfather.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Carey_0a48.html" title="Edit section: Relationship with Bianca">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with Bianca</span></h3>
<p>Babe struck up a friendship with <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Montgomery_7ec9.html" title="Bianca Montgomery">Bianca Montgomery</a> during Decemember of 2003, They grew to be inseparable and Babe threw a surprise baby shower for her. <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Kane_eb13.html" title="Erica Kane">Erica Kane</a>, Bianca's mother, did not want Bianca to follow through with the pregnancy since the baby had been conceived from a violent rape. She vainly asked Babe to try and convince Bianca to have an abortion. On the stormy night of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. Bianca fled from her home after an argument with Erica. It was a week before Bianca's baby girl was due to be born and a month before Babe's was. To cheer Bianca up, Babe took Bianca to a nice cabin in the woods. There was a flood and the two pregnant girls were stuck in the cabin as their car was washed away. All of Pine Valley went out to search for the girls.</p>
<p>Babe helped Bianca give birth to her baby daughter, Miranda Mona Montgomery. Bianca fell unconscious and Babe left to go get help. She broke into Dr. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hayward_42e6.html" title="David Hayward">David Hayward</a>'s cabin and called Paul at Llanview Hospital for help. The day before (on <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Life_To_Live_1fde.html" title="One Life To Live">One Life To Live</a>) Paul had helped his sister, <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Cramer_bce8.html" title="Kelly Cramer">Kelly</a>, give birth to a baby boy who had died right after birth; Kelly begged her brother to get her a child. Paul helped Babe get back to the cabin, where he delivered her son by the fire place.</p>
<p>Paul seized this opportunity to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby-Switch_Storyline_216b.html" title="Baby-Switch Storyline">give his sister a baby</a>. He drugged Babe, put her in a helicopter, and staged a helicopter crash near a river in the forest. When Babe awoke Paul told her that the helicopter crashed and her baby was dead. She then fell back. When Babe and Bianca's family and friends arrived at the scene, Paul twisted his story around and told them that Bianca's baby had fallen into the river while Babe's child survived. JR's family was elated that Babe's baby was alive, but Bianca's family was destroyed by the news. In <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llanview%2C_Pennsylvania_07ca.html" title="Llanview, Pennsylvania">Llanview</a>, Paul gave Kelly <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Chandler_III_8f71.html" title="Adam Chandler III">Babe's son</a>, telling her that the boy's mother was a poor homeless woman who didn't want a baby.</p>
<p>Later on Babe found out that the baby she thought was her own was really <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda_Montgomery_cb8b.html" title="Miranda Montgomery">Miranda</a>, Bianca's baby who was thought to have died in the storm. Babe was so distraught over the reveal that her son had been the one to die in the storm she decided to keep the baby. When the truth was finally revealed, it caused a severe rift in their friendship that continued with Bianca's departure and recent return to Pine Valley, although Bianca was more distant than hostile toward Babe. However, when Babe was apparently murdered by the Satin Slayer, Bianca was devastated, and showed regret for not forgiving her when she had the chance. But with the recent revelation of Babe being alive and well, Bianca had her chance to do so, finally and truly repairing their damaged friendship.</p>
<p>Many fans believe that Bianca is secretly in love with Babe which is the only reason why Bianca has forgiven Babe for stealing Miranda, Bianca's child. Some fans are hoping Babe and Bianca will finally <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjUlIkiJlOc" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjUlIkiJlOc" rel="nofollow">sleep together</a>.</p>

<p>During the time around May 2005 <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Dillon_c1b2.html" title="Amanda Dillon">Amanda Dillon</a> came to Pine Valley seeking the help of her old friend J.R. Chandler. Hoping that she could stay with him in Pine Valley at the Chandler Mansion she conspired with JR to get revenge on Babe and to take Jaime away from her. Amanda mainpulated Babe and Jaime under the guise of friendship while she was secretly scheming to drive a wedge between the two. When Babe started becoming guilty about holding Jaime back from realizing his dreams as a doctor, Amanda saw her chance to separate the two. She tried to use Josh as a way to keep Babe away from Jaime. However, over the course of time, Babe and Amanda reconciled and formed a much happier relationship.</p>
<p><a name="Babe.27s_affair_with_Josh" id="Babe.27s_affair_with_Josh"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Carey_0a48.html" title="Edit section: Babe's affair with Josh">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Babe's affair with Josh</span></h3>
<p>Babe and Josh's relationship got off to a rocky start during a hot summer night in July 2005. They became fast friends after Josh helped Babe get back Jamie's car from a few drunken, violent frat boys at a roadside bar. They bonded on the beach and shared stories of their past and became close. During this time, Amanda was scheming to steal Jamie away from Babe, and tried to enlist Josh in her plan. Josh resisted Amanda's advances and didn't want to cause trouble.</p>
<p>As time went by, Babe felt increasingly guilty of holding Jamie back from his dream of becoming a doctor. Due to the terms of his Aunt Phoebe's will, Jamie would have to leave Babe (now his fiancee') to acquire his inheritance. According to the terms of the will, Jamie would have to be the one to end the relationship; it had to be his choice to have nothing to do with Babe. Babe began hatching a scheme with Amanda and Josh to get Jamie to break up with her. When Babe asked Josh if he would help her make Jamie think that she was cheating on him, Josh agreed.</p>
<p>After Jamie walked in on the set up, and found the naked Babe and Josh in the Pine Cone, Jamie and Babe lashed out at each other. Jamie knew it was a set up and was too hurt to understand why Babe couldn't respect his choice, while Babe kept trying to make Jamie see that she didn't care about him and wanted him gone and wanted to be free and left alone to be independent. Jamie angrily left the scene, while Amanda smirked at the demise of the couple.</p>
<p>After helping Babe break up with Jamie, Josh and Babe became close friends. On October 31, 2005, Josh told Babe that he couldn't deny it anymore: he was falling for her, and he wanted her to be happy and to enjoy her life and not worry about JR or Jamie anymore. During this talk they shared a kiss and Josh declared an interest in her.</p>
<p>Babe was taken aback by Josh's declaration. Although she was flattered, she told him she simply wasn't ready to be in another relationship. Babe and Josh continued their friendship. Babe several times asked him for help at her new job at Fusion and also used him to make JR jealous on occasion. During Josh's time at Erica's new talk show, "New Beginnings," Babe warned him away from the troublesome Amanda Dillion.</p>
<p>Their friendship reached a new level in May 2006, when Babe confided to Josh that JR had tried to murder her with a rigged construction site at Fusion. Babe was severely distraught over this revelation. Josh tried to calm her down, but she couldn't be calmed and soon ran out. Josh, upset and angry over JR's latest violent attack, threatened Jamie as well as JR and said if they ever hurt Babe he would make them pay. Josh stuck by Babe's side through it all. They even went on a date, where they shared a kiss and a personal talk. But Babe turned down his advances, telling him she still loved her husband despite everything, and that she wanted to make it work with JR. Josh didn't understand and walked away.</p>
<p>Babe and Josh became closer friends over the summer of 2006, and sparks began to fly. Even though still married to JR, Babe started to have feelings for Josh and felt the need to be there for him when Dr. Greg Madden (the man he believed to be his father) went missing. Babe supported Josh, talked him down, and tried to be there for him as a friend.</p>
<p>When JR started to become jealous of her relationship with Josh, Babe assured him that nothing was happening and she and Josh were just friends. Despite JR and Babe's many fights concerning Josh, Babe continued to see Josh and supported him during this rough time.</p>
<p>In July, when it was found that Greg Madden had died due to being buried alive underground for weeks, Babe stuck by Josh and sought to help him through this. This further enraged JR, causing more problems for their marriage. Due to the lack of communication, the murder attempt, their increased fighting, the Greg Madden murder mystery looming over their heads, and the search for Kate (JR's long lost sister), JR and Babe began shutting down on one another. This led Babe to turn Josh, confiding in him even more and spending more time with him.</p>
<p>Josh, unable to take being under the spot light in Pine Valley anymore, decided to leave and go work in a hospital in Sweden. During this time he made amends to Erica for drugging her and to Julia for setting her up to take the fall for his medical mistake. Before leaving, he went for one last night out at Confusion, the new club below the Fusion offices. Unfortunately, JR had become so jealous of Josh and Babe's relationship that on this night he decided to humiliate Josh by playing Greg Madden's last words, which revealed Josh was really the aborted son of Erica Kane and Jeff Martin.</p>
<p>Josh reeled from the revelation and ran off to the private jet that Greg had owned. Babe ran after, to attempt to level his head and try to get him to see reason. Josh was too far gone and she couldn't get through to him. Instead Josh shut down, and started telling jokes and coming on to her. Babe stopped it and finally got him to open up. Josh played along, telling her that he would stay in Pine Valley to hear Erica out. However, Josh sneaked off and started the plane, kidnapping Babe and jetting off to an unknown destination. The plane ran out of fuel and crashed into an island; Josh and Babe's families feared they were dead.</p>
<p>During their time on the island, Babe and Josh became closer than they ever were before. They sat by the fire, talked, kissed, and later snuggled together for warmth. Josh revealed to Babe that he loved her and wanted to be with her. But Babe continued to insist that she wanted to be with JR; if Josh couldn't accept only friendship, they would have to end their relationship. Josh reluctantly agreed. They were rescued by JR, Jaime, and Julia</p>
<p>As their relationship further developed, Babe and Josh became close friends and confidants. Babe helped Josh reach out to his new family, helping him come to terms with his parentage as well as with his grief over Greg . She also gave him a job at Confusion, so he could avoid running into his father Jeff or his grandfather Joe. Troubled by their children's increasing closeness, Krystal and Erica began to pry in Babe and Josh's relationship, and joined in a pact to keep their children apart. Upon learning this, Babe and Josh angrily told their mothers to butt out, then left for a business trip for Fusion. During the trip, Babe and Josh met with an outrageous rock star, Zarf, to try to get Zarf's song to use for a Fusion promotional campaign. After much drinking, Zarf finally agreed. Josh and Babe drank too many jello shooters while trying to convince Zarf to sign. Drunk, they took cold showers as a way to sober up, but it didn't work. Babe and Josh slipped into the shower together and almost shared a kiss. Instead of lingering on it, they moved past it, started talking about their promotional campaign with Zarf, ordered room service, and fell asleep on the couch together.</p>
<p>Babe's relationship with Josh continued to anger and frustrate JR, causing more tension between them. However, Babe refused to end her relationship with Josh, instead telling JR that they were just friends, that Josh was her only friend, and that she still didn't trust JR after his murder attempt. During this discussion, JR left and stormed off.</p>
<p>Babe spent more time with Josh. She helped him grieve for Greg, letting him lock himself in a casket so he could experience what Greg went through. It led to an emotional breakdown, which caused the two to feel closer then ever. As Babe began to realize she was developing deeper feelings for Josh then she had previously admitted, she started to distance herself from him. She asked Jeff to comfort Josh, as a substitute for her absence.</p>
<p>Babe and Josh reconnected on the night that Colby was thought to be dead. Babe was struggling with coping with all that had happened that year. Feeling overwhelmed by JR's murder attempt on her, the Greg Madden murder, her feelings for Josh, and JR pushing her away, she gave in to her passion for Josh and slept with him.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Carey_0a48.html" title="Edit section: Babe's Friendship with Zarf and Zoe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Babe's Friendship with Zarf and Zoe</span></h3>
<p>After their exciting business meeting in August over the <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusion_Cosmetics_3c60.html" title="Fusion Cosmetics">Fusion</a> campaign, <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_%28All_My_Children%29_fe3a.html" title="Zoe (All My Children)">Zarf</a> came to PV searching for Babe after a grueling world tour. He wished to get in contact with her to talk with her and catch up. When Babe arrived she introduced Zarf to Bianca. Zarf fell in love with her at first sight.</p>
<p>As there relationship grew Babe and Zarf became closer and started working on the Confusion campaign and after a strained talk with Bianca, an embarrassing over the top drag performance and an arrest by the Pine Valley Police Department, Zarf came out to Babe and admitted that he was <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> and he was truly "Zoe". A woman who was attracted to other women, a lesbian. Babe accepted her and it was exactly what Zoe needed. After this confession their friendship continued to blossom.</p>
<p>Zoe was accused of killing the Fusion women and was considered the main suspect for the Fusion deaths by a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_killer.html" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a>. Babe didn't believe this and proved Zoe with safety under her roof and fought back against those who tried to harm Zoe and helped her come out to everyone. Unfortunately not everyone was accepting. Kendell, JR, Zach and Ryan berated Zoe by calling her a freak and slurred her with demeaning names. Babe stood by Zoe throughout all and helped her back onto her feet by giving her peace at the Chandler Mansion.</p>
<p>Babe and Zoe continue to be good friends. After Babe's supposed death Zoe mourned for her best friend and after Bianca told Zoe that Babe was still alive Zoe was happy that her best friend was back.</p>

<p>December 2006, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simone_Torres_7321.html" title="Simone Torres">Simone Torres</a> was found dead on the floor of the Fusion office in a white dress with a ribbon and gardenias. Her death was concluded to be of natural causes and it was revealed that her heart stopped beating. A week later <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erin_Lavery_9e41.html" title="Erin Lavery">Erin Lavery</a> was found dead on the roof of the Fusion building with a white ribbon and gardenias attached to her hands. It was then decided by Derek Frye that there was a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_killer.html" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a> on the loose.</p>
<p>During January 2007, the killer attacked again, almost killing Danielle Frye and mistakenly taking <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_Cooney_Martin_2e3f.html" title="Dixie Cooney Martin">Dixie Cooney Martin</a> as his victim in an attempt to kill Babe. The serial killer then targeted Babe as his next victim by tying a white ribbon outside the gate of the Chandler Mansion.</p>
<p>After a brutal breakup with JR, Babe was in the Chandler Enterprises parking garage with her bodyguard. After talking to Zoe, she and her bodyguard went to leave the parking lot and the serial killer attacked. Babe found her bodyguard lying dead on the ground and was quickly attacked by the Satin Slayer, who plunged a needle into her neck and poisoned her with v-tac. The show featured a double funeral for Dixie and Babe, but after the funeral, Babe was shown waking up in what appeared to be a hospital bed.</p>
<p>Joe, Jack, Jeff, Josh, Kendall and Zach knew that Babe was alive. Jack and Jeff made it their mission to make everybody think that Babe was really dead. Babe had suffered a heart attack and briefly slipped into a coma after being poisioned by the Satin Slayer. She was secretly taken to a room at Zach's casino, where Josh took care of her while she recovered from her attack. When she woke up, Josh initially lied and told her she was at the hospital. He did not tell her that her family and the rest of Pine Valley believed she was dead.</p>
