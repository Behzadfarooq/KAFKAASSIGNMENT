<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babington_Plot_b408.html" title="Edit section: Mary's Imprisonment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mary's Imprisonment</span></h2>
<p>In January 1586,Queen of Scots, found herself in the strictest confinement she had experienced in the eighteen years she had been imprisoned by the English as a result of an increasing number of plots surrounding her. She was confined to Chartley Hall in Staffordshire, placed under strict observation, under the control of Sir <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amias_Paulet_eb02.html" title="Amias Paulet">Amyas Paulet</a>. Paulet was a Puritan, and although Mary had been able to win over her previous jailers, Paulet was able to resist her charms and kept her in extremely strict conditions. Having been instructed to watch the comings and goings of servants and visitors to Mary, he stopped all open correspondence.</p>
<p>Because of increasing concern surrounding Queen Elizabeth's safety, Parliament passed an act which provided for the execution of anyone who would benefit from the death of the Queen if a plot against her was discovered. Whilst Mary had escaped formal reprimand as she had not actively participated in a plot, now she could be executed if a plot was initiated that would lead to her acceeding the throne of England.</p>
<p>Although Elizabeth was reluctant to act against Mary, some within the English government feared her status as a figurehead for English Catholics. Sir <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Walsingham_aa9c.html" title="Francis Walsingham">Francis Walsingham</a>, Elizabeth I's <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_%28United_Kingdom%29_533c.html" title="Secretary of State (United Kingdom)">Secretary of State</a> and a strict Protestant, realised that if she could be implicated in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth, then Mary could be executed and the Catholic threat diminished. He infiltrated much of Mary's correspondence network. Taking advantage of Mary's lack of communication, he instituted a system for secret messages to be passed to the Queen.</p>
<p><a name="The_Plot" id="The_Plot"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babington_Plot_b408.html" title="Edit section: The Plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Plot</span></h2>
<p>It is named after the chief conspirator <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Babington_3c47.html" title="Anthony Babington">Anthony Babington</a> (1561–1586), a young <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> nobleman from <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derbyshire.html" title="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ballard_bc8f.html" title="John Ballard">John Ballard</a>, a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Jesus_37d2.html" title="Society of Jesus">Jesuit</a> priest and Catholic agent, persuaded Babington to become involved in a plot to overthrow and/or murder Queen <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, replacing her on the throne with the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Queen of Scotland.</p>
<p>Walsingham ensured that a line of communication was opened up between him and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_agent.html" title="Double agent">double agent</a> Gilbert Gifford, who had been trained as a Catholic priest, to act as an intermediary between him and the English Queen.</p>
<p>In July 1586, Gifford delivered his first message from Mary to Anthony Babington. The letter from the imprisoned queen said that there were reported supporters of her in Paris. The reply to Mary from Babington said that Babington had a hundred followers to assist in delivering Mary from Elizabeth, and the conspiracy had six personal friends of Babington who were carrying out Mary's release. In the message, Babington, a Catholic, betrayed his feelings about Elizabeth and described her as an usurper, claiming that he was free from obedience to Elizabeth as a result of her excommunication. Elizabeth had been excommunicated by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_V_cc8c.html" title="Pope Pius V">Pope Pius V</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/7/1570.html" title="1570">1570</a>, and many Catholics in England believed they were released from duty to the excommunicated queen of England as a result.</p>
<p>The messages between Mary and Babington were encoded using symbols for some words and phrases and letter substitutions (23 symbols for letter substitutions and 36 characters for words and phrases). The messages were smuggled in and out through beer barrel stoppers where a nearby brewer delivered and picked up the barrels. Queen Mary's servants would retrieve the messages from the beer barrels and place messages back into the hollow of the beer barrel stopper.</p>
<p>Walsingham already had the conspiracy identified and was attempting to find out the identities of all six conspirators who formed the inner circle of the plot. Gilbert Gifford, who delivered the messages to and from Queen Mary, was a double agent, actually working for Walsingham since 1585. Each message between Mary and Babington was first read by Walsingham, copied by Walsingham's spy school, and sent to its destination intact. Walsingham's spy school decoded each message by trial and error by starting with letter substitutions and using the frequency of common characters (see <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_analysis.html" title="Frequency analysis">frequency analysis</a>) until a readable text was found, and then the rest was guessed at by the message context from what was decoded until the entire cipher was understood. After the cipher was found the messages were read the same day they were copied. Each message was returned in good enough condition that it was not evident that it had been read and copied.</p>
<p>The correspondence between Mary and Babington was about the conspiracy. Without the endorsement of Queen Mary the plot would fail, since the supporters would have no future crown to support. In July 1586, Babington proposed to Mary that Elizabeth be assassinated, and he referred to an invasion by Spain — King <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Spain_23db.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II</a> had promised to send a military expedition to England when Queen Elizabeth was no longer in power, and had a plan for Mary's release from her imprisonment. The July 1586 letter also described plots to kill Walsingham and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cecil%2C_1st_Baron_Burghley_28f6.html" title="William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley">Lord Burghley</a>, Elizabeth's chief minister. Sir Francis Walsingham thus had the evidence he needed, but he needed the identities of the six conspirators.</p>
<p>In Mary's last letter to Babington, in which Mary acknowledged Babington's enterprise, Walsingham had Thomas Phelippes, a cipher and language expert in his employ, forge a postscript asking for the identity of the six conspirators. Babington received the forged postscript and message, but he never replied with the names of the conspirators, as he was arrested while seeking a passport in order to see King Philip of Spain. The identities of the six conspirators were nevertheless discovered, and they were taken prisoner by <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/5/8/1586.html" title="1586">1586</a>.</p>
<p><br />
This was one of the four plots we know of that are most important. The plots are&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridolfi_Plot_aa4f.html" title="Ridolfi Plot">Ridolfi Plot</a>.</li>
<li>The Throckmorton Plot.</li>
<li>The Parry Plot.</li>
<li>The Babington Plot.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babington_Plot_b408.html" title="Edit section: Arrests and Executions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arrests and Executions</span></h2>
<p>The conspirators were sentenced to death for <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> and conspiracy against the crown, and were sentenced to be <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanging%2C_drawing_and_quartering.html" title="Hanging, drawing and quartering">hanged, drawn, and quartered</a>. This first group included Babington, Ballard, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chidiock_Tichborne_3630.html" title="Chidiock Tichborne">Chidiock Tichborne</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Salisbury_7509.html" title="Thomas Salisbury">Thomas Salisbury</a>, Robert Barnewell, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Savage_b1e3.html" title="John Savage">John Savage</a> and Henry Donn. A further seven men, Edward Habington, Charles Tilney, Edward Jones, John Charnock, John Travers, Jerome Bellamy, and Robert Gage, were tried and convicted shortly afterwards. Ballard and Babington were executed on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a> along with the other men who had been tried with them. Such was the horror of their execution that the queen ordered the second group to be allowed to hang until dead before being disembowelled.</p>
<p>Queen Mary herself went to trial at <a href="../../../f/o/t/Fotheringhay.html" title="Fotheringhay">Fotheringhay</a> Castle in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northamptonshire.html" title="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a> and denied her part in the plot, but her correspondence was the evidence; therefore, Mary was sentenced to death. Elizabeth signed her cousin's death warrant, and on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">February 8</a> 1587, in front of 300 witnesses, Mary, Queen of Scots, was executed. Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's spymaster, had saved England from invasion, and saved Queen Elizabeth I from assassination. This may have ended the Babington Plot, but it set a dangerous precedent for the future. For years, Elizabeth had dragged her feet about ending Mary's life, much to the chagrin of her advisors; they were so busy worrying about her life that they could not see things logically as she did. Elizabeth's stubbornness to execute her cousin was well founded; she realized that once a sovereign became answerable for the common man's crimes, the belief that a king's or queen's actions were accountable only to God would be undercut and ultimately challenge the structure upon which her authority was founded.</p>
<p>The story of the Babington Plot is dramatised in the novel <i>Conies in the Hay</i> by <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Lane_%28author%29_d404.html" title="Jane Lane (author)">Jane Lane</a>. (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7551-0835-3</a>). One episode of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_R_2dd6.html" title="Elizabeth R">Elizabeth R</a> is devoted to the Babington Plot.</p>
