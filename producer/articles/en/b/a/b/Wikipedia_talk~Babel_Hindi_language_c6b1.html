<dd>Dear Shresh,</dd>
<dd>My Hindi is awful, I know, but I didn't know it was so bad that it was actually 'vulgar!&#160;:-) Oh boy. I learned what Hindi I know from a guy from New Delhi and also from some friends in Varanasi. I would consider it to be at about the level of a three year old, perhaps. Not much to brag about. I read the article about Lalu, and based on that, I would say I should probably take your comment about my Hindi as a compliment??&#160;;-)</dd>
<dd>At any rate, rather than simply reverting the tag to all question marks, why not simply fix it. Please take a look at the project page of this <a href="../../../h/i/n/Wikipedia%7EHindi_language_user_tag_project_709b.html" title="Wikipedia:Hindi language user tag project">Wikipedia:Hindi_language_user_tag_project</a> that I have set up to assist with getting these tags to be functional.</dd>
<dd>By the way, I feel that since it is my uneducated guess that probably 99.9% of the native Hindi speakers who might visit Wiki might be just as comfortable seeing the Hindi language tags written in the Roman alphabet as in the Devanagari script, my suggestion is that just to keep things simple, and more legible to non-Hindi speakers, perhaps we should keep these Wiki-tags written in the Roman alphabet. Also, by using the Roman alphabet, it might have three other advantages:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>It might encourage more interest in the Hindi language by others who have no ability to read Devanagari.</li>
<li>It might assist 'beginners' in Hindi like myself who may have little or no ability to read Devanagari.</li>
<li>It could save us all from having to figure out how to get the Devanagari script to work in Wiki, which in my humble opinion, might not be worth all of that trouble, just for a few language tags.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On another subject.... you are apparently going to school in Delhi. If so, then you must be a native Hindi speaker (hi), not a beginner (hi-1). No?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will look forward to hearing more about your suggestions and comments about this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks,</dd>

<dd>PS: Shresh, If you might be interested, I would be happy to work together with you on this project in any way I might be able to be of help. Obviously you know Hindi far far better than I, but I may know a little Wiki coding that you may not know, at least I could review your coding and possibly make suggestions if needed, if you wanted. Namaste, humari dhost.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, my name is Shreshth. I'm a guy, so no 'Humari'. And secondly, if you want to make the tag more 'international', then at least write some proper Hinglish (Hindi + English). And about the (hi) or (hi-1), I don't like Hindi that much. I left it when I had a choice between it and French.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would be glad to be of any help to you and would graciously accept any help that you choose to povide. Also, I assure you, Lalu's Hindi is in no way good. Anyways, those who don't know Hindi, wouldn't be interested in it, no matter how it's written. --May the Force be with you! <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShreshth91_b54e.html" title="User:Shreshth91">Shreshth91</a><small><a href="../../../s/h/r/User_talk%7EShreshth91_b218.html" title="User talk:Shreshth91"><font color="green">($ |-| r 3 $ |-| t |-|)</font></a></small> 17:15, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Shreesth,</p>
<p>Thanks for putting up with my abominable Hindi. It has been almost 20 years since I used it to any extent. It would appear that your Hindi is probably 'less abominable' than mine, which in my humble opinion, is better than nothing, and is certainly better than what the tags look like now. So, here is a list of things that need translation from english into 'Hinglish', I suppose. If you translate, I'll be happy to set the tags.</p>
<ol>
<li>hi-1: This user is able to contribute with a <b>basic</b> level of Hindi.</li>
<li>hi-2: This user is able to contribute with an <b>intermediate</b> level of Hindi.</li>
<li>hi-3: This user is able to contribute with an <b>advanced</b> level of Hindi.</li>
<li>hi-4: This user speaks Hindi at a <b>near-native</b> level.</li>
<li>hi: This user is a <b>native</b> speaker of Hindi.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any chance you might be able to take a crack at it?</p>
<p>Namaste <i>Mera</i> Dhost?,</p>

<p>On Shreesth's talk page you wrote:</p>
<p>Delhiwala asking a Bombaywalla on correct Hindi?! I had the impression that Delhi people speak <i>shuddh</i> Hindi. We speak a really corrupted version -- the bollywood style, not the hi-funda Shushma Swaraj style. I'm not sure what to write for the missing hi-4 tag, though I corrected a minor error in the rest.</p>
<p>(<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp sent me this</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Nichalp,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I saw that user:Shreesth has recommended you for your most pure knowledge of the most refined <i>Bollywood Hindi</i>. Whatever your Hindi might be, it would certainly be better than what we have now on the Hindi language tags at: <a href="../../../h/i/n/Wikipedia%7EHindi_language_user_tag_project_709b.html" title="Wikipedia:Hindi language user tag project">Wikipedia:Hindi_language_user_tag_project</a>, and any help you might be able to provide, even in Bollywoodwala Hindi, would be a vast improvement. If you might be able to give your best shot at translating the phrases as shown above in comment subject #2, this would be most helpful, and would be very very much appreciated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the missing hi-4 tag, if you could just do the translation, I could fix the rest of the tag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you might be able to either post your translations on this discussion page, or make the necessary tag changes yourself, either way that would be most helpful for the Wiki language tag project.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You flatter me.&#160;:) . I don't see what's wrong with hi,hi-1,hi-2 and hi-3. There was a minor spacing issue, but I sorted that out. The text for the hi-4 should go like this: "इस सभ्य की हिन्दी मातृभाषा जैसे कक्षा का प्रदान कर सकते हैं। "</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not 100% sure, it doesn't quite sound right to me. I suggest you verify with those guys who have tagged their user page with the hi tag. =Nichalp «Talk»= 18:17, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Nichalp,</dd>
<dd>From my computer here in the US, it would appear that two things might be going on with your fix's:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>All I am reading here are question marks. Nothing more, on <i>any</i> of the tags.</li>
<li>My guess is that you may have inserted Devanagari script characters, that somewhere between Bombay and the US are getting translated into question marks. The translation into question marks appears to be made sometimes in Wiki servers themselves, and sometimes in my own computer. If you were interested as to why I say this, I could give details.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I suggested above on this discussion page, perhaps it might be better, so that all users everywhere will be seeing the same thing, if we stuck with simple Hinglish/ Hindi: that is, Hindi written out in the Roman alphabet.</dd>

<p>Your browser/comp is at fault; not the internet or WP servers. You'd need to have a unicode compatible Hindi font first. Then set up your browser to autodetect the encoding. Lastly ensure that you're seeing the correct rendering. (Read: <a href="../../../e/n/a/Wikipedia%7EEnabling_complex_text_support_for_Indic_scripts_cf38.html" title="Wikipedia:Enabling complex text support for Indic scripts">Wikipedia:Enabling complex text support for Indic scripts</a>). User:Nichalp/sg 18:56, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, thanks Nichalp. I just spent the last hour or so trying to get a unicode Devanagari script to work on my PC and gave up. That's OK. At least now I know, why all question marks on my computer. Still, my educated guess is that probably 99% of all non-Indians read all&#160;?'s as well, as none of them have any real reason to take all of the trouble needed to make their computers Devanagari compatible. If you ever wanted others like myself to read anything but question marks there, I'd be happy to help. Also, if you might be curious as to whether or not my theory about what percentage of Wiki users are seeing all question marks is correct, we could put in a 'request for comment' on the Wiki-talk/ Request-for-comment page, and either prove or disprove my theory by getting other Wiki users to comment on what they see in these language tags. Thanks again.</dd>

<dd>Well, the issue is with the browser. WinXP has most of the fonts needed to view Indic text. I believe Internet explorer also supports rendering of unicoded text correctly. The same can be achieved in Linux/Firefox combination. Most of the browsers I have seen in my university computers show them correctly. Of course, win98 or ME does not have unicode support, but now I guess many of the users use WinXP. So, I think very few non-Indians should have problem viewing unicoded text in the Windows platform.

<p>As a result of the recent findings and collaborations, I have gone ahead and corrected the format of the hi-4 tag, I have upgraded all category headers to show the recent improvements to the tag texts, and I have also taken the liberty of inserting English subtexts into each of the tags. I apologize for having the character conversion problems at my end, however it would look as though this entire process has been for the better for all tags.</p>
<p>The hi-4 tag still needs to have the correct Devanagari characters added, from my end I cannot yet do this, (but am hoping to upgrade my computer soon, now that I know this). I will message to Nichalp to request for this, now that the structural format for tag hi-4 is fixed. Any comments, questions or suggestions about any of the other changes (hopefully these changes are upgrades) would also be very much appreciated here.</p>
<p>Thanks to each and all for your kindly assistance here.</p>

<p>I would really like to help. Now, I'm a gora too and have read this all. My humble suggestions are: to keep it in Devanagari. Only an extended Roman font can represent all the sounds, and this provides the same viewing problems (btw Mac OSX Tiger + Safari browser बढ़िया है!) for people without unicode compatability. Everybody needs to figure it out sooner later, its the future. The Indian, Pakistani and state of Tamil Nadu's governments are all members<a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/memblogo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/memblogo.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. My second observation is that even at first glance it looked too "purified," like the artificial attempts of nationalist groups. I'm sure this wasn't conscious, but things are too "Sanskritized" IMHO. I'm just wondering what resources you use? My level of Hindi is probably best seen on the page I largely created and need more help with <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Hindi-Urdu_phrasebook" class="extiw" title="wikitravel:Hindi-Urdu_phrasebook">here</a>. In addition, I'll ask my Hindi teacher what she thinks. She would know if it sounds natural or not. Maybe it does work. But an example of what I'm talking about is सभ्य (or <i>sabhya</i> if you see&#160;???). Especially when it comes to the internet. I think यूसर (<i>yūsar</i>) would work just as well, though I'm sure there are other ways to express it without using Hinglish. Leave me a message if I can help. फिर मिलेंगे! <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhirad_33fd.html" title="User:Khirad">Khirad</a> 13:33, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
