<p>The strip is mainly about raising babies and children. Children in the strip are more often than not unaware of their parents' difficulties (but also fear of their punishments), and parents often meet a <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilemma.html" title="Dilemma">dilemma</a>, being exhausted and frustrated of the children's incooperation, as well as ultimate love towards them.</p>

<p>The strip mainly consists of three families:</p>
<p><a name="Main_Family_.28MacPhersons.29" id="Main_Family_.28MacPhersons.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Blues_8e85.html" title="Edit section: Main Family (MacPhersons)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Main Family (MacPhersons)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Wanda Wizowski-MacPherson</b>: The mother. Though she originally had a job, she was forced to stay at home to look after her children. She is easily frustrated (due to the job of being a mother), and jealous of any mothers who seem to do better than she does. Wanda was born <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>. She stands 5' 5" tall. She has black hair and brown eyes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Darryl MacPherson</b>: The father. A manager, noticeable with his extremely large nose. He is sometimes unaware of his wife's exhausted state. In various strips, Zoe, Wren and Hammie are there to meet him right when he gets home from work. He takes this as nice, but then realizes they're in trouble. He stands 5' 9" tall. (6' 0 when he measures with his nose up.)

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Zoe Jennifer MacPherson</b>: The eldest daughter ("born" <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">January 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> – her birth starts the strip). She is a very fussy girl and likes to tease and annoy Hammie. She was the only child to appear on the Baby Blues television show. She and Hammie tend to fuss the most over Wanda's dinner, and would prefer macaroni and cheese.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hamish MacPherson</b>: The son, usually called <b>Ham</b> or <b>Hammie</b> ("born" <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_29.html" title="April 29">April 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>). He has great fondness and uninhibited enthusiasm for <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">trucks</a>, and can tell their model on sight, as proven in several strips. Likes to tell his mom when his big sister <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tease.html" title="Tease">teases</a> or <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bullies</a> him, but generally he gets mad less often than Zoe. He also likes driving Zoe mad or watching Zoe get into trouble (without doing anything himself). He was named after his great-great-grandfather, who was called "Ham" Going to his first sleepover he misses Wanda very much, but not as much as she appears to miss him.<a href="http://www.babyblues.com/Testing/index.php?formname=getstrip&amp;GoToDay=04/05/03" class="external text" title="http://www.babyblues.com/Testing/index.php?formname=getstrip&amp;GoToDay=04/05/03" rel="nofollow">See Strip</a></li>

Still an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant.html" title="Infant">infant</a> at the time of this writing. She does not seem to be as much of a nuisance as her elder siblings. Wren is a very curious baby. She often is shown climbing on top of things or grabbing at things. She loves to stick things in her mouth. She has shown an annoyance several times to her parents by holding her legs completely stiff so they couldn't change her diaper.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Bunny</b>: The mother and the main character of this family. She is the target of any possible <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jealousy.html" title="Jealousy">jealousy</a> from Wanda, because Bunny outrages her by being perfect in many aspects (such as body, life-style, etc.) Nearly all main adult characters don't like her and have, on occasion, tricked her. Bunny does seem oblivious to how she irritates Wanda, or anyone else. She is also oblivious, at times, to the convenience or needs of others in contrast to her own. She still has moments of near-human quality, especially concerning motherhood, despite her fairly obtuse personality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Butch</b>: Bunny's husband. Generally unaware of his wife's behavior towards the neighbors. Tends to spoil Bunny, a point which Bunny herself enjoys discussing in detail with her neighbors. He is generally seen in the background with Darryl if the two families are together.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bogart</b>: Butch and Bunny's eldest son. He's the greatest victim of Zoe's <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tease.html" title="Tease">teasing</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bullying</a> (because he doesn't cope with <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tease.html" title="Tease">teasing</a> as well as <i>Hammie</i>), she calls him a "crybaby". Named after movie star <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humphrey_Bogart_fdac.html" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>, since he was conceived while his parents were watching "The African Queen." It is evident, based on some dialogs, that Bogart is not as fond of his extra curricular life as Bunny might think he is. In the TV series, he's called Haggot.</li>
</ul>

Before they were named, they were called "<a href="../../../p/u/c/Puce.html" title="Puce">Puce</a>" and "<a href="../../../t/e/a/Teal.html" title="Teal">Teal</a>" based on the colors of their wrist bands.</li>

<li><b>Yolanda</b>: is the mother of this family and a long-time supporter of Wanda, usually quiet when Wanda quarrels with Bunny.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mike</b>: Yolanda's husband, as much of a guy as Darryl. Tends to support Darryl's point of view, though not as subtly as one might think. He is also friends with Butch, so the three stick together when the families have gatherings.</li>

<p>Unlike other strips, children in Baby Blues' do grow as time passes, though slower than <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real-time_%28media%29.html" title="Real-time (media)">real time</a>.</p>
<p>The authors claimed that the time ratio is 3 to 1 <a href="http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/zforum/03/r_style_cartoon041803.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/zforum/03/r_style_cartoon041803.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (that is, three days in real time equals one day in the strip), but the fact is only true when a MacPherson's kid is born and hasn't celebrated the first birthday. As the strip goes on, the ratio becomes about 2 to 1. Characters do <i>not</i> celebrate all their birthdays even in terms of comic time.</p>

<p>In 2000, "Baby Blues" was adapted into an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_cartoon.html" title="Animated cartoon">animated cartoon</a> series which aired on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_WB_Television_Network_e9d5.html" title="The WB Television Network">The WB Television Network</a> for a few weeks in the summer, from <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. The animated version featured Darryl and Wanda raising the infant Zoe as their first child, as distinct from the comic strip's storyline of the time which showed Zoe as the older sister to Hammie. <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_O%27Malley_6839.html" title="Mike O'Malley">Mike O'Malley</a> supplied the voice of Darryl while <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Sweeney_6baf.html" title="Julia Sweeney">Julia Sweeney</a> played Wanda.</p>
<p>The <i>Baby Blues</i> television series differed from the comic strip by focusing on Darryl and Wanda's relationship with the Bittermans, a neighbor family with three children (Rodney, Megan, and Shelby); Kenny, Darryl's co-worker; and Bizzy, the babysitter for Zoe. Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott had little creative control over the animated version. <a href="http://www.enquirer.com/columns/kiese/2000/07/27/jki_kiesewetter_network.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.enquirer.com/columns/kiese/2000/07/27/jki_kiesewetter_network.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>The WB typically aired two episodes each week, thus enabling eight different episodes to be shown in the five-week run, but abandoned plans to air additional episodes which had been completed. Previously unaired episodes were later shown by the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_Network_8384.html" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a> in its <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_Swim_e7c7.html" title="Adult Swim">Adult Swim</a> block.</p>
<p>The Theme Song was "It's All Been Done" by the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barenaked_Ladies_3f0b.html" title="Barenaked Ladies">Barenaked Ladies</a>.</p>
