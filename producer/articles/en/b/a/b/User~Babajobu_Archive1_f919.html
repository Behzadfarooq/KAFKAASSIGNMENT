<dd>"Haterade"? That's an overused (street) term I do not use. (I don't know anyone who does.) And, no. I don't just go off on people, unless I'm provoked -- and sometimes not even then.&#160;:p</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know that hush harbors, except in the context of religious practice (and not necessarily <i>Christian</i> religious practice, as your article states), merit a separate article. As a separate phenomenon -- often, the crudest of clearings in a wooded area -- hush harbors can be most effectively treated in an article treating African-American syncretic religious practice -- which, I think, merits fuller treatment in <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_culture_ce45.html" title="African American culture">African American culture</a>; or, as has been suggested earlier, in a separate article on the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_church_4951.html" title="African American church">African American church</a>. Then "hush harbor" could simply redirect to those pieces. However, praisehouses/meetinghouses have a very particular history, and I think they might deserve separate treatment. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:52, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the street can be a pretty fertile place, and haterade is a great term. Thanks for the feedback on hush harbor. Your comments confirm for me that I'm really not up to the job of expanding it or placing it in a more appropriate context. I just don't know enough. However, I think it's very notable, very interesting, an important part of American cultural history, and very much merits some form of treatment in Wikipedia, perhaps--as you suggest--as part of an article on African-American religious practice. For now, I'll just leave it there hope it attracts some work for contributors more knowledgeable in this area.

<li>What is up with the "please sign your real name" request on the HBCU page??? What's the logic? Plenty of us would rather take a hot poker up the arse than start throwing our real names around cyberspace. You can be sure that plenty of people at HBCUs feel the same way. For the good of this very worthwhile project, I think the bizarro request for real names should be dropped.

<ul>
<li>It's not a bizarro request, participants will be seeking out school officals and thus will be in a professional enviroment where anonymity would not be will recieved. The page exist so that the officials and subequntently the students we want them to recruit have a page to refer to that explains the projects goals and validates that the representative they met with is involved with the project, its sort of a portal. Ultimatley no one recruited is obligated to join the outreach, and therefore they do not have to remain anonymous. However, if you are interesred in participating in the project but not being a representative, I suppose the representatives and the notice in question could be moved to their own section within the participants list. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 04:20, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Baba, I agree -- though that's not what's keeping me from signing up. JCarriker, well, then, what's the "e-mail this user" function good for? Why not simply use that to maintain editor anonymity? <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:13, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>And who the hell made you the thought police? lol Further, my response is no more over the top (and certainly more accurate) than your "<i>everytime</i> [sic] someone says something with which you disagree." Further, what I say to someone else on my talk page (or theirs) is none of your business. Thank <i>you</i> so much. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 8 July 2005 08:53 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you missed my point. The italicizing of "everytime" was about your hyperbolic mischaracterization (both in frequency of ocurrence and nature) of my responses on this web site. The "sic" was a reflexive, noncritical one (being a writer/editor) which I chose not to inhibit in light of the circumstances. You're flat-out wrong in this regard. Additionally, because your experience is not mine, you cannot school me on when and when not to make "racialist" remarks. Again, you are neither the thought nor the etiquette police, so stop frontin' like one -- at least on my talk page. Peace. (You know I love you, darlin'.&#160;:) Stop buggin'.) deeceevoice 8 July 2005 09:24 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for dropping by to register your support for keeping the article. Frankly, I never thought the VfD had a snowball's chance in hell. Just some arrogant "contributor" who knew nothing of the subject matter who objected to his inept edits being reverted. Petty. The article is far from perfect, but it'll get better w/time.

<p>In that case this page, which you seem to have taken under your wing, fails to show it. The recent edits are an improvement BTW, but what I want to see is a series of stubs listing the major episodes. (If you know the material then there should be no problem with your naming them. Of course if you need some help I can give it to you, at least in terms of knowing what to look for and research.)</p>
<p>Be advised that this series is corrupt by being sundered from the existing <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution.html" title="Religious persecution">Religious persecution</a> article and the category <a href="../../../r/e/l/Category%7EReligious_persecution_68bc.html" title="Category:Religious persecution">Category:Religious persecution</a>.</p>
<p>I have come to agree with others the Irishpuknktom created the series as a cover for this article being an anti-semetic rant. That does not mean that an article on this subject is inately bad or irredeamable. However, the series is very much off on the wrong foot, and in any case needs to be integrated into what already exists. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 14:51, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My impression is that Irishpunktom used the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Persecution_by_Muslims_131f.html" title="Religious Persecution by Muslims">Religious Persecution by Muslims</a> article as a starting point for the series, but I could be wrong.

<dd>The Russian area you asked about is called the Jewish Autonomous Region. It was meant to be an area set aside for Jewish settlement. Apparently Stalin's purges put an end to it as such a sanctuary and I am unsure of its current status, other than that the region still technically exists. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:05, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One more thing: I think that these edits will be too little, too late to save it from being Vfd-ed. My advice is (assuming that it is deleted) to fall back, research what is on Wikipedia and well as what this article should cover, and then try again with a much better article.</dd>
<dd>This theme can escape deletion, but you need to show at the outset that the concerns about being inherently POV (other than the overall theme) is not necessarily a problem. Also realize that this will always come up for VfD at first: There are some people who will always object to a "the Jews did this wrong" POV. However, a knowledgable and well-written article will survive VfD. The trouble is that you have to create that article first instead of struggling to pull it off now.</dd>

<p>Hello. I've noticed that you are quite pressured with the ongoing VfD, and that you believe that the delete votes mirror ethnocentrism and related paranoia. However, insults (e.g., "<i>panicky ethnocentrists</i>"; "<i>Get over your paranoia!</i>") are problematic at Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>; <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>; <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I've noticed that a couple others have been violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, as well, and you'd best inform them of that (if you plan to respond to them). (P.S. I've responded to your (partial) rebuttal of my comment on the VfD page). Cheers, <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">talk</a></sup> 00:44, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed. Calling someone paranoid and ethnocentric is a breach of Wikipedia policy. It's not productive; it provides identification of your problems with other editors, but it doesn't address those issues. Perhaps you now feel that continuing to address such issues wouldn't accomplish anything. If so, you're right about steering clear of potentially hot issues. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">talk</a></sup> 01:08, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's emphatically <i>not</i> acceptable to be insulted, and it's equally unacceptable to defend yourself with insulting retorts. 'Round here, if ya wanna get involved ya gotta bear the heat (or respond by logically refuting insults with <i>substantial</i> responses). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">talk</a></sup> 01:19, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I am going to second that. All that you are doing by antagonizing others is to put more nails into the coffin the article.</p>
<p>I repeat: <b>If you hit a bee hive, you are going to get stung.</b> There is <b>no way</b> that any article that you write on persecution by us Jews is not going to go through the VfD process. <b>However</b>, a well written and well defended article will get past it. c You need to realize that people like Jayjg are personally offended by the implication that Jews are less than perfect and see that automatically as an anti-semetic attack. You also need to realize that they are irrelevant because of it. They will scream <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> until they are blue in the face, and so be it.</p>
<p>So you really want to kick those people in the teeth? Then let's see you produce an article on the topic that I (or at least others) can support. Let's see it cover the Hasmonean dynasty and it's excesses. Let's see it at least mention the JDL (if you know what that is). Let's not worry about European incidents unless you have specific examples. (After all, when you are a Jewish kingdom surrounded by Christian states, you don't want to give your neighbors an added excuse to invade you. So I doubt that any persecution went on places like that.) You claim to be knowledgable, but I suspect that you don't yet know what you do not know.</p>
<p>My interest in Wikipedia is science, not religion. So I lack the knowledge, resources, and interest to help with this project. I am here to defend the subject of persecution by Jews against attacks that it is inherently anti-Semitic. That is all. However, there is some relevance here. In science, someone every so often comes up with what they think is a good idea, and has it beaten down. Often that person just gets and stays angry, blaming everyone except themselves and the inadequacy of their research for the failure of their idea. These people end up ranting and raging and never get anywhere because they refuse to acknowledge and correct their mistakes.</p>
<p>If all that you can be is angry, you will never produce an article that can get past a VfD challenge. You are being offered a lot of valuable feedback in the VfD process. That is what you should be paying attention to, and not people like Jayjg whom you are right in saying will never fail to find something wrong with an article on that topic. Remeber that even with your improvements and my approval of the project, my VfD vote for this article remains <b>strong delete</b>. I assure you that I am quite capable of issuing a <b>stong keep</b> also, but you have a lot of work to do to create an article that can earn that.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that you stop listening to the inevitable insults and get to work on improving the article. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 02:09, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a sensitive and inflamatory topic, such that a badly written article cannot in good conscience be left in place.</p>

Later, when you have a better product, you can try to return it to the article space. I repeat that as I found it, the article was an anti-semetic rant. It is better now, but I retain doubts that it will stay that way because of the open nature of Wikipedia and the apparent lack of a defending community. However, a better article may well attract defenders. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 02:48, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Hasmonean kings conquored a neighboring kingdom, Ideomea, and forcedits inhabitants to convert to Judaism. That is probably the worst case of religous persecution in our history. Zionism also should be covered, if not because it is a source of said persecution then because it has been called that. (This is not to say the there should be broad coverage of it, but instead enough to put it in context and link to the relevant Wikipedia articles productively.)</p>
<p>You say that you are "science-y". Then look on this as a research project, and not a chance to do a mind dump. (Research for Wikipedia articles is actually quite encouraged. It is OK for the research to be orginal within Wikipedia, but not for the thesis being covered to lack external description and coverage.) --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 02:48, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I won't make any guarentees or promises that this will be the case. What I can say is that I have learned the a 2/3 majority is needed to establish a consensus over whether a page should be deleted or not. This VfD is at that threshhold. So I cannot say that the page will stay, but neither can I say that it will go. In the end, it will be up to the administrators to decide the issue. (The lack of an obvious consensus will help, but in the end this will be a judgement call on their part.)</p>
<p>If the page stays (or even if it does not at this time), work is still needed. What you need to do is to look over the current Wikipedia record on persecution, and bind your articles to it as tightly as you can. You also need to explicitly cite sources in a references section and get the Idemean conquest in there. Also, I will help to guard the page again, since this VfD effort may have created a group of editors ready and willing to update and guard it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the template/navigation bar I worked on is probably going to be deleted. JFW put it up for deletion (I would think out of spite), and the request is just sailing through. However, I now see why: Pages like that attact people who want to add all sorts of odd links to it without adding the articles. A scientologist is trying to add the relevant entries. Baha'i certainly cannot be far behind. Also, there has been so much internal conflict between Chistian groups that seperate pages can be written for each denomination it seems. Given that, the use of a category scheme is better. That way, the relevant article has exist to have anything added to the category. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:26, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good job getting the source out of the article space. Now realize that you can create subpages in the user space. just click on <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_Religious_persecution_by_Jews_2f97.html" title="User:Babajobu/Religious persecution by Jews">User:Babajobu/Religious persecution by Jews</a> and you can start a subpage for drafting the revised article. Just move the article text there. (It is needed if you are drafting multiple articles anyway.)</p>
<p>I think that you are right that the name needs to be changed. Overall you have walked into a claptrap set up by Irishpunktom to justify an anti-semitic rant. That the write-up is getting more infomred and less accusatory is not at all to his liking. Hence his view that the series as a whole either stays or goes.</p>
<p>In any case, there is a lot to learn both about this subject and about how to present it. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 18:00, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some anti-Muslim activists have gone on a Wikipedia compaign to erase all use of the word "prophet" in connection with Muhammad.</p>
<p>It is true that when some Muslims contribute to Wikipedia, they write things like "the Prophet Muhammad, PBUH" and suchlike. That can be NPOVed as "the prophet Muhammad". It is not POV to describe someone as a prophet. That's a religious role, like shaman or priest. Use of the word does not imply that one recognizes Muhammad as a TRUE prophet, or THE prophet. Prophet is routinely used to describe the Hebrew prophets, frex, and no one believes that this implies conversion to Judaism or Christianity. Please stop the prophet-removal campaign. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:20, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hey. I was the person who originally nominated this article for featured status, but, due to Hurricane Katrina, I've been without internet since August 25th and that means no wiki. I like your edits, they make the article flow a lot better! I wouldn't have any objection to you continuing to better the article. As Pentawing said, I want to eventually get it featured on the front page (in a way, it already is, since it's an April 20th featured anniversary). If you see anything that affects a NPOV without being backed up by a source, or that's irrelevant to the article, change it. I want it to be as spick and span as possible before the vultures over a the front page nominations area get to it.

<dd>Actually, though, that's not the only reason I deleted it. I also deleted it because it is not an appropriate article for the main namespace, but perhaps rather for Meta-Wiki or the Wikipedia namespace. Also, the article wasn't serious: it contained assertions about the subjects being "superior beings", and what not. So there were lots of reasons what it was suitable for blanking and hard deletion. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 16:19, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User Emiellaendiay (I think I've spelled that right) is slowly and quietly changing "Islamic prophet Muhammad" to "Muhammad, prophet of Islam". I left a message on her page saying that I felt that the second phrase seemed just too pious and POV and asking her not to continue the campaign. I don't know if you're still on your "secular language" roll, but this is something up your alley. I'm not motivated to change all her edits so far back -- we can tolerate a little variation, IMHO. However, I'm feeling that a steady diet of "Muhammad, prophet of Islam" would be cloying.</p>

<p>My concern was more for individuals unfamiliar with the situation who might misread your comments and take them seriously. Considering that at least some of the people who <i>have</i> been following the Esperanza incidents have been confused, I don't think it was outside possibility for someone who <i>hadn't</i> been following it to be confused and potentially upset. All around, it's just best to avoid anything that skirts on implying violence against other users. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> Â· <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 16:19, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Babajobu. As you may or may not know, there have been some troubles with Esperanza.

<p>Thanks for catching the "late" 1930s ref to Lucas that someone inserted... I've noticed many vegetarian websites incorrectly refer to it in order to "spin" the anecdote as aggressively as possible.

<p>Hey Babajobu, thanks for your note. I'd say the organic label is only in part to do with what's put in the soil and on the produce, but also about how the animals are reared. The regulations vary between countries, but will normally preclude the overuse of antibiotics, which means the animals can't be kept in the usual crowded conditions. Prohibiting the use of growth hormones rules out the disfigured condition animals end up in (pigs being unable to stand up etc), and the rules on what they're allowed to eat tends to mean they suffer less illness (the classic example being cows who were fed cows ending up with mad cow disease). Also, farmers who go organic are small-scale farmers who tend to care about their animals, or at least care more. Most factory farms aren't run by farmers, but by huge corporations that have nothing to do with agriculture. Poultry production in the U.S., for example, is controlled by just 50 corporations, the second largest of which alone sold 5.3 <i>billion</i> pounds of chicken and 310 million pounds of turkey in 2004. It's these huge (almost unfathomable) numbers of animals being sold very cheaply that causes the abuse â€” makes the abuse necessary, in fact. Cruelty-free products can't be available to people of all incomes â€” unless we're talking govt subsidies, and that'll never happen â€” because raising animals well and in something close to a natural environment is a slow, expensive business. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:22, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This seems to be your baby, so I hope the following is of interest. No doubt the term is of limited use, but if you watch gaelic sports teams from Cork and Kerry on TV you will usually observe one or two players with distinctive dark complexions and colouring - I take it that the term refers to this type of people. The explanations for the presence of this type, especially in the western parts of those counties, are based either on myth (<a href="../../../m/i/l/Milesians_%28Irish%29_e444.html" title="Milesians (Irish)">Milesians (Irish)</a>) or just daft speculation (survivors of the Spanish Armada). But there was an extended contact between Iberia and south-west Ireland, when Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets used that part of the country as a base for their expeditions into the north Atlantic, reaching as far as Newfoundland; this activity continued from at least the mid-15thC. to the mid 17thC., but the details have been lost with the extension of English authority in Ireland and the decline of the Spanish empire. Evidence of the extent of the connection isn't great, but there are remains of Spanish fish processing plants along the coast, and prior to its destruction in the Elizabethan wars of the late 16thC. the town of Dingle in west Kerry was described as built in the Spanish style. Whether or not there was a contribution to the native gene pool requires DNA investigation (and bear in mind that fishing communities probably survived better during periods when entire populations were wiped out by war and famine). Leaving aside the terminology, this may help to explain why a separate type of Irish people should be identified by casual observation. What do you fink? Should I just stick it in the article?<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 12:09, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I did express concerns about POV editing, I find Anonymous Editor generally reasonable in discussion, and don't see any reason to think he would abuse his admin privileges. In addition, I think that Wikipedia would benefit from multiple POVs. Also, I think the Muslim related articles get a lot of vandalism, and it would be helpful to have an admin patrolling them more regularly. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:46, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. You flagged Carrot Capers(Camp Lazlo) for speedy deletion because it had no assertion of notability. Please review the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>. While an assertion of importance/significance is a criteria for speedy deletion, this only applies to biographical articles. An example of such an article would be like an article named "Johnathon James Doe" which said "Johnathon Doe is a really cool kid."

<p>In general I think you do have a serious shot at being made an admin if you can get ~40 or so votes to compensate for 8 or so votes from the muslim/dhimmi contingent. If you look at the bulk of the oppose votes they are about about various fixable things. So I think that if you keep your nose clean and practice good habits, you have a very good shot at being made an admin soon. Certainly you will be made an admin before I will ever be&#160;!!! <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 09:24, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not plan to use the bot in the future, as I have plenty of others things to do, and again, I dislike the guy for reasons you saw on his RfAr.</p>
<p>As such, you are on your own cleaning up after him from here into the future. Please note that this job is not as easy as you may think, it will take big effort and a lot of commitment.

<dd>I just know Klonimus from around Wikipedia, and from SIIEG. He's a good dude. I don't know his politics exactly, but he's no fascist as far as I can tell (and Hitchens certainly isn't!). Anyway, one might think of me as the love child you and Klonimus will never have, combining Hitchensish love of Enlightenment values with a crotchety libertarianism. Some other mischief maker suggested SIIEG's motto should be "SIIEG Heil!", which was funny, but unfair.

It seems youre not aware of the religious ethnic-spectrum of American politics. Im not talking about the famous hedonistic diasporic <i>Iranian Jews</i> living in LA. Im talking about <a href="http://www.aipac.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.aipac.org/" rel="nofollow">these guys</a>: The elite mainstream American Jew that goes to Yale or Brown or NYU, and ends up with a top career in US govt. In fact Dianne Feinstein, a famous CAL jew who you must know, once proposed to ban all Iranian students from studying in the US.<a href="http://www.payvand.com/news/01/nov/1003.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.payvand.com/news/01/nov/1003.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> In fact it is because of this very group of elites in American politics that Iran and the US are enemies, despite common strategic interests. Like Zora, the claim-to-know-it-all American Jews think they know better than Israelis about the welfare of the Jewish state. (Zora thinks she knows more about Islam or Iran than I do). If it werent for the American Jews (which Israel has often criticized), and if it werent for reactionary dumb-ass retrogrades like Iran's new president, Iran and the US would be friends now.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 03:09, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was trying to illustrate that Klonimus's whole goal here is keeping it clean of Wahhabi-sect sympathizers' skewed perspectives. Mine is more making sure Socialists don't try to constantly paint everything with a Marxist brush....I've been that way ever since I heard people trying to claim that Nazis were socialist.

<p>Hey, I've been involved in some articles you've been involved in and seen some of your edits. I think they're reasonable, even when you step over the line and start calling people donkey-haters. Surprised you weren't banned for that. But seriously, I just wanted to say hey and I'm sorry I missed your RfA. Woulda voted yes. Oh, and re: your post on Islamofascism: I believe you meant "hackles" when you wrote "cockles." I take it that you are using cockles in the sense of "cockles of my heart," which refers to ventricles, which could imply that raised cockles raise blood pressure. But I surmise, rather, that you meant hackles, as in "raised hackles, which rise on the back of one's neck when confronting, um, moronic 3RR sock-pupeteers. Anyway, hope you won't take this tiny criticism ill. I figure whether I'm right on this or not, from your history I can count on you to at least have a sense of humor about it.

<p>Hey Baba, I am not joking when I say that Gidonb may be paid to take care of wiki for the killers of Yitzhak Rabin. There a few places that are relevent to Rabin murder. rabin murder conspiracy,shimon peres, yigal amir, yitzhak rabin, barry chamish, kempler video. Gidonb is on all those pages deleting stuff. He will delete the links. He tried to delete Kempler video, When he failed in the delete he edits. Barry Chamish does not have a link to barry's site. On english Gidonb is becoming somewhat successful... In hebrew you cannot make a article or mention kempler video even on the rabin murder conspiracy page. Gidonb may be working on both languages and it may be his job.. So don't expect reasonable behavior. It is hard for you to believe what I am writing.. go through the history and it is really wierd. Gidonb had a partner previously.. but it seems like Gidonb is still at it..<a href="../../../k/e/m/User%7EKempler_video_a0dc.html" title="User:Kempler video">Kempler video</a> 18:30, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From the talkpage of User:BigDaddy777 - It's too late dude.</p>
<p>I've got all the goods on you guys I need.</p>
<p>Now it's on to the people who finance Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I GUARANTEE you when I'm done with presenting the evidence, you won't be getting a RED CENT from anyone but liberal donors.</p>
<p>A far left wacked out organization financed by purely left wing funding.</p>
<p>Try selling the American People THAT as a neutral encyclopedia...</p>
<p>I told you guys this was gonna be a win:win for me.</p>
<p>I win if I stayed and helped changed Wikipedia.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>I win if I PROVED beyond a shadow of doubt to reasonable people (not these dungeons and dragons playactors I've been dealing with) that this place is what I told user ngb the first days I came here -</p>
<p>A liberal cesspool of far left kooks controlling what is said on the political pages.</p>
<p>So, block me now, block me forever, you were a day late and a buck or two short. T he damage has been done.</p>
<p>I will take the ENORMOUS PASSION I have to reform Wikipedia to the funding sources and make sure ANY conservative or fair minded person sees this how utterly contemptable the left wing bias is in here. And when I do...watch the non-liberal funding dry up.</p>
<p>This plan has been in place from almost the beginning but I wanted to see if reformation was possible. But the final straw for you guys was that anti-Semetic Jew baiting slur from JamesMLane. Wait till the donors find out this pure bigotry was spewed by one of the MOST RESPECTED liberals in here. There's gonna be a lot of 'splainin to do over that one. lol!</p>
<p>Face it: In very short order, Wikipedia will rightfully become known throghout the world as the official encyclopedia for DemocraticUnderground.Com and nothing else....</p>
<p>Your pal,</p>
<p>Big Daddy</p>
<p>Ps Special thanks to all the liberals in here that censor conservatives and treat them like Negroes in the south in the 50's. I really could not have done what I'm about to do without you. Think I won't?....I think you all know better...</p>

<p>That guy's pretty hardcore. But there are a lot of political kooks on wikipedia, but a dearth of both registered sex offendors and people who like to impersonate registered sex offendors.
