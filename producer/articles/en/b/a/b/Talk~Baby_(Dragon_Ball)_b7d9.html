<p>I added this section because the concept and creation of the character needs to be discussed in the article. That's why the fiction tag is currently on top of this article. Don't delete the section just because there isn't any text there yet, I don't have the resources to provide accurate and sourced inforamtion, but it does exist. See <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_%28The_Legend_of_Zelda%29_6fbd.html" title="Link (The Legend of Zelda)">Link (The Legend of Zelda)</a> for what a character page should look like. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 01:31, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
While <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_%28The_Legend_of_Zelda%29_6fbd.html" title="Link (The Legend of Zelda)">Link (The Legend of Zelda)</a> looks great, it's not really possible to do the same for Baby. Link can have a 'concept and creation' section because the character 'Link' has appeared in more than one story, and it's clear that there are multiple 'Links'. To make an article about a character who is more than one person, or is portrayed several different times one needs to structure the article around how and what 'the character' is about. This is exactly how most comic book character articles are written. There's a section about each representation of the character and the article will discuss how each differed from the last.</p>
<p>But Baby is a different story altogether. Baby was only ever portrayed once, and then only for a relatively short time. The only non-plot information we have about him is that he was designed by Toriyama - everything else is straight from the plot information and it makes sense to keep that information in the 'biography' section. Recounting the plot needs to be told from an in-universe perspective, it would be difficult to read otherwise. Anything that can be talked about from a real-world perspective <i>is</i>.</p>
<p>I contest the use of the In Universe tag. The article clearly states he is a fictional character and talks about his concept and creation (as much as is known) in the first paragraph. The In Universe tag is meant to be used on pages that are ambiguous as to if they are referring to actual things or fictional things. If the article was written ion such a way as to suggest that Baby was <i>actually</i> running amok and destroying planets, then yes the article would need to be re written. But in this page it's made clear that Baby is not real, tells a bit about his concept and creation, mentions his voice actors, and <i>then</i> recounts the plot of the story with which he is involved. Nothing inappropriate, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 04:29, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The in-universe tag is there because the plot is the only thing being talked about. <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padme_Amidala_fa95.html" title="Padme Amidala">Padme Amidala</a> are both also featured character articles. Things like how the writers came up with the idea, how animators drew the character, and how the actor decided to voice the part are all things that should be talked about. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 05:57, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That would be great. Does that information <i>exist</i> for this character? --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 06:07, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it exists, it's just a matter of how hard you look for it. Searching for interviews with Toriyama would be a good start. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 06:15, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only info you'll probably get is that he was designed by Akira Toriyama, which is something that's already there. They don't release info like the Star Wars people do. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 06:19, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good luck. All I've ever seen is two pages from what I can assume is the GT data book(s?) that have really no text at all on them.

<dd>Agreed. GT wasn't created by Toriyama (whom we could <i>hope</i> to find an interview with), it was created by Toei's group of staff writers. I think it's highly unlikely that there will be any interviews with them. Especially now, ten years after the fact. The only information one would find would be in the GT DragonBook, or the GT Perfect Files books. And there I doubt you'll find anything about his concept or creation.</dd>
<dd>If you can find any information Jay, then by all means include it. But I suggest taking out a section that has no information, and is unlikely to get any. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> 20:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If plot information is the only thing that will ever be in this article then it should probably be merged with the list of characters. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 21:07, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He's large enough a character to warrant his own page. I think the 'biography' section should be trimmed considerably (if one wants a recap of the Baby arc they can read the arc summaries). But the 'Powers' and 'special attacks' sections are pretty good. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesireCampbell_ab29.html" title="User:DesireCampbell">DesireCampbell</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDesireCampbell_dfeb.html" title="User talk:DesireCampbell">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DesireCampbell_ee1e.html" title="Special:Contributions/DesireCampbell">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>There's still some debate about the name, whether the romanization should be 'Bebi' or 'Baby'. There was a Move Request that ended without concensus, and thus the page stayed at <a href="../../../b/e/b/Bebi.html" title="Bebi">Bebi</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some points on the matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name in katakana is <b>ベビー</b></li>
<li>If "baby" is transliterated into katakana it would indeed be ベビー</li>
<li>"Baby" is the spelling used in Funimation's dub of GT, and the Blue Water dub of GT, as well as Funimation's English subtitles.</li>

<li>There's no information available to say if the name is indeed a pun on "baby", but there is <a href="http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/4058/cap004lv1.png" class="external text" title="http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/4058/cap004lv1.png" rel="nofollow">this scene</a>.</li>

<dd>Neither does polling. Polling discourages consensus because it eliminates options and is used to justify actions that don't necessarily have consensus. You use polling wherever you can and it's really quite an annoying habit. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 20:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And first past the post democracy discourages being nice to those that don't vote for you. But it's better than the other alternatives we have. If you have <i>sone other alternative</i> to polls, then please <i>do that</i>. Don't simply say the poll is evil and do <i>nothing</i> to improve the situation. Do you have <i>anything constructive</i> to add at all? I brought up the discussion, <b>Power Level</b> thought I'd given enough evidence to warrant a quick poll of whoever was interested.

<dd><b>STROGLY Support</b> There is no doubt in my mind the name should be "Baby" because that is the proper spelling not Bebi which is just the Japanese spelling used primarily before the dub.

<li><b>Support</b> per DesireCampbell. Oh, and by the way, wether or not polls are "evil" on Wikipedia is a POV, so pushing it like that as if it were a policy isn't going to work.

<dd>It's not a real Move Request poll. It's simply an informal poll to gauge general consensus for a 'Bebi' to 'Baby' move.

<p>"Bebi (FUNimation's dub: Baby) is a fictional character and major villain in the anime Dragon Ball GT."</p>
<p>See that there? Where it says "fictional character"? Yeah. That right there states that he is NOT an actual existing entity in the real world and is, in fact, FICTIONAL.</p>
<p>"<i>I contest the use of the In Universe tag. The article clearly states he is a fictional character and talks about his concept and creation (as much as is known) in the first paragraph. The In Universe tag is meant to be used on pages that are ambiguous as to if they are referring to actual things or fictional things. If the article was written ion such a way as to suggest that Baby was actually running amok and destroying planets, then yes the article would need to be re written. But in this page it's made clear that Baby is not real, tells a bit about his concept and creation, mentions his voice actors, and then recounts the plot of the story with which he is involved. Nothing inappropriate, in my opinion.</i>" --DesireCampbell 04:29, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See all of that that was said there? Yeah. In Universe tag is being used inappropriately. It will be removed again in a moment.</p>

<dd>The article is completely written in an in-universe perspective. Only the leading is written in an out- perspective. Just an example:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Bebi is first seen by Goku, Pan and Trunks while they are on the planet M2, home of Dr. Myu. During the encounter, Bebi is still confined to a tank of liquid, where he is completing his regeneration.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>An out-universe sentence would be <i>Bebi is first introduced in Dragon Ball Z #55, chapter 13, "Bebi arrives" (1990). In that chapter, Bebi is confined to a tank of liquid, similar to the one appearing in Dragon Ball Z #30, chapter 2, "Vegeta hurts" (1988), where Vegeta regenerated himself after the battle with Freeza.</i></dd>
