<p>I dropped out of ccg-ing ages ago, but I could swear that one of the gaming magazines (<a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard.html" title="Wizard">Wizard</a>'s version, IRRC), sometime within the past year or two had an article wherein they rated their top-five all time favorite games, and the B5 ccg came in either first or second. If anyone can find, or knows, of the issue number and how B5 fared, an addition to this article would be dandy. --Jeffrey O. Gustafson 23:45, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just before Precedence lost the license to produce the B5 CCG, they were working on a stand-alone, two-player game that would allow players to represent either the Vorlons or the Shadows, in a grand conflict for control of the galaxy. This game was still in development but had been produced in demo form and playtested at the major gaming conventions, according to second-hand reports. It was to come out at the same time as the CRUSADE expansion, originally, then was pushed back to the time of the ANLA'SHOK expansion (which was never officially released), and then was cancelled. I do not recall the name of this stand-alone game, but it was something like THE GREAT WAR (though that was the name of one of the B5 CCG expansions, so it might have been something else, similar to that). 65.87.33.13 01:43, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is quite simply full of holes, generalisations and vague statements. It appears to have been written by someone who has never played. I used to be a rep (known as Rangers after the organisation in the show) for this game before its demise, but as I'm new to Wiki I'm loathe to randomly wander in and start changing things in case I delete the whole thing....</p>
<p>At first glance I spotted the following:</p>
<p><b>"The Vorlons and Shadows, although not a playable race in their own right, are available as supporting characters and fleets, as are Babylon 5, the Drakh and the Interstellar Alliance."</b></p>
<p>The Drakh are a seperate case to B5 or the ISA. A player can become a Drakh Faction and completely remove all characters of his former faction if he chooses. Likewise the ISA is different to B5 as it is player formed coalition unlike B5 which is similar to the Vorlons and Shadows.</p>
<p><b>"The object of the game is to use various agendas, events and conflict cards to build power and influence points for your faction."</b></p>
<p>The object of the game is to win. You can build all the power and influence you'd like, it doesn't mean anything without being ableto win with it.</p>
<p><b>"Actions in the game have to be carried out by the characters that you control, for example if you only have one character in play you can only initiate one action per turn. Unless otherwise stated, Characters can only perform one action per turn. "</b></p>
<p>Actions in the game do not have to be performed by characters and the amount of actions you have is in no way dependant on your number of characters. Characters may perform as many actions as they are allowed to until they are forced to rotate. And even then they are able to continue to perform other actions if so permitted. The article misleads.</p>
<p><b>"Each player begins with a starting hand which includes their Ambassador and 3 other cards of the players choice, a draw deck of cards (45 or more) and 4 influence points. "</b> The article is using a blanket statement based on basic rules. All factions may have at least an extra card in their hand (A Crusade...), the Non-Aligned Faction starts with another card automatically, although this card's type is restricted, and certain cards completely alter the entire dynamic of the starting hand (Londo Mollari - Gambler - No cards in your starting hand, begin the game with seven influence, and other conditions regarding influence gain).</p>
<p><b>"Each player takes it in turns to initiate conflicts and spend influence points to bring different cards in their hand into play, then uses those cards to try and either build up more influence for themeselves or prevent other players from building up influence. When everyone has done everything they want to do, any conflicts in play are resolved, points are allocated and players have the opportunity to play Aftermath cards. Finally, all players draw a card from their draw deck and take it into their hand."</b></p>
<p>This section is incredibly vague and misleading for a new player.</p>
<p><b>"Play continues in this manner until one player either reaches 20 power/influence points or fulfills a specific game-winning criteria."</b></p>
<p>Incorrect.</p>
<p><b>"Premier</b> <b>The Shadows</b> Deluxe The Great War Psi Corps Severed Dreams Wheel of Fire Crusade<b>"</b></p>
<p>I'd say that the unreleased Collector's Set be added with the notation that it was unreleased although Precedence did preview the entire set which is now archived with images at Vorlon Space.</p>
<p><b>"Aftermath</b></p>
<pre>
   <b>Cards which are played at the end of the round by any players who won a conflict. Aftermaths can be played either on yourself to raise your own cards abilities, or on your opponents cards to lower their abilities"'''</b>
</pre>
<p>Aftermaths can be played by anyone regardless of whether they won or lost the conflict and on anyone who fits the criteria.</p>
<p><b>"Agenda</b></p>
<pre>
   <b>These cards often contain text stipulating what a player must achieve to win the game. They also grant bonuses to your own cards, for example giving characters a stat bonus or increasing the strength of a players fleets"'</b>
</pre>
<p>Again hopelessly vague.</p>
<p><b>"Character</b></p>
<pre>
   <b>Each card features a character from the TV series and includes a short explanation of what the character can do in the game as well as a side bar indicating what stats they possess. A characters stats are based on 4 values - Diplomacy, Intrigue, Psi, and Leadership. The main character in a deck is known as the Ambassador, and acts as the players avatar in the game."'</b>
</pre>
<p>Certain characters can make used of all FIVE stats available in the game.</p>
<p><b>"Conflict</b></p>
<pre>
  <b> Conflicts are the main way in which players build up influence points. At the start of the round, Players can declare a conflict either on one of their opponents or (if the card allows) on themselves. There are 4 main types - Diplomacy, Intrigue, Psi and Military. Each conflict can only be supported or opposed using it's specified stat ie: Diplomacy conflicts use a characters Diplomacy stat. Military conflicts can only be supported by Fleets."'</b>
</pre>
<p>There are only five stats in the game, '4 main types' is a bit redundant. Conflicts may be supported by any ability that the rules or another card allows, not just the ability of the conflict type.</p>
<p><b>"Enhancement</b></p>
<pre>
   <b>Improves a targeted card of the specified type, usually with a stat bonus. Most cards that remain in play (characters, agendas, fleets etc) can be enhanced."'</b>
</pre>
<p>Any card (including other Enhancements) can actually be enhanced, depending on the Enhancement.</p>
<p><b>"Event</b> Can be played at any time during the round, by any player. Event cards are usually played in order to disrupt an opponents current playing strategy or enhance your own."</p>
<p>Events may only be played during the Action Round, and only when it is your action.</p>
<p><b>"Fleet</b> Military conflicts can only be initiated by an available Fleet card. Fleets, like characters, can also be used to target an opponents fleets and characters in order to try and damage them, impairing their abilities or removing them from play." I'm rapidly running out of adjectives for wrong. Standard Military conflicts may be initiated regardless of whether or not you have a Fleet in play.</p>
<p><b>"Location</b> Locations are planets or space lanes that grant bonuses to the faction as a whole. For example, Homeworld locations can be used to double the amount of influence gained from winning a conflict. " Only five homworlds in the game alter the amount of influence gained from a conflict, and then it only adds one influence, not doubles it. The others have different effects.</p>
<p>This is only what I've managed to see on my first glance but I think i've made my point. This article should be made accurate, any new player (and they still happen even though the game is six years out of print) would be utterly confused by this article. I don't believe the article should be a copy of the rulebook or a tactics and play guide, but it should have all the errors removed and reworked to be an accurate piece on the game.</p>
<p>If I can workout how I'll move this into the B5 project as well.....</p>
