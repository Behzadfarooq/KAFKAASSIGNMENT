<p>What's the backing for the "Babylon" in 1 Peter not being Rome? I realize that this is often claimed in anti-papal polemics, and that of course the Mesopotamian Babylon still had a large Jewish settlement, but the statement still strikes me as:</p>

<li>controversial</li>
<li>not supported, and</li>
<li>largely irrelevant to an article on the Mesopotamian city.</li>

</dl>
<p>Babylon in I Peter 4:13 is in the dative. There is a question about the presense of the preposition εν, but all the variants listed by Nestle/Aland have Babylon in the dative. Even without the preposition, this would be locative and would still be translated "in Babylon", so definitely an individual person, not a city. To translate "She who is Babylon" would require the nominative. In any event, it is not related to the content of this node, which is controversial enough without bringing irrelevant passages to into it.</p>
<p>Regarding the fall of Nineveh: I don't know if we know exactly. The date of the later fall of Babylon to Cyrus can be nailed down very precisely, but the exact date for the fall of Nineveh may involve some interpolation, working backward through the generations of Babylonian kings and/or forward from earlier events. Unless someone knows differently, I'd say call it the seventh century BCE and let it go at that.</p>

<p><i>In the Assyrian tablets it means "The city of the dispersion of the tribes."</i> Wouldn't that be nice if it were true? Then the name would coincide with the moral of the story of the "Tower of Babel," wouldn't it? Sunday school! This kind of fakery makes it impossible to write authentic history of anything touched on the the Bible. Would someone check this and remove it please if the "Assyrian tablets" say no such thing? <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 22:36, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it's fair to presume that "the Assyrian tablets" are written in Assyrian, then the statement is pure nonsense. Assyrian is another Akkadian dialect, closely related to Babylonian. In both langauges, bab-ilu would mean "gate of god"/"gods" (have to look up what the difference between genitive plural and genitive singular is). If this does turn into an edit war, I've got the docs to back this up, after taking a year of Akkadian in college. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwbrum_d3bd.html" title="User:Benwbrum">Benwbrum</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>bab-ili(m) is "gate of the god", while bab-ili, with a macron over the final i is "gate of the gods". This meaning is an ancient folk etymology for the name of the city, and is NOT an Akkadian rendering of the Sumerian KA2.DINGIR.RA -- rather, the Sumerian is a learned back-translation from the Akkadian, by Akkadian scholars who liked to show that they still knew their Sumerian until it caught on and became a common logographic writing. 612 is the traditional date for the sacking of Nineveh. The Assyrian empire under Assur-uballit III shifted its seat to the city of Harran in the west and continued to survive until the Babylonians under Nabopolassar sacked it 609. The Assyrians' Egyptian allies arrived at about that time (appropriately late?), and a struggle between Egypt and Babylonia ensued to see who would inherit the fragments of the Assyrian empire. Babylonia, under crown prince Nebuchadnezzar (II), was victorious and chased the Egyptians out of Syria. --128.135.245.253</p>
<p>Actually, this reflects the somewhat confusing situation as different assyriological schools use different chronologies. Mesopotamian chronology is actually worthy of an article on its own. I've tried to find if there is something on it, but have not found much. If someone would start it, I could lend a hand, but sadly I'm not that good in astronomy to do it myself. Or is there anything I've missed? --<a href="../../../o/o/p/User%7EOop_8403.html" title="User:Oop">Oop</a> 21:46, Oct 2, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am searching for information on what existed in Babylon in the first century AD - any palaces - anything documented. Can anyone help? Beth</p>
<p>This article could use some more organization and I've made some steps to that end. I added and expanded sections on Babylonian history.</p>
<p>There's alot of semiotic discussion in "Archeology" and I don't understand what the heading "Archeology" is supposed to encompass to that end. It's a total mess. But there's some good facts in there that simply need to be organized properly.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I it indeed a mess (I suppose, a lot of 1911 stuff interspersed with random additions). You are welcome to improve it! I suppose between 539 and 331, Babylon was just another town in the Persian Empire. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 17:45, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>why is the etymology section a subsection of Archaeology? What about the (correct) etymology given in the intro (from Babilu, meaning "The Gate of God". This Semitic word is a translation of the Sumerian Kadmirra.)? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 20:44, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Really, it's an afterthought because I'm trying to preserve as much content as possible from the original mash under Archeology (a mix of history, semiotics, and some archeological facts smushed together), but I'm not sure where to stuff it all. It should probably go, since the existing definition leading into the article is far more elegant.</p>

<p>I was redirected to this page while looking for data on Babel. Granted, most are predisposed to believe that Babel (as in the city housing the tower of babel) is a myth, however if it is to be associated with any city, Babylon is certainly not the one to associate it with.</p>
<p>1) Babel and Babylon are <i>false cognates</i>. Babel means confusion and Babylon means Gate of god. Therefore, similar names are purely coincidental</p>
<p>2) Babel is, in Genesis 10, one of four sumerian cities ruled by Nimrod: "Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh." These are on the plain of Shinar, and shinar is of course Sumer. Babylon is in Akkadia, not Sumer. It's way too far north to be in Sumer.</p>
<p>3) Babylon is far too new to be the first major city on earth. Other places in sumer, most probably Eridug, are more likely.</p>
<p>Babel was a different city. A seperate page ought to exist discussing it's non-babylon nature, but in the meantime at least, babel should not be mistaken with babylon via redirects and a misinformed disambiguation page. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 04:55, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>H.W.F. Saggs, in "Babylon", writes:</p>
<p><span style="color:blue">"The original name of the settlement was Babil or Babilia. This was pre-Semitic, being perhaps an instance of the so-called 'substratum language'.

<dd>I was careful to attribute the statements. As such, they definitely belong here. We just have to make sure that it is clear that they are still rather unconfirmed. If there are any dementi about the damage from the pentagon, or from other sources, by all means, they should be included. But as far as I can see, some experts were outraged at damage done by the occupation forces, which have reacted with rather suspicious silence. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 19:36, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>these reports are terrible. If this is what happened, that's outright barbarian. You can argue that to bomb and torture people is useful because it demoralizes opposition (also very mistaken, if you know anything about history, but at least that's a rationale), but to pointlessly rape a unique archaeological site, when you could just have put your camp half a mile further down the road, that's just <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orc.html" title="Orc">orcish</a>.

<dd>I spent a month on that base in September 2003 with the Marines. While it was probably too early to judge, it seemed the harm to any archaeological value of the place had already been committed by Saddam with his "rebuilding." The Ishtar gate mentioned in reports is merely a copy, built two decades ago. While I could definately make out MUCH older ruins, most of the soldiers there respected it's age. It is true, we shouldn't have set up camps directly within the walls of an ancient city, but it proved to be a good defensible position and well-suited for the headquarters established in Saddam's old palace.--SaintMark5 16:46, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also spent a month in at the base in March of 2002 with the Marine Corps. The ruins were kept off limits without a escort. I had a chance to tour the ruins and all the damage I saw were obviously caused by looters. The reason it was obvious was because objects were missing not just damaged or smashed. The US Military could not have possibly looted everything I saw because the Soldiers and Marines have a mission and have no time or enough room in their vehicles to have looted everything I saw, couple that with the stiff penalties for the acquiring of war trophies and the likelihood drops even more.

<p>I have made entries about these claims (see section below "Who cares..."). The reason the US Military was close to the ruins was to prevent (we were too late) or at least stem the looting of the ruins. So please, stop accusing the military of "raping" the site and "demoralizing" the populace. My expectation was the people contributing to Wikipedia were more intelligent than to be susceptible to heresay and juevenile comments. I assure you the military is the ONLY thing that has prevented each brick from leaving the ruin. I treasure my opportunity to see Babylon with my own eyes and was very much aware of the historical significance of the site. My opinion is my fellow Marines felt the same way. Looting or disgracing the site was never in my mind.</p>

It is either <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, the familiar spelling in English, based on Biblical Hebrew, <i>or</i> the correct Akkadian transliteration, <i>Nabû-kudurri-uṣur</i>. I don't see where there is any room for calling the king "Nebuchadrezzar" between these two options. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 18:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because the Bible uses Nebuchadrezzar too. Talking about Nebuchadnezzar in an article entitled Nebuchadrezzar would just be retarded. And given that Nebuchadrezzar is closer to the man's name, the article should be named such (or, if anything, moved to Nabu-kudurri-usur, although that would probably be overkill, considering that pretty much all foreign names are referred to in the English Wikipedia under an English form). Both are used in English, but one is more correct than the other. The Bible isn't the only place where one can read about Nebuchadrezzar, in any case. This isn't the only instance of the Bible fudging people's names either. Look at the Bible calling Pharaoh Apries Hophra. Should we all just start calling him Hophra, because the Bible says so, screw all of the rest of the ancient world? Your dichotomy of having to call Nebuchadrezzar either Nebuchadnezzar or Nabu-kudurri-usur is a false one. The name Nebuchadrezzar stands on good middle ground, not quite the raw Akkadian, and not nearly as completely wrong as Nebuchadnezzar with its invented letter in there replacing a missing one.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 03:19, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

we may be splitting hairs a little bit; the article title is irrelevant, it was <i>moved</i> to Nebuchadrezzar, and can just as easily be moved back. It being "middle ground" is irrelevant, as long as it is not in common use. "Nabukudnusar" would be "middle ground", but it is out of the question because nobody uses it. It <i>does</i> seem to see some use in English, about one tenth of Nebuchadnezzar, if we're to believe google. But then point is that the name <i>is</i> in use in the <a href="../../../k/j/v/KJV_3727.html" title="KJV">KJV</a>:</p>

<p>So, the -n- form in KJV is in Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemia, Jeremiah, Daniel while the -r- form is in Jeremiah and Ezekhiel. The Vulgate, interestingly, has -n- <i>exclusively</i>, <b>Nabuchodonosor</b>. The -r- form seems to be a variant in Hebrew (nbwkdr'zr vs. nbwkdn'zr, maybe even a scribal error, the whole difference is one little stroke). Some modern translations amend this to Nebukadnezzar throughout, take for example Je21:2:<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/tmp_dir/versions/1133447806-8722.html#2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blueletterbible.org/tmp_dir/versions/1133447806-8722.html#2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I think this shows that Nebukadnezzar is the more current variant, and should be used as article title (but I don't care enough to insist, this is simlply my detached judgement). In the article text, both variants should be given, together with Vulgate's <i>Nabuchodonosor</i> and LXX's <i>Naboukhodonosor</i>. The article certainly shouldn't claim that Nebuchandezzar is a "mistaken" spelling. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:48, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I mentioned the middle ground thing because you only presented two options, Nebuchadnezzar and Nabu-kudurri-usur, the latter of which isn't exactly in common use either. Nabukudnusar would still suffer the same problem as Nebuchadnezzar. Regarding those King James Version stats, being used over 54% as often as Nebuchadnezzar doesn't exactly make Nebuchadrezzar the forgotten orphan, even within the Bible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What you forget, though, is that the man and his name are known from outside the Bible. I'm not even sure why we keep talking about what the Bible does or doesn't do, because his name stands without the Bible. The only thing we can get from the Bible is that maybe we should refer to his name in English as Nebuchadrezzar instead of, say, Nabukudrusar. But what someone was actually called and what they're called in the Bible are completely orthogonal issues. There are tons of cuneiform tablets from the Neo-Babylonian period, and as far as I know, not a single one of them refers to him as anything that could be converted into Nebuchadnezzar. That the Bible calls him something else in some places doesn't change what his actual name is known to have been from contemporary writings in his own language (and probably even from Greek writings, although I don't remember for sure at the moment). It's the same thing with the Pharaoh I mentioned above. Should we all start calling him something else because the Bible has a different name for him than what his name is actually known to have really been? That's my point: Nebuchadrezzar's name can be completely established from contemporary cuneiform. What anyone else referred to him as in their own religious books doesn't change what the man's name actually was. In lieu of going around referring to Nabu-kudurri-usur, we should take the standard English version that is as close to his actual name as possible. Now, if the name Nebuchadrezzar didn't exist, the options would truly be either Nebuchadnezzar or Nabu-kudurri-usur, and I would probably agree with using Nebuchadnezzar. Or even if the name Nebuchadrezzar existed in the Bible, but we didn't know from external sources what his real name actually was. But neither of those is the case, we actually have a standard English version that can be established to be somewhat close, at least closer than the other standard English version.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 17:05, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wiki policy is to go with the form used most often <i>in English</i>, no matter what it is in his own language or any other language; and that is demonstrably "Nebuchadnezzar". Of course neither one matters to me a whole lot anyway. (I could be way off, but I vaguely seem to recall seeing somewhere the form with -n-, instead of -r-, incorporates some sort of "under-the-breath"-like resemblance to an insult in Hebrew, since he was particularly hated by Jews for destroying Jerusalem and leading them to the Babylonian captivity.) <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> 18:40, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[Gregory McCoy] email available upon request. I, too, spent time there as part of the occupational force (I'm a retired Marine and was present for the actual war). There were NO landing sites anywhere near the Babylon ruins. Period. Access was by highway. I know it is fashionable to lay blame of all sorts on America for all the evils of the World but this is baseless. One opinion of a British scholar holds no more weight than my own with the excpetion I was actually there.</p>
<p>Let me state clearly, that before U.S. forces could arrive, the Iraqis themselves were in the process of a full looting spree. They took everything human hands could carry, even the lighting fixtures from the museum. It is impossible to know all the treasures that were carried away or otherwise trampled upon. Let me also state Saddam had constructed a palace nearly on top of the ruins (Literally less than a 100 yards). What effect did that have upon the ruins? Where is the mention of that in this entry?</p>
<p>Shall we place in the article the fact the local Iraqis were constantly hawking wares for sale, hoping for US currency? I was offered what appeared to be bricks from the ruins several times for $5.</p>

<p>Kukini, I am not sure what part of `Babylon under Persia` is incorrect. In fact, every single statement is factual, unless your biased views dictate they are not the truth. Elamites, and Medes were the ancestor of Persians. When Cyrus the Great entered Babylon, he avenged Marduk and dissolved the the Chaldean king. The history of Babylonians and Persians are intertwined. Furthermore, Babylon became a major player in world history after Cyrus colonized it. Examples include, numerous mentions of the Persian Empire and the freeing of Jews in Babylon in the Old Testament, the fact that the Persian Empire made Babylon the center of its administration, the fact that `First Charter of Human Rights` in history was found in Babylon, embedded in the Cyrus cylinders, written by Cyrus <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/persianempir1/a/aa032800a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/persianempir1/a/aa032800a.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and other major historical events. As such, it is only fitting that, instead of a one sentenced, almost insignificant introduction to this period, a more informative paragraph be embedded in the `Babylon under Persia` section. You should really do some research before deciding for yourself what history was. <a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 05:25, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Persians have much more in common with Babylon than Iraqis ever will; Iraq refers to the land that was formerly Babylon, before Arabs invaded Persia and moved their own people there.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 05:26, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sumerians who were originally an Iranian tribe had immense ties to Babylon, you may look up [<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/su/Sumer.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/su/Sumer.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>], that says, ``The history of Mesopotamia began with the civilization of the Sumerians, who emigrated from the highlands of Iran and northern Anatolia in about 3000 BC``.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 05:25, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
- - - -</p>
<p>The link you provided in that last paragraphs says no such thing, rather it clearly states that Sumerian origins are still a mystery.</p>
<p>Further, from the books I read (Roux' "Ancient Iraq", Crawford's "Sumer and the Sumerians", Oppenheim's "Ancient Mesopotamia", and some articles) all agree that there is no difference physiologically betwen the Sumerians and their Semtiic northern neighbors, and that not only is there no evidence of Sumerian origins outside of the region, but they seem to go back deep in history. Now, I may have mis-read, but that is what I recall.</p>
<p>If you look at the patterns of Neolithic migrations, humans migrated <i>from</i> the Ferile Crescent, not <i>into</i> it. When agriculture began in the Fertile Crescent, the population exploded, and people from there began migrating out of the area into all directions.</p>
<p>In that light, the Sumerians, being in the Fertile Crescent itself (south Iraq), can be seen as a continuation of the local population, now booming and entering a more urban phase. Thus they are locals. it is this Neolithic migration, which began around 10,000 years ago, and continued for several thousand years after, that not only explains the spread of agricluture to many regions around, but also may explain the spread of languages, such as the similarities between Elamite (also from southern Iraq), and Dravidian, perhaps due to Neolithic Elamit (or Proto-Elamite) speakers from southern Iraq spdreading east-wards all the way to India.</p>
<p>But anyway, the point is, the Sumerians are most probably indeed an indigenous population, one continuous with with Neolithic farmers of the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>I do think it is sad your attempts to "steal" as it were, the Sumerians for "Persia" (strange you stating that they came from both Iran and northern Anatolia, which are quite a ways apart! And around 3000 b.c. you say? So they came to southern Iraq <i>after</i> they began their civilization? Quite amazing!).</p>
<p><br />
Further, while it is true that Arabians moved into parts of Iraq (and have for some centuries before Islam), there was no population displacement of the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>And what's this about Persians being descendants from the Elamites and Medes?! <a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMYLO_35f5.html" title="User:MYLO">MYLO</a> 09:05, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I cannot do your homework for you. In regards to the origin of Sumerians, Columbia Encyclopedia says, <b>``The questions concerning their origin cannot be answered with certainty. Some evidence suggests that they may have come as conquerors from the East (possibly from Iran or India)``</b> <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/su/Sumer.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/su/Sumer.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Furthermore, a scholar in his article titled `History of Iraq` says, <b>``the history of Mesopotamia began with the civilization of the Sumerians, who emigrated from the highlands of Iran and northern Anatolia in about 3000 BC``</b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/iraqinfo/sum/hist/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/iraqinfo/sum/hist/history.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. And, about Iraq being made into an Arab country after Arabs invaded Persia; Encyclopedia Britanicca confirms it <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-22936?query=sumerians&amp;ct=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-22936?query=sumerians&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Finally about Elams being one of earliest people to be in Iran, Encyclopedia Britannica says it is so <a href="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363508" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363508" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Keep in mind; the relationship between Elams, Medes, and Iranians is very much like that of Germans and Austrians. However, the difference is, 4000 years ago, all these tribes, and later Scythians being added to them, formed the country of Iran. Unfortunately, problems arise due the fact that some may have their own biased views, as well as the fact that in the West, Persia is mistakenly the name used for ancient Iran; see Discussion in Persia.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 05:25, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is no need to confuse the distinct groups, even if the modern peoples are descended from a mixture of all of them. And additionally, as I have repeatedly stated to no avail, this particular article is strictly about ONE CITY, the city is not know nto have existed after 275 BC when the inhabitants were deported by the Seleucids, and the story of that city (and this article) really ends there. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 19:36, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't change the languages to fit your views. The languages are all well known, and were not related. One is Semitic (Babylonian), one is Indo-European (Persian), and Elamite and Sumerian are totally different again. They were four separate countries, four separate ethnicities, not even existing at the same time frame. Nothing in Columbia Encyclopedia, which you seem to be twisting to your own ends, can possibly trump everything that is known by experts about these peoples and languages.

Sumerians may have not existed simultaneously as Persians; however, they may have been the ancestor of Iranians. <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elamites.html" title="Elamites">Elamites</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medes.html" title="Medes">Medes</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persians</a> existed simultaneously and were very much close in their ethnicities. <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elamites.html" title="Elamites">Elamites</a> lived in what is today southwest <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>--whom incidentally is the neighboring state of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pars.html" title="Pars">Pars</a>, i.e., <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> in latin, the state from which the first Persian dynasty, <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaemenids.html" title="Achaemenids">Achaemenids</a>.

Bottom line; these ethnicities were the ancestor of modern Iranians, which you try feverishly to deny. Again, In regards to the origin of Sumerians, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Encyclopedia_b1be.html" title="Columbia Encyclopedia">Columbia Encyclopedia</a> says, <b>``The questions concerning their origin cannot be answered with certainty.

<p>I remember once walking into an Iranian book store, here in Los Angeles, and seeing them sell various miniature of various Assyrian and Mesopotamian artifacts, like a statue of Sennacharibe and Sargon and Great and the winged bull figures. When I asked the owner why they are selling Mesopotamian artifacts, she actually told me that these are all really Iranian! That the Assyrian Empire was as much Persian as "Iraqi"! This clearly shows the extent to which modern national animosities have influenced perceptions of history.</p>
<p>Let me repeat what I said before, there is no evidence of Sumerians coming from anywhere but Iraq. You cited sourced, and so did I. I got mine from books I read, which I already mentioned. If you want me to quote from the books I have here, I will gladly do so, but I'm sure you can find them yourself.</p>
<p>Further, as I already clearly stated, the pattern of neolithic migration shows that humans migrated <i>out of</i> the Fertile Crescent starting from around 10,000 years ago, and onwards for several thousand years afterwards. This is a fact, proven by both archeology and genetics. From a modenr geographic stand-point, that means people went from "Iraq" to "Iran", not the other way around.</p>
<p>And about the link you provided, ask yourself a simple question: how can Sumerians have come from both the Iranian plateau, <i>and</i> northern Anatolia?! Two areas far apart? And how can they have come into southern Mesopotamian in 3000 b.c. when their civilization began beofre that, and has clear and proven precedant in earlier cultures?</p>
<p>Were there some cultural ties with the Iranian plateau? Yes, as there was with Anatolia, and Syria, but that is to be expected with the rise of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent, and the spread of peoples (and cultures) from there on out-wards, as well as later purely cultural influenced. As humans spread form the Fertile Crescent out-wards, they took their language and culture with them, which would explain the Elamite-Dravidian connection(unless you want to tell me that the Elamites must therefore have come from southern India?). There were pre-Sumerian Mesopotamian Ubaid cultural artifacts in eastern Arabia, should I take this proof that the Ubaid peoples were originally from eastern Arabia then?</p>
<p>Also, it should be pointed out that the land of Elam is technically part of the Mesopotamian low-land. You have only to look at a map, and you will see that while Elam is contiguous with southern Mesopotamia, it is seperated from the Iranian plateau by the Zagros mountains. That Elam was later taken over by Persians, and is today part of the nation of Iran, is true, but means nothing, like with the Syrian-Iraqi, or Syrian-Turkish borders.</p>
<p>I don't think that the lack of similarities between the various languages should point to differing ethnic origins. Afterall, back in paleolithich and mesolithic times, the human population density was fairly small, so that people who are living i the same area, could develope langauges that evolve to be desimilar over time, but with the coming of agricluture and the growth of the human population in these areas, the speakers of these languages grow as well, though perhaps some more than others (as may have been the case witht he speakers of Semitic in the Fertile Crescent, vis-a-vis speakers of Sumerian and Elamite, the latter of whome spread their langauge and elements of culture eastwards all the way to India).</p>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong. But from what I have read, both in books on Mesopotamian history, Near Eastern history, as well as genetic/linguistic studies (specifically the works of Cavalli-Sforza), there seems to have been in the region of today's Iraq, Syria/Palestine, south-western Iran, and south-eastern Turkey, a human population which, like in other parts of the world, made up of hunter-gatherers living ins mall population densities, probably speaking various languages that evolved differently over time. Then with the coming of agriculutre in the Fertile Crescent, the people's there grew in number, and began spreading out from the region in all direction, a process that continued for thousands of years, taking their language and culture with them.</p>
<p>Eventually, some of these peoples living in the origin-zone evolved urban centers and civilizations, which would influence neighboring regions as well.</p>
<p>That's not to say that <i>cultural</i> influences only spread from the Fertile Crescent out-wards, since things like pottery designs have no boundaries (I belive that neolithic migrants to Europe were themselves influenced by some of the local mesolithic cultures), but that is not the same as major human migrations, which, atleast from 10,000 years ago on-wards to maybe 6,000 or 5,000 years ago, tended to be from the Fertile Crescent outwards.</p>
<p><br />
As for the Arabs in Iraq. Your link itself clearly states "The Arab conquests of the 7th century brought about the Arabization of central and southern Iraq." Yes, there was Arabian migration into Iraq, as into Syria and other areas (including eastern Iran), not just during the 7th and 8th centuries, but even before. But to say, as you seem to be implyingf, that somehow the local population of Iraq somehow disappeared and was replaced by one of Arabian ancestory, is silly.</p>

<p>I don't know what this nationalist cruft is doing on this talkpage, but it could definitely do with a more civil tone. Yes there is continuity between the Elamites and the Persians, there have been endless debates about that on <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elamite_Empire_2aeb.html" title="Elamite Empire">Elamite Empire</a>. I don't know about "ancient ties to the Sumerians" though, but that is completely irrelevant to the topic anyway. Babylon was under Persian rule for 200 years, and if you have information concerning the city during this time, it will be welcome.

<p>What I put in was history with dates, not some meaningless statements about "world power" this and that.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Absolutely not; Persia is the word that should be used, such that it is the name of the country that is used in association with Babylon, and not the name of the dynasty. It now seems very clear that you have some prejudices about Persia, since you call the factual statements ``nonesense. Next time I will report you to the Wikipedia boardroom.

<p>What was the empire's name? Was it not "Achaemenian"? Is this not how it is refered to in most history books? When people refer to Baghdad's early-medieval empire, do they say "Abbasid" or "Arab"? Do peolpe say "Qin" and "Song" and "Tang" dynasties, or do they say "Chinese Empire I", "Chinese Empire II" and so on? Are you afraid that if you don't say "Persian" then some how people won't credit Persia for it?</p>
<p>And Persia is not the name of the country used in association with Babylon, rather it is "Mesopotami" or "Iraq". Get your geography straight.</p>
<p>Report me? Is that a threat? I'm not using Wiki entires as nationalism propganda.</p>

Persia is the country mentioned often in the Old and the New Testament , because the Jews were freed by Persians. And, Iraq did not even exist at that time genius. But, I guess you are playing tune def. <a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 07:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, "Persia" didn't exist during the Sumerians, but that didn't stop you from harping on and on on their supposed connection.</p>
<p>And what do the Jews have anything to do with this?</p>

<p>It is like going in circles with you. Jews do matter, because many know Babylon from the Old Testament, when it was under Persia. And, what does it have to with Sumerians? We are simply discussing the `Babylon under Persia` section, and not the `Babylon and Sumerians` section. It is amazing what being biased does to one`s preception of historical events.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 07:41, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>WHo said that most people know Babylon through the Old Testament? Maybe a hundred years ago, but not today.</p>
<p>And if you want to mention the Old testament, then Babylon is first mentioned in connection with the neo-Babylonian (Chaldean) Epire, not the Achaemenian Empire.</p>
<p>"And, what does it have to with Sumerians?"?? Do you even read what you write? Maybe you should scroll up to the begining of this topic, and read what you wrote.</p>
<p>I'm not biased. I couldn't care less what anyone believes. There are people out there who believe that Aryans were blond Germans who built world civilization. There are people who believe that msot of the ancient civilization were black. There are people who believe that space aliens built the Pyramids. Anynone can believe what they want, just don't put it on Wikipedia!</p>
<p>You want to talk about bias, maybe you should read what you wrote in the main page. Harping on and on about Cyrus and the Jews, and "world power"....what does this have anything to do with the history of Babylon? Put that in that "Cyrus" page and the "Jewish Exile" page, not here.</p>
<p>Again, you're using that section of the "Babylon" page for your own nationalist agenda. I'm not. I'm trying to just put in facts.</p>

Well, since all these events hapenned in Babylon, it [does] matter. And, We are simply discussing the `Babylon under Persia` section, and not the `Babylon and Sumerians` section. We are talking only about one section. And, adding two lines to a section is ``Harping on and on about Cyrus and the Jews``? Do not let your biaseness come in the way of necessary facts that need to be mentioned in association with Babylon. Facts from <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> quotes are a far cry from ``People believe in aliens too`` comment that you made. <a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 08:23, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, exactly, there is no "Babylon and Sumerians" section, but there IS a `Babylon under Persia` section, and this discussion is only limited to the latter section. You cannot twist or play with words to push a political or social agenda in Wikipedia--only facts are allowed here. And, there is nothing that is not factual or irrelevant in the `Babylon under Persia` section. You cannot change Persia into the Achaemenid dynasty in the heading, because the former is the universally recognized title, and the latter is an obscure title for many, which is the name of the dynasty. There IS NO `Achaemenid Empire`, yet, there IS the Persian Empire. Mention the name of the dynasty of that era somewhere in the section, not in the heading.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 21:52, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yes, it is about Babylon; however, simply adding some facts under `Babylon under Persia` section, which is the most celebrated time of Babylon, e.g., numerous mentions in the Old and New Testmant, is ``nonesense``?

<p>I'm sure wherever he is right now, Hammurabi would be surprised that his city's "most celebrated" period was under the rule of the Achaemenians!</p>
<p>How am I trying to undermine it? I merely presented dates and facts. Things like "world power" is not fact, and more importantly, not relevant. As for scientific growth, there is no evidence of that. Most of Mesopotamia's achievements occured earlier.</p>

<p>Well, all the Encyclopedias say Persia was the first global empire, and at its time was ``the preeminent power of the world``. But, I guess you don`t believe in such refrences.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 07:12, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Persia" wad the land from which the "Achaemenid" dynasty established it's empire.</p>
<p>Same thing with the "influence the Greek" part. It's not relevant to this page, and is more appropriate to a page devoted to "Mesopotamian sciences" for example.</p>
<p>And the refernces to Sumerians means nothing, regardless of how true or false it is. Sumerians had nothing to do with Babylon anyway.</p>

<p>Alexander`s case is different. He did not have ties to Babylon, and did not rule it for two centuries.

<p>You don't seem to understand. It has nothingt o do with "persia" or not, rather it has to do with the name of the empire which we are talking about, which is commonly called "Achaemenian", not "Persian", since "Persian" refers to the country, which had another empire later on (the Sassanids).</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>

<p>The empire is called the Persian Empire, and Achaemenid was the dynasty. The British Empire is known just as that, and not by the name of the dynasties that ruled it. You are doing your best to not include the word and any mentions about Persia.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 07:46, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The British Empire is called that, because there weren't multiple empires like with Persia (Achaeminids and Sassanids).</p>
<p>Why don't you type in "Persian Empire" in Wikipedia, and see what you get. It's not the Achaeminid Empire, just an over-all history of Persia. Now type in "Achaeminid Empire" and see what you get. Yes, many use "Persian Empire", but msot use "Achaeminid Empire", to distinguish it from the Sassanid Empire, which was also Persian.</p>
<p>As for me not wanting to use the word "Persia", go back and read what I wrote in the main article, I clearly wrote "Persian Achaeminids". You really think that people don't know that the Acheaminids" were Persian? And if not, then they probably will find out once they look it up.</p>
<p>You don't see arabs running to replace "Abbasids" with "ArabS" lest people not know that the Abbasids were Arabs. And the same with the Chinese and the Tang, Song, Chin, etc...</p>

<p>We are talking about the empire here, not the country. If we were simply talking about the land,t hen let us use "Persia", but here this article is about Babylon, and in that section is discussed Babylon's counquest by the Achaeminids. And who said msot readers as familiar with "Persian Empire" and not "Achaeminid Empire"? If they know one they will know the other.</p>
<p>And what will any suer who read this, and wishes to learn more about this "Persian Empire" find when he goes to the "Persian Empire" article? He'll find not an article about that specific empire, the Achaeminid, but rather just a general history of Persia.</p>
<p>But let us suppose it is "Persian Empire", then why not write the section title as "Persian Period"? Why this "Babylon and Persia" as if this was about the relationship between the two lands, when it is really abou the Empire's conquest of Babylon?</p>
<p>And you still haven't answered the relevance of Cyrus freeing the Jews to babylonian history?</p>

<dd>The Jews lived "by the rivers of Babylon" (the city) when they were in exile, so it's relevant as an anecdote to the time period that is most familiar to most people. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 16:58, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then it should be included in the "Jewish Exile" article (if there is one), or under the "Neo-Babylonian" section, or even write create a new section about the "Jewish Exile" in this article.</p>
<p>But to include it in that particular section, just as a way to boast about Cyrus' magnanimity, is, I believe, irrelevant. This isn't the Cyrus article.</p>

<dd>That's a pretty weak argument, actually. Just because not everyone who visits the article reads the Bible, means it cannot be mentioned -- even when it's directly relevant to the subject? I guess by that logic, we'd have to totally delete the article <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_in_the_Judeo-Christian_tradition_3812.html" title="Cyrus in the Judeo-Christian tradition">Cyrus in the Judeo-Christian tradition</a>, because some non Bible readers might accidentally click on it and be offended; and let's not leave out the article <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_the_Great_in_the_Qur%27an_e1f5.html" title="Cyrus the Great in the Qur'an">Cyrus the Great in the Qur'an</a>, that might offend non-readers of the Quran... The Babylonian captivity IS quite relevant to this article about the city, Babylon, and mention of the famous decree ending it DOES belong in this section with Cyrus, and not anywhere else... but anyway, thanks for the compliment! <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 19:57, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had changed "global empire" to "world empire" because this article about the city of Babylon is repeatedly getting stuffed with Persian Jingoism. I see it has now been changed yet again to "global empire". I was skeptical that Persian possessions ever spanned the globe, even if this is relevant to the city of Babylon. At the link to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_empire.html" title="Global empire">global empire</a> I read:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A global empire involves the extension of a state's sovereignty over territories all around the world. The essential criterion demands that, when navigating around the world, the longest trip between the empire's possessions be half of the circumference of the planet. "Global" is therefore a function of longitude, not of latitude. For example, because of the Spanish Empire's territories around the globe, it was often said in the 16th century that "the sun never sets on the Spanish Empire." This phrase was later applied to the Russian Empire and British Empire.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Now when I look at a globe, I do not see the distance in longitude from Egypt and Greece in the West to India in the East spanning anywhere near half the circumference of the globe. So for that reason I must question why Persia, Macedonia, and Rome are listed as "Global" empires on that article. But more to the point of THIS article, why must this bit of unnecessarily jingoistic padding be mentioned at all in an article about BABYLON THE CITY??? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 13:35, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, wouldn't you know it, when I investigate at that article further, I see User Zmmz has been editing it in the last few hours. Notwithstanding the opening definition that I copied above, he actually went in and changed a list of "early Empires that were <b>not</b> global" to read that "Persia was the first global Empire". It remains to be explained exactly what sense of the word "global" he considers Persia to have ever attained at any point in the history of man.

<dd>I know, I know; I guess the point is whether contemporary authors describe it as such. Or whether it is monopolar, i.e. the Byzantines were certainly aware of both the Franks and the Sassanids (and vice versa). The Egyptians were aware of the Hittites and the Assyrians. In Achaemenid times, for a short time, there was really just Persia and the outskirts of Persia. I guess that amounts to "Superpower" if that wasn't too modern a term. I daresay this is all quibbling and "Empire" (which already entails "largish") is a good enough description even for the Achaemenids. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:55, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please note that "preeminent power of the world at the time" does not include the world "global". Nor does a paragraph on a gamer fansite constitute what "Historians say."

'Local empire' is not a term I'd use -- plainly the Persian empire <i>was</i> the greatest the world had seen at that point, just as the Assyrian empire that preceeded it was the greatest seen <i>at that point</i>, and Alexanders was greater than the Persian Empire when it succeeded it. None of these, however, was a "global" empire in any reasonable sense of the word.</dd>

<dd>Okay, one of us here is making an assertion without attributing it, and the other is asking for attribution. Here's what we do: you go find a source that says Persia was a "global empire" <i>anywhere</i>, then paste in a quotation from that source without accidentally sneaking the word "global" into it, and then link to the exact page of the website or page number of the book where you got it. Then I check your attribution and say "Wow, Zmmz is right -- I had no idea that Darius colonized the West Indies and the Phillipines. Guess you learn something new every day!" I back up your assertion, and lend my voice to yours in explaining to other editors why Persia was really a Global empire before tranoceanic navigation. This won't be too hard, since armed with the attribution, the preponderance of evidence will be on your side, and the discussion will move on to more productive things.</dd>

<dd>I don't think anyone would question those things, but 'global' means it went more than halfway around the globe, which it didn't... And I've never seen any sources alleging that it covered any land in what is now Nepal, but perhaps you have different books where you live... At any rate, how big a deal do we really need to make of this in an article about this city? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 22:44, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Couple of important responses: one; the Allempires.com is [not] a "gamers" web site. It is a legitimate, highly acclaimed web-site/web-community that has <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholars.html" title="Scholars">scholars</a> ranging from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a> to ancient civilizations historians from <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">University</a> for example, contributing to its articles. Sorry, but some people may be playing too much video games, and doing less reading. Secondly, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> [was] a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Empire_dec1.html" title="Global Empire">Global Empire</a>, since at the time it ruled over the much of the then known world. With the exception of mainland Greece, and a few other countries, there were [no] other states or civilized lands that the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a> did not cover. Furthermore, we cannot apply the world global in its planetary definition here. Also, it literally had no rivals for two centuries. Yet, because some erroneously insist the words <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Empire_dec1.html" title="Global Empire">Global Empire</a>, should not be used here, then you may leave that of the article. However, as I have proved via many references--there is an over-whelming consensus among Western historians that <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> was the world’s first <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super.html" title="Super">Super</a>-<a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">Power</a>; an entity not seen in the history till then. I sincerely believe that since this was a milestone event in history--and that as a consequence it heavily impacted the Greeks, as well as other civilizations, and because for the first time in history, most of the civilized world, nomads and alike were unified under one nation, the outcome of future history itself was affected. As such it is [necessary] to mention this in the article, since Babylon--the "CITY"-- was intimately tied to the empire. As one of the foremost respected <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholars.html" title="Scholars">scholars</a> in ancient history Robert Payne said in his book, "The Persian Empire swallowed up the Babylonian and Assyrian Empires, and went beyond them. It was the greatest empire the world had ever known, and for two centuries its capital was the capital of the world."<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5646/splendor1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5646/splendor1.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.

Please do not take it upon yourself to edit that section, unless you provide a valid reason, backed with multiple sources that proves the words--world’s first <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super.html" title="Super">Super</a>-<a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">Power</a>--are irrelevant to this article.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 02:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>why are we discussing terms for the Persian Empire here</b>? The city of Babylon, the subject of this article, was part of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a> for 200 years. Period. Whatever the Persian Empire may or may not have been is beside the point here, and to be discussed on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersian_Empire_b479.html" title="Talk:Persian Empire">Talk:Persian Empire</a>.

<p>I hope everone agrees with the new sentences I recently inserted in the Babylon under Persia section. It states, ``Overall the city being the administrative capital of the Persian Empire (the preeminent power of the then known world), played a vital part in the history of that region for over two centuries. Today, many important archeological discoveries are being made that can provide a better understanding of that era, not only in regards to the role of Babylon and the Persian Empire, but perhaps the history of its earlier inhabitants as well [1][2].`` If not let me know please.<a href="../../../z/m/m/User%7EZmmz_afc7.html" title="User:Zmmz">Zmmz</a> 00:23, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am Iraqies and I am sorry that my English language is not very good but I must say that under the rule of Persia, Babylon lost it's glorify becuase there were many rebellion and Persian dealing with it very violent and Darius III destroy the tower of babylon and all historians agree that the ruin of babylon start with the Persia occupation ( Babylon lost there independence ) and the heavy taxs exhaust the city. it's silly idea that Babylon get it's glorify under the rule of Persia, Babylon get glorify under the rule of it's kings like Hamorabi and Nebuchadrezzar and they were not Persian ( all historians agree that they were Amorites ( Semitic) ). I am sorry because I see the Summerain and Babylonian and Assyrian pages and there is many peoples claim that they are the inheritors of this nations but do you knew who are the relly inheritors of this civilizations? It's the poor Shia people how live in the south Iraq marshs they live like there grandfather in the same cane houses and in the same place.

<i>Joan Oates claims in her book 'Babylon' that the rendering "Gateway of the Gods is no longer accepted by modern scholars. The noted American linguist I.J.

<p>Ok, I've yanked this out entierly because it doesn't belong where it was put and needs to be cleaned up, and also needs the attention of an expert. I for one actually adhere to some variant of the idea that Babylon is an echo of a more ancient city by a similar name, so don't go screaming at me about bias against the data (Sorry if that seems a little curt, but It's happened before, frequently), this cannot, however, go on the main page until such time as it is cleaned up, cited, and wikified. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 01:06, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This sentence <i>The noted American linguist I.J.

   How Babylon has become An object of horror among the nations!

<pre>
   51:20 He says, "You are My war-club, My weapon of war; And with you I shatter nations,
   And with you I destroy kingdoms.

   51:42 "The sea has come up over Babylon; She has been engulfed with its tumultuous waves.

<p>I don't have a source in front of me right now, but I'm quite certain that Babylon existed well into the first few centuries AD. It was very small of course, but it was a center of jewish scholarship and the place where the babylonian talmud was written. Futhermore, while it's probable that Babylon in the NT is code for Rome, it is not a universally accepted fact.
