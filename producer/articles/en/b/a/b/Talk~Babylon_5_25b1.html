<p>Before you create your own B5 wiki, you may want to consult with Steve Grimm, who runs <a href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html" class="external text" title="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html" rel="nofollow">The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5</a>. That web site is a highly comprehensive guide to the series, and a wiki would be largely redundant to it. I think he should be contacted anyway about maybe bringing his episode info pages into this Wikipedia to fill in the B5 episode articles which exist here (somebody went to a LOT of trouble to create an article here for every episode, but they're all far too stubby). <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 03:43, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Has anyone followed up with the suggestion above, now over six months old, about merging the content of the <a href="http://www.mindwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mindwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html" rel="nofollow">The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5</a> into Wikipedia? It is an outstanding resource, and I'd like to see its content mirrored if for no other reason than to preserve it. I'm a big fan and Wikipedian, and I'd love to help with the transfer, but obviously this content is copyrighted and a license needs be secured. Anyone? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 01:02, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, that project has since collapsed. Wikia wants someone to adopt it. I am thinking about it. However, I need to fill two volunteer positions before I start.
<ul>
<li>The "Artistic Manager" would be in charge of the site theme. This would include the logos, CSS files, style of all templates, and all copyright issues. This person may want to delegate some of those responsibilities. To apply, please state what you use for editing PNG, JPG, and MPG files. (Unlike Wikipedia, I do not believe that OGG has enough players.) Also, can you create SVG files? How about <a href="../../../a/p/n/APNG_d204.html" title="APNG">APNG</a> files? (That is a animated version of PNG where the first frame is stored where all PNG parsers can see it. Subsequent frames can be ignored by parsers that only understand single frame PNG files.)</li>
<li>The "Promotion Manager" would be responsible for telling the world about our wiki without anything that might be thought of as spam or, on Wikipedia, vandalism. It would help if you do sales for a living.</li>

<p>I think technomages should have their own page and should be mentioned more here. Anyone feel the same way?</p>
<dl>
<dd>If someone decides to discuss technomages, it should be done within the Crusade sub-section. A paragraph should suffice. The technomages were marginal in B5. As far as I can remember, they were only present in 1 episode, and perhaps mentioned a few times by the Centauri. <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEDGE_3e36.html" title="User:EDGE">EDGE</a> 03:47, Sep 22, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>

<p>66.255.108.148 mentions in his edit that babylon 4 has a propulsion system? Does anyone have a refrence of where this is mentioned? I'm 99% positive it's not in any of the 5 seasons of B5 or Crusade or any of the movies. I'm not doubting you per-se, I just am curious.</p>

<p>I know the main plan was for 5 seasons. However, did that plan limit the producers to just that many? Most series are open ended in that they continue until ratings fall or someone gets tired of the series (like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_James_Elliott_2880.html" title="David James Elliott">David James Elliott</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/g/JAG_5cc6.html" title="JAG">JAG</a>).--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Pittenger_1026.html" title="User:Will Pittenger">Will</a> 07:52, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's the thing, B5 was not open ended. It was planed for 5 seasons, that's all. Many of the plot likes could have theoretically continued in the spin-off series, Crusade and Legend of the Rangers. However, Crusade only ran for 13 episodes and Rangers never made it past the pilot movie. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 19:32, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stracszynski said from day one (as I witnessed first hand at a very small huddle at a convention in 1995) that Babylon 5 itself had a 5 year span, and no more, but that at the end of it all there would be one core item that might itself be the basis of a series, and he is reported to have said the same consistently on a number of separate occasions before and after that conversation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At that time he refused point blank to elaborate further, but most people assume that the "one issue" was the Drakh (and their revenge), which ultimately led to Crusade which had a much more open-ended and episodic format. Clearly this wasn't altogether true, however, because there have been several films, and an attempt at another related series after the failure of Crusade. It is possible that with Crusade being canned so early in its run and surely greater issues than just the Earth's predicament to be unveiled, Legend of the Rangers was going to draw on the same story material and make some effort to replace the former. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 20:07, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's funny that I missed this section. First off: about the sixth season. Straczynski discussed it at one point, and in fact, I just added that note to the article about the DVD series recently. He had discussed the idea in 1996 of doing a sixth season that would be an anthology show, following individual characters in non-arc stories. Seems that now, he's got his wish.</p>
<p>Also, note that the hook that Straczynski had talked about certainly seemed to me, at the time, to be much more significant than the Drakh turned out to be. My guess is that he was referring to the overall idea that the first ones packed their bags and left in a relative hurry, and there would be consequences. The Drakh are certainly an element of those consequences, but I would be surprised if they were the only element that was to be explored in Crusade. If you're curious, you can always ask him. He still responds to posts on the B5 newsgroup. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 04:07, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right. The Drakh plague was to be just one part that was going to be explored in Crusade, and was to be resolved in the first year or two of the series already. However, there would be behind the scenes political machinations going on at earth, and left over shadow tech at other places that was being abused, after which everything was going to spin out of control again. It would've been interesting.

<p>One of the main themes of B5 seems to be missing from the themes section. This missing theme is (roughly stated): "How Races of Vastly Different Levels of Evolution Interact With Each Other." The show deals extensively with how advanced races (Vorlons, Shadows, First Ones) interact with less advanced races (Humans, Minbari, etc.) An idea often mentioned is that ants are to humans just as humans are to Vorlons. Is this show primary about light vs. dark, or is it about possible scenarios that can occur when races of vastly different tech levels co-exist? Personally I believe it is the latter, and other themes such as light vs. dark and order vs. chaos are particulars of this main theme. The Shadow War resulted in Vorlons and Shadows abandoning their fight and letting the primitive races learn things for themselves. To me this is not about light vs. dark or order vs. chaos. It's about how very advanced races choose to deal with the primitive races; in this case, letting the primitive races evolve on their own. I wonder how the rest of you think about this. It would also be very interesting to know how JMS thinks about this.75.84.83.99</p>
<p>I wanted to post here that my intentions are good in my edits to the theme section of the article. I've come across some problems with the sub-sections, and so I'm going to adress the major ones here and hopefully the minor ones are clear (I've removed some of the more obvious OR). I've also tried to make it more prose friendly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Authoritarianism vs. chaos" section currently is all over the place. While it rightly mentions the first two questions: "Who are you?" and "What do you want?", the third one (and the vague 'unknown' 4th) don't fit at all in the context of "light vs. dark". I've removed the rest because it just didn't meld properly. If the Theme was reworked entirely into "Questions", then it could fit.</li>
<li>While I'm trying to keep a NPOV in my edits, I just don't personally see how "Fighting the system" is a core theme, when most of the attributes take form in any other, especially the "Light vs. Dark" or "War and Peace" sections. If I'm wrong on this please add this section back in.</li>
<li>The "War and Peace" section can completely do without the timeline. While it is helpful, it's something that breaks the entire flow of the section, and would be better without it in my opinion as the text can speak for itself on the subject without needing extra explanation.</li>
</ul>
<p>References still need to be added, but I hope that these changes are viewed as positive changes, and if anyone has any questions I'd be happy to discuss them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 05:38, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also should ask, is this page about Babylon 5 the series, or Babylon 5 the franchise? If it's supposed to be more focused on the series, then perhaps the Spin-off, Novel..., and especially the video game sections should be reduced masively, as more attention should be focused at least on the series at hand, of which the "Novel" section would be important, but the video game section (of which no offical video games have ever been released) and the spin-off section (which should have a more concise explanation of the spin-offs) should have some work done to reduce the size a bit to make it more clear and in keeping with the article's focus. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 06:16, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Again, in terms of the overall series, how notable is the "Ethnicity and language of characters" as well as the "Usage of English"? Personally I'd feel they're pretty low on the notablility of the series, and the article probably should give these sections less weight and probably could be handled in two well written paragraphs total. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 06:58, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"References still need to be added…". I think this sums up the basic problem of the plague of "theme" sections for TV-show articles: they're <b>all</b> original research. That's not to say they don't have accurate information in them, or even that some of it is known to have been discussed by the creators, players, and reviewers. It's that <b>no one ever sources</b> what are clearly original essays on these subjects. Editors just write what they think they know or see on the screen, completely ignoring one of the most important policies of Wikipedia: <b><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a></b>.

<dd>I agree. Find a source first, then write it. Same is true for a lot of the other sections here though, although most aren't as susceptible to OR as a a 'themes' section. E.g. the trap door section has no sources (and does need a bit of a rewrite), but can be fairly easily salvaged, so I wouldn't suggest outright deleting the poorly sources non-themes sections. (I was able to find sources for the trap door section with relative ease, although I haven't had time yet to properly rewrite that section and integrate the sources I found: <a href="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-1299&amp;query=trap%20door" class="external autonumber" title="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-1299&amp;query=trap%20door" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-12410&amp;query=trap%20door" class="external autonumber" title="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-12410&amp;query=trap%20door" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-12205&amp;query=trap%20door" class="external autonumber" title="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-12205&amp;query=trap%20door" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-15240&amp;query=trap%20door" class="external autonumber" title="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-15240&amp;query=trap%20door" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-3223&amp;query=trap%20door" class="external autonumber" title="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-3223&amp;query=trap%20door" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-11544&amp;query=trap%20door" class="external autonumber" title="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-11544&amp;query=trap%20door" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-12195&amp;query=trap%20door" class="external autonumber" title="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-12195&amp;query=trap%20door" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-9044&amp;query=trap%20door" class="external autonumber" title="http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-9044&amp;query=trap%20door" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>).

The rest, while they may be "true", stink of Original Research and must go. I've copied the text and will probably try in the near future to find sources, but as is, it must go. The Trap Door part should be moved up in the page, <s>and perhaps the season episode section could be merged with the DVD section and have that be re-written a bit to more focus on the seasons/episodes (with notes to when they were released on DVD)</s>. It could make the article flow just a bit better (and be shorter). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 03:23, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After a discussion with <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a>, I'd like to bring this concern to a larger audience, since it affects the whole page. Babylon 5 is a TV show that lasted 5 seasons, and was almost entirely written by one man who liked to communicate directly with the public. This is, to say the least, unusual. Because of this, there <i>are</i> strong themes in the show which was written as a single story, not as episodes, and we <i>can</i> find sources for those themes. I would ask that, rather than simply deleting material, people seek sources or clarifications for what is here. For example, while the religion section was poorly written, it is key to the story of Babylon 5, and Straczynski makes it clear that it was an important theme for him. Cleaning up and sourcing that section was not much harder than deleting it, and doing so gives us a final article with more depth and more clarity.</p>
<p>Please, consider this as you edit. Thanks. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 18:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about a compromise when it comes to the Language issue. The way I see it now (after review) is that the "Usage of English" section should be renamed to just "Language" (or something to that effect) with all language parts moved there from the "Ethnicity and language" section into the <i>new</i> section. Distilling the less meaningful trivial information (the cases of guest characters speaking in a different accent), and making a strong section that covers all the various languages and their different accents, or what have you. Example: The "Earth language of commerce" is important, but the trivial mention of one character saying something in Spanish isn't (if you feel it is, I can just do the merge, and leave the actual language bits in until further discussions can be done). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 19:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Update: As I said, in retrospect, I see how language is important to the show. However, I don't see how (in the context of the entire show) how ethnicity is as important to the big picture (to a character yes, but not the entire arc), especially after previewing a edit I'm about to implement (to strengthen the Languages aspect before including citations). The section is now up in the "Concept" section (where it was about 5 days ago). I've kept almost all the language section intact, save very trivial sentences, and moved most of the accent/language parts from "Ethnicity and language" into the Languages section. I hope the changes are agreeable. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 20:57, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How many episodes have to touch on something for it to be important enough to fit your criteria? How much plot does it have to impact? Ivanova's background is fairly key to her character. Her Jewish and Russian heritage is revealed throughout the first season, and informs her character in obvious and subtle ways throughout the series. Why would you drop ethnicity as a subject? (For the record, first season shows that involved Ivanova's background: Midnight on the Firing Line, Born to the Purple, TKO, Eyes) -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 22:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It has to make enough of an impact to make sense adding it to the main article page. I'm not against any of her personal information making it on wikipedia in some form, just the location (I feel it fits best in her character's article). It is a matter of weighing the value of the information compared to the other information that is in the article. The ethnicity section was weighed down by mostly either language information and character summaries. Unfortunately, when you distill and <s>move</s> merge the information about language with the rest of the language information (It was mostly about what the auidence hears as English), the ethnicity section turned into just a character summary section. It shouldnt' belong on here, or we're looking at a 60K+ article length with mostly redundant information. I just want this article (as well as the other B5 articles) to be as clear and organized as possible. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 02:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The above discussion in this section demonstrate why sourcing is so important. People are arguing about their own opinions of what is important, rather than letting the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a>, that Harmil correctly says are available, determine what is considered important. Anything else is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. (Please read <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Some_definitions" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Some definitions</a> for explanation of why secondary is preferred to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary</a>, like the episodes themselves.) If we <i>start</i> with the sources, rather than grafting them on after we compose our own opinions, we don't need to argue about what's important.</p>
<p>Of course, we may miss some topics that some feel are important. But not everything that is "true" is necessarily suitable material for Wikipedia. To quote the very first line of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>." (Emphasis in the original, and the bold phrase is repeated twice in the article to make the point.)</p>
<p>As far as sourcing rather than removing, WP:V also includes <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#The_policy" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">the following policy</a>, again bold in the original:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources.</b></li>
<li><b>Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor.</b></li>
<li><b>The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>This is probably a practical guideline, based on the kind of work that our editors are likely to do. We <i>all</i> like to write; that's why we participate. Many of us like to do cleanup as well. This labor is cheap, even for the free-contribution market. Getting proper sources is much harder. Most sourcing efforts never extend beyond Google searches and discussion boards, which are also easy to add, even if they aren't <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. Very few editors take the time and trouble to get proper sources, especially if they're print. (When was the last time any of us went to a public library to check on something for WP?) Considering all this, <i>Babylon 5</i> editors have it <i>easy</i>. As Harmil points out, JMS was unusually interactive with the show's fans, and quite a bit of material is available electronically. The extent to which we haven't even bothered to collect these sources and use <i>them</i> to write the theme sections shows how much harder it is to get sourcing done properly than writing and cleanup.</p>
<p>Finally, even if we ignore the idea of starting with sources and simply <i>must</i> have the original-essay texts of the Theme section as a basis, that material will always be available in the history if someone finally gets around to backing it up with sources. Deleting this material (and keeping it deleted until good sources are collected and cited) is an excellent means to motivate us to do the job correctly. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 01:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ulch. Deletionism at its most refined, Look, I'm not saying that the cruft about true seekers was relevant (it's a phrase used in the show, but it was taken out of context here) or sourcable. However, you're mistaking an argument over what elements of the show make the grade for discussion on this page with some sort of desire to keep anything anyone has typed, forum-style. I'm certainly not in the latter camp, but when you just remove something such as the note that Straczynski, an atheist, specifically made religion a major theme of the show, you are removing an important element of the history behind the show, and there's no particular assurance that someone who knows better is going to notice that you've done so and fix it. No, it wasn't correctly sourced, and yes, it should have been tagged {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}. Why does deleting slowly (e.g. makring those things that need sources, and retiring them after some period of time) hurt the page, since these sections have been here for quite some time already anyway?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, on to the idea that external sources must be the only guide in developing an article. This is complete nonsense. I defy the adherent of this mantra to read <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a>'ths featured article, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> and explain to me how this showpiece of Wikipedia was guided by reliable sources only. It's a deeply non-notable subject (a side character in a children's video game series) and one on which there's no such thing as scholarly treatment. And so, we pick and we choose, and we debate notability of elements of the topic. When we are done debating, we prune and preen and dust and try to cite our sources as best as one can, given the topic. Now, B5 is a much richer ground for good sources, and that makes our job easier. However, the importance of Ivanova, for example, to the overall story is still questionable. You can still debate the inclusion of her background, and so we do. You won't find an article in Newsweek that will help you decide... you just have to make the call you think is right for Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 03:53, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hate to get nit-picky, but I just want to point out that the use of <i>JMSNews: The J. Michael Straczynski Message Archive</i> is something that I've been meaning to bring into question for a while. I have found a number of his postings to Usenet which the archive does not seem to contain, and the information in the headers is often WRONG (JMS posted from two different accounts to Usenet, one early on and one on AOL later, JMSNews only lists one address for all). A more reliable archive at this point is Google News, which is what I try to use for most of my citations of Usenet these days for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can get at the original message's format and headers</li>
<li>You can cite <i>conversation threads</i> as well as articles (this came in handy for citing a controversy in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl_6.html" title="Perl 6">Perl 6</a> development, recently).</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this helps. I'm not saying we <i>must not</i> use JMSNews, but perhaps if you're going to go looking for a source, you should consider something else first? -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 19:12, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that his accent is a somewhat strangled "British" accent, as first used by Dick Van Dyke in the film Mary Poppins.

<p>Right.</p>
<ul>
<li>"It was also the first sci-fi series to respect Newtonian physics in its space battle sequences, with particular emphasis placed on the effects of inertia." Do we have a source for this? I think a claim to be the first of anything needs to be backed up with a reasonably good source, particularly something like this where something obscure might have done it without most people realising.</li>
<li>Does "trap doors" belong so high up in the article? OK, <i>I</i> find it particularly interesting, because among other things I'm a writer and like to study the techniques used to write any fiction I enjoy. I don't suspect it's a priority for most people, though.</li>
<li>Similarly to the first point, if JMS really was the first to write a full season of TV shows, we need a better source than a newsgroup post for it. Newsgroups aren't <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for anything controversial, which such a claim may be. Or change the text to "Straczynski claims to be...". Or something.</li>
<li>Later in the same section: Talia's data crystal was either never used, or JMS used it in a short story. Both can't be true.</li>
<li>"Babylon stations" section: Might be nice to point out that the fates of the previous stations play into important themes in the series, i.e. sabotage by growing anti-alien sentiment on Earth &amp; more directly in the whole stealing B4 story arc.</li>
<li>"Themes": the introduction of the shadow &amp; vorlon questions could probably do with some explanation. Somebody who hasn't seen the show would probably have a WTF moment on reading that.</li>

<dd>Good suggestions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I seem to recall this being debated previously to no avail. Perhaps changing it to "one of the first"? In any case, we should find a source to back up this claim.</li>
<li>In one sense it does fit there because the previous paragraphs are about how B5 is a miniseries with a story that was complete from the beginning and the trap doors are related to that. However the way it is structured and the length of the section make the trap doors seem like one of the most critical aspects about the show. I would prefer it was later on in the article. Possibly as the third sub section of Original Series (#5), a sub section of Regular Cast (#2.1), or even in the Trivia section (#10).</li>
<li>What JMS was refering to didn't happen on screen. He had said that he had the entire history of the B5 universe planned out for at least a decade past when the series ended, so some of the things that happened viewers never saw. This part should be clarified to say that the data crystal was never reused in the television series after Kosh recorded it, even if JMS had created a storyline about it.</li>
<li>I think it is fine the way it is. We don't want to go into too much detail, especiall about B4. There are links to the episodes which feature B4, so the reader can go there for more information.</li>
<li>Agreed. It is pretty confusing the way it is now.</li>

<p>A few of my suggestions (to both JulesH and Koweja):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I have heard that it "respected" Newtonian Physics, but not that it was the "first" (also we aren't sure if it was "one of the first at all"). I'd say tag it with a citation notice for the time being.</li>
<li>I moved the "trap door" section there because it fit better there than elsewhere in the page (it used to be near the trivia). Personally, now I'm thinking it should probably be the last section of the "concept" section. I think the whole part needs an overhaull. Splitting the "concept" part (which is a bit vague) with a "production" section (which would include how the show "began" which the "internet marketing" section could easily be culled down to important facts and reintegrated) and then right below the section with the cast section second and then a "plot" section (which would contain the rest of the information about the station, the "universe", civilizations, "trap doors", and the "languages" section. (this would be closer to a format that is used by the wikipedia television project, and would make a lot more sense. Trap door and language sections needs to be edited down a bit.</li>
<li>Yes, a lot of information is not always good. People should not be using this article to substitute watching the show.</li>
<li>The theme section is really tough, but it's leaps and bounds better than just a few months ago.</li>

<p>Okay, here me out. I've been in the process of cleaning up a bunch of other Babylon 5 pages, when I finally got to looking at the aforementioned page that I noted in the header. There's already a page for Babylon 5 influences, so I propose that the information there should probably be moved into that article (the article currently needs a lot of work but that will come later). If that's done, currently all the information of the Internet marketing section is already in the main Babylon 5 article, so the article wouldn't really be necessary. I'd love to have some input on this matter before I tag anything or are too bold in my editing.

<dd>I think the articles are fine as they are, and don't need to be merged. It's nice to have all the fan influences in one place, which keeps them from spilling over into articles where they might not belong. Also, the main list of influences focuses on story and stylistic influences on the show, while the list on the fan influences page is more weighted to the production side. A merge would be misguided, IMO. - <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurekaLott_6975.html" title="User:EurekaLott">EurekaLott</a> 00:01, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see where you are coming from, but don't really see what you see with the influences page. I see it as a conglomeration of a lot of different topics, and some of the trivia points on the internet marketing page are tenious at best on that list as is. Perhaps a re-write of the section is in order before any final decision (re-writing it into prose), as it may turn out that it isn't sutable for the influences page, and would be more sutable in a truncated form on the main article (Franke triva into music section, and so on). I'll take a closer look at it later to form a better opinion. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 02:26, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The article needs to exist as a stand-alone article. I could see a good argument for re-naming it, and it certainly needs to be expanded, but Straczynski's 12-year-long direct interaction with fans over Genie, Compuserve, Usenet and AOL has been so unusual in Hollywood that even today, in the age of blogging, very few television writers or producers have such an extensive interaction with the public (<a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Ellis_25d7.html" title="Warren Ellis">Warren Ellis</a> comes to mind, though his series, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Frequency_4040.html" title="Global Frequency">Global Frequency</a>, was canceled before it aired). That history spans the various elements of the Babylon 5 franchise, and most of Straczynski's other work (comics, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremiah_%28TV_series%29_0c91.html" title="Jeremiah (TV series)">Jeremiah</a>, etc.) There's just too much history and influence in both directions for that to be a footnote in <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a>.

<dd>If that's the decision, then the article really needs to be renamed and some serious work needs to be put into expanding the article since most (if not all of the information currently) could be easily integrated into the main article without any loss of meaning. The page needs to either be about the internet marketing, or be about the fan influence, or a totally different title needs to be used that would include the two in a more cohesive (and logical) way. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 04:56, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"Babylon 5 influences" is about the background material from which Babylon 5 draws, not the impact that feedback had on the show. If anything that's more suited to the "Babylon 5's use of the Internet" article, but again, I'm agreeing that it's currently not terribly well constructed (no section should be a pure bullet-list unless it's an appendix like "See also" or "References"). -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 17:17, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:Jet7111 keeps changing Ardwight Chamberlain, voice of Kosh, to regular cast. As he is never listed in the main credits, I assert that he is a recurring character. However, before I run afoul of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, I want to understand the greater consensus.

<dl>
<dd>Is there a Wikipedia wide policy on what defines someone as regular cast vs recurring? I believe that as far as studios, the writers'/actors' guilds are concerned, they have to be in the credits to be considered regular cast (I recall JMS saying sometime on the Lurker's Guide how importaint it was where in the credits people were placed). However, wikipedia obviously isn't bound by those policies. If we aren't going with that definition, then I don't see why he couldn't count as regular cast. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 03:29, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that being listed in the main credits is an important part of being in the "Regular" cast. Most episodes didn't have Chamberlain. I fail to see how his appearances warrant that designation (and the idea of a Vorlon being described as "regular" is...) --<a href="../../../e/y/r/User%7EEyrian_d64b.html" title="User:Eyrian">Eyrian</a> 04:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>WP's task is to document fact, not re-assess it. I can't remember the cut-off but the distinction between regular and recurring is based on the proportion of episodes cast members appear in during any given season. Chamberlain does not, and did not at the time, fulfill those criteria. He definitively was <i>not</i> a member of the "regular" cast. It's black and white. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 12:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've changed some tenses in the introductory paragraphs to reflect the proper use of present tense to represent works of fiction as they exist in the real world. <i>Babylon 5</i> <b>is</b> a television series, just as "<i><a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</a></i> <b>is</b> a tragedy by William Shakespeare". It is appropriate (and necessary) to use past tense when discussing events in the show's production and other history — including its airing schedule — but that does not change the fact that the show exists and can be seen as easily as one can pick up a copy of <i>Hamlet</i> to read. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 19:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair comment. It was just that the prior edit changed the tense of the first sentence making it inconsistent with the rest of the paragraph and (I thought) other references later in the article.

<dd>I don't agree. Although you can discuss if the list of similarities was original research or not, the rest was not more original research than most articles on Wikipedia. Even the list was only a comparison of two original sources. Every article that quote from more than one source is a comparision of sources. Anyway, at least the fact of the wide discussion about the similarities should at least mentioned somewhere in an article of B5 (and DS9). --Lasttan 20:52, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello I think there is one misconception in it about Vorlons. Vorlons were not at all authoritarian and the question "who you are" is completely misperceived by the writer of this article.</p>
<p>This is prooved by the bery Episode in Babylon 5 series where a vorlon questioned one woman. She said that she is what her duties and ranks are but all these questions were wrong. and she got punished for that. The meaning of vorlons was "what you are without your names and positiongs and designation?" I request this point be overviewed as I am damn sure by looking on this episode that the point is greatly missed thus making the whole "Authoritarianism vs. anarchy; order vs. chaos; light vs. dark" chapter a blog. 213.35.239.31 20:55, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, this article has been written by many editors, and I'm sure that even the section you refer to has had many contributors. Second, the material is supposed to be backed up by sources, not simply speculations or analyses of the editors. There <i>is</i> room for improvement here, as the last two paragraphs have no cited sources. Finally, I believe you are reading too much into a specific plot, namely the "risk all for one" theme of "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Comes_the_Inquisitor_9f7c.html" title="Comes the Inquisitor">Comes the Inquisitor</a>", where Delenn was tortured during her many failed attempts to answer that infamous question, "Who are you?", and was only released when her actions (and those of Sheridan} showed, rather than spoke, their answer. Despite the Vorlons' motivations, their actual effect as authoritarians is adequately shown by the sources. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 00:12, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section about "authoritarianism vs. anarchy" misuses the word anarchy. Anarchy is a political philosophy and isn't chaos. The Vorlons represented authoritarianism and order, the Shadows represented chaos, and the "third way" represented by the humans. Minbair and others are an example of anarchism or anarchy. Anarchy is about self-determination, which was the choice made contra the Vorlons and Shadows. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.94.183.180 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.94.183.180_190d.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.94.183.180">contribs</a>) 04:07, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Actually, according to Merriam-Webster Online, Cambridge Dictionaries Online, and our own <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchy (disambiguation)">Anarchy (disambiguation)</a>, "anarchy" can certainly mean "chaos". But this article currently does point to the political philosophy, which is not part of the sources cited as references for this information. In fact, reviewing those sources, it looks like there is more in them about "good vs. evil", "order vs. chaos", and the need for conflict (vs. an enforced peace, presumably) than "authoritarianism vs. anarchy", <i>per se</i>. We really do need better sourcing. The problem, I suspect, is that the material was written first based on original research, then backfilled with easily found sources only partly relevant to the points the editors wanted to make. This is a common problem with Wikipedia articles, especially ones about subjects with serious fan bases, and is exactly backwards from the way that material should be added. I'd urge the regular editors of this article to read (or re-read) the published material discussing these subjects at length and synthesize what is said in them (with plenty of specific citations), not just look for individual sentences in JMS discussions that justify opinions. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 04:27, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. I own all 5 seasons plus The Gathering/In the Beginning, Movie set (all 5 movies), and Legend of the Rangers. All are local (Australia, Region 4) releases.
