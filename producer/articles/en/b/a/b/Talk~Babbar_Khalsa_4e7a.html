<p>I have reformatted the entire website and I dont feel that there is anything that needs to be tidied up. I've read ur comments re. Babbar Khalsa on ur own page, and what I dont understand is your own flagrantly hypocritical stance on so-called "honorific" names such as "Shaheed". You wrote that such references *might* be acceptable if accepted by a large portion of the Sikh community: who gave you the right to decide what is and what isnt the majority view on a subject? There are photo's of Shaheed Sukhdev Singh Babbar in my local gurudwara in Southall, which speaks volumes: actions speak louder than words. As for the content, it is absolutely 100% true: the sources used here include the Federation of American Scientists, The Sikhs in History by Sangat Singh and archival information from Punjab Police, not to mention information gleaned from Amnesty International and the United Nations. What more do you want? You speak of a neutral point of view, but your own pro-India, anti-Khalistan standpoint is clouding and compromising the validity of the information in these same articles. I strongly suggest you improve ur own knowledge of Sikh history and read the Amnesty International and United Nations reports on Human Rights violations in Punjab before questioning the integrity of an article that is based on fact, not lies. The term Shaheed is perfectly applicable here as there is a sizeable portion of the Sikh community that harbor strong sentiments for the formation of Khalistan, whether thru violent or non-violent means, and as such have a favourable view of the Babbar Khalsa. Please do not let your own bias influence the education of others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh at last, someone who seems like they may like to discuss the changes. I am away for four days now so I won't be able to have a meaningful discussion until later, however I still take issue with Saheed. Check back in a week. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 07:18, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How exactly is my stance hypocritical? These titles are in no way their real names, nor sanctioned by any significant Sikh organisation nor is the term used by any large number of Sikhs. Even if it was acceptable to use Shaheed, you still would not refer to them constantly as "Shaheed Bhai Sukhdev Singh Babbar" and "Shaheed Bhai Talwinder Singh Parmar" which is farcicle at best. Instead you would use "Sukhdev Babbar" and "Talwinder Parmar" which is consistant with the way names are shortened in the English language.</dd>

<dd>The main issues I had with this article were in earlier versions around the edit wars with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThetruth_7c82.html" title="User:Thetruth">Thetruth</a>. Although the current version is actually better, it still has considerable problems. For starters, you may suggest various sources were used, but none are referrenced directly, no pages, dates, authors or anything of the like. I still have issues with these comments:</dd>

<dd>"the Babbar Khalsa is still capable of causing damage and hitting political targets."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly how was this decided? This either needs expansion or it need removing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"According to Punjab Police, the last words uttered by Shaheed Sukhdev Singh Babbar were: "The Sukhdev Singh you have come to get has left, this body is an empty vessel, you may do with this as you wish.""</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, there is a reference claimed, but this quote turns up nothing but pro-Khalistan pages on Google. Again either a more direct reference is needed or it needs to be removed. I could claim that the Punjab Police said "googldy woogldy" which might have a "reference" but it wouldn't be credible in its current state.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The same can be said about “the most prominent militant leader since 1978” which again brings up pro-Khalistan pages and forums. For all I know, this could have been made up by someone and then propagated across web sites. I also have issues with subjective opinions such as "Furthermore, the romance and allure of the Sikh freedom fighting organisations, particularly the Babbar Khalsa, remains strong abroad."</dd>

<dd>I don't have issue with the Human Rights violations (which in my opinion did occur) and as you can see, I've not been debating those issues.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree with this statement: the usage of Shaheed to highlight fallen Sikh soldiers is used by many significant organisations, including PanthKhalsa.org and Akhand Kirtani Jatha. The latter is widely active in the United Kingdom and organises a variety of events concerning the development of Sikhi in Sikh Youth. Moreover, the term Shaheed is used informally by many pro-Khalistan politicians, such as the Council for Khalistan as well as by Khalistan protagnists that are recognised by the Government of India itself, namely the Dal Khalsa. I can understand your querying of the issue, but the name Shaheed is widely used to illustrate those who gave their life in a just cause.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is an obvious statement: the title Shaheed is conferred upon an individual for a sacrifice that he or she makes, much in the same way that Baba Deep Singh Ji is referred to as a Shaheed for his role in defying Ahmed Shah Abdali. Nobody is under any illusions as to think that the term Shaheed is actually somebody’s name, as you are suggesting. It is indeed a honorific title conferred upon somebody as a result of the sacrifice they have made, just as the term Babbar is applied to somebody who is a member of the Babbar Khalsa. Your quotation is completely irrelevant and carries no argument.</dd>

<dd>Gurdwaras in Southall represent over 50,000 Sikhs in and around London. The posting of a Babbar Khalsa picture in one of them is a representation of what the sangat believes in, since the gurdwara is, in many ways, a mouthpiece of the Sikh community in western London. Hence, if many gurdwaras in Southall display pictures of Shaheed Sukhdev Singh Babbar, as is the case (it is not just ONE), this demonstrates a large support within the Sikh community for the underlying aim of Babbar Khalsa: <b>Khalistan</b>.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t understand how you can have issues with that. It is publicly known that there is an undercurrent of support for Khalistan abroad, particularly in the UK, Canada and to a lesser extent, the USA. The hanging pictures of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale Ji and the destruction of the Shri Akal Takhat following Bluestar 1984 in a multitude of gurdwaras in the UK alone is testament to the seething anger still present today regarding the Indian government. The pictures of Babbar Khalsa and other freedom fighters also reinforces the view that many Sikhs still have raw emotions about the formation of Khalistan. The pro-Khalistan literature handed out during Vaisakhi in areas all over England highlights the support for Khalistan. I believe that this statement of yours is completely baseless: yes, I may not be able to provide hard evidence since the support is almost wholly covert and undercurrent, but there is a huge consensus in the UK that support for Khalistan is vibrant to say the least. Much of this support for Khalistan can be traced back to the “romantic” notion of Sikh freedom fighters a la Babbar Khalsa, hence justifying my original statement.</dd>

I was a bit skeptical at first that you would reply because I've had many people edit Khalistan and associated articles without any discussion, thinking their edits will stay because they've put them there.

<dd>Maybe we can use the comprise I've added for the Sikh Gurus? I've listed the Gurus pages under their standard non-honourific names (I suppose 'Guru' could be seen as honourific, but that's what they're mostly known as) and then added the full name in the introduction. For example, <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Gobind_Singh_522b.html" title="Guru Gobind Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a> is listed as Sri <b>Guru Gobind Singh</b> Ji in the introduction, but thereafter *and* on all other pages, simply Guru Gobind Singh is listed. Also, the honourific titles are not in bold to signify that they are 'additions'. I'm willing to accept a similiar compromise with this case.</dd>

I have no problem showing both sides of the story, but adding lots of propaganda without references just makes it worse.</dd>

<dd>"Hi - thanks for replying! I was a bit skeptical at first that you would reply because I've had many people edit Khalistan and associated articles without any discussion, thinking their edits will stay because they've put them there. However, you seem to wish to have a meaningful discussion and I'm more than happy to reach a compromise with you"</dd>

<dd>Well, first things first, i am pro-Khalistan and anti-India, i make no qualms about that. The beliefs and opinions that were expressed previously were made with an air of quiet confidence that can only be obtained thru hours upon hours of attempted understanding of the Sikh faith. I dont claim to be a Sant or know my way around Sikhi better than everyone. I just want to share with people information and knowledge that is fact, and express it as it should be told, not in an overly pro-India, anti-Khalistan ideology which, unfortunately, is all too prevalent in modern Sikh academic circles.</dd>

<dd>Maybe we can use the comprise I've added for the Sikh Gurus? I've listed the Gurus pages under their standard non-honourific names (I suppose 'Guru' could be seen as honourific, but that's what they're mostly known as) and then added the full name in the introduction. For example, Guru Gobind Singh is listed as Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji in the introduction, but thereafter *and* on all other pages, simply Guru Gobind Singh is listed. Also, the honourific titles are not in bold to signify that they are 'additions'. I'm willing to accept a similiar compromise with this case."</dd>

<dd>"Gurdwaras in Southall represent over 50,000 Sikhs in and around London. The posting of a Babbar Khalsa picture in one of them is a representation of what the sangat believes in, since the gurdwara is, in many ways, a mouthpiece of the Sikh community in western London. Hence, if many gurdwaras in Southall display pictures of Shaheed Sukhdev Singh Babbar, as is the case (it is not just ONE), this demonstrates a large support within the Sikh community for the underlying aim of Babbar Khalsa: Khalistan."</dd>
<dd>Well I could counter that by saying my local gurdwara displays no political pictures at all. The only martyrdom pictures are from the age of the Gurus."</dd>

<dd>Well, here we are just going to have to agree to disagree, because we could go back and forth numerous times. As with the general Sikh diaspora, there are gurdwaras which proactively support the Khalistan cause (which I myself personally deem just) and there are those gurdwaras that do not. They are all houses of worship of Satnaam Waheguru and I;m going to leave this discussion here: I do not see the point in discussing how a gurdwara should or should not be run thru the prism of whether they are pro or anti Khalistan.</dd>

<p>This is strictly false. Firstly, I'm not a "moderator". The concept of moderation doesn't really exist on Wikipedia and the closest thing is an administrator - which I'm not either. Secondly I certainly never "okayed" any version. I asked for many changes and many sources and agreed with the other editor that a week was a reasonable amount of time to retrieve them. Since then, no sources have been provided and thus I still have issues with the current version. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 19:38, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, having gone through the current and some previous versions of this article, I strongly believe that it is POV in current form. I've some ideas for improving it, but as I believe that I lack the domain expertise, I'd just list them here, so that interested people can take a look and add to, or modify the list. 1) Babbar Akali was active in 1920 while Babbar Khalsa was conceived in 1978. Hence, the origin cannot be traced to Babbar Akali; perhaps, it can be stated that Babbar Khalsa was inspired by Babbar Akali. If strong claims to the origin need to be made, common links - in terms of leaders, modus operandi etc. need to be outlined. 2) That the Nirankaris are a sect makes it clear that they wd have some differences from mainstream Sikhs in terms of customs and traditions. Apart from that, all references to the sect in the article apear to be POV. 3) The article makes it clear that Babbar Khalsa was born with the killing of a Nirankari leader. It appears from the passage that the struggle led by Babbar Khalsa was more for the leadership of the Sikh community rather than its independence from India. 4) As several orgns. were active in the struggle for Khalistan, Babbar Khalsa's role among these orgns and their relations with one another need to be discussed. 5) Most importantly, the causes of rifts between S. S. Babbar and T. S. Parmar must be talked about - was it financial, ideological or fight for leadership? 6) Details about the recent arrest of Hawara and his place in the organisation need to be added.

<dd>I generally agree with above, but would add that the view (apparently widely held) that this group is a terrorist organization should not be suppressed. Editors are urged to look at the results of this Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Babbar+Khalsa%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Babbar+Khalsa%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Two messages come from this result: (1) WP is ranked first among the searches, so our resonsibility in providing complete and NPOV coverage is great (2) an adjective widely associated with this group is "terrorist." The WP article, of course, does not need to endorse this characterization, but neither should it be ignored. <a href="../../../f/r/s/User%7EFRS_3198.html" title="User:FRS">FRS</a> 05:32, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, first things first, I am the editor of this Babbar Khalsa page. I do not know who made remarks on my behalf vis-a-vis any agreement with the page administrator, Sukh. However, suffice to say, it wasnt me. I have read the above comments and I think i understands the views and sentiments that are being mentioned. I will make the necessary changes to the page regarding links and regarding extra information around 16-17 December, as this is when my medical exams end. One note worthy of mention is that a Google search, despite the reputation of the search engine, is inherently biased, as anybody with a tacit understanding of the internet can produce a webpage denigrating Babbar Khalsa as a terrorist organisation. I am pro-Khalistan, and proud of it. But I am a Khlaistan protagonist who knows his facts.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, during the height of militancy in the late 1980s, Babbar Khalsa was not deemed a terrorist organisation by the UK, USA or Canada. Is it not a coincidence that since the liberalistion and opening of the Indian economy in 1991, under the careful aegis of the now PM Manmohan Singh, that the very same Western nations have hiterto ploughed billions of dollars into the Indian economy and that the branding of Babbar Khalsa, intertwined with the relevant low-key militancy at the time being, is merely an attempt to cosy up to the Indian leadership and a policy that is conducive to their own respective economic and business interests?</p>
<p>Im not saying that this theory is right or wrong, but it is certainly worth mentioning when one talks about the proscribing of Babbar Khalsa and other Sikh organisations. Anyone who believes that Western nations act strictly in the pursuit of human rights and democracy without at least one eye on their own interests is naive at the very least.</p>
<p>The facts that have been mentioned by Amnesty international, an organisation still not allowed to function freely in india, also lend credulence to these fighters being freedom fighters, rather than terrorists. I agree some outrages were conducted by Sikh terrorists, but Amnesty International itself has recorded 2,093 unidentified bodies that Punjab Police extra-judically cremated in 3 crematoria in Amritsar. Furthermore, the Indian Supreme Court only recently convicted Punjab Police officers of killing the human rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra.</p>
<p>Lastly, the "an adjective widely associated with Babbar Khalsa" statement is a non-starter. The vast majority of websites, in the range of 75% upwards, that proscribe Babbar Khalsa as a terrorist organisation are Indian and very pro-India and anti-Khalistan. If you are to talk about POV regarding this article, then you have to question the POV of the editors and authors of those webpages that you so eloquently subscribe to. I will mention that some people think of this organisation as a terrorist one, but when I do so, I will make sure that it is known to the reader that this view is widely held by those who are inherently pro-India and/or anti-Khalistan. You would struggle to find a sizeable number of Sikhs who believed in their heart of hearts that BKI and others were wholly terrorist organisations. A comparison of the differing views held by the USA and the UK on the IRA would be a perfect example.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nirankari-Sikh clash of 1978: if the passage is making out that the BKI was trying to lead the Sikh community, then I shall make amendments to it. The Babbar Khalsa was not the only organisation there: the Akhand Kirtani Jatha was also present. As it seems from your comments that this webpage is confusing on that matter, it shall be cleared.</p>
<p>Regarding more intricate knowledge of the ongoings within the Babbar Khalsa, it must be remembered that this organisation was fighting occupation forces in Punjab, and as such, not all of its activites were broadcast from the rooftops. Moreover, this occurred in an era where information was not freely available. I have heard that the schism between Shaheed Bhai Sukhdev Singh Babbar and Shaheed Talwinder Singh Parmar were ideological rather than anything else. I shall see if I can improve my knowledge on such matters.</p>
<p>The arrest of Hawara will also be mentioned, tho his involvement within the Babbar Khalsa is far more restrained than made out by the pro-India media. Nevertheless, I will try to make the matter more clear.</p>
<p>I am serious about making genuine corrections to this page and I welcome any dialogue that makes the gross human rights violations in Punjab more open to the public, but I wont stand by while it is defamed and unaccurately protrayed as a terrorist organisation. i will make my amendments around 16-17th December.

<p>Although the new paragraph added by wiretowire I just deleted is frankly not that much worse than the rest of the article, I felt it was time to draw a line. This is the paragraph:</p>

<p>I don't believe that there is any evidence that the Delhi Bomb Blasts were carried out by Babbar Khalsa International. As far as I know, Jagtar Singh Hawara specifically stated that BKI did NOT do it and condems the killing of innocents. It is in my opinion that the afforementioned fact be added to the article in a NPOV manner.</p>
