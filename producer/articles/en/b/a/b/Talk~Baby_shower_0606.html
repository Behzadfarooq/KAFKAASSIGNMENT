	    <p>No, it shouldn't be retitled: Baby Shower is correct, and they are very common, at least in the United States.</p>
<p>I do think it's an error to say that "gifts and money" are given. I think it would be much more accurate to say that "typically gifts, but also sometimes money" is given. Especially because an expecting mother who will be participating in a baby shower usually creates a baby registry, it is most typical that guests bring gifts.</p>
<p>The reason it's called a "shower" is the same reason that word is used for a "Bridal Shower." The idea is that the bride or expectant mother is "showered" with gifts. -- CurlyHairDay 10/12/2006</p>
<p>Leaves aside fact that it usually the mother for whom the baby shower is given, and it's a typically female affair, though there are undoubtedly contemporary exceptions. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<p>The page says showers are "more common in the past 15 years", but that seems like a totally arbitrary figure, if the basic statement is even true. Could this be rephrased, or backed up with any references? --Chad.netzer 9 July 2005 04:47 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is called a "baby shower" just like a "bridal shower". It may well be an North American specific term, but please don't call it a "pre-birth party" which has a total of 35 google hits whereas "baby shower" has 24 million! <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 04:11, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Support, unless someone can come up with another common term that is less ambiguous to non-USA folks. "Pre-Birth Party" seems to be an odd neologism -- simply because some people may be confused by the use of "shower" in this context is not a good reason to arbitrarily rename an article with an uncommon term. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:20, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I cleared out the external links yesterday, and today two were back. I've cleared those again as there was no explanation of why they were returned. They both seem to be links to fairly low value, generic "party planning" info on commercial sites. If someone would like these links back in the article could you please post how they add encylopedic value to this article?

<dd>Hi there, I noticed you've been removing links on the 'Baby Shower' section because they are deem "commercial" &amp; "unencyclopedic". Just want to clarify with you here that some of the links are actually to fully featured guide on baby shower planning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a shower planner myself I know that baby shower planning is a big topic on it's own, which usually entails weeks of careful planning and work. So it's just impossible to add more than a general desciption on Wikipedia; much more specific information is required. IMO, the links to external sites are the best we can do to provide more valuable information to researchers using Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've since removed all genuinely "commercial" links on the page and left 2 which I find are truly relevant and of value to the topic. I hope u will reconsider and leave them intact. Because by removing them we will be limiting Wikipedia users to better resources elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Tks, I hope you'd discuss with me first if you decide to make any changes.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.75.59.119_0546.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.75.59.119">219.75.59.119</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/9/User_talk%7E219.75.59.119.html" title="User talk:219.75.59.119">talk</a>) .</small></dd>

<p><br /></p>

<dd>I don't find your arguments very persuasive. For a start the purpose of an encyclopedia article on baby showers should be about the social and historical context of the phenomenon. Not about how to plan one (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a>). There is no problem with readers finding better baby shower resources on other sites. If someone wants to plan a baby shower or other event, off-line they'd reach for a how-to book, not an encyclopedia. If a reader wants to research what baby showers are - how they have impacted lives in general, what social, religious and economic factors have shaped them and other <i>encyclopedic</i> matters, then Wikipedia should be trying to ensure we have the best possible resources for them. I don't think these links fit.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The links are to poor quality content from an encyclopedic perspective. They're not particularly well written; they're not particularly authoritative (no one "quotes" them in research), or popular (Alexa rankings put them both in the million+); the content is trivial (in that there are many places similar content can be found, and lots of people could write similar content) and can be found through a simple search on any search engine; and, most importantly, the quality of the information is not verified - the sites are not written by acknowledged leaders in the field, and there is no peer review or other process to ensure facts are correct.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You say you've deleted the genuinely commercial sites, as though these two are not. But the sites you linked to are also blatantly commercial. With one site you link not to the content that expands (if poorly) on baby showers, but to a blurb introduction whose only purpose appears to highlight moor google ads. On this same site, the "About" page even has a nice little button to press so anyone can learn how to "generate revenue from your site with google adsense" However, though commercial sites are discouraged in favor of non-commercial sites, it's not a reason for deleting <i>if</i> the site is otherwise a good link. But since I fail to see how these links add any encyclopedic value, the fact that they are commercial makes me very keen on seeing them deleted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While you've said you plan baby showers and think readers need more information on that than the article can provide, you haven't said how these links add encylopedic content to the article. Do you (or other editors) have other, encyclopedic, reasons for keeping the links? Or do you disagree with my idea of what is encyclopedic?

<p>The statement "in india baby shower is gifts for the mother rather than gifts for the baby" is false.</p>
<p>In India, baby shower is traditionally held in the seventh month,i.e. 28-32 weeks,of pregnancy. In earlier times it was a function which was organized and attended by women only. Nowadays many a times both genders of the family / friends circle are included in this function.</p>
<p>In India too it is a function to celebrate the expected arrival of the baby and present the parents-to-be with gifts appropriate for the expectant new born as well as either of the parents-to-be. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by KshitijaK (<a href="../../../k/s/h/User_talk%7EKshitijaK_cf49.html" title="User talk:KshitijaK">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KshitijaK_e790.html" title="Special:Contributions/KshitijaK">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
