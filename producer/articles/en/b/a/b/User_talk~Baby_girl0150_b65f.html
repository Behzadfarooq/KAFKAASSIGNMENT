<p>Whats good? So you go to counseling today. I'll see if I can go see you at 3:00, and if you change your time let me no so I can change my times to. Anyways the reason I didn't say Hi to you yesterday was because my staff be on some grimmy shit every day. Most of the time when we say hi to ya'll he be wanting to take our points. I wanted to say Hi to you so bad see if we was on the outs I'd be talking to you every day, but in here we can't talk to no girls hardly. But you said am I shy or something. Naw im not shy at all 4real. Most of the time I just say what ever comes to my head, even if its ignorant. But why would you say i was trying to ignore you, I would never ignore you girl. But real talk today if I see you at counseling I don't care if I loose points im still going to talk to you. Well you asked me how am I graduating at the end of the 11th grade, well I got 7 credits now. This year I'll have 14 credits, plus the summer credits that equals up to 17 credits. So at the end of the 11th, or the begining of the 12th I'll have enough credits to graduate. I also pan on going to college so I need the college credits to. Anyways you said that you can't write me any more because you were mad. What was wrong? because when you hurt I hurt, When your upset Im upset to. Its like what ever you feel I feel it to. So let me do my school work so my staff don't take any points. I'll try to go see you at 3:00. LoveYou. Oh Yeah Im a virgin for real. I've just been looking for the right girl to give it to. who ever gets its going to be real happy with what they see. Who Know it might even be you. I got a question to ask you now. Are you a virgin. How many boys have you've slept wit. But 4real I Love You Allways. W/B</p>

<p>What's good? About this place you just have to let time go pass. Just look at how long some other people have been here, for a while. I’m pissed off like a motha fucka 4real. That I had to be here so long. That’s why I talk to girls, so time can go faster. I could have been home but I’ve been going a little wild, because I was only suppose to be here 6 2 9 months, but I've been here longer than that. You said that your boyfriend would do anything for you; well I’m your boyfriend now. I guess I’ll have to take that roll. I’ll do anything for you I’m telling you, and can I be your future baby daddy. I promise I’ll try not to fuck up 4real. I might fuck up once or twice but keep it 100 I'm only human I'm not perfect, I'm going to make a mistake, and when you’re lonely I’ll comfort you until your better Real talk. You know how your old boy friend fucks up. The only difference is that I won’t keep fucking up. I’ll make sure to keep you happy alight. As long as you do the same witch what you’re talking it sounds like you’re going to 4real. But wit me you’ll never have to worry about me going out wit any other girl besides YOU… like I'm saying I know your heart has been broken before but I'm here to fix it. Like I said I might make a mistake but I'm only human u feels me, I'm not perfect. So write back and tell me what you think. Love Ya Boo. W/B</p>

<p>What’s up? About your old boyfriend. You don’t have to worry about nobody breaking your heart again because I'm here now. You know how you have a dream about the almost perfect guy that’s me. You don’t have to worry about anybody cheating on you or doing ignorant shit, because I'm not like that. Oh ya thanks for that hug maybe next time I’ll give you a kiss depends on if staffs watching. See I should just give you a kiss in front of every body that would be something ignorant I would do, but I'm tying to make my level. But 4Real you know how your old boyfriend was ignorant I'm not ignorant at all like that I might say some ignorant shit but other than that I'm cool. Anyways I got some questions to ask you. Why did you choose to go out wit me? Is it because I look good? Or is it because I have a good personality? What ever it was I'm glad you’re going out wit me. Anyways you said that I can be your baby daddy that’s what’s up. I don’t mind being the father of your children. We might even get married some day. Who knows. But I got to do some school work now W/B. Love you always.</p>
