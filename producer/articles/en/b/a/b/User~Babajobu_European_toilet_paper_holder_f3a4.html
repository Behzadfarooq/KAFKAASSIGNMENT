<p>The <b><a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_Toilet_paper_holder_ddbd.html" title="User:Bishonen/Toilet paper holder">toilet paper holder</a></b> has been an important facet of European <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathroom.html" title="Bathroom">bathroom</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design.html" title="Design">design</a> since antiquity. Distinctly European in origin, it has been a part of Western culture since its invention in the mists of pre-history. The symbolism and design of these fixtures has changed over the centuries, but they continue to occupy a central place in bathroom layout as well as in the emergent construction of a specifically European identity.</p>

<p>Analysis of toilet paper holders has long been an important part of the historian's arsenal. In ancient <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, toilet paper holders designed by <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitruvius.html" title="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> were prized as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_symbol.html" title="Status symbol">status symbols</a>. Records of toilet paper holder practices in ancient <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, unearthed in the 1970s, brought fresh insight into the contrasting cultures of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>. In the later <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetic.html" title="Aesthetic">aesthetic</a> qualities of the <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_paper.html" title="Toilet paper">toilet paper</a> itself, rather than of the holder, come to the fore for the first time, as evidenced by the lovely <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">icon</a> paper shown top right, with its obvious religious significance. The toilet paper holder, previously an essentially secular item, emerged as central in the early development of Christianity, with a role in the myth of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Grail_c5ce.html" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a>. And discoveries in recent decades have confirmed that toilet paper holder engineering was known to the designers of Stonehenge.</p>

<p>The artistic glory days of these bathroom fittings stretch from the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th</a> to early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th</a> centuries, when splendid designs were produced by everyone from <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladio.html" title="Palladio">Palladio</a> to <a href="../../../f/a/b/Faberg%C3%A9.html" title="Fabergé">Fabergé</a>. Individual toilet paper holders of spectacular opulence have again and again played key roles at crisis points in European history: a uniquely alarming Palladian polar bear holder dissuaded England's Virgin Queen <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a> from marriage with the King of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, one jewelled Fabergé holder precipitated the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_b5cc.html" title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, and another exacerbated the course of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Vernacular holders provide a cultural commentary from below. In spite of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">historical</a> importance of these cultural artefacts, their own history is surprisingly under-researched.

<p>The ancient history of toilet paper holders confounds those who assume that bathroom fittings and sanitary arrangements were <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive.html" title="Primitive">primitive</a> before our own day. Recent research by Professor David Summers and his team from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, has shown that the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesolithic.html" title="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posthole.html" title="Posthole">postholes</a>, thought to date to 800 BC, discovered surrounding <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonehenge.html" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, were not in fact postholes but a series of <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_convenience.html" title="Public convenience">public conveniences</a> erected for the use of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a> worshippers at Stonehenge.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a href="#fn_1" title="">1</a></sup></span> This theory is based on the discovery, during construction work at the new visitors' centre in 2004, of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze.html" title="Bronze">bronze</a> artefacts at one time thought to be funerary ornaments dedicated to a <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phallic.html" title="Phallic">phallic</a> <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">god</a>. However, recently discovered <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_painting.html" title="Cave painting">cave paintings</a> at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheddar_Gorge_b490.html" title="Cheddar Gorge">Cheddar Gorge</a>, showing these artefacts in use, clearly suggest a woven cloth wrapped around them, which was used in ablutions of a personal nature. These astoundingly graphic cave paintings, which have yet to be opened to public viewing, record accurately the use of the bronze holders with a view of Stonehenge behind. The paintings were probably made by pilgrims returning from their once in a lifetime visit to <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonehenge.html" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, and similar paintings have been found in the <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardeche.html" title="Ardeche">Ardeche</a>. Typically, pilgrims would paint objects which had impressed them; the fact they painted the toilet paper holders indicates that these were not in common use at this time. There is an apparent allusion to this practice in Canto XCI of <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Pound_79cc.html" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a>'s long <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernist.html" title="Modernist">modernist</a> poem <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cantos_4610.html" title="The Cantos">The Cantos</a></i>. Pound was drawing on the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> <i>Brut</i> of <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layamon.html" title="Layamon">Layamon</a> and it is speculated that, through the monastic <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter-library_loan.html" title="Inter-library loan">inter-library loan</a> system that existed at the time, Layamon may have been familiar with some now-lost early personal hygiene manuals.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Spartans</a>, who favoured the manly virtues of toughness and disregard for bodily comfort, preferred bowls of freshly-harvested <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thistle.html" title="Thistle">thistles</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stinging_nettle.html" title="Stinging nettle">stinging nettles</a>, a habit that led to frequent, heartfelt cries of <i>Oi moi! Aoi <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lacedaemon.html" title="Lacedaemon">Lacedaemonai</a></i> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <i>Οι μοι&#160;! Αοι Λακεδαιμωναι!</i>). The use of ornate pottery holders in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> and the likely survival of remnants of this hidden tradition in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grail.html" title="Grail">Grail</a> stories has led the critic <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Bloom_486b.html" title="Harold Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> to reassess <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Keats_3200.html" title="John Keats">John Keats</a>' <i><a href="../../../o/d/e/Ode_on_a_Grecian_Urn_793d.html" title="Ode on a Grecian Urn">Ode on a Grecian Urn</a></i>. Bloom argues that the lines <i>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard/Are sweeter</i> point to a growing requirement for privacy in the convenience. This, in turn, fed demand for greater numbers of toilet paper holders to service individual cubicles. Close reading of the extant manuscript sources for <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>'s <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato%27s_Republic_09f4.html" title="Plato's Republic">Republic</a></i> has lead to a re-evaluation of one of the best-known passages in that work. It seems that Plato did not wish to bar <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet.html" title="Poet">poets</a>; his censure was rather aimed at the new Athenian softness in the personal hygiene department. Later, in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a> times, toilet <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parchment.html" title="Parchment">parchment</a> holders, similar in style to the Egyptian, were designed by <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitruvius.html" title="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a>, and much prized by the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Romans</a> as a symbol of status. The <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor.html" title="Emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caligula.html" title="Caligula">Caligula</a> had many of these <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objets_d%27art.html" title="Objets d'art">objets d'art</a> made for his new palace, some of which have been uncovered on the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatine_hill.html" title="Palatine hill">Palatine hill</a>.</p>

<p>With the decline of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Empire_b100.html" title="Western Empire">Western Empire</a>, the sophisticated objects valued by the Romans were replaced by cruder wooden holders used by the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic.html" title="Germanic">Germanic</a> tribes. These have, up to recently, been wrongly categorised by <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archeologist.html" title="Archeologist">archeologists</a> as <a href="../../../v/o/t/Votive_deposit.html" title="Votive deposit">votive deposits</a>, but are now recognised for what they were (Gibbon <i>passim</i>). In the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, patterned toilet paper emerged as a side product of <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">icon</a> production. The highly ornate holders required to do justice to these <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a> papers were of such value that they were frequently carried from <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bog.html" title="Bog">bog</a> to bog by their owners. (See image top right.)</p>
<p>Research currently being carried out at the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Museum_of_Ireland_ac8c.html" title="National Museum of Ireland">National Museum of Ireland</a> indicates that the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze-age.html" title="Bronze-age">Bronze-age</a> ornate gold <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torc.html" title="Torc">torcs</a> found all over the island are not, as was believed, necklaces but are, in fact, toilet paper holders of a pendant type. The fact that many of these were discovered buried in bogs in a manner that indicates that they may have been votive offerings is highly suggestive. With the advent of Christianity in the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celt.html" title="Celt">Celtic</a> area, matters of personal hygiene took a distinctly Spartan turn. For example, in the absence of any suitable vegetation, the monks of <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skellig_Michael_ed03.html" title="Skellig Michael">Skellig Michael</a> took to using rough earthenware containers filled with pieces of broken <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell.html" title="Shell">shell</a> gathered on the seashore. Winter weather conditions frequently meant that even this rudimentary form of filling for their holders was in scarce supply.</p>
<p>Recently the daring suggestion has been made that the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_French_38c4.html" title="Old French">Old French</a> <i>San Greal</i> is a misreading of an <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> word deriving from the root <i>sgr</i>, meaning <i>to close</i>, with close associations with personal hygiene. The theory, as formulated by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Brown_5a02.html" title="Dan Brown">Dan Brown</a> in his important historical monograph <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a></i>, is that the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Grail_c5ce.html" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a> was, in fact, a particularly fine Middle-Eastern toilet paper holder that was brought to Europe by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Magdalen_d150.html" title="Mary Magdalen">Mary Magdalen</a> as she was fleeing persecution. Close reading of the <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnostic.html" title="Gnostic">Gnostic</a> gospels has led Brown to conclude that Magdalen suffered from chronic constipation from an early age. He goes on to claim that the 'Grail' came into the hands of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_the_Bald_87f3.html" title="Charles the Bald">Charles the Bald</a> and later formed a key element in the French elaboration of the theory of the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Right_of_Kings_85b4.html" title="Divine Right of Kings">divine right of kings</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that the Holy Grail may well have been a toilet paper holder, requires a thorough review and reinterpretation of the stories surrounding the shadowy, mystical figure of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Arthur_40ce.html" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a>. Given the frequency with which holders are found in religious contexts, if, indeed, the Grail was closely associated with defecation, it must be linked, via the use of human excrement in early medieval farming, with Celtic vegetation cults. This link is underscored by the emphasis placed on the role of the Grail in the fertility of the land. For example, in the version of the myth found in the <i><a href="../../../m/a/b/Mabinogion.html" title="Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a></i>, the failure of the questor <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peredur.html" title="Peredur">Peredur</a> to ask the (somewhat loaded) question <i>Who does the Grail serve</i>, results in the desolation of the land, the infertility of maidens and the confinement of the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fisher_King_1b06.html" title="Fisher King">Fisher King</a>.</p>
<p>It should also be remembered that this practice of soil enrichment and fertilisation resulted in an increase in agricultural output, which in turn hastened the abandonment of that <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter_gatherer.html" title="Hunter gatherer">hunter gatherer</a> culture of which the Knights of the Table Round were the <i><a href="../../../a/c/m/Acme.html" title="Acme">nec plus ultra</a></i>.</p>

<p>The Dark Ages of Early Medieval Europe are subject to great speculation that is unsuited to a scholarly account of this nature.

<p>It is often thought that <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque.html" title="Baroque">baroque</a> toilet paper holders were an innovation of the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, but this is false, as <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladio.html" title="Palladio">Palladio</a>, doubtless inspired by Vitruvius, designed them at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_Capra_066b.html" title="Villa Capra">Villa Capra</a> in the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>. These were of course <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladian_architecture.html" title="Palladian architecture">Palladian toilet paper holders</a>, magnificent objects adorned with fluted doric <a href="../../../c/o/l/Column.html" title="Column">columns</a>, supporting a ring from a lion's mouth, on which were hung sheets of decorated <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parchment.html" title="Parchment">parchment</a>.</p>
<p>Inaugurating a tradition among the crowned heads of Europe of using luxurious and unique toilet paper holders as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politically</a> significant gifts, King <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_XIV_of_Sweden_bf1d.html" title="Eric XIV of Sweden">Eric XIV of Sweden</a> commissioned a once-off, fearsome toilet paper holder from Palladio, featuring a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polar_bear.html" title="Polar bear">polar bear</a>'s head in place of the usual Palladian lion, as a gift for Queen <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>. By sending this remarkable gift, which has unfortunately been lost to posterity, to the 28-year-old Virgin Queen in <a href="../../../1/5/6/1561.html" title="1561">1561</a>, together with a full-length portrait of himself, Eric hoped to persuade her into a <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty.html" title="Dynasty">dynastically</a> important <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a>. Elizabeth, infatuated with her Master of Horse Lord <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Dudley_3553.html" title="Robert Dudley">Robert Dudley</a>, had dithered before receiving the gifts, or as Clare Rider writes, "in characteristic manner, the Queen kept everyone guessing, refusing to commit herself on the subject of the royal marriage or the succession issue or to discuss such matters before Parliament". Her exact coeval Eric was a handsome, well-educated and talented <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> prince who had not yet begun to show signs of the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insanity.html" title="Insanity">insanity</a> which was to blight the later part of his reign (see Lavery), unless indeed his lapse of judgement in sending such an alarming object as a betrothal present be accounted an early symptom of madness. At any rate Elizabeth, though pleased with the portrait (shown left), declared upon sight of the sculpted polar bear's head with unusual decisiveness that she would never set foot in a nation that was home to such dreadful beasts. Thus ended a marriage project that would have changed the course of European history.</p>

Leonardo's lost sketch of a valve flush toilet from the <i>Codex Madrid I</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>An important gap in the history of toilet paper receptacles was filled in 1974, with the discovery of a missing page from the <i>Codex Madrid I</i>, a notebook of <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> found in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>'s National Library in the 1960s. Ramon Paz y Bicuspid found the missing page, which verified a long-held belief that Leonardo had invented the first <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flush_toilet.html" title="Flush toilet">valve flush toilet</a>. As you can see from the sketch (at right), the valves involved clearly double as toilet paper holders, and one of them is conveniently within an arm's-length of the seat.</p>
<p>The dual-purpose paper holders in this sketch form a definite cultural and architectural <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Bridge_7e62.html" title="Brooklyn Bridge">bridge</a> between the vertical and functional paper holders of the preceding centuries and the increasingly horizontal and poetic paper holders of the Romantic and Baroque periods.</p>

<p>Whereas trends in toilet paper holder design in the Mediterranean and Central European lands dominated by the <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburgs</a> tended towards the robustly exuberant <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rococo.html" title="Rococo">rococo</a> style epitomized in the late designs of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernini.html" title="Bernini">Bernini</a>, the more temperate climes of Northern Europe induced a more sober outlook towards the intimate accouterments of daily life.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine.html" title="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> revelries of the late <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venetian</a> designs so widely imitated in the South that intimated a celebration of earthly munificence and material prosperity in those brief private moments their owners shared with them in daily reflection was supplanted in the North by a quiet pessimism and resignation; <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Nature_of_Things_2488.html" title="On the Nature of Things">De Rerum Natura</a></i>, "the call of nature", became the philosophical underpinning that guided aesthetic developments. In the loos of <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxony.html" title="Saxony">Saxony</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>, the toilet paper holder had become a potent symbol of human mortality, embodying the sacred trinity of "ashes to ashes, dust to dust, fertilizer to fertilizer", and this sobriety extended to toilet paper itself. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s <i>95 Theses</i> nailed to the door of the door of the privy of the Wittenberg Church of All Saints was explicit condemnation of the decadence of the soft, perfumed paper so favored by the Romans, who Luther derided as <i>papelists</i>. Luther argued that such indulgences fatally undermined the constitution and moral fiber of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic.html" title="Germanic">Germanic</a> <i>Urmensch</i>, whose posteriors, he challenged, were more accustomed to the coarse, unbleached <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flax.html" title="Flax">flax</a> prevalent since late Roman times.</p>
<p>Many of Luther's followers, embracing a perhaps too literal reading of the doctrine of <i>sola fides</i>, abandoned the use of toilet paper completely. Others, in a more <a href="../../../i/c/o/Iconoclast.html" title="Iconoclast">iconoclastic</a> spirit, took to nailing looted indulgences to their outhouse walls. In <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor.html" title="Tudor">Tudor</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, where Lutheran rigour encountered an existing hygiene deficit, the new austerity was enthusiastically received. In fact, recent excavations in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_Castle_4be3.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a> have led some historians to wonder if a related <a href="../../../o/l/f/Olfactory.html" title="Olfactory">olfactory</a> complaint contributed to <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>'s difficulty in sustaining long-term relationships.</p>
<p>In the face of this mass movement, the Northern European wing of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_Reformation_3b8f.html" title="Counter Reformation">Counter Reformation</a> inclined towards greater austerity in the area of personal hygiene, even, at times, pursuing a policy of return to the privations of the early monastic church.

<p>The holder pictured right is a modern <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copy.html" title="Copy">copy</a> of a landmark baroque toilet paper holder known as the "Blenheim holder", an understated version of Palladio's opulent design which was developed for <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blenheim_Palace_08e6.html" title="Blenheim Palace">Blenheim Palace</a> by the architect Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> in the 1720s. (We will be mercifully silent on the holder for some reason pictured left.) The Blenheim holder is today perhaps best known for its anomalous resemblance to a modern <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_roll_holder.html" title="Toilet roll holder">roll holder</a>. Vanbrugh's model predates the invention of the <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_paper.html" title="Toilet paper">toilet roll</a> itself by several centuries, and various non-<a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainstream.html" title="Mainstream">mainstream</a> conjectures including variants of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_astronaut_theory.html" title="Ancient astronaut theory">ancient astronaut theory</a> have been offered in explanation of this seemingly prophetic early design (see Däniken pp. 70—73). However, Vanbrugh's austere black <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marble.html" title="Marble">marble</a> cylinder cannot in fact be loosened as in a modern roll holder, and most scholars assume that the sheets of newspaper or of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restoration_comedy.html" title="Restoration comedy">obsolete plays</a> which were commonly used for hygienic purposes in the 18th century were kept in place simply by being tucked behind the cylinder (Blunt p. 191).</p>

The stylized <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seashell.html" title="Seashell">seashell</a> backing and subtly restrained flutings of Vanbrugh's design made it one of the most noted and appreciated features of the sumptuous Blenheim bathrooms, and effected something of a revolution in paper holder taste among the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landed_gentry.html" title="Landed gentry">landed gentry</a>.

</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Albert_7a9e.html" title="Prince Albert">Prince Albert</a>, consort of Queen <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Victoria</a>, took a special interest in the design of toilet paper holders. He personally designed for the queen both <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balmoral_Castle_6b50.html" title="Balmoral Castle">Balmoral Castle</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/b/Osborne_House_6e4e.html" title="Osborne House">Osborne House</a>, and in each of these sumptuous holiday residences he designed the toilet paper holders to blend with the surroundings.</p>
<p>For instance, in the private apartments at Balmoral, the holders have been designed as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stag.html" title="Stag">stag</a>'s <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heads.html" title="Heads">heads</a>, and the individual sheets of paper were hung daily by the queen's personal servant on the tips of the horns. In this way Prince Albert was emulating the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic.html" title="Gothic">Gothic</a> <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic.html" title="Germanic">Germanic</a> design of paper holders in his homeland.</p>
<p>It was at Osborne, however, that delight of architecture, overlooking the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solent.html" title="Solent">Solent</a>, that he gave full rein to his architectural freedom. Here the toilet paper holders were of an <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean.html" title="Ocean">oceanic</a> nature, carved from Isterian <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limestone.html" title="Limestone">limestone</a> and embellished with <a href="../../../o/n/y/Onyx.html" title="Onyx">onyx</a>. They depicted scenes of <a href="../../../n/e/p/Neptune_%28god%29.html" title="Neptune (god)">Neptune</a> and the water <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">gods</a> performing their toilet in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass.html" title="Bass">bass</a> <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relief.html" title="Relief">relief</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Ewart_Gladstone_b6ab.html" title="William Ewart Gladstone">Gladstone</a>, visiting Osborne in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>, noted in his journal the eccentricities of the bathroom fittings, while a decade earlier <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disraeli.html" title="Disraeli">Disraeli</a>, writing from Osborne, in a letter to his wife expressed the sentiment that "My Dear, until one has seen the luxuriant fitments of the bathrooms here, one has not lived". As Psyche Hornblad has shown in a ground-breaking short study, "Benjamin Disraeli and the afterlife of a penny magazine" (1997), he was undoubtedly referring to the toilet paper holders.</p>
<p>During this period, toilet paper holders became for the first time relevant to the non-elite, as it was inevitable that so useful an item would draw the attention of British industrialists of this great age of mass production.</p>
<p>One of the less-noted exhibits at the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Exhibition_of_1851_cf24.html" title="Great Exhibition of 1851">Great Exhibition of 1851</a> was <i>Doulton's Patent Water Closet Fitting for the Relief of Gentlemen and the Delight of Ladies</i>. After an inauspicious start, Doulton's ceramic and steel holder became a byword for middle-class style and hardly a respectable household was without one by the end of the century. Indeed, one of Doulton's creations features in the toilet scene near the beginning of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joyce_98cc.html" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s novel <i><a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_%28novel%29.html" title="Ulysses (novel)">Ulysses</a></i>.</p>
<p>The working classes, however, persisted in their preference for an arrangement of galvanised <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nail_%28engineering%29.html" title="Nail (engineering)">nails</a> and woven <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemp.html" title="Hemp">hemp</a> fibers. While the work of the great sanitary pioneer <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Crapper_86ca.html" title="Thomas Crapper">Thomas Crapper</a> (1836-1910) impinged considerably on lower class plumbing, it effected only marginal improvements in their bathroom fitments (see Reyburn).</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">This <a href="../../../f/a/b/Faberg%C3%A9.html" title="Fabergé">Fabergé</a> egg opens to play a musical movement and reveal a twirling "surprise". Could it once have held the different surprise of toilet paper?</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of all toilet paper holders probably the most beautiful, but ironically the most elusive and today unrecorded, were those made in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Petersburg_adeb.html" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> for the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Carl_Faberg%C3%A9_59f2.html" title="Peter Carl Fabergé">Peter Carl Fabergé</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/a/b/Faberg%C3%A9.html" title="Fabergé">Fabergé</a>, court jeweller to the <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">Tsar</a> of Russia, and purveyor of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewel.html" title="Jewel">jewel</a>-encrusted objets d'art to the elite of the world, entranced the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanov.html" title="Romanov">Romanov</a> family with his <a href="../../../c/u/f/Cuff-link.html" title="Cuff-link">cuff-links</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette.html" title="Cigarette">cigarette</a> cases, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parasol.html" title="Parasol">parasol</a> handles, toilet paper holders, and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_eggs.html" title="Easter eggs">Easter eggs</a>. Many of the Romanov family's palaces contained small rooms with jewelled toilet paper holders designed by the great master jeweller. Sadly, not one example is known to remain. The speculation that Fabergé's famous <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_box.html" title="Music box">music-box</a> Easter eggs may have originally been portable musical toilet paper holders is seen by modern scholars as wishful thinking: the world of bathroom art would be the richer if it were the case, indeed, but <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-ray.html" title="X-ray">x-ray</a> examination of music-box eggs such as the one pictured right have revealed no traces of radical alterations, and all contemporary references suggest that the Fabergé toilet paper holders were of the wall holder type.</p>
<p>Unfortunately so, because, fixed to the walls of the gilded bathrooms, they were left behind by the fleeing <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocrats.html" title="Aristocrats">aristocrats</a>, and then looted by revolutionaries for their stones, their historic importance dismissed. One sole example remained intact at <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsarskoe_Selo_8f26.html" title="Tsarskoe Selo">Tsarskoe Selo</a> and this was looted along with the famed <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber.html" title="Amber">amber</a> room by the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Vyrubova_f675.html" title="Anna Vyrubova">Anna Vyrubova</a> in her <i>Memories of the Russian Court</i>, describing a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stomach.html" title="Stomach">stomach</a> complaint, makes veiled reference to the opulence of the dowager Empress's bathroom fittings. <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagmar_of_Denmark_549c.html" title="Dagmar of Denmark">Empress Marie</a> was known for her love of jewels and bathroom fittings. Robert K. Massie in <i>Nicholas and Alexandra</i> describes the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_of_Hesse_97a6.html" title="Alexandra of Hesse">Empress Alexandra</a>'s own bathroom as being very simple and modest, yet a newspaper feature as early as <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a> reports Alexandra as having given <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rasputin.html" title="Rasputin">Rasputin</a> a Fabergé toilet paper holder. At a time when many <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peasants.html" title="Peasants">peasants</a> could not afford soft toilet tissue this was certainly a provocative act, and was undoubtedly one cause of the revolution.</p>
<p>Empress Marie writing to her daughter <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenia%2C_Grand_Duchess_of_Russia_ae44.html" title="Xenia, Grand Duchess of Russia">Xenia</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> wrote: "I often feel the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a> began with that Fabergé toilet paper holder". However, she was more likely referring to a little known incident at Christmas 1913, when <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_II_of_Germany_a896.html" title="Wilhelm II of Germany">the Kaiser</a> discovered he had only received a jar of <a href="../../../c/a/v/Caviar.html" title="Caviar">caviar</a> for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> from the Tsar, while his cousin <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">George V</a> had received a Fabergé toilet paper holder. The resultant <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy.html" title="Diplomacy">diplomatic</a> incident caused a permanent rift between the Royal houses of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and one can only speculate as to whether this was part of the Kaiser's underlying hostility to Russia and Britain in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Yusupov_c436.html" title="Felix Yusupov">Felix Yusupov</a>, the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvestite.html" title="Transvestite">transvestite</a> murderer of Rasputin, almost certainly owned several Fabergé toilet paper holders. In his book <i>Lost Splendour</i> he gives us one of the few detailed descriptions of a Fabergé original: "My favourite was a gift from Princess Olga Marizinski, fashioned from <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malachite.html" title="Malachite">malachite</a>, edged with rose cut <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamonds</a>, and with the Marizinski crest (a treble headed <a href="../../../o/s/t/Ostrich.html" title="Ostrich">ostrich</a> erect) depicted in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burmese</a> rubies. When the paper was pulled, a spring caused a hidden musical movement to play the 'Star Spangled Banner', hence one knew when to stand up. This toilet paper holder had been a special commission from Fabergé, and was a killing example of the Princess's renowned wit and sense of humour." While better known to posterity for her unconventional sex life, Princess Marizinski was said to own one of the largest collections of Fabergé's art in Russia.</p>
<p>So, what of the legacy of the rarest and most prized toilet paper holders of all? Interestingly in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, when a new book of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_II_e338.html" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>'s jewels was published, Buckingham Palace refused to comment when questioned about the whereabouts of the 1913 Fabergé toilet paper holder, causing speculation that it is today still in regular but very private use.</p>

Late twentieth century vertical roll holder.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While the toilet paper holder has been an object of status and desire for many millennia, it has not been immune to technological advances.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_century.html" title="21st century">21st century</a>, it seems that in parts of Europe the utility and prized place of the toilet paper holder in the domestic pantheon is fading. The toilet paper holder has been reduced in size, becoming an almost vestigial appendage to the bathroom suite; indeed, the digital (paperless) toilet has emerged, with the toilet paper holder replaced by an integrated <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bidet.html" title="Bidet">bidet</a>. In contemporary <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_toilet.html" title="Japanese toilet">Japanese toilets</a>, toilet paper is a rare sight.</p>
<p>Although German fashion has followed this reductionist approach, Scandinavians have favoured an increase in opulence, with striking ornamentation gaining popularity as a contrast to the sleek modernism prevalent in domestic decor outside the lavatory.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and Benelux have shown a third way, however, with the adoption of apparently primitive unarticulated forms such as the vertical rod [see illustration, left]. Some style analysts suggest that this may be a conscious echo of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Native American</a> forms. Another catalyst for the adoption of such designs is the growing cult of individualism in the UK—this form allows the individual user to place the holder to the left or right hand <i>ad hoc</i>.</p>

<p>An interesting sequel to "The Camilla" occurred when an undercover agent from the finest secret service in the world (the Italian) placed an agent Giacomo Bondi in Balmoral Castle to investigate claims that the new <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchess_of_Cornwall_d0c6.html" title="Duchess of Cornwall">Duchess of Cornwall</a> was in fact a subversive member of the Italian Royal family, otherwise known as Chamomile Ciotole-Del-Parco, attempting to unite the failing house of Windsor with that of the noble and superior blood of <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savoy.html" title="Savoy">Savoy</a> and hence unite the two crowns and restore the Italian monarchy, while simultaneously electing Prince Charles to the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">papacy</a>. Agent Bondi 003.5 with his phone camera was able to capture the secret and lavish wedding gift to Camilla from Charles. Spurning the Commemorative Camilla, he had in fact commissioned from <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartier.html" title="Cartier">Cartier</a> a jewelled lavatory tissue dispenser, thought to be redolent of that by Faberge so zealously guarded and treasured, and some say indeed used, by his mother.</p>

<p>Most Marxist inspired revolutions have aimed to improve the general welfare and living standards of the people. In this context the toilet paper holder has been a celebrated emblem of modernity, comparable with the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractor.html" title="Tractor">tractor</a> cult or <a href="../../../s/p/u/Sputnik.html" title="Sputnik">Sputnik</a> as evidence of the superiority of actually existing socialism.

<p>Once an art form has become "official" or "state," it is no longer art, but rather <a href="../../../o/r/n/Ornament.html" title="Ornament">ornament</a> or <a href="../../../e/m/b/Emblem.html" title="Emblem">emblem</a>. "Ornament" functions as a re-encoding of class/ideology, while "emblem" is a branding of class or ideological position. Social critics like <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Williams_4c9d.html" title="Raymond Williams">Raymond Williams</a> have argued that the toilet paper holder is ornament and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Display.html" title="Display">display</a>: a voluntary signification of wealth and power. However, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> and others have suggested that such ornament is not voluntary, that the progress of ornament through a house into even the "shameful" and "invisible" areas of bodily necessity is on the contrary a demonstration of the compulsion of emblem. In this schema, a richly decorated and impractical toilet paper holder is an emblem of wealth and a sign of a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurosis.html" title="Neurosis">neurotic</a> ideological position.</p>

Passing of the Antique: Futurist toilet paper holder by Umberto Botulini, 1919. Although Futurist in spirit, this piece still shows discernible traces of the Baroque.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bathroom fitments and particularly toilet paper holders are inscribed into <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western.html" title="Western">Western</a> culture as inherently debased, minor, or "funny", argues Marta Zajac, who has theorized the belittling and ridicule of toilet paper holders as being a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masculine.html" title="Masculine">masculine</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domination.html" title="Domination">domination</a> strategy. Zajac has used the masculinist "<a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_humour.html" title="Toilet humour">toilet humour</a>" to show that toilet paper holders are <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gendered</a> <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminine.html" title="Feminine">feminine</a> in two different ways. Firstly, the domestic <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a> defined by gender is epitomized in the toilet, the most feminine place in the house, where men often feel compelled to re-mark the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territory.html" title="Territory">territory</a> as masculine and as "theirs" by urinating outside the bowl, in order to feel psychologically able to use the facilities at all. Secondly, the toilet paper holder, being "<a href="../../../d/o/o/Door_furniture.html" title="Door furniture">door furniture</a>", is a thing that women view more often than men, a site where women can subvert the dominant paradigm by using their sexual difference, i.e. by sitting facing the door as opposed to standing facing the wall, thereby seeing the paper holder. To men, who see only the wall behind the pot, the paper holder is an "invisible" art object, a suggestion which could be taken to account for the ignorance and <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scepticism.html" title="Scepticism">scepticism</a> of the history of these artefacts which prevail in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarchy.html" title="Patriarchy">patriarchal</a> societies.</p>
<p>These gender attitudes can be read behind the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiotics.html" title="Semiotics">semiotics</a> of the symbols ♀ and ♂, which, for Zajac, deconstruct the feminine and masculine spaces involved in this power-driven transaction. Or, put into layman's terms, if you squint a little, you can see the symbols as aerial views of a woman (represented by an o) facing a door, and a man (also represented by an o) sending a proud stream far afield in a random direction.</p>

Eliot</a> described this phrase as "perhaps the most finely layered tissue of cultural allusion in the whole of the poem" (<i>The Sacred Wood</i>, p. 73). The phrase becomes further complicated when it reappears in several different languages, including Old Norse, in another Modernist classic, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joyce_98cc.html" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnegan%27s_Wake_1f08.html" title="Finnegan's Wake">Finnegan's Wake</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>).</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, the song <i>Hold on (I'm coming)</i> by the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_soul.html" title="Southern soul">Southern soul</a> duo <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_%26_Dave_5a54.html" title="Sam &amp; Dave">Sam &amp; Dave</a> was released by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stax_Records_5e47.html" title="Stax Records">Stax Records</a>. It has been the subject of some conjecture that the iconic song has the motif of an empty toilet paper holder in a moment of need, although it is unclear whether it was Sam Moore or Dave Prater with the urgent requirement. However it is equally likely that the song refers to a famous European historical event, as the pair were well travelled.</p>
