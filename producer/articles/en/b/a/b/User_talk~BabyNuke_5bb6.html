<p>Yes, a template makes sense. At present though, 1/2 of the relevant material or articles aren't yet written, or are in draft from only. Once various editors get those in order, then a template would be an obvious navigational aid. Much of my current work on the article agrees with your suggestion -- I'm trying to farm off the major areas to their own articles, or as you say "larger sections be given their own smaller articles" (ie, <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Summary style</a>).</p>
<p>I've set the titling issue to one side for now, though. Rather than discuss it now, may I make a suggestion? Let's get the asa article done, and a couple of others being drafted, and then look at them overall. My concern here is that the field itself has confusing namings, and in trying to copy those we're inheriting their contradictions. For example, zoophilia to many people means sex with animals, its widest use seems to be affinity/attraction/sexuality, and psychologically its a paraphilia. Culturally zoosexuality is identical to zoophilia but in sexology its utterly a different concept. technically much of "zoophilia" actually relates to zoosexuality, only its more commonly known as zoophilia. The present titles try to respect the major uses of the main terms - and you're right, it's probably worth discussing (in the sense its logical but doesn't match people's expectations).</p>
<p>What I'd do to solve this, if you're agreeable, is tackle it the other way round: move what we need to into separate focussed articles, summary style (makes it simpler), then look at what's left, consider what articles (covering what) should be useful or what confusions exist, and <i>then</i> discuss between editors what titles each should be given individually to the necessary articles (based upon their content and focus).</p>

<p>Hello BabyNuke. I believe your intentions with the article are correct and honourable. I also believe some editors have not presented you with a complete picture of the issues core to zoophilia. Indeed, zoophilia and zoosexuality are exactly the same in the literature. You are completely correct in this regard. And you have said that there are problems with the images and with argumentative elements in the article. That is correct. The article will never approach neutrality if pro-zoophiles are allowed to take the facts, and warp them into "psychologists understand more about zoophilia, so they support zoophilia". For what its worth, I consider zoophilia to be very similar to pedophilia. From what I have read, most of the research also agrees with this. The article is lacking reasoning why people, legislations, and ethical thinkers also consider this to be true. All it needs is a bit of NPOVing. I see no reason to make the article anti-zoophile. I believe you have already been helpful in increasing neutrality. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJHartley_ebb3.html" title="User:JHartley">JHartley</a> 06:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll very much agree that the two may be very similar from a psychological point of view, but the consequences of the act are not. As for ethical thinkers, their opinions vary. The example you gave was from a Christian point of view and seeing as the bible strongely condems bestiality, his conclusion was only to be expected. People in general think its wrong because they conform to society. Do you really believe the average person has given the topic of bestiality any serious thought before arriving to his or her conclusion? Legislation varies world wide and laws aren't always based on logic, I believe up to a few years ago the sentence for having sex with an animal in the UK was worse than for brutally killing one, and I'm pretty sure this is still the case in many other legislations though I'd have to look it up. Does that make sense? Also, a call for a ban in the Netherlands in 2004 was rejected by the Dutch minister of Justice. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyNuke_9e6c.html" title="User:BabyNuke">BabyNuke</a> 10:11, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, you reverted my external link addition (AnimalDB.com) to the Zoophilia article. The first reason you gave was that you think the contribution to the page is questionable. I beg to differ. AnimalDb.com is a searchable database containing information on bestiality publications such as movies, magazines, books and websites. The zoophilia article on wikipedia is, among more, about bestiality. Several (or possibly all) persons and movies named in the pornography section are also in the database. The database is the largest in his kind. Your second argument for removing the link is that the database possibly has illegal content for somecountries. I believe you are right regarding the fact in itself that some of the websites content might be illegal in some countries, because the database contains cover images for the movies and magazines. But again I have a different opinion about this being a reason not mentioning the link in the wikipedia article. A lot ot the other sources and external links on this articles page do also contain the same kinf of material. If you think this argyment is valid then you should remove al those other links also. I think adding a warning behind the link should be enough. I started a discussion on the zoophilia talk page. <a href="../../../i/k/2E/User%7EIk.pas.aan_d1ab.html" title="User:Ik.pas.aan">Ik.pas.aan</a> 18:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear BabyNuke,</p>
<p>I decided to pester you as I saw your editing of automotive-related articles, and the fact that you are Dutch (did I mention that I <b>LOVE</b> the Netherlands and Dutch people?) As you might know, procuring high-quality copyright-free images of cars has become a rather important priority for the Wikipedia car community now. While we are making much progress with regard to current and recent models, photos of historic cars, especially rare models, prove relatively hard to make, as they are obviously not that easy to make. Therefore, several users have started to email owners of historic cars, enthusiast clubs and similar organizations to ask for permission to use their photos on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I have just discovered a <a href="http://www.delest.nl/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.delest.nl/index.html" rel="nofollow">website</a> of an interesting company located in Vlaardingen, called "Garage de l'Est BV", which, if I understand correctly, deals in French classic cars. They have a very nice gallery of photos of cars they deal in (including non-French cars too), and I thought it would be great if they could grant us permission to use the photos on Wikipedia. I believe this would be mutually beneficial, as we would obviously have to specify and link to the source of photos, so everybody who would be interested and click the picture would hear about them.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether you could do Wikipedia a favor and write them a nice and very convincing email with such proposition, explaining the nature of Wikipedia and everything related to it. What would be needed is an email reply from them stating that they allow the use of the photos found in <a href="http://www.delest.nl/indexnew.html?main=/html/archief.html" class="external text" title="http://www.delest.nl/indexnew.html?main=/html/archief.html" rel="nofollow">their photo archive</a> in all language versions of the Wikipedia, as well as modifying them for Wikipedia purposes (I believe some of the pics should be cropped before using in articles). If you would find time to do that, both I and, I believe, the entire Wikipedia community, would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and tot ziens&#160;:D</p>

<dd>Whoops! Seems like my tiny brain failed to do its homework again. I've been talking about the "Photo Archive" only, but there are also nice photos of cars currenlty on offer in the <i>"Vorraadlijst"</i> section. When you wrote to Mr. Stedehouder, did you specify that it is about "photos from the archive", or just "photos from the website"?

<p>Hi! As you might have seen, you're efforts were unfortunately nullified by the application of some strange WP policy that orders immediate deletion of images with permissions! While I am contemplating going against the whole system and proposing changing the policy, it will surely take some and I do not expect it to be overly successful, as WP tends prone to a considerable amount of inertia.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was suggested that the images would have to be licensed by Mr. Stedehouder under e.g. Creative Commons v. 2.5. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/deed.nl" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/deed.nl" rel="nofollow">Here is the Dutch version</a>. I wanted to ask you what are your feelings about that - would you think it would even be worth asking Mr. Stedehouder to consider that?

<dd>In Dutch: Goede avond, nee hoor, geen probleem.</dd>
<dd>Tranlsated: Good evening, no, this is not a problem.</dd>
<dd>So the Creative Commons tag can be applied. I'll update the permissions page accordingly. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyNuke_9e6c.html" title="User:BabyNuke">BabyNuke</a> 20:47, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoops - seems like some misunderstanding ensued! I did not intend to make you e-mail Mr. Stadehouder, just to find out your opinion. I have also asked some admins proficient in copyright issues how it should be properly done, and unfortunately it seems it would not be so easy. Here is what <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">User:Durin</a> advised:</dd>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;"><i>I think I would make it clear to Mr. Stedehouder what the ramifications are of releasing the images under that license and noting the numbers of mirrors and forks. He will have no control over the images once released under that license. If he's comfortable with that, then great.<br />
I would seek a blanket statement from him regarding all images on his website releasing them under terms of CC 2.5. Make sure he understands the ramifications of that release; anyone can use them for any purpose, including commercial purposes. If he doesn't want to release all pictures, I would get a list of pictures he is willing to release under those terms. Then, attach his communication to each image on the image's page, under licensing. That will clarify the copyright situation.</i></td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>

<dd>I believe Durin is right on the money concerning that - Wikipedia content is regularly uploaded in bulk by sites like answers.com which maintain their own versions of the encyclopedia. While this is absolutely legal, Wikipedia has no control over that. Moreover, people can simply download any image licensed under CC and legally use it for any purpose, and WP has no control over that either.</dd>
<dd>As concerns technicalities, <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">User:Interiot</a> pointed towards a solution he used for <a href="../../../4/5/0/Image%7E450SELI_0411.jpg_5ca5.html" title="Image:450SELI 0411.jpg">an image acquired in a smiliar way</a> - take note of the link in the description page, which leads to a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Requests" class="extiw" title="commons:User:Interiot/Requests">dedicated subpage</a> - although the contents of the Interiot's email correspondence are probably too vague in their wording for our case, where a few hundred pictures are concerned.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, I am compelled to ask you whether you could be so kind and email Mr. Stedehouder again explaining to him that we want to make sure he is informed of all the caveats concerning licensing images under CC, and that it if he still agrees, we would be obliged if he stated expressly in his reply that he wishes to license all the photographs of cars that can be found in his website under Creative Commons Attribution license version 2.5. Thanks in advance if you find time and will to do that, but I of course understand if you won't.

<dd>He has agreed to the use of the CC 2.5 license of which the conditions were made known to him. The link provided to the C.C. 2.5 summary states the implications, including the explicit statement that images could be used commercially. I don't want to keep bothering him with issues that do not concern him, nor me for that matter. Furthermore, I assume Mr.Stedehouder speaks English as does 99% of the Dutch population, so you could always e-mail him yourself. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyNuke_9e6c.html" title="User:BabyNuke">BabyNuke</a> 11:53, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow! Thanks an unbelievable lot for that! That's great news for all of us I guess!

<p>Now, I have read a bit about such permissions on WP and I think it would be the best if you could forward those emails (along with a translation, preferably) to "permissions at wikimedia dot org", as well as post a relevant notice @ <a href="../../../s/u/c/Wikipedia%7ESuccessful_requests_for_permission_22f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Successful requests for permission">Wikipedia:Successful requests for permission</a>. I know it is a bit of a hassle, but I have only just learned of that and I neither have the access to your mailbox nor can translate from Dutch&#160;:( Het spijt me&#160;:(</p>
<p>I hope you will find time to do that - if you do and receive a confirmation from the PR department that everything's OK, please let me know, so I will add an appropriate note to the description of the Simca pic, so that it could serve as a template&#160;:D</p>
