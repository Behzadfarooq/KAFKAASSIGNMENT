The album (re-releaed in late 2004) contains 8 songs, two songs are 
by Baby himself, there are at least 3 other songs out there, but as 
of today they have not been released. Baby Huey died of heart attack 
on October 28 1970. He was found dead in his bathroom. He was buried 
on November 1 1970 in Richmond, Indiana, state where he was born.

<p>Hmmm... this is what is was on the original bio and you reverted it like a vandal, then the bio I placed there was reverted and you say it's no good, now exact same thing is there and you accept it, great, goes to show your ignorance and bad judgment based on stereotyping others who know much more than you... Revert yourself and your copy bio of the photo of James and revert your brain with curps.</p>
<p>Ignorance of the reversion, by herostratus and curps, there is no copyright, against contradictory evidence, if it's copyrighted,then those linkx should not even be posted here.. <a name="Protection_requested" id="Protection_requested"></a></p>

<p>Protection requested on this article to be as it was on February 3rd, from vandals like Herostratus who can not accept the truth but eventually will say things that something is copyrighted, as everything else is in his head, vandalising this site and the rest, no, not George Reeves dude was reverting but another guy who is James Huey fan. Again, protection against Herostratus the vandal requested...</p>

<p>The original stub expansion by the George Reeves dude was essentially a cut-and-paste job from allmusic.com. It is a violation of US copyright law to directly copy material without permission.</p>
<p>By using different IPs, the George Reeves dude was able to fool protectors into reverting back to the copyvio version. Anyway, I rewrote the article, mainly but not entirely using the allmusic.com material as a source, so it is no longer copyvio. Just revert back to my version of 12 February 2006 (unless later improvements have been made) <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 23:42, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>James Ramey</b> was a singer who fronted a Chicago based, rock/soul outfit that went by the name of Baby Huey &amp; The Babysitters. Baby Huey was the name that James Ramey used when with the band.</p>
<p>Birth Name: James Ramey<br />
Born: Jan 1, 1944 in Richmond, IN<br />
Died: Oct 28, 1970 in Chicago, IL<br />
Buried: November 1 1970, Richmond, IN</p>
<p>A locally beloved figure on the Chicago soul scene, Baby Huey never achieved quite the same renown outside of his hometown, despite an exciting live act and a record on Curtis Mayfield's Curtom label. Born James Ramey in Richmond, IN, on January 1, 1944, Baby Huey was literally an enormous stage presence: a glandular problem kept his weight around 350-400 pounds and beyond. He began performing in Chicago clubs in 1963 with his backing band the Babysitters and soon became a popular concert draw. As the '60s wore on, Baby Huey's sound moved from energetic RB into a more psychedelic brand of soul/rock with a vocal style that drew comparisons to Otis Redding. He signed with Curtom and recorded a debut album, The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend, that featured several Curtis Mayfield songs (most notably the oft-sampled "Hard Times" and "Mighty Mighty Children"), plus a cover of Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come." Sadly, Baby Huey didn't live to see it released.<br />
The album (re-releaed in late 2004) contains 8 songs, two songs are by Baby himself, there are at least 3 other songs out there, but as of today they have not been released. Baby Huey died of heart attack on October 28 1970. He was found dead in his bathroom. He was buried on November 1 1970 in Richmond, Indiana, state where he was born.<br />
his weight and substance-abuse problems were exacting a steep toll on his body. The album was released early the next year (1971). In the years since, Baby Huey's lone LP has become a sought-after collectible among soul fanatics. Baby Huey was an undiscovered talent. Some call him the grand-father of hip-hop.<br />

<p>I'm interested to know the name of the glandular disorder Ramey is said to have had. If he did have one, it must have been diagnosed by a physician, and if the diagnosis is public then there must be a source. A glandular disorder must have a diagnostic name. Is he supposed to have been hypothyroid? Hypothyroidism is easily treated. Usually a "glandular disorder" turn out to be plain old overeating. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicmart_227d.html" title="User:Nicmart">Nicmart</a> 05:11, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Back then in 1970 it was much not easy discovering a disease. And it's possible glandular disorder did not exist, but... in his condition he would not have lasted much longer, may be a year. This is a genetical disease.</p>

<p>It's time they release his other singles.</p>
