<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth%27s_called_shot_509c.html" title="Edit section: The dispute">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The dispute</span></h2>
<p>There is no dispute over the general events of the moment. All the reports say that the Cubs "bench jockeys" were riding Ruth mercilessly, and that Ruth, rather than ignoring them, was "playing" with them through words and gestures.</p>
<p>The longtime debate is over the nature of one of Ruth's gestures. Did he point to center field, to the pitcher, or, perhaps to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> bench? Even the films of the at-bat that emerged during the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> have not drawn any definitive conclusions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charley_Root_dc6e.html" title="Charley Root">Charley Root</a>'s first pitch to Ruth was a called strike. Ruth then looked over at the Cubs dugout and raised his right hand, and extended one of his fingers. Root missed with the next two pitches, but the next pitch was a called strike, and the crowd again cheered loudly. Ruth then waved back at the Cubs dugout and held up two fingers. He began to shout at Root, and it is at this point Ruth made a pointing gesture in the direction of Root, center field, or to the Cubs bench.</p>
<p>Root's next pitch was a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curveball.html" title="Curveball">curveball</a> that Ruth blasted at least 440 feet to the deepest part of center field near the flag pole (some estimates are as high as 490 feet). Calling the game over the radio, broadcaster <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Manning_e221.html" title="Tom Manning">Tom Manning</a> shouted, "The ball is going, going, going, high into the center field stands...and it is a home run!" Newsreel footage shows that as he rounded first base, Ruth looked toward the Cubs <a href="../../../d/u/g/Dugout.html" title="Dugout">dugout</a> and made a waving off gesture with his left hand; then as he approached third, he made another mocking gesture, a two-armed "push" motion, toward the suddenly quiet Cubs bench. Many reports have claimed that Ruth "thumbed his nose" at the Cubs dugout, but the existing newsreel footage does not show that (if it occurred, it might have been considered vulgar and would have been edited out). Sitting in a box behind home plate, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_4d26.html" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>, soon to be elected 32nd <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>, even had a laugh as he watched Ruth round the bases. When he crossed home plate, Ruth could no longer hide his smile, and he was patted by his exuberant teammates when he reached the Yankees dugout.</p>
<p>On Root's next pitch, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Gehrig_2b64.html" title="Lou Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> followed Ruth's homer with his second home run, a shot to right field that knocked Root out of the game. The <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankees.html" title="Yankees">Yankees</a> won the game 7-5 and, the next day, the Yankees finished off the demoralized Cubs 13-6 completing the four game sweep. The "called shot" homer was Ruth's last World Series hit.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth%27s_called_shot_509c.html" title="Edit section: Origins of the called shot story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins of the called shot story</span></h2>
<p>Ruth's second home run in game 3 probably would have been merely an exclamation point for the 1932 World Series and for Ruth's career, had it not been for <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporter.html" title="Reporter">reporter</a> Joe Williams. Williams was a respected but opinionated <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports.html" title="Sports">sports</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editing.html" title="Editing">editor</a> for the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripps-Howard_4e26.html" title="Scripps-Howard">Scripps-Howard</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspapers.html" title="Newspapers">newspapers</a>. In a late edition the same day of the game, Williams wrote this <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headline.html" title="Headline">headline</a> that appeared in the <i>New York World-Telegram</i>, "RUTH CALLS SHOT AS HE PUTS HOME NO. 2 IN SIDE POCKET." Williams summary of the story included, "In the fifth, with the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Cubs</a> riding him unmercifully from the bench, Ruth pointed to center and punched a screaming liner to a spot where no ball had been hit before." Apparently Williams's article was the only one written the day of the game that made a reference to Ruth pointing to center field. It was probably due to the wide <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper_circulation.html" title="Newspaper circulation">circulation</a> of the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripps-Howard_4e26.html" title="Scripps-Howard">Scripps-Howard</a> newspapers that gave the story life, as many read Williams article and assumed it was accurate. A couple of days later, other stories started to appear stating that Ruth had called his shot, a few even written by reporters who were not at the game.</p>
<p>At the time, Ruth did not clarify the matter, initially stating that he was merely pointing towards the Cubs <a href="../../../d/u/g/Dugout.html" title="Dugout">dugout</a> to tell them he still had one more strike. In another interview, this one with respected <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> sports <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporter.html" title="Reporter">reporter</a> John Carmichael, Ruth said he did not point to any particular spot, but that he just wanted to give the ball a good ride. Soon, however, the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a>-savvy Ruth was going along with the story that he had called his shot, and his subsequent versions over the years became more dramatic. On one <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsreel.html" title="Newsreel">newsreel</a> footage, Ruth voiced over the called shot scene with the remarks, "Well, I looked out at center field and I pointed. I said, 'I'm gonna hit the next pitched ball right past the flagpole!' Well, the good <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">Lord</a> must have been with me." In his <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a>, Ruth gave another enhanced version by stating he dreamed about hitting the home run the night before the game. Ruth explained he was upset about the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Cubs</a> insults during the series, and was especially upset when someone spat on his wife Claire, and he was determined to fix things. Ruth not only said he deliberately pointed to center with two strikes, he said he pointed to center even before Root's first pitch.</p>
<p>Others helped perpetuate the story over the years. Tom Meany, who worked for Joe Williams at the time of the called shot, later wrote a popular but often embellished <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">biography</a> of Ruth. In the book, Meany wrote, "He pointed to center field. Some say it was merely as a gesture towards Root, others that he was just letting the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Cubs</a> bench know that he still had one big one left. Ruth himself has changed his version a couple of times...Whatever the intent of the gesture, the result was, as they say in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, slightly colossal."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the article he wrote on the day of the game appears to have been the source of the entire legend, over the ensuing years, Joe Williams himself came to doubt the veracity of Ruth calling his shot.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the called shot further became etched as truth into the minds of thousands of people after the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">film</a> "The Babe Ruth Story", which starred <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Bendix_58c2.html" title="William Bendix">William Bendix</a> as Ruth. The film took its material from Ruth's <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a>, and hence made no doubt of the veracity of the called shot. In the film (by consensus a poorly made film), Bendix is making such an obvious pointing gesture to center field that the called shot scene is almost comical.</p>

</ul>
<p>The called shot particularly irked Root. He had a fine career, winning over 200 games, but he would be forever remembered as the pitcher who gave up the "called shot" — much to his annoyance. When he was asked to play himself in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">film</a> about Ruth, Root turned it down when he learned that Ruth's pointing to <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_field.html" title="Center field">center field</a> would be in the film. Said Root, "Ruth did not point at the fence before he swung. If he had made a gesture like that, well, anybody who knows me knows that Ruth would have ended up on his ass. The legend didn't get started until later."</p>
<p>In 1942, during the making of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pride_of_the_Yankees_2165.html" title="The Pride of the Yankees">The Pride of the Yankees</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Herman_3f25.html" title="Babe Herman">Babe Herman</a> (who was at that time a teammate of Root with the minor league <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Stars_3a2e.html" title="Hollywood Stars">Hollywood Stars</a>) was employed as body double for both Ruth (playing himself, but already too sick to convincingly swing a bat) and Gary Cooper (who played <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Gehrig_2b64.html" title="Lou Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>). Herman re-introduced Root and Ruth on set and the following exchange (later recounted by Herman to baseball historian Donald Honig), took place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root: You never pointed out to center field before you hit that ball off me did you?</li>
<li>Ruth: I know I didn't, but it made a hell of a story, didn't it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Root went to his grave vehemently denying that Ruth ever pointed to center field.</p>

A still of Ruth pointing during the at-bat.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the 1970's, a <a href="../../../1/6/_/16_mm.html" title="16 mm">16 mm</a> home movie of the called shot surfaced and some believed it might put an end to the decades-old controversy. The film was shot by an amateur <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filmmaker.html" title="Filmmaker">filmmaker</a>. Only family and friends had seen the film until it appeared on a February, 1994 Fox TV program called "Front Page." Later in 1994, still images from the film appeared in <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filmmaker.html" title="Filmmaker">filmmaker</a> <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Burns_1dcd.html" title="Ken Burns">Ken Burns</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_film.html" title="Documentary film">documentary film</a> <i><a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_%28documentary%29.html" title="Baseball (documentary)">Baseball</a></i>.</p>
<p>The film was taken from the grandstands behind home plate, off to the third base side. One can clearly see Ruth's gesture, although it is hard to determine the angle of his pointing. Many who have watched the film became believers in the called shot after having previously doubted it; however, others remained unconvinced. Some contend Ruth's extended arm is pointing more to the <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_field.html" title="Left field">left field</a> direction, toward the Cubs bench. Others who have studied the film closely assert that in addition to the broader gestures, Ruth did make a quick finger point in the direction of the pitcher or center field just as Root was winding up.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the still and is more evident in the film, Cubs catcher Hartnett actually had his back to Ruth at the time of the gesture.</p>
<p>For a list of publications and media outlets that have featured this rare footage, go to <a href="http://www.thecalledshot.com" class="external free" title="http://www.thecalledshot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecalledshot.com</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, another <a href="../../../1/6/_/16_mm.html" title="16 mm">16 mm</a> film of the called shot appeared. This one had been shot by Harold Warp, and coincidentally it was the only major league baseball game Warp ever attended. The rights to his footage were sold to <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> which aired it as part of the network's <i>Athletes of the Century</i> program in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. Warp's film has not been as widely seen by the public as has Kandle's, but those who have seen it and offered a public opinion seem to feel that it shows Ruth did not call his shot.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The myth is dead,"</i> said ESPN producer, Mark Shapiro, <i>"He was clearly pointing at the Cub dugout. He wasn't pointing at center field."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"To me it looks as if he was pointing toward the Cubs dugout. If he were pointing toward the seats, his arm would be elevated a bit more,"</i> said the man who brought the film to light, Warp's great nephew, James Jacobs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The authors of the book <i>Yankees Century</i> also believe the Warp film proves conclusively that home run was not at all a "called shot".</p>
<p>Despite all the abuse from the Cubs players and fans, Ruth would later say he never had so much fun in all his life the day of his famous home run. His longtime friend <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Frick_a6e5.html" title="Ford Frick">Ford Frick</a> once tried to get the truth from Ruth. Frick asked him, "Did you really point to the bleachers?" The coy Ruth would answer back, "It's in the papers, isn't it?" Ruth may have not called his home run, but the called shot is probably the most famous moment of his career.</p>

The <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Ruth_737f.html" title="Baby Ruth">Baby Ruth</a> sign outside Wrigley Field, as seen during the 1935 World Series, three years after the "Called Shot"</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Shortly after the called shot, the Chicago based <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss_Candy_Company_19dc.html" title="Curtiss Candy Company">Curtiss Candy Company</a>, makers of the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Ruth_737f.html" title="Baby Ruth">Baby Ruth</a> candy bar, installed a large advertising sign on the rooftop on one of the apartment buildings on Sheffield Avenue. The sign, which read "Baby Ruth", was just across the street from where Ruth's home run had landed. Until the 1970's, when the sign was taken down, Cubs fans at Wrigley Field had to endure this not-so-subtle reminder of the "called shot."</p>
<p>In a 1991 <a href="../../../m/a/r/Married_with_Children_d13d.html" title="Married with Children">Married with Children</a> episode, Al Bundy points to Center Field like <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth.html" title="Ruth">Ruth</a>, holds his hand like the mythic <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_at_the_Bat_1e8f.html" title="Casey at the Bat">Casey at the Bat</a> and then makes a speech, reminscent of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Gerhig_f158.html" title="Lou Gerhig">Lou Gehrig's</a> "luckiest man" speech, saying that he is done with baseball. The last scene of the episode is taken from the movie <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_Men_Out_374c.html" title="Eight Men Out">Eight Men Out</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, there was a <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Light_c857.html" title="Bud Light">Bud Light</a> commercial showing the called shot. Instead of appearing to point to center field, it appears he's pointing to a vendor selling <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Light_c857.html" title="Bud Light">Bud Light</a>.</p>
<p>In the third season (1992) episode of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, "<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_at_the_Bat_6905.html" title="Homer at the Bat">Homer at the Bat</a>," Homer points to right field. He then hits a home run straight into left field. After pondering this for a second, he points to left field.</p>
<p>The 2006 movie, The Benchwarmers, showed David Spade pointing to Center Field then moving his finger downward when everyone turns to see what he is pointing at.</p>
