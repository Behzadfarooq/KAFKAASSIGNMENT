<p>Was the Babylonian calendar really fully lunar until the 5th century BC? If so, why would regnal years of kings line up more or less with Julian year calculations of eclipse data? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 20:09, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! Somehow that escaped my notice. As far as I know, the Babylonian calendar was always lunisolar, thus it did not drift through the seasons like the present <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_calendar.html" title="Islamic calendar">Islamic calendar</a> does. But before about 499 BC it was purely observational, with the intercalary month being inserted only as needed. I'm changing the article. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 20:53, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[Joe], your assumption that Babylonians had always used the 19-year cycle is false. The cycle was introduced probably in the V century BC. So do you imply that before that time there was no Babylonian calendar? Of course, there was, and Babylonians had to rely solely on the vernal equinox as a point of reference to fix the beginning of the new year in their calendar. This can be seen from the VI BC tablets. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBravehearted_d69c.html" title="User:Bravehearted">Bravehearted</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravehearted_dd0b.html" title="User talk:Bravehearted">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bravehearted_1bca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bravehearted">contribs</a>) 12:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I am well aware that the 19-year cycle only began in 499 BC, with only three minor exceptions until 380 BCE (thereafter there were no exceptions) according to the tables of Parker and Dubberstein (1956). But according to those same tables the earlier Babylonian calendar could not have used any astronomical cues (either the vernal equinox or the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heliacal_rising.html" title="Heliacal rising">heliacal rising</a> of a single star like <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius.html" title="Sirius">Sirius</a>) because there was too much variablility between intercalary months. There was simply no rhyme or reason to the years having an intercalary month before 500 BCE. If they had used an astronomical cue, then they would have introduced an intercalary month every two or three years, but there was a far greater variability in its frequency, so they must have been much more arbitrary in their decision on when to decree it. One possibility is that they used the heliacal risings of many stars, such as those listed in the <a href="../../../m/u/l/MUL.APIN_bd25.html" title="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a> tablets, which allowed the astronomers to pick and chose which heliacal rising to accept or reject, allowing them or the king to aribitrarily decree that almost any year was or was not intercalary. Another possibility is that they may have used environmental clues, as did the later Hebrew calendar prior to the destruction of the Second Temple. Of course, the king could have ignored his astronomers and arbitrarily decreed the intercalary month as he saw fit. A final possibility is that the tables of Parker and Dubberstein are grossly in error, which I reject because those same tables are relied upon as evidence for the use of the 19-year cycle during the last half of the first millennium BCE. Of course, those tables no doubt have a few errors because other cuneiform tablets have been discovered, recognized, or re-interpreted since 1956 (see <a href="http://www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk/Egypt/ptolemies/chron/babylonian/chron_bab_src.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk/Egypt/ptolemies/chron/babylonian/chron_bab_src.htm" rel="nofollow">Sources for Babylonian to Julian Conversion</a>), but their tables cannot have had gross errors. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 03:35, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. Let's settle a couple of facts. First of all, on the basis of the Old Testament we can assume that Hebrews had begun their new calendar year sometime about the vernal equinox, because about the time of the Passover they had to present first freshly harvested barley grains. Also their first month had been called Abib relating to the greenish color of nearly ripe barley. So Jews without using any special system just relied on the looks of barley and also the weather conditions - rain season should have been over and roads fairly dry for the people to come to Jerusalem from all over Israel. But Babylonians who had no Passover also started their new year about the time of the vernal equinox even before the V c BC. This can be clearly shown from the dates of king Nebuchadnesar's reign. If Babylonians did not rely on the spring equinox, then what did they depend on in deciding on the time when their new calendar year should begin? Jews had nearly ripe barley and fairly dry roads, what data did Babylonians have? Because they must have relied on something as they never started their year before the vernal equinox, but alwas in the month starting on or after that day (again, data from Nebuchadnesar's reign). <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBravehearted_d69c.html" title="User:Bravehearted">Bravehearted</a> 17:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The vernal equinox is never mentioned in the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a>. Instead, the first month or Abib had to be a <i>spring</i> month. "Spring" is a three month season which gives the first month great variability in time without violating Jewish law, similar to the variability of the meteorological cues that you mention (the condition of roads and the barley crop). The Babylonians were unaware of precession, that is, they made no distinction between a tropical year event like the vernal equinox and a sidereal year event like the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heliacal_rising.html" title="Heliacal rising">heliacal rising</a> of stars. Indeed, the Babylonian <a href="../../../m/u/l/MUL.APIN_bd25.html" title="MUL.APIN">Mul.Apin</a> tablets (1100–700 BC) specifically state that the constellation <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perseus_%28constellation%29.html" title="Perseus (constellation)">Perseus</a> became visible on 1 Nisanu <a href="http://www.geocities.com/astrologymulapin/mulapinheliacal.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/astrologymulapin/mulapinheliacal.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> without mentioning the vernal equinox. Use of the 19-year cycle after 500 BC <i>does not require</i> the observation of any astronomical cue, either the vernal equinox or the heliacal rising of Perseus—the cycle itself causes the year to begin within half a month of any astronomical cue. The high variability in the interval between intercalary months before 500 BC recorded by Parker and Dubberstein mean that Nisan <i>did</i> occur before the vernal equinox during some years, which is consistent with the heliacal rising of a <i>whole constellation</i> rather than a specific star (like Sirius for the Egyptians). Your rather vague assertion that the year began "about the time of the vernal equinox" during the reign of King <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebuchadrezzar_II_0513.html" title="Nebuchadrezzar II">Nebuchadnezzar</a> is not contradicted by Parker and Dubberstein. But the Babylonians themselves stated that they used the heliacal rising of stars, not the vernal equinox, to regulate their year before 500 BC. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 08:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you please cite at least one Babylonian document where Nisan 1 fell before the vernal equinox? I haven't read what Parker said about Babylonian documents from VI BC, but I know what he noted on the subject of double dated Elephantine papyri where in one case Jews recorded a date suggesting Nisan 1 falling before the vernal equinox - Parker said this only shows they had poor knowledge of Babylonian calendar or made a mistake - please see <a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/2000/130pdf/130159.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/2000/130pdf/130159.pdf" rel="nofollow">Sacha Stern, The Babylonian Calendar at Elephantine z Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik 130 (2000) 159-171</a>, as far as I remember Parker's comment is cited somewhere in footnotes. And as far as Jews go, there was no much possibility of greater variation from the time of vernal equinox as all Jewish feasts had to fit in certain seasons of the year to bring the proper kind of crops required by the law or to arrive in Jerusalem when they wouldn't have had to travel in dirt, rain and cold. Isn't that strange that Persians, Babylonians, Israelites, Assyrians and other nations in the regions started their new calendar year about the time of the vernal equinox? It is strange you shift this aside as I have heard the vernal equinox mentioned many times by people writing on the Babylonian calendar. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBravehearted_d69c.html" title="User:Bravehearted">Bravehearted</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravehearted_dd0b.html" title="User talk:Bravehearted">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bravehearted_1bca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bravehearted">contribs</a>) 19:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>
