<p>Hey, does anyone know how the Babylon Rogues story in the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> comics worked out? I don't have the comics and can't find scans like that anywhere, so I can't fill in the information beyond where it is at this point. Besides which, I'm an avid comics fan, and I'd very much like to know. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenjo_59ed.html" title="User:Denjo">User:Denjo</a> 20:22, 28 March 2007</p>

<dd>Well, for one, it says so on the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Riders_aaca.html" title="Sonic Riders">Sonic Riders</a> article, Concept Mobius also stated that (but now the site has gone defunct). But, I do agree Storm sounds a lot more like Madeleine's voice. Oh, and, where's YOUR source for it being Madeleine's voice (does it say it in the manual, I can't remember) <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeRsCoRe_0e72.html" title="User:UnDeRsCoRe">UnDeRsCoRe</a> 22:43, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A few paragraphs down actually. Earlier, everyone was <i>so</i> convinced it was Blaustein.

<dd>This actually only seemed to start when some IP address put "Unknown" for his voice actor and wrote a sentence in trivia sentence that <i>"Storm's voice has said to voiced by many including Tom Moboka, Madeleine Blaustein, Dan Green. The true voice of him is unknown and uncertain."</i>. But, if it's is Madeleine or Dan you can't really cite a manual or credits at the end of the game. <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeRsCoRe_0e72.html" title="User:UnDeRsCoRe">UnDeRsCoRe</a> 23:27, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just alittle theory. Since it's stated in the games that the Babylonian Rogues were punished by gods, and Chaos is the only official "god" figure in the Sonic universe, I wonder if it's possible that there are other gods like Chaos in the series, or if Chaos was the one that punished them. That'd be interesting to know.</p>
<p>I think Tails was just talking about <i>the</i> God. Chaos was probably still in the Master Emerald when the Babylonians were killed. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadoman_5a39.html" title="User:Shadoman">Shadoman</a>, 23 March 2006</p>
<p>As this is a kids game, they wouldn't include "the" God. They don't mix religion with video games very often, so, I don't think that's what there talking about. Although I do totally agree with you that Chaos was probably still trapped in the Master Emerald... Although, it is totally possible the the Babylonians were around at the exact same time as the Echidnas, before Chaos was sealed, as there were supposedly many clans around at that time of the Echidnas that were waring with eachother (more like the Echidnas were waring with everybody else). It was never stated when they existed or when they fell (unless I forgot), so anything is plausible. ~ Ultimate Perfect Chaos 03:20, 4 May 2006 (UTC) ~</p>
<p>on sonic riders when you highlight the babylongardian level wer you defear the genie thing it says beat the "god" of the babylonians or somminlike that</p>
<p>is it possible that the god that punished them was the Gizoid?</p>

<p>You know, the Jet picture should move up cause it looks like Jet is Wave. --anon</p>

<p>I'm looking at updating the Sonic template - should the Babylon Rogues be categorized neutral or villains? I'm leaning towards keeping them neutral. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHntr_2e75.html" title="User:ShadowHntr">Alex</a> 21:52, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Neutral, AKA, anti-heroes. That's where they should be put. The rogues are thieves, yes, but they still have common enemies with some heroes. As stated in both Jet's theme song, and by Jet himself in the game, they don't want advanced technology or world domination--just treasure. Rouge is kind of like this, but she wants JEWELS. And she's also a government spy. Also, she more treasure 'hunter' than jewel thief. The Rogues are straight-out thieves, and will take any real treasure--namely, jewels, gems, gold, silver, money, etc. --<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltima_the_Hedgehog_4023.html" title="User:Ultima the Hedgehog">Ultimate</a> 21:58, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Storm's voice actor is Ted Elliot according to IMDB. And Stolen was the 13th Leader of the Babylon Rogues.<a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukecchi_b715.html" title="User:Sukecchi">Sukecchi</a> 20:17, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who the hell is Stolen? I've been playing riders extensively but I never heard of Stolen. Where did you get this? <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToastypk_a70f.html" title="User:Toastypk">Toastypk</a> 17:21, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It confused me at first, also, as I thought it meant that something was 'stolen,' but it's confirmed that <i>Stolen</i> was the 13th leader of the Babylon Rogues. He's probably also the one who developed the first Extreme Gear. The Extreme Gear allowed them to 'fly' without having to struggle to do so. My guess is that Wave is younger, thinner, and smaller, and she can fly a lot easier than Jet and Storm. These are unusual birds, you know. They are much larger than ordinary ones. Oh, and it's found in the note that Eggman reads after they beat the Babylon Guardian, and claim the treasure of Babylon. --<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltima_the_Hedgehog_4023.html" title="User:Ultima the Hedgehog">Ultimate</a> 21:50, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, Storm's voice actor is NOT Ted Elliot. IMDB is not a very reliable source as once in Shadow the Hedgehog, they said <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Humphrey_7497.html" title="David Humphrey">David Humphrey</a> and <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Drummond_1d65.html" title="Ryan Drummond">Ryan Drummond</a> would be returning to play Sonic and Shadow, even though they ended up being played by <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Griffith_7b93.html" title="Jason Griffith">Jason Griffith</a> instead.

Notice that Maddie Blaustien's name is at the bottom of the credits with the likes of Rouge (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_Delaney_8d04.html" title="Kathleen Delaney">Kathleen Delaney</a>) and Cream (<a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebecca_Honig_e355.html" title="Rebecca Honig">Rebecca Honig</a>)? Blaustien plays the two Egg-Robots, as well as the final boss (the giant Babylonian Genie). I DO know that Maddie Blaustien can play deep-sounding characters, but if that was the case for Storm, the character would sound more like Lt. Surge or Solomon Mutou. I think the point was that Jet has the same VA as Sonic, and Storm has the same VA as Knuckles. <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Palant_b5a6.html" title="Amy Palant">Amy Palant</a> played Omochao in addition to Tails, so that was her second job as opposed to playing Wave. If Wikipedia's policy for confirming voice actors for characters in 4Kids related production is just 'guessing' (which it seems to be, check out some of the One Piece character pages), I think that's enough confirmation.</dd>

<dd>Eh, just scrolling through here, and noticed this. Truth is, nothing had been 'specifically' stated about a Season 4. However, translations of TMS Entertainment's website stated a few of their current projects, and Sonic X was listed. If the series was over, they probably wouldn't list it among that. It's safe to assume that is the case. As for the part about the Babylon Rogues appearing, I have know idea where that came from. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it was the case. <i>(P.S. I <b>know</b> about the rumor about Babylon in Season 4.

<p>I noticed that Jet seems to have a resemblence to Shadow, what with the eyes and markings and chest hair. It seems like that should be noted in the articles. 24.196.6.150 08:30, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I beg to differ. Whoop-dee-doo if they both have chest hair and similar eyes and tattoos. It's hardly worthy of a mention in an encyclopedial article. --Danish Ranger 21:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aside from a mention in <i>EuroGamer</i>, there is no evidence <i>Sonic Riders 2</i> is even in development; it's quite possible that plans for such a game have been shelved, and we havn't heard anything about the game since that interview (which took place before <i>Sonic Riders</i> itself was released at the beginning of this year). Although it would be likely that the Rogues would appear in such a game, there is nothing official that says so, and adding the rumours about the Rogues appearing in it is pure fan speculation. As such, I don't think the article should even mention <i>SR2</i>, until there is more info. -- <a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVederJuda_16a3.html" title="User:VederJuda">VederJuda</a> 23:07, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm inclined to agree as much as I would wholly enjoy SR2, there is no official word of it being in development as of yet. Maybe it will come back, who knows. But until that time, I guess we can remove the mention of it. <a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnuckles_sonic8_7940.html" title="User:Knuckles sonic8">Knuckles sonic8</a> 23:32, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
