<p>I noticed Answers.com is running this older and much longer <a href="http://www.answers.com/babe%20ruth" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/babe%20ruth" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>Wikipedia article on Ruth that was a very impressive article. I was wondering why answers.com is running the older Ruth article instead of this current one. With all due respect to the writers of this current Ruth article, this current Ruth bio not organized nor written well, and it really pales in comparison to the older article. What happened to the older article? Thanks Steve M 11/29/2006</p>
<ul>
<li>Length does not equate to quality. The information was not sourced, poorly written, and in some cases, flat out wrong. The current article is well organized and much better written. There are some "flow" issues, but the article is in much better shape than it was.

<dd><a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> - Thanks for fixing the errors you inadvertently included in your revert, however you did not replace the citations I included for Ruth's accolades. Why were these removed? Also, I'm going to assert that this sentence: "Major League Baseball, sportswriters, and fans have recognized Ruth as one of the greatest baseball players of all time" does not violate NPOV precisely because of those citations I had included. Look at this example from <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>: <i>So, rather than asserting, "The Beatles were the greatest band," we can say, "Most Americans believe that the Beatles were the greatest band," which is a fact verifiable by survey results</i>. Please explain how this does not apply in this situation. If you are concerned about showing only one viewpoint, than I would not be adverse to referencing in the same paragraph a credible source that claims Babe Ruth was not one of the greatest baseball players of all time. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattingly23_58f5.html" title="User:Mattingly23">Mattingly23</a> 20:05, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> - As you suggested, I looked at <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a> to determine if this article is close to exceeding the recommended amount of content. It states this about the main body of prose for an article: <i>Readers may tire of reading a page much longer than about 6,000 to 10,000 words, which roughly corresponds to 30 to 50 KB of readable prose. Thus the 32 KB recommendation is considered to have stylistic value in many cases</i>. I copied the main body of text directly from my web browser into Microsoft Word and did a word count. This method states that the article has about 3,200 words, or about half of the recommended length when users should begin to worry about length. Is this the length rule you are referring to or are you using something else as a guideline? - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattingly23_58f5.html" title="User:Mattingly23">Mattingly23</a> 20:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article already communicates that he was named the "greatest" athlete on a number of polls. Beyond that, I don't believe any further comments about his relative greatness are encyclopedic. For perspective, many people make that same statement about <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_Cobb_62bb.html" title="Ty Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Mays_bc08.html" title="Willie Mays">Willie Mays</a>, and others. I would probably remove any other content that is added in about ruth being the greatest baseball player.</dd>
<dd>In regards to the length, the article is approximately 9 pages in length. The supplemental information puts the article onto 10 pages. In reading WP:SIZE, you will see that 12-15 pages is really "pushing" it as far as readability. As I have said, there is definitely some room to work with. However, I think that the length as of now is pretty good. The best thing for the article would be to weed out information about superfluous topics and the "laundry" list of stats that are used. People should not have to be baseball experts to read an article on Ruth (or any player for that matter). The notes section has become splintered with the new sources being added and that might need to be addressed. Another area that needs "help", is the sale section. I will tag it appropriately. // <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 01:15, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My attempt was to write a lead-in to what reads as a "laundry list" of awards. As far as sentences such as this used in other articles, see <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> (<i>Considered by many to be greatest basketball player of all time, he became the most effectively marketed athlete of his generation</i>) and <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> (<i>He is generally regarded as the best player of his era and has been called "the greatest hockey player ever" by many sportswriters, players, coaches, and fans.</i>) I still feel that this sentence is acceptable to include in the article - perhaps it would be even better to remove mentioning the specific awards and just give references to them, since the introduction is not supposed to be too detailed. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattingly23_58f5.html" title="User:Mattingly23">Mattingly23</a> 04:21, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please do not break up comments. If that statement is added to the article, i will remove it. This is not to engage in an edit war, but rather to protect the integrity of this article. Using the Jordan and Gretzky as examples does not help prove your point. What it shows is that these articles need attention. If you want to invite others to the discussion, please do so. Pointing out that he was named the greatest player of all-time in a poll is perfectly acceptable and should satisfy your goals. I generally use the guideline:"Stick to the facts, avoid opinions".

<dd>I'd have to agree on this last part.

I know it's tempting to say how great he was and how many people think he was great (I've been guilty of it and so have "many others") but it's much more effective to give real verifiable info. Just because the articles on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> use peacock terms, doesn't mean this article has to stoop to that level.</dd>

I still can't fully see how <i>Most Americans believe that the Beatles were the greatest band</i> is acceptable but <i>Major League Baseball, sportswriters, and fans have recognized Ruth as one of the greatest baseball players of all time</i> is not when the statement is a cited fact. If someone could clearly explain why the first sentence is acceptable and the second is not I would fully agree with keeping the sentence out of the article. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattingly23_58f5.html" title="User:Mattingly23">Mattingly23</a> 15:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Beatles example mentions that it's verifiable by survey results, etc. If you have reliable sources with similar survey results, then I think it would be okay to include it for Babe Ruth too. Just to simply say "Many consider Babe Ruth to be the best" with no supporting info is bad. You're right that the example at <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is contradictory to <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">WP:PEACOCK</a>.

<p>The stereotypical notion that Ruth's numbers would have been reduced by integration is challenged in the recent book <i>The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs</i>, by Bill Jenkinson. His analysis of every Ruthian home run in regular season, spring training and exhibition games throughout his career indicates that he hit as well against the top Negro League pitchers in exhibitions as he did against the white pitchers that he faced in regular competition. The fact is, Ruth was so far ahead of his time as a slugger that nothing could stop him except his own excesses. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bottom line, America is a very racist country, all humans should be treated equally. With that being said, if one wants to quesion say Barry Bond's records, then the manipulation of who played in the MLB can also be questioned. Specifically the records of all whites before Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. Therefore, the numbers of Gehrig, Cobb, Hornsby, Ruth, part of Ted Williams, etc.. every player that played before does not have relaible or viable because the statistics of blacks who potentially were better but did not have the opportunity to play were not credited. Furthermore, as far as stats, Hank Aaron was the greatest, as far as how the game was played Willie Mays was the greatest but with a white majority the white player is still held in highest regard. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.74.11.76_f29e.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.74.11.76">75.74.11.76</a> (<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User_talk%7E75.74.11.76.html" title="User talk:75.74.11.76">talk</a>) 04:35, 9 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Every country is racist and ethnocentric, America is no different. There is no way to turn the clock back, so all we have is what we have. Aaron was not the "greatest" slugger, he hit them much less frequently than Ruth, he just played more years, and he played a good chunk of his career at a higher altitude, thus inflating his overall career numbers. In modern times, McGwire and maybe Bonds hit them at nearly the same rate as Ruth, albeit with performance enhancers (most likely). Forgetting that, those guys are statistically the closest to Ruth, but it's more than numbers. The impact Ruth had culturally is hard to fully measure. Mays was the greatest I ever saw, but he was not also a pitcher like Ruth was. Ruth hit Negro League pitchers in exhibitions just as hard as he hit regular competition. FYI, Ruth himself had no race prejudices, and was loved by black kids as well as white. He also sometimes had to withstand small-town criticism for playing in mixed-race exhibitions. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Various biographical articles explore areas of interest to some readers, such as a reasonable description of what someone's voice was like. And some possibly interesting facts fit better in a separate section than in "hiding" them in the article. One thing to be aware of is that this article was once much longer and detailed, and some editor cut it down substantially, thus losing lots of detail that is slowly finding its way back in. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:45, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There are various recordings of Ruth's voice that can be used for comparison, for anyone who wants to check it out for themselves. Probably the easiest to get would be <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Pride_of_the_Yankees_624b.html" title="Pride of the Yankees">Pride of the Yankees</a></i>, in which Ruth plays himself in several scenes. Another famous recording, with his voice horribly gravelly from surgery and sounding nothing like his old self, has found its way onto CD's here and there. By contrast, Gary Cooper's flat monotone was not very similar to Gehrig's somewhat higher pitched and New-York-tinged voice, which most everyone has heard thanks to the clip from his "Luckiest man" speech, in which he says "man" with a New York style dipthong. And of course Ray Liotta, with his New York accent, sounds nothing like Shoeless Joe Jackson, but that's getting a tad off base. d:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:56, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
