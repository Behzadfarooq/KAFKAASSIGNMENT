<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/z/Bazooka.html" title="Edit section: Development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Development</span></h2>
<p>The development of the <b>Bazooka</b> involved the development of two specific lines of technology: the rocket-powered (recoilless) weapon, and the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaped-charge.html" title="Shaped-charge">shaped-charge</a> warhead.</p>
<p>The development of the Rocket Powered Recoilless Weapon was the brainchild of Dr. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_H._Goddard_8540.html" title="Robert H. Goddard">Robert H. Goddard</a> as a side project of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenure.html" title="Tenure">tenure</a> at <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester_Polytechnic_Institute_f8fe.html" title="Worcester Polytechnic Institute">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_University_08a1.html" title="Clark University">Clark University</a>, and at <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Wilson_Observatory_e622.html" title="Mount Wilson Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a>, devised a tube rocket for military use during World War I. He successfully demonstrated his tube-fired rocket to the US Army Signal Corps at <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_Proving_Ground_934a.html" title="Aberdeen Proving Ground">Aberdeen Proving Ground</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">November 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, but the end of the war only five days later killed interest in the weapon. Goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the US Government at <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Head_5909.html" title="Indian Head">Indian Head</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>, until 1923, but he then ceased all work on the project, and others picked up where he left off.</p>
<p>The explosive shaped charge dates back to the work of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physicist.html" title="Physicist">physicist</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Edward_Munroe_df67.html" title="Charles Edward Munroe">Charles Edward Munroe</a>, who did the first practical work on the subject in 1880. This work was built on in the 1930s by Henry Mohaupt, a Swiss immigrant who worked on the idea for the War Department.</p>
<p>Mohaupt developed a <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaped_charge.html" title="Shaped charge">shaped-charge</a> <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand_grenade.html" title="Hand grenade">hand grenade</a> for anti-tank use that was effective at defeating up to 100 mm (4 in) of armor, by far the best such weapon in the world at the time. However, the M10 grenade weighed 3.5 lb (1.6 kg) and was difficult to throw and too heavy to function as a <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle_grenade.html" title="Rifle grenade">rifle grenade</a>. The only practical way to use it was to place it directly on the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a>. A smaller version of the M10, the M9, was developed which could be fired from a rifle. This resulted in the creation of the M1 (Springfield M-1903), M2 (Enfield M-1917) and the M7 and M8 for the M1 Rifle, and the M9A1 Grenade which was still Standard A.</p>
<p>Things changed when <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Army_6d69.html" title="US Army">Army</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Leslie A. Skinner suggested placing the grenade on the front of the experimental <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoulder-launched_missile_weapon.html" title="Shoulder-launched missile weapon">rocket launcher</a> he had developed with US ARMY Lieutenant Edward G. Uhl, a weapon looking for a role. Development took place in Corcoran Hall at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_George_Washington_University_361d.html" title="The George Washington University">The George Washington University</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>. By late <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, the <b>Rocket Launcher, M1A1</b> was introduced. This consisted of a 54-inch-long (1.37 m) tube with a simple wooden stock and sights (replaced by metal in the production models), into which the 60.07 mm (designated 2.36-inch to avoid confusion with rounds for the 60 mm mortar) rocket grenades were inserted at the rear. A two-cell dry battery in the buttstock provided a charge to ignite the rocket when the trigger was pulled. The main drawback to the weapon was the large backblast and smoke trail which gave away the position of the shooter (compare to the British <a href="../../../p/i/a/PIAT_3d55.html" title="PIAT">PIAT</a>). The original models were not reinforced for bore-safety, and they added a ring basket at the breech and a deflector at the muzzle of developmental models to control the backblast.</p>
<p>The original model was equipped with a hinged rear sight and fixed front sights. These were followed by a peep rear sight and a front sight in the form of a rectangular frame at the muzzle of the launcher. The vertical sides of the frame carried graduations for ranges of 100, 200 and 300 yards. In the production models, these sights were replaced by an optical ring sight hinged to fold against the tube when not in use, and protected by a cover. It had an adjustable range scale that provided graduations from 50 to 700 yards (46 to 640 meters) in 50 yard increments. The final major changes were the division of the tube into two pieces with bayonet joints for airborne deployment. This changed the weapon specifications to a tube length of 55 inches (1.4 meter) and a weight of 14 lb (6.35 kg), the replacement of the battery with a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28electrical%29.html" title="Magneto (electrical)">magneto</a> operated through the trigger, and a trigger safety that isolated the magneto to prevent the firing dud rounds when the trigger was released and the storage of a charge that would prematurely fire the next round.</p>
<p>The ammunition for the original M9 Launcher was the M6 Series, which finalized as the M6A3 that was 19.4 inches (49.28 cm) long, and weighed 3.38 lb (1.53 kg).</p>

<p>Secretly introduced in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Torch_30e2.html" title="Operation Torch">Operation Torch</a>, it was highly effective, though inherently inaccurate at all but very close ranges.

It was the success of the Panzerschreck that caused the original bazooka to be reworked after the war to the larger 3.5-inch (88.9 mm) model that was identical in size and power to the German weapon.</p>
