<dd>This is not a democracy. This is a serious attempt at creating a respectable encyclopedia. We want everyone to contribute positively, but we won't tolerate nonsense, abuse, etc. Your edit, "<i>Carlsberg don't do cities but if they did, then Limerick would probably....</i>" makes no sense, and does not contribute to the encyclopedia value of the <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> article. You are welcome to argue your case, but seeing as you don't actually have one, it might not help you any. Please re-read the message I first posted here; it was friendly and even-tempered. Your response to me was not. This is a community effort, so please try to act as you would with people in real life. Again please take a look at the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">welcome page</a> if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia.

<dd>By all means, then, explain what your edit means. First of all, it makes no grammatical sense, and means nothing to anyone who is not familiar with it. Wikipedia tries to represent a world view, so if you can rephrase it, and explain it, then perhaps it can be included in the article. If you're simply looking to pick a fight, then good day to you. - <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltbluetony_df3f.html" title="User:Cobaltbluetony">CobaltBlueTony</a> 14:54, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am openly and honestly trying to engage you in understanding your edit. If it is indeed an essential element of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a>, and noteworthy, then why would we not want it to be included? I'll ask you again, please elucidate your edit and explain it to me, and I can help you find an effective way to include it if it is indeed worth of mention. This process of discussion assists us in including information which may otherwise be overlooked.</dd>
<dd>I apologize if you considered my response summarily judgemental. I work hard to fight <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">vandalism</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">opinionated edits</a> to keep Wikipedia encyclopedia and neutral. Since your edit seemed opinionated, but at the least grammatically nonsensical, I reverted it. If you believe it should be included, then discuss it with me. I am not an administrator; vandalism reversion is the privilege of every editor! And so is discussion, to 'fight' for your views to be proplery and accurately represented if it is deemed encyclopedia and noteworthy. Please do not become so quickly discouraged, or you will not develop the skills and talents valued in good Wikipedians.

<p>Your use of the word "alleged" in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_Campbell_bd7d.html" title="Sol Campbell">Sol Campbell</a> is totally useless unless you provide details of who is doing the alleging; without that context then your additions are mere repetition of the same rumours, which from the point of view of libel law is no different from making the allegation yourself. Wikipedia has come under a lot of flak recently for possible defamations, which highlight how important it is that Wikipedia's content is accurate and verifiable.</p>
<p>Your recent edits to this article are not only unsourced, but contravene several Wikipedia policies and guidelines: The use of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a> such as "Many supporters" and "It is speculated" is strongly discouraged, your speculation about Campbell's mental condition is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and the insinuation that homosexuality is "shameful" or something to feel "guilty" about contravenes <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Please read the above policies and bear them in mind when making future edits. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 11:14, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I am an Arsenal fan, but my main concern here is that Wikipedia is accurate. I couldn't care less about Campbell's sexuality, and if there was any verifiable truth to the edits you made I would be fine with their inclusion. But there isn't any discernible truth, which is why I object.</dd>
<dd>I don't think you really are aware of the ramifications of your edits; if you were, you would put it on your own website and put your own name to them, rather than anonymously posting them here wrapped in weasel words and letting Wikipedia deal with any potential flak. I'll quit "pontificating" when you start playing by the rules here. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 11:44, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I can't speak on Irish law, the precedent set in English law is that repetition of an allegation is regarded as equal to making the allegation yourself; this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/A1183394" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/A1183394" rel="nofollow">BBC guide</a> (and in particular <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/A1183394#4" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/A1183394#4" rel="nofollow">this section</a>) is quite a good primer, and makes clear that merely adding "alleged" or similar words makes little difference. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 12:10, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Just a quick warning to say that if you continue to vandalise <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStemonitis_ca3d.html" title="User:Stemonitis">User:Stemonitis</a>'s user page (editing it after he's asked you to stop, and inserting nonsense letters into the text, is vandalism), I'll be reporting you for it.

<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<dl>
<dd>I move that the edit-freeze be unlocked as I believe I have made my point, what with my neutrality flag being frozen in the article long enough now. I move that with the overwhelming consensus of opinion against me (even with sockpuppets in play) the neutrality flag be de-activated and the edit function restored. I vow not to flag the music section in this article again unless provoked into doing so by ungracious comments. I reserve the right to maintain my point of view about the subjectivity of this section but I uphold to defer to the majority as my point has been well-established and my neutrality flag maintaining its' presence is synonymous with this point. I thank you all for an engaging debate and I look forward to hopefully supporting your views in the future. Thanks once again. Bazzajf 16:58, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I will unblock the page. Edit warring is not the way to resolve things, it results in freezing pages. That a majority is disagreeing does not say it is correct, and if you have good reliable sources, talk about it. If the discussion at the talk page does not work out, use <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and related options, that will work better in the end than edit warring. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 18:30, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You continue to alter my user page despite my requests for you not to. Your edit summary of "factual amendment" is false â this is an issue of terminology, not facts.

<dd>You are mistaken (again). I am happy to engage in discussion, however it is getting me nowhere in light of your refusal to accept the stark facts, my edit summary is correct, ultimately truth is reflected in legal provisions and legally a reference to the islands of Ireland and U.K. is provided for by the definition "British &amp; Irish" Isles. You were the one who ended the discussion on the topic concerned, with an expression of boredom which suggested to me you had nothing to counter-debate the stark reality of the situation. I will possibly continue making the factual adjustments on your userpage but more infrequently. I don't understand why you won't revert to the legal description, you are letting personality clashes get in the way of facts, egos shouldn't compromise the truth. Am I correct in stating it would not be too much work for you to revert to my version or are their difficulties in upholding the link? Be a man and swallow your pride in the interest of truth please Stemonitis.

<li>"Legally"? Under what law? Even if you mean Irish law, then that does not apply to Wikipedia (which is not situated in Ireland).</li>
<li>Furthermore, Wikipedia follows <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">common usage</a>, not the phraseology preferred by lawmakers. "British and Irish Isles" is not widely used (used, yes, but not widely, and certainly not as much as "British Isles").</li>
<li>At the risk of repeating myself, this is a question of terminology, not of facts: no-one disputes where the mountains in question are located, which would be a factual discussion.</li>
<li>To answer your question, yes, there <i>are</i> problems with your version of the page. It simply doesn't work! The links are broken, nullifying the whole point of having them there. The only questionable benefit of your change is that you are not offended by it. Every other aspect of it is bad: it is a less widely-used name, the name is less concise, the links become broken, it's not how I want it to be, and, finally, it's a waste of your time and effort to make it.</li>
<li>Your efforts would be better placed in debates where it matters. My user page is not an integral part of the encyclopÃ¦dia, and carries no weight. I don't mind you having an opinion, nor even your stating it in the appropriate places, but vandalising my user page (since it must be construed as vandalism) is unacceptable, and is likely to lead only to your being blocked again.</li>
<li>Only one person wants your change made, but so far several independent users have been involved in restoring the page to my preferred version. If you cannot accept this kind of consensus (as the Wales debate would seem to suggest), then perhaps Wikipedia is not the place for you. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStemonitis_ca3d.html" title="User:Stemonitis">Stemonitis</a> 10:53, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The only reason I have not yet blocked you is that I did one of the reverts myself. However, next revert, I will do it because by that time, you are at 6RR (and no, they do not have to be the exact same reverts!). Furthermore, watch your language, your langauge is not making you a lot of friends. Wikiepdia can be a really nice place, but if you repeatedly bump into admins for violations of basic policies, it becomes very quickly something else. It is up to you. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 18:11, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I apologize for reporting you to 3RR when I was in violation myself (inadvertantly, but still in violation). I should have gone about it differently, and having you blocked was not the ideal solution. When your block expires, I urge you to discuss the issue on the <a href="../../../j/e/b/Talk%7EJeb_Bush_53e8.html" title="Talk:Jeb Bush">Talk:Jeb Bush</a> page, so that we don't again end up with multiple people reverting your reversions as we did before.

I hope you find this satisfactory. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 12:30, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I ask you to reconsider your action in light of the fact that I commit to not amending that user's discussion page once I am formally warned.

I am now officially warning you off my userpage, I do not want your comments here because I see you as engaging in unreasonable and biased actions against me. Please note I do not want you fiddling with my userpage in any fashion, a reply to this as far as Im concerned will be considered vandalism as I do not wish to communicate with you in any sense of the word. As for user POWERs you are free to reply here as you have been reasonable at certain times. My answer to you is that I was never formally warned and my personal attack was rationally motivated and warranted in the circumstances which you seemingly failed to investigate, political offence in this circumstance was deemed bigotry by me and if you investigated further the user I accused states that he has no problem with this description and reserves the right to maintain my "comment" on his userpage, presumably because he deems it rational unlike you lot.</dd>

<dd>It doesn't matter what I investigated or not. A personal attack is <i><b>never</b></i> warranted on Wikipedia. If you wish to continue making them, you are likely to earn a permanent block. That's not a threat, just a statement of what is likely to occur. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 00:04, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just for the record: I by no means agree with your statement on my user page, but I maintain your right to say it. To state that I have "no problem with [the] description" is stretching the truth. I deny all "political bias and bigotry"; I deny any "anti-Irish bias". I consider your statements therefore untrue, but, as I say, I will allow you to express them if you must. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStemonitis_ca3d.html" title="User:Stemonitis">Stemonitis</a> 09:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you have a problem with it, remove it, if you consider it untrue, remove it. It is a simple change to your userpage that you are unwilling to make and the motivations and reasons behind this unwillingness form the basis for my rational conclusions. It's a bigoted use of terminology, it has been explained to you that it has caused offence and the reasons why it causes offence but you insist on maintaining its use despite the bigotry that it and hence you exude. <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazzajf_cf6c.html" title="User:Bazzajf">Bazzajf</a> 12:14, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bazzajf, don't get me wrong. I know you're a human being and I wish you all the best. However, your constant edit warring on user pages (and elsewhere), your generally arrogant attitude, and your mind-numbing self-righteousness can all get tiring very quickly. I don't know if you exhibit similar personality traits in your personal life, but if you do, you're going to have to do some deeply serious soul-searching before you will ever be capable of giving AND receiving love and appreciation. Please, my good friend, get a life. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.136.html" title="User:152.163.100.136">152.163.100.136</a> 12:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Get a life" - What a fantastic suggestion, you really come up with original insults my good fellow. Here's my suggestion to you "Get a Username" because you are just hiding behind a dynamic IP like a cowardly worm and I am certain you exhibit cowardice in real life. You are obviously a sockpuppet of somebody I have been in dispute with in the past and you strike me as being very bitter and depressed about it. Cheer up buddy, there are organisations you can turn to. I won't insult you this time because by the sounds of thing you would probably jump off a cliff if I did. I am sorry for your troubles and I feel sorry for you. Yes, I have a heart. <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazzajf_cf6c.html" title="User:Bazzajf">Bazzajf</a> 13:41, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This reflects a very sad mentality and an inability to debate the issues very well, a lack of confidence in oneself overall, I would suggest. <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazzajf_cf6c.html" title="User:Bazzajf">Bazzajf</a> 12:14, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe you're not Vashti, even though I'm certain he uses sockpuppetry but keep your comments coming Mr. Anonymous Coward, I find them hilarious. I quote "PLEASE calm down and re-evaluate your life, values, and overall personality." Hehehehehehe, I think you need to calm down yourself and stop taking things so seriously, oh and try and stand up for yourself a small bit and quit the hiding thing, you are differently suffering from a lack of confidence and low self-esteem. Your IP userpage is vandal heaven of which I'm confident you are at least partly responsible, you may well be some scitzo screw-up but you are entertaining me with your profound words and commentary so keep it coming. <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazzajf_cf6c.html" title="User:Bazzajf">Bazzajf</a> 22:15, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi there, it's Mr. Anonymous Coward again! I appreciate your continued responses and I look forward to a "spirited debate," to borrow a term from your favorite U.S. President. I do need to point out the irony of one of your comments: "You are obviously a sockpuppet of somebody I have been in dispute with in the past." Why ironic, or at least comic? Because this statement of yours was in response to my own warnings to you about your destructive personality traits, ones which can indeed lead to multiple bitter disputes. Are you 100% confident you don't want to do a little healthy soul-searching and think about why so many people are hostile to you on Wikipedia, and why you were blocked? It couldn't POSSIBLY be your fault some of the time.............could it??? <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.71.html" title="User:205.188.116.71">205.188.116.71</a> 02:23, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr. A.C. here! (I find the way you abbreviated my name to be quite affectionate.) Your proclamation of "never my fault" indicates that we have a lot more work to do, but I am patient, and I am here for you. I have no username because I am not a regular Wikipedia editor. Rather, I am YOUR own personal guardian angel, who has flown in on translucent wings to help you turn your life around. A mere username would be trivial compared with the task at hand. Now, where should we start? What is the first personality trait of yours that you wouldn't mind examining, if only tentatively? <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.71.html" title="User:205.188.116.71">205.188.116.71</a> 12:04, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is this some sort of joke? I have just been re-instated and my first edit was naturally enough on still seeing my talkpage blocked to ask the person to unblock it like he should have done 5 days ago and the 2nd was to an Irish pal of mine to contribute to an article about a band in which I think he could contribute very well because he did such a fine job on contributing to a similar article on a Dublin band "The Frames". This block is unbelievable, I am totally flabbergasted to be blocked for this. I could easily get around this and set up a new user name on my dynamic IP on my home PC but that is not my style and I will stand over and sign my records irrespective of past blocks etc. Please refer this situation on to other admins for their comments as this is blocking policy exceedingly above and beyond what is merited.

<dd>Bazzajf, your first two edits were both to user talk pages and were both uncivil. Given your history, this is a clear warning sign. I repeat my question: is it your intention to cease the trolling and disputation which got you blocked in the first place, or not? I don't know what your past is with Deskana, but you will see that I did unprotect your talk page so that dialogue can commence, and I did post this on the administrators' noticeboard for review. I am doing my best to assume good faith here, please do me the courtesy of reciprocating. I also suggest that you and Deskana leave each other alone for a while, since you evidently have history. Posting an aggressive demand to have your talk unlocked was pretty stupid, though - the chances of success are dramatically increased when you ask nicely, I always find. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:45, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have jusy implicitly called me "stupid" when I have never had any dealings with you so why am I being lectured about civility? I don't even know Deskana and have had very few dealings with him bar his unreasonable and uncalled for interventions in my business on one occasion. I contacted him to remove the block on my user talkpage because he placed it there and never removed it despite my return as an active User. My disputes on WP have always been on article content and POV, why is this seen as trolling? I am entitled to put across my POV on an article's discussion page and edit articles in a manner I deem fair and reasonable, that is part and parcel of WP. I am happy to leave the guy alone once he stops stalking me for no apparent reason. In summation, I don't troll and have no interest in doing so, however I am often in dispute and also in agreement with users on article POV and editing reversions. If this form of disputation is never allowed on WP, then I suggest I am banned indefinitely because sometimes I disagree with POV and edit reversion on certain articles.<a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazzajf_cf6c.html" title="User:Bazzajf">Bazzajf</a> 13:50, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am perfectly calm, allow me to share some advice with you "don't make assumptions on other's behalf." I have already answered your question, let me repeat it seeing as it failed to be grasped the first time. I have no interest in trolling, however disputation which is unfortunate is a by-product of differing opinions on POV and edit reversion. In relation to the stalking issue, the term "stalking" in this case may be excessive but it sprang to mind at the time given that the person in question intervened on more than one occasion in my business unnecessarily and further more give his tupence worth on the admin noticeboard notwithstanding his conflict of interest, hence the stalking allegation, albeit excessive. Listen, do what you want to do, I'm weary of having to explain myself and defend 1) a justifiable comment and request of a negligent admin who failed to unblock my talkpage when he should of because of a personal grievance and 2) a request to a fellow user who I know to be of good standing on musical articles to contribute on one occasion to an article on an Irish band, the same user took no umbrage from said request and is seemingly as bemused as me by all of this.</dd>

<dd>Calm is not a word which I would use to describe your comments thus far. For example, saying that a "negligent" admin and "personal grievance" when it's equally possible said admin just forgot - you could have posted to the <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> or the admin noticeboard instead of writing strident demands on Deskana's talk. What did you expect? If you really think Deskana harbours a grudge, what good result was likely to come form that comment? I am genuinely puzzled that you apparently believe this was smart. And to back that up by an accusation of stalking, when you had <i>invited</i> comment by posting at his Talk page - well, that really takes the biscuit. And as I stated above, I didn't block you on account of your pointlessly aggressive comment on Irishpunktom's page, but because you returned from a block and started off with two incivil remarks on user talk pages, which looks a lot like the kind of thing that got you blocked in the first place. But I was not convinced that this was anythign more than sour grapes, so I came along here, unprotected your talk page and asked you if you are prepared to contribute in a more collegiate manner, without bullying and aggression. I was catually trying to help you avoid being kicked off the project, believe it or not. I think I'll ask the AMA to send someone along. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 22:17, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Listen carefully,in relation to leaving a message on Deskanna or whoever it is talkpage, there was no personal attack, i told him to hurry to unblock my page as whether you like it or not he was negligent, read the bloody message again, as to whether it was smart or not, I am not here to compromise myself, I am decent and mannerly to people if they treat me in an evcen-handed manner. In relation to the "stalking" matter you have got it completely wrong so try and take in what I say this time, he intervened unnecessarily in my business on more than one occasion in the past irrespective of what happened yesterday.</dd>
<dd>In relation to my second comment, to ask a user to contribute to an article on one occasion - "for once" imploring him to have a look at it, and in turn implicitly complementing him on his contribution to a similar music article and same user taking no umbrage from it being classed as incivility is a judgement from the clown court and I'm laughing.

And had you been a bit nicer to me on my talk page I would have unprotected your talk page immidiately. I feel no need to do anything for people who can't <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and say "Hey, I'm unblocked now and I would like it if you'd unprotect my talk page, I think you've forgotten about it".

There was no malice or calculation about it, no admin abuse, whatever you think of it. You accuse me of stalking you without recognising it is my job to watch users and sure they abide by policy.

<p>Hi, Bazzajf. I would like to try to help you understand why your statements "I will report you for admin abuse seeing as you are not up to speed and a bit inept in timing issues" and "Get a move on and do it" are not civil and resulted in your re-blocking. Do you see why someone might not like to be called "inept"? Do you see why Deskana might object to the threat of being reported for abuse of administrator powers?

If those had been the only uncivil comments or problem edits you'd ever made, you probably wouldn't even have qualified for a warning. Blocking is preventative not retributive, I blocked you because I was concerned that we would see the pattern of past behaviour repeated.</dd>
<dd>Are you wasting your time? No, I hope not. If you had no history of productive edits then nobody would be taking any kind of trouble here. What is needed is some kind of indication that you accept that incivility is in the eye of the beholder, and that things which you likely dismiss as part of the cut and thrust of debate can be seen as highly offensive by others. In short, you need to acept the validity of many of the (numerous) criticisms which have been levelled against you over time. As soon as you are prepared to indicate (a) an acceptance that you have done wrong in the past and (b) <i>a commitment not to repeat the problem behaviours</i>, then I think progress can be made. I understand that you have strong feelings here, but it seems to me from the above and other contributions that you have been a loose cannon in the past, and before we let you loose again we need to be satisfied that you are going to give rather more consideration to the feelings of others, and stick to arguing the merits of an edit rather than those of an editor. I don't see it being much more complex than that myself. I'd be very happy to see you return to making good edits. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 11:51, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As would I. You could start by answering the questions I posed several days ago. You can find those questions above where I said "I would like to try to help you understand why your statements ... are not civil and resulted in your re-blocking." <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 12:34, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
