<p>The article states that "...in 1942 Irakli Bagrationi-Mukhraneli, of the junior branch of the family, proclaimed himself Head of the Royal House and founded “Georgian Traditionalist Union” throughout Europe." Elsewhere in Wikipedia there are similar references to this "junior" branch. However, in all of the genealogies I have seen, the <i>Bagrationi-Mukhraneli</i> are the <i>senior</i> branch of this family. Although they were the youngest descendants of the Kartli branch, all the older branches of the Kartli Bagrationi are extinct: The last two known members of that line were brothers, Prince Demetre Bagrationi and Prince Aleksandri Bagrationi, sons of Prince Petri. They died in Bolshevik prison in 1918 or 1919. The last male member of the even more senior Gruzinsky branch of the Bagrationi was Prince Sergei Gruzinsky, son of Prince Iakob and Master of Ceremonies of the Imperial Household of Russia, who died in 1880. The Kakheti branch replaced the Kartli Bagrationi, uniting and ruling <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kartl-Kakheti_478a.html" title="Kartl-Kakheti">Kartl-Kakheti</a> in 1762. The Bagrationi-Mukhraneli family then served under Kartli-Kakheti's kings as Mukhranbatoni. However, even though the Kakheti and Imereti lines were the last branches to <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reign.html" title="Reign">reign</a> with the title of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">King</a> (<i><a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">Tsar</a></i>), and there are still males of the Kakheti branch living, both the Kakheti and Imereti (as well as the illegitimate Davitishvili) lines were junior to the Kartli branch, from which the Mukhraneli descend. Therefore, the Bagrationi-Mukhraneli line remains the most senior branch of this dynasty, as male-line descendants of the extinct Kings of Kartli. Is anyone familiar with a different genealogy than this? Was Mukhraneli an independent <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality.html" title="Principality">principality</a>, like <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mingrelia.html" title="Mingrelia">Mingrelia</a>, or a part of the Kartli-Kakheti kingdom? <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 11:17, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for an interesting comment. I basically agree with you, but the question is rather complicated and sources are contradictory. I was never able to fully reconstruct the genealogy of all branches and hence the further development of the article was halted. If you could help with it, I would be very thankful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Kakhetian line actually acquired, in the person of <a href="../../../t/e/i/Teimuraz_II_5ae7.html" title="Teimuraz II">Teimuraz II</a> (son-in-law of <a href="../../../v/a/k/Vakhtang_VI_of_Kartli_1c31.html" title="Vakhtang VI of Kartli">Vakhtang VI of Kartli</a> of the Mukhrani line), the vacant throne of Kartli and prevented any attempt by the descendants of Vakhtang VI (who had emigrated to Russia) to win back the power. Thus, some regarded them usurpers, but the legitimacy of the Kakhetian branch was eventually recognized by Georgian nobility, church and subsequently Catherine II the Great in the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Georgievsk_e83d.html" title="Treaty of Georgievsk">Treaty of Georgievsk</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the Mukhrani fiefdom, it was not an independent principality but a constituent part of Kartli and then of Kartli-Kakheti. All the best, <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 13:14, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Lethiere's and Kober's observations are basically correct. I refer you to alt.talk.royalty, where these questions have been discussed ad nauseum, and to the full genealogy of the family I posted <a href="http://genealogy.euweb.cz/georgia/index.html" class="external text" title="http://genealogy.euweb.cz/georgia/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Although the Mukhraneli are technically the senior branch in the House of Bagration (like the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galitzine.html" title="Galitzine">Galitzines</a> are the senior branch in the House of Gediminas and the Czetwertinski are the senior branch in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Rurik_a216.html" title="House of Rurik">House of Rurik</a>), the last king of Georgia was George XII, whose male-line descendants are alive and well (although the line is nearing its extinction). According to the laws of the Russian Empire, the Mukhraneli have the same status as, say, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galitzine.html" title="Galitzine">Galitzine</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolgorukov.html" title="Dolgorukov">Dolgorukov</a> — <a href="../../../g/e/d/Gediminid.html" title="Gediminid">Gediminid</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurikid.html" title="Rurikid">Rurikid</a> families, respectively: male-line descendants of <a href="../../../g/e/d/Gediminas.html" title="Gediminas">Gediminas</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_of_Chernigov_fa7c.html" title="Michael of Chernigov">Michael of Chernigov</a>, to be precise. The marriage of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_II_of_Russia_ba70.html" title="Alexander II of Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_Dolgorukov_e0e2.html" title="Catherine Dolgorukov">Catherine Dolgorukov</a> was considered morganatic. The same goes for the Mukhraneli, whose status was based on their high title at court (<i>mukhranbatoni</i>) rather than their sovereign demesne (Mukhrani?), although their supporters are keen to prove that each constituent "duchy" of Georgia was a sovereign polity and hence their lords should be considered mediatized nobility according to the strict standards of the <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almanach_de_Gotha_77c2.html" title="Almanach de Gotha">Almanach de Gotha</a>. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 16:07, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for confirming the facts. But what is meant by saying that the Mukhraneli are "technically" the senior branch in the House of Bagration? Either they are or they are not, and we have agreed that they are -- and I had explicitly acknowledged that this did not make them the senior descendants or heirs of the last Georgian monarchs in Kartli-Kakheti or Imereti. So all of the references on Wikipedia that describe the Mukhraneli as a "junior" branch (<a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorge_de_Bagration_632c.html" title="Jorge de Bagration">Jorge de Bagration</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_Russian_Throne_f8b6.html" title="Line of succession to the Russian Throne">Line of succession to the Russian Throne</a>, etc) are inaccurate and need to be corrected. The reality is that the issues around the Russian succession are so contentious that it seems difficult for people to acknowledge facts that they think might "support" a pretender whose claim they don't accept, so the facts get buried under the rhetoric. It seems to me that the relevant data on the Mukhraneli's status is contradictory and ambivalent, and needs to be sorted out factually so that Wiki readers can draw their own conclusions. Two points occur to me as relevant in this regard:
<ol>
<li>When <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duke_Vladimir_Kirillovich_of_Russia_36a7.html" title="Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia">Vladimir Kirilovich Romanov</a> responded to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Louis_Ferdinand_of_Bavaria_52fd.html#Children" title="Prince Louis Ferdinand of Bavaria">Infante Ferdinand of Bavaria</a>'s inquiry about whether the Mukhraneli were dynastic enough for Prince Erekle Bagrationi-Mukhraneli (Leonida's brother), to contract an equal marriage with his daughter, Vladimir did not declare that they were so because they were Georgian pretenders, claiming (erroneously) to be heirs of the last Georgian kings in Kartli-Kakheti. To do so would have been to implicitly support the pretensions of Prince Erekle Bagration-Mukhransky to the Georgian throne, something Vladimir carefully avoided doing because it conflicted with his own claim to be rightful sovereign over Georgia pursuant to the 1801 annexation. Rather, Vladimir acknowledged the Mukhraneli's "royalty" on the grounds that they were the senior line of a <i>former</i> royal dynasty -- just as the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Hanover_0463.html" title="House of Hanover">House of Hanover</a> was acknowledged by the German Emperors after Prussia annexed that kingdom. In doing so, of course, he reversed the attitude toward them of Nicholas II in 1911 -- but he never claimed that Mukhraneli <i>Ebenbürtigkeit</i> was tied to any claim to represent the Kartli-Kakheti legacy.</li>
<li>It is, however, true that the distinction <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchess_Maria_Vladimirovna_of_Russia_dfc3.html" title="Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia">Maria Vladimirovna Romanova</a>'s supporters make is that her mother Leonida's descent from a dynasty that had reigned more recently by a couple of hundred years than the <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurikid.html" title="Rurikid">Rurikids</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/d/Gedyminas.html" title="Gedyminas">Gedyminians</a> justifies distinguishing between Maria Vladimirovna's <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty.html" title="Dynasty">dynasticity</a> and the non-dynasticity of most other descendants of the Romanovs who belong to the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanov_Family_Association_d88c.html" title="Romanov Family Association">Romanov Family Association</a>. They argue, in effect, that such a distinction was commonly made by other reigning dynasties in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, which accepted the <i>Ebenbürtigkeit</i> of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Orl%C3%A9ans_ad4a.html" title="House of Orléans">House of Orléans</a>, which ceased to reign in the 19th century, but not that of, for example, Irish clan chiefs, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Royal_Families_5e12.html" title="Irish Royal Families">some of whom reigned</a> into the 17th century. On this point, the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Georgievsk_e83d.html" title="Treaty of Georgievsk">Treaty of Georgievsk</a> becomes potentially relevant, because it constituted an international treaty guaranteeing a certain status to the ruling dynasty of Kartli-Kakheti, a guarantee not possessed by Rurikids or Gedyminians. But the treaty is ambivalent on this point. On the one hand, it does guarantee the dynastic status of the "the Heirs and descendants of his House" of the Kartlii-Kakheti kings (not merely "descendants of the kings") and required that the treaty's terms could only be changed by mutual agreement between Russia's and Kartli-Kakheti's monarchs. But on the other hand, in the treaty's list of Georgian families that were to be treated as nobility (not royalty) in the Russian Empire, the Mukhraneli are included -- and they were eventually accepted into Russia with legal status as ordinary nobles. In and of itself, the latter point is not decisive: In France, Britain and Sardinia, the Condés, Cumberlands, and Carignans were simultaneously princes of the blood royal and nobles, and their legal status as nobles did not differ from that of other nobles, except in precedence, yet they retained <i>Ebenbürtigkeit</i>. On the other hand, it is true that although <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_II_of_Russia_61a9.html" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a> promised <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duke_Konstantin_Konstantinovich_of_Russia_422b.html" title="Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia">Grand Duke Constantine Konstantinovich</a> that he would not "treat" his daughter's marriage to a Bagration-Mukhransky as unequal, and unlike most unequal marriages the couple was welcomed into the Imperial family, she was required to renounce her succession rights prior to the wedding. When evidence is so mixed, it's crucial that people get all the facts to develop a POV -- so Wiki need not have one. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 21:55, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Correction" to what? Where have we been discussing the relative antiquity of dynasties? The Beauharnais Leuchtenbergs had zero antiquity as rulers, and were deemed equal. Both the Dolgorokys and the Bagrationi were far more ancient as ruling dynasties than the Romanovs. If anything, the relevant criterion for marital equality seems to be <i>recentness</i> of sovereignty -- not "ancientness". <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 20:19, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was referring to your remark that "the distinction Maria Vladimirovna Romanova's supporters make is that her mother Leonida's descent from a dynasty that had reigned more recently by a couple of hundred years than the Rurikids and Gedyminians justifies..." etc. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 10:20, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By "senior", appears, is there meant that in the primogeniture-oriented thinking that branch is genealogically senior = descends from an elder brother, compared to some others ("junior") who descend from younger brother. However, primogenitural orientation is not decisive everywhere. Even in Western Europe, other alternatives, such as succession by next brother rather than a son, and proximity of blood, were highly favored at least all the Middle Ages. Several other cultures have used and are using some other preference in succession than primogeniture. Georgian monarchy/monarchies came, in several ways and through many occasions, to hands of "junior" branches, and in their people's view, they were more important and higher than a "senior" branch descending from only some early monarchs but not from recent ones. Besides, I do not think that anyone says even in European genealogist circles that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_II_of_Romania_6d27.html" title="Michael II of Romania">Michael II of Romania</a> should be regarded junior to the Prince of Hohenzollern; or that <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_II_e338.html" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> should be regarded junior, and possibly somehow subjugated, to whomever now happens to be the pretender to the Saxe-Weimar grand duchy. So, being "senior" branch does not matter much to Georgians, nor to Russian dynasty, but it seems to matter to German houses. That is the light in which I see Vladimir's response and Ferdinand's satisfaction. (The Spanish aspect of Ferdinand actually did not much need that, it seems to be just the German aspect.) <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 00:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your point is well-taken, and I agree that Romania/Sigmaringen is an apt analogy. Even though the <a href="../../../h/o/h/Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen_050a.html" title="Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen">Hohenzollern-Sigmaringens</a> were a non-reigning but senior branch of the Hohenzollerns that lacked the royal rank of the Romanian line, they were 1. still eligible to inter-marry with reigning dynasties, and 2. still eligible to inherit the Romanian throne. In fact, in every dynasty, non-reigning cadets are considered to be dynastic if they descend in the male (and sometimes even the female) line of the dynasty's founder. Nonetheless, if a Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen prince had sought to marry a Romanov princess in 1911, no one would have questioned the fact that the H-S ranked as equal, whereas the B-M were not considered equal in 1911. On the other hand, other dethroned imperial dynasties (Habsburg, Hohenzollern) still enforced marital standards in 1948 (when Vladimir wed Leonida), but their <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretender.html" title="Pretender">pretenders</a> had lowered those standards from the strict <i>ebenbürtig</i> rules of the monarchy. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 05:13, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the matter of Tatjana Konstantinovna, I have long held an idea that Nicholas II's desire to have her renounce IS a sign of her mariage being equal - because if the marriage was NOT equal, her issue would not be heirs to Russian throne in its semi-salic sense just because they then were born of an unequal marriage and therefore ineligible, and Tatjana's renunciation would not have changed that at all. Whereas if her husband was equal, then her issue born of that marriage were entitled to semi-salic rights to Russian succession, an outcome avoidable by Tatjana's renunciation. By the way, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_I_of_Russia_77e9.html" title="Nicholas I of Russia">Nicholas I of Russia</a> deemed Duke Maximilian of Leuctenberg as equal enough, and it is well-known that the Leuctenberg issue of Maria Nicolaievna were regarded entitled to semi-salic rights to Russian throne. What was Leuchtenberg? A family of Bavarian nobility and French nobility, having its ancestor as adopted son of Napoleon I, whom Imperial Russia did not want afterwards to recognize as a proper emperor nor a proper monarch. So, Nicholas I already created the precedent that some tenuous link to former <i>de facto</i> rulers is sufficient; the Bagrationi are in approximately same situation. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 00:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Tatiana_Konstantinovna_of_Russia_5d0a.html" title="Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna of Russia">Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna of Russia</a>'s marriage was considered legally (although not <i>socially</i>) morganatic. The reason that she had to renounce is because Russia's laws automatically deprived her morganatic children of succession rights, but left her own rights intact. To prevent the possibility of her succeeding to the crown and creating dynastic havoc by attempting to de-morganatize her offspring by imperial <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fiat" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:fiat">fiat</a></i> (as it was widely believed <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria_362b.html" title="Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a> planned to do), Russian Imperial policy was to require that any dynast marrying morganatically must also renounce his/her own rights of succession. This is well-documented in the <a href="http://www.permonline.ru/~museum/romanov/fond/0006.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.permonline.ru/~museum/romanov/fond/0006.htm" rel="nofollow">1911 Imperial memorandum</a> that was initiated to accomodate Tatiana's wedding, which was the first dynastically-approved-but-unequal marriage to take place among the Romanovs (not counting Alexander II's 1880 <i>mésalliance</i> with Princess Catherine Dolgoroky, which was done suddenly and secretly to legitimise the couple's illegitimate children). <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 05:13, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was there in imperial Russia of 19th century (say, in year 1900), in real terms, other families than imperial house itself and its semi-salic cognatic descendants, to hold a "legal status" higher than "ordinary nobles"; and what was such status, if such existed? I have grave doubts that in 1900, Russia did not treat any of its subjects (other than the imperial house and its cognatics such as Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, Leuchtenberg...) as royalty. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 00:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes and no. You cannot simply cite the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximilian%2C_Duke_of_Leuchtenberg_5b9b.html" title="Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg">Beauharnais Leuchtenbergs</a> and then discount them as an exception. They were exactly like the Battenbergs and Tecks in England; a "<a href="../../../a/l/m/Almanach_de_Gotha_77c2.html" title="Almanach de Gotha">Gotha</a>-3rd-section" princely family not strictly equal by European dynastic standards, but accepted as equal by a dynasty that found it advantageous to find suitable husbands for royal daughters without forcing them to move abroad (The Spanish also chose to generate home-grown spouses, with their Orléans, Sicilian and Bavarian <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infante.html" title="Infante">infantes</a>, but the Borbóns managed to choose fully royal --although often uprooted -- princelings to naturalise. Leonida's sister-in-law was among them, King <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain_a3b9.html" title="Juan Carlos I of Spain">Juan Carlos</a>'s mother was another.) Aside from Russia's Beauharnais Leuchtenbergs, the only other <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Prince_b173.html" title="Foreign Prince">princes étrangers</a></i> naturalised in Russia were the <a href="http://pages.prodigy.net/ptheroff/gotha/sayn.html" class="external text" title="http://pages.prodigy.net/ptheroff/gotha/sayn.html" rel="nofollow">Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayns</a>. Their status was unusual, for not only was their foreign title confirmed, but they were one of the 20 or so families whose members were recognized in Russia as <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serene_Highness_42a2.html" title="Serene Highness">Serene Highnesses</a>. In Russia you are correct: they inter-married with the nobility rather than the Romanovs, but <a href="http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/abt.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/abt.htm" rel="nofollow">the Sayns had equality rules,</a> and when these were complied with descendants often married back into mediatised dynasties, yet <a href="http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/g_morganat.htm#Wittgenstein_case" class="external text" title="http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/g_morganat.htm#Wittgenstein_case" rel="nofollow">when the rules were violated</a> the result was deemed morganatic in Germany. Their Russian princely title and <i>Sérénissime</i> was affirmed in 1899 (but remember that the morganatic branch of the Beauharnais were also given a ducal title and HSH by the Tsar in 1890). As a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediatisation.html" title="Mediatisation">mediatised</a> rather than <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reign.html" title="Reign">reigning</a> house, it is intriguing to wonder how they might have been regarded if one of Nicholas II's daughters had, for example, taken a fancy to HSH Prince Gustav Alexander zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn (1880-1953), whose mother belonged to a French ducal family and paternal grandmother was a Princess Bariatinsky, whose elder brother wed a mediatised countess in 1911, and whose father renounced his princely title to make a second, morganatic marriage to a Russian commoner in 1883. Romanov <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_law.html" title="House law">house law</a> required dynastic spouses to belong to "a royal or reigning family" -- the "or" necessarily implied that the family need not be both. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 05:13, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
