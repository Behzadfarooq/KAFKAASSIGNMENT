<p><b>Bagdad Railway</b>. The Asiatic link, a line 2500 miles long of the Great "Berlin to Bagdad" Railway, which was intended to further German penetration into the Near East. It was one of the most important "stakes of diplomacy" and as such may be regarded as one of the factors that contributed to bring about the War of 1914; indeed, the frustration of the German "Berlin-Byzantium-Bagdad" plan was publicly declared by Allied and American leaders during the War to be a vital issue of the world conflict. Before the inception of the Bagdad Railway scheme, Central Europe had been connected with Constantinople by the Oriental Railway; and in the very year (1888) in which the first through train ran across the Balkans to the Ottoman Capital, a German syndicate headed by the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> obtained a concession to extend the Haidar Pasha-Ismid Railway as far as Angora, in the interior of Anatolia. As soon as this line was opened (in 1893), the same syndicate, operating through the Anatolian Railway Company, obtained permission to build a branch to Konia (completed 1896). Now a wider vista of economic-political penetration was unfolded to the ambitious German engineers and financiers; they now proposed to push the railway from Konia across the frowning Taurus mountains, through Cilicia and northern Syria, across the desert to Mosul on the Tigris; thence to Bagdad, and on to the Persian Gulf. Negotiation for this project, begun in the nineties, culminated in 1903 in the formal grant of the Bagdad Railway Concession by the Ottoman government to an Ottoman corporation, the Bagdad Railway Company controlled by German banks. Russia immediately objected; England and France, declining an offer of shares in the enterprise, raised obstacles in the way of the German advance. Nevertheless, the work of construction was begun, and section after section was completed; yet, because of diplomatic as well as engineering difficulties, the line was unfinished when the War began. Great gaps were still unbridged in northern Mesopotamia and in the Amanus mountains. Turkey's entry into the War was largely due to the politico-economic grip which the railway project had given Germany on the Ottoman Empire. During the conflict, Turks and Germans labored in frantic haste to complete the line, for military purposes. The celebrated Bagtché tunnel was pierced in 1915, a narrow-guage track was laid to Aleppo, and by the Armistice all but 325 miles between Nisibin and Bagdad, and the sector below Bagdad, remained unfinished. But not for Germany were the fruits of the enterprise reserved. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) cancelled all former German rights in the Bagdad Railway; The Treaty of Sèvres and the accompanying secret Anglo-French-Italian agreement (1920) provided that Turkey should appropriate the Anatolian and Bagdad Railways, and transfer them to a Franco-British-Italian corporation. France, stealing a march on Britain by the Franco-Turkish Treaty of Angora (1921), obtained for a French syndicate (the Cilician-Syrian Railway Company) the concession for the middle section between Bozanti and Nisibin (i.e., between Cilicia and the Tigris) in 1922. The southeastern sections, from Samarra to Bagdad and thence to Basra, having been completed by the British army of occupation, were, of course, under British control. The northwestern or Anatolian section, from Haidar Pasha to the Cilician Gates, remained provisionally in Turkish hands, pending fulfillment of the Sèvres treaty or some other arrangement. It was a delicate problem, because the stockholders of the Bagdad Railway Company, which was to be expropriated, were by no means all Germans; about 30 per cent of the stock was owned by French investors, and a large block was held by the Swiss <i>Bank für orientalischen Eisenbahmen</i>, to which the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> had transferred its holdings. By purchasing a controlling interest in this Swiss bank, in May, 1923, British financiers hoped to obtain indirectly a dominating interest in the railway. A little later, a British financial group represented by Mr. Huguenin was reported to be negotiating with the Turkish government for a lease on the Anatolian railway. Such negotiations, of course, were pursued largely behind the scenes of public diplomacy, and could not be traced with certainty, nor had the ownership of the Anatolian-Bagdad system been definitely determined by 1924; but of one point there could be no doubt, that the magnificently ambitious German scheme, which had so profoundly stimulated the hopes of German imperialists and no less deeply stirred the enmity of Entente statesmen before the War, was no longer to be a German enterprise.</p>

<p>The article says <i>historians agree that it was not a cause of World War I</i> above the 1926 encyclopedia says <i>It was one of the most important "stakes of diplomacy" and as such may be regarded as one of the factors that contributed to bring about the War of 1914; indeed, the frustration of the German "Berlin-Byzantium-Bagdad" plan was publicly declared by Allied and American leaders during the War to be a vital issue of the world conflict</i> - which is right, they can't both be, I would like a discussion here pointing to the WikiTruth of the matter <a href="../../../s/b/a/User%7ESbandrews_8633.html" title="User:Sbandrews">sbandrews</a> (<a href="../../../s/b/a/User_talk%7ESbandrews_cb76.html" title="User talk:Sbandrews">t</a>) 00:10, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then if it was all settled, on the eve of war when tensions were high, why didn't they tell us that such an important issue had been settled? What was the settlement and was it fair?

<dd>tensions were not very high in June 1914 when settlement was reached (and it lowered the tensions that did exist).

<dd>tensions were not high?

<p><i>closely the particular circumstances of 1914. For a start, there was no shortage of wars in precapitalist eras, and in the nineteenth century there were many wars throughout the world involving non-capitalist states. Neither Serbia nor Austria-Hungary could possibly be regarded as highly-developed capitalist states of the sort Lenin wrote about, and there is little evidence that highly organized financial monopolies and trading interests pressurized the Russian or French governments into pursuing the policies they actually followed in 1914. Furthermore, many economic and colonial issues which had been causing friction between French, German and British governments before 1914, such as the financing of the Berlin-Baghdad railway and the future disposition of the Portuguese colonies, had been resolved by the summer of 1914. Because of a very narrow, largely economic definition of the word ‘imperialism’, socialist and Marxist accounts of the origins of the First World War have laid emphasis on colonial clashes and on economic rivalries which other historians have regarded as of secondary importance.</i></p>
<p>Certainly new ‘economic’ imperialism of the sort referred to by Lenin can be discerned in some of the policies pursued by the British, French and German companies and trading interests in Africa and the Far East from the 1880s onwards, and they did generate considerable economic and political tensions which their home governments often found difficult to resolve. But such colonial and trading disputes, while they may have contributed to a more inflamed international atmosphere, were largely resolved by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. Far more of a threat to international stability was posed by the older and more traditional imperial rivalries, involving struggles for power in areas regarded as strategically and militarily important. These rivalries provoked the most serious clashes: Austria-Hungary’s attempt to impose its will on Serbia, Russia’s hopes to spread its influence in the Near East, the dreams of the pan-German nationalists to secure German mastery of the Russian steppes. It was not the capitalist system as such which was giving rise to ambition, but traditional desires for prestige and influence and great power status. These may well have been sharpened directly or indirectly by economic competition and by the development of industry, but they were not caused primarily by these factors.</p>
<p>Some critics in the inter-war period blamed individual capitalists, and particularly armaments manufacturers, for the spiralling arms race in Europe before 1914 and for the consequent outbreak of war,</p>

<dd>Ah, so it seems that the 1989 (Routledge) version and the 2002 version have different page numberings, the 1989 (Routledge) version (hardback, Luddite that I am) starts page 39 with "action against Serbia, was known to be sympathetic to Southern Slav ambitions," <a href="../../../s/b/a/User%7ESbandrews_8633.html" title="User:Sbandrews">sbandrews</a> (<a href="../../../s/b/a/User_talk%7ESbandrews_cb76.html" title="User talk:Sbandrews">t</a>) 18:49, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>the problem with the above page from Henig is that it is 'cherry picked' from a chapter which talks about the political interpretations of history. First the text outlines the socialist perspective 'The contents of these confidential memoranda ... revealed the spoils of war and the imperialist booty that ... had been promised by the British' etc etc, 'indeed, they argued, inevitable connections between capitalism and war, and the important role imperialism had played in arousing tensions and driving nations to war in 1914'. The text then looks at 'non-Marxist' views, which you then quote. Any book which splits views into Marxist and non-Marxist and sees no further than that is to be questioned even *before* cherry picking! <a href="../../../s/b/a/User%7ESbandrews_8633.html" title="User:Sbandrews">sbandrews</a> (<a href="../../../s/b/a/User_talk%7ESbandrews_cb76.html" title="User talk:Sbandrews">t</a>) 12:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Phrases like "historians agree" and "no one knew" are realy not good enough in an article like this. It is quite clear that there are two views on the effect this railway project had on the European instability that followed. Those two views represent to some degree the political bias of the historians - it is natural, we would all like to blame people who are not like us.

<p>Another aspect was to put pressure on the British and their growing influence in the oil-laden Persian gulf area. It could also serve as a possible spring board to get Germany into Persia and India. Thus after 1908, work progressed on the railine through Anatolia. Bridges, mountain ranges and deserts hindered swift progress. By the outbreak of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> the line was mostly finished, with a few hundred kilometers needed to be built in the Mountains of southern Turkey. Allied prisoners of War captured at the debacle at <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kut.html" title="Kut">Kut</a>, were soon slaving and dying on the railway, as Turkey needed to quickly finish the railway to move supplies, now that <a href="../../../t/2E/e/T.E._Lawrence_64e7.html" title="T.E.

<p>In the end, the railway never fulfilled the goal of a direct link from Potsdam to Persia. Rather, due to debts owing, it promulgated the Great War and dragged Turkey in on the side of the to-be-defeated German power. Parts in Turkey were finished by the Americans with the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_concession.html" title="Chester concession">Chester concession</a> in the 1920s.</p>
