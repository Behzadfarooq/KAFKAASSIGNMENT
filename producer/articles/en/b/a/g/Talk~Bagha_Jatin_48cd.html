<p>22 February 2006 As the much despised author of the old article, not knowing where to insert my congratulations for the author of this new version, I take this opportunity to thank him/ her for the remarkable presentation. I must insist upon the withdrawal of the reference to the most mediocre Italic textBanglapediaItalic text article (I can produce excerpts from other specialists' opinion) which fails to portray the man we speak of.

<p>We have rules against this sort of personal abuse. May I suggest that, before you attack me, and defend your version, you take a moment to look at Wikipedia policies such as <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>?</p>
<p>While I appreciate that <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">User:Dwaipayanc</a> is trying to help, he too seems to be unaware of what a neutral point of view is. He has also reinserted a huge number of mistakes of grammar, punctuation, Wikipedia formatting, etc. Dr Mukherjee may well be an authority (though in my experience, genuine authorities are less boastful of their status, and don't appeal to "Google sites(?) to back up their claims); that's irrelevant to Wikipedia, though. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhronima_8cbf.html" title="User:Phronima">Phronima</a> 18:18, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is good to hear about the Commandments delivered from the pulpit. We presume remarks like "purple prose" are on the top of the list of wikipedian courtesy. At least, uttered by a motherly voice, they are pregnant with an urge to imitate and idolise, distribute unqualified and hasty judgments as evident by one of the users, sermoning on this article, which "can be said to be somewhat politically and to some extent ethnically Good Gracious! biased. Besides, it has still got some purple prose [[<i>Italic text</i>SIC!<i>Italic text</i>]],as the divine ?, why not! Phronima ponted out." It incites other votaries to become <b>Bold text</b>ruthless<b>Bold text</b> quite in keeping with the <i>Italic text</i>jihad<i>Italic text</i> decreed by saintly promoters of <b>Bold text</b>fatwa<b>Bold text</b>. Guardian of grammar, style and spelling, the Oracle may utilise "corectly" [<i>Italic text</i>SIC!] if HM so chooses, provided no un-Oxfordian dares challenge it. P.

<p>Dear <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhronima_8cbf.html" title="User:Phronima">User:Phronima</a> and Dr.Mukherjee and others,I have marked the article as <i>disputed</i> to grab the attention of other wikipedians.There are portions in this article that need to be corroborated with sources.However,the article is not in a position that cannot be recovered , so far as the grammatical flaws and typos are concerned.And regarding <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPoV_219c.html" title="NPoV">NPoV</a>,according to my short experience as a Wikipedian,this article can be said to be somewhat <i>politically</i> and to some extent <i>ethnically</i> biased.Besides, it has still got some <i>purple</i> prose,as Phronima ponted out.Still,I can tell with certainty that these problems can be sorted out with a bit of patience and some proper citations rather than changing the whole article ruthelessly.This article contains invaluable information which would otherwise be unavailable in the Wikipedia.Thank You.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 19:08, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid that I have to agree with <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhronima_8cbf.html" title="User:Phronima">Phronima</a> here. The article that you are trying to reintroduce is pretty well unsalvageable. Ruthlessness is the only option. I shouldn't even know where to begin editing it. It's written in a melodramatic style, full of errors, and riddled with PoV language. It doesn't just have <i>some</i> purple prose — it's purple from beginning to end. It would never be accepted by a respectable academic journal, and I don't see how you can think that it should be accepted here.</dd>
<dd>When I came across the dispute I thought at first that some compromise was possible, but a closer look convinced me that it wasn't; the long article just isn't salvageable. Moreover, you seem to be saying that the right approach is to leave in place something that's long and poor, and edit it gradually to make it better, while rejecting the idea that we should leave in place something that's short and good, and gradually edit it to make it fuller. The latter is surely the more sensible approach. Remember that the article is public from the moment that it's created.</dd>
<dd>If you want to improve the article, I suggest that you work with what's there now, but <i>slowly</i> — and from what I've seen here and in the article, deferring to Phronima on matters of English style, punctuation, etc. Please don't replace the current article with the old version again. I see that it's been copied to a temp page, so if you really think that you can prove that it can be turned into a decent article, why not experiment on that version? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 19:28, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've been involved in this in a sort of policing way. My feeling is that the article as it is now (and as it's being expanded) is in a very good state; the alternative versions at Bagha Jatin/Old article and Bagha Jatin/Temp2 (the latter of which has seen a lot of activity, but isn't getting any better) offer no advantages, and are full of problems (of grammar, punctuation, style, PoVness, etc.). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:36, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's ok that we should take time to re-create the article.However, the portion that is already there,why should the references relating to that portion be deleted?The references given are mostly from printed material and not from the Web.But one cannot help it if those are not on the web for easy verification.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 08:18, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Please</i> stop editing the article while the RfC is active. It's not that editing is against Wikipedia rules, but by introducing poorly formatted and written material, you (and the anon) are simply muddying the water, making the difference between the two versions less clear. Phronima has been working slowly, introducing material after making it clearer, and removing the mistakes; you seem insistent upon inserting it quickly, retaining the unclarities and infelicities.

<dd>We did not have an RfC problem betwwen <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_7e1e.html" title="Bagha Jatin">Bagha Jatin</a> and Bagha Jatin/Temp2.It was decided that Bagha Jatin/Temp2 cannot be retained.I propose Wikipedians to see this version , which I have put as <b><a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_Temp3_d5c6.html" title="Bagha Jatin/Temp3">Bagha Jatin/Temp3</a></b>.Let's compare on this version with the present version.My points are as follows:</dd>
<dd>1)At the start of <i>Revolutionary activities</i> the present version suddenly jumps to the collaboration between Bagha Jatin and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barin_Ghosh_486a.html" title="Barin Ghosh">Barin Ghosh</a>, while in the <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_Temp3_d5c6.html#Revolutionary_activities" title="Bagha Jatin/Temp3">proposed version</a> , the activities prior to this collaboration has been discussed.</dd>
<dd>2)activities during Alipore bomb case have been detailed in the competing version, with activities in <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundarban.html" title="Sundarban">Sundarban</a> being highlited.</dd>
<dd>3)The death and preceeding sequence has been brought under a separate heading in the competing version.<s>And the present version says Jatin died on the spot</s>,while the truth ,as has been described in the <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_Temp3_d5c6.html#The_final_battle" title="Bagha Jatin/Temp3">competing version</a> is jatin was wounded in the gunfight and died the next day.</dd>
<dd>4)The number of refernces are more in the propsed version.I admit the refernces may not be beatifully arranged,but that is a technical problem which can be bettered.Please point out the NPoV languages in the <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_Temp3_d5c6.html" title="Bagha Jatin/Temp3">proposed version</a> which the Wikipedians should be able to modify.</dd>

<li><a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> sems to have misunderstood what's going on. I'm trying, slowly and carefully, to expand the article by using material from various sources, including his temporary version, ironing out grammatical and punctuation problems, and making it NPoV. His complaint seems to be that it isn't finished, and that therefore we have to use a poorly written, PoV version.</li>
<li>The source that I used said that he died in the gun battle; your sources say that he didn't. That's why, pending my rewriting and expansion of that section, I commented out your addition (after correcting its grammar, punctuation, and style).</li>
<li>Again, regarding the references, I've started carrying them over, but first, they were often very confusingly prsented, and I had to work out what was being referred to, and secondly, they needed formatting properly. That's why I was doing the work slowly.</li>

<dd>I'm confused; apart from the fact that you've used some of my version, which is flattering, I suppose, this version contains quite a lot of grammatical errors (though less than before), and is actually less full than my version.

<p>I looked into the 3 versions, and following are my comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bagha_Jatin/Old_article is totally unusable. In fact, it looks like a children's story rather than an encyclopedic article. So, that's out of the picture.</li>
<li>Bagha_Jatin/Temp2 has too many small sections, with questionable titles (e.g. <i>A Pilgrimage for Revolution</i>)</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_Temp3_d5c6.html" title="Bagha Jatin/Temp3">Bagha Jatin/Temp3</a> looks the more mature of all three versions.</li>

<p>There are some factual corrections I made in the main page <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_7e1e.html" title="Bagha Jatin">Bagha Jatin</a>. One of them is that Jatin was born in <a href="../../../j/h/e/Jhenaidah_District_0f11.html" title="Jhenaidah District">Jhenaidah</a> rather the <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushtia_District_7346.html" title="Kushtia District">Kushtia</a> proper. I know people from Jhenaidah, who consider their home region to be totally different from Kushtia.</p>
<p>Can we use the <a href="http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/B_0034.htm" class="external text" title="http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/B_0034.htm" rel="nofollow">picture</a> from Banglapedia? That should be a PD-old use, because the picture is at least 100 years old, and under Indian and Bangladeshi copyright laws, all copyright expire after 60 years.</p>
<p>Also, should we make Bagha Jatin a redirect and move the page to "Jatindranath Mukhopadhyay" ("Jatindranath Mukherjee" being another redirect)? Because "Bagha Jatin" is not his formal name, and Mukhopadyay is a complete and formal form of Mukherjee.</p>

<dd>I think making <i>Bagha Jatin</i> a redirect and moving the page to <i>Jatindranath Mukhopadhyay</i> would be a good idea.I think it is the usual norm.Like,<a href="../../../n/e/t/Netaji.html" title="Netaji">Netaji</a> is a redirect that gets one to <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subhash_Chandra_Bose_02c3.html" title="Subhash Chandra Bose">Subhash Chandra Bose</a>.

<p>I would thus modify the opening sentence&#160;: Bagha Jatin, born Jatindranath (also written Jotin and Jyotin) Mukherjee, (7 December 1879–10 September 1915) was a Bengali Indian revolutionary activist against British rule. One of the founders of the Calcutta Anushilan Samiti, he created out of it the Jugantar (or Yugantar) party that was the major association of revolutionaries in Bengal. He masterminded the Indo-German Plot during World War I.</p>
<p>I borrow the verb "masterminded" from several sources (viz: the article DADA by Bhupati Majumdar, Jatindranath's associate and Minister for several terms in West Bengal Cabinet after 1947, published in the <i>Italic text</i>Sainik<i>Italic text</i>, 15 August 1948, pp13-15). Several Secret Police Reports (i.e. Dally's and Nixon's) confirm that Jatindranath was among the founders of the Calcutta Anushilan. Historians like Dr Jadu Gopal (<i>Italic text</i>Biplabi jibaner smriti<i>Italic text</i>, A.C.

<p>Dictionaries tell you meanings; they're not so good at telling you usage. "I would thus modify the opening sentence" would be taken by native speakers to follow from a previous explanation; the meaning of "thus" you want to use would involve a different word order: "I would modify the opening sentence thus". That would be correct, though sounding rather old-fashioned. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:32, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is precisely the word order, that I had in mind. When someone writes "Me this unchartered freedom tires", evidently he knows the usual syntax, but deliberately insists on beginning the sentence with 'Me'. <b>Thus</b> displacing 'Thus'I meant to stress on the verb 'masterminded' as a contrast to the 'instrumental' side of the evaluation. I am glad to guess that you will notice it.

<dd>I'm a little perplexed that you're arguing with a native speaker about what clearly isn't your first language. Still, to answer your points: the first example you give is poetic, and would sound absurd in any other context, and the word-order of your sentence with "thus" doesn't do what you intended — it merely makes it look as though some earlier explanation is missing. By the way, one can lay stress on something, or stress something, but not stress on something. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 15:44, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi! It was interesting to note the pattern of usage of "thus". However, what about the object of "thus"? I mean the proposed change? With proper reference, that is not unwelcome I guess.

<p>"Mastermind" has a purple-prose feel; "instrumental in" has the advantage of being more formal, and thus appropriate to an encyclopædia article. It's true that "instrumental in" is more general than "mastermind"; "ws responsible for" or "devised" are other possibilities. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 17:13, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm afraid that I've reverted a series of large-scale edits, in which material was added some of which was not rerribly relevant to Jatin, some was sourced only by a vague reference to notes, much was oddly written or wrongly coded, etc. I've tried to retain the useful edits, especially additions of Wikilinks.

<p>In the good old days when India was under HM’s rule, it seems the prestige of a political agitator depended on the number of informers that was appointed to dog him. Sir Charles Tegart, the future Commissioner of Calcutta Police, is said to have begun his career by getting sometimes caught by <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_7e1e.html" title="Bagha Jatin">Bagha Jatin</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jatindra_Nath_Mukherjee_4366.html" title="Jatindra Nath Mukherjee">Jatindra Nath Mukherjee</a> who, out of pity, employed the young spy as a lackey. It is believed that had Mukherjee lived longer, by dint of following him, a growing admiration would turn J.C. Nixon the Civil Servant into the former’s <i>follower</i> in the figurative sense. Even some of Mukherjee’s emissaries enjoyed this status. On reaching Vancouver, in 1907, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarak_Nath_Das_a25d.html" title="Tarak Nath Das">Tarak Nath Das</a> discovered that one William Hopkinson of Calcutta Police was sent to follow him. WH did even better; on recruiting pro-British Sikh informers, till his assassination by a Sikh in 1914, WH kept on undoing the little that Das and his colleagues could afford to materialise in the name of dignity. Whenever I have tried to add anything about these pioneers in North America and Canada, the data disappeared.</p>
<p>I have the impression that the ghost of Sir Charles is hovering over this Wikipedia article in order not to throw too much light on the little-known and underestimated personality of <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_7e1e.html" title="Bagha Jatin">Bagha Jatin</a>. Under the pretext of correcting English, this ominous shadow is keeping on gnawing <i>all information</i> leading to the knowledge of the anxiety and despair caused by <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_7e1e.html" title="Bagha Jatin">Bagha Jatin</a> and his colleagues to the great Empire. Whatever I quoted from the two succeeding Viceroys (Minto and Hardinge) with <b>more than adequate documentary support</b>, has been mercilessly obliterated.</p>
<p>As for the spirit of correcting, some kind of a zealous obscurantism seems to claim that even Tom, Dick or Harry (be they sweepers, bus-conductors or watchmen), by the fact of being born Englishmen, can join us as authorities on English and look down upon others who are not born Englishmen, whatever be their qualifications. What are they to think of the English written by foreigners like Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo or, nearer to us, <a href="../../../v/2E/s/V.S._Naipaul_6579.html" title="V.S. Naipaul">V.S. Naipaul</a>&#160;? It is at times possible, of course, to <i>better</i> anglicise anything penned by someone who is not born English, but does it require a megaphone pealing with a particular complex&#160;?</p>

<dd>Leaving aside the melodrama, the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assumptions of bad faith</a>, the pointless politicising of the issue, the <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">snide insults</a>, etc., the fact is this: you've made a series of edits for which you've offered no explanations, not even edit summaries, and which for the most part either are apparently false or turn good to worse English. For example:
<ol>
<li>What is the reason for turning "born Jatindranath Mukherjee" to "alias Jatindranath Mukherjee"? You don't say, you merely insist on it.</li>

<li><b>if</b> "purple prose" and "melodrama" were unknown to snide insults, one could have taken them to be movingly flattering since, I suppose, the origin of "melodrama" comes from the use of <i>words spoken against a musical background</i> (what a music!) and the life these persons led was rather of a romantic "purple" instead of our logically correct grey. In certain traditions, some people suffer from a "green-phobia".</li>
<li>"alias" was expected to redirect the article to "Jatindranath Mukherjee" as well.</li>
<li>"Different" was utilised as a synonym to replace "several" in order to avoid repeating the word too often.</li>

<p>Just a small clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"alias" was expected to redirect the article to "Jatindranath Mukherjee" as well.</i> probably the user was not aware that no further redirect was necessary, as <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jatindranath_Mukherjee_b950.html" title="Jatindranath Mukherjee">Jatindranath Mukherjee</a> is an article that redirects to <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_7e1e.html" title="Bagha Jatin">Bagha Jatin</a>. So, in the body of the article <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_7e1e.html" title="Bagha Jatin">Bagha Jatin</a> , it is not necessary to link <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jatindranath_Mukherjee_b950.html" title="Jatindranath Mukherjee">Jatindranath Mukherjee</a>. I understand that it was due to a misunderstanding of the wiki software. So we can leave that point. However, I do not have any idea regarding "alias", "Different" issuses, as I am not that well versed in English grammer. I propose to create another redirect page <a href="../../../j/y/o/Jyotindranath_Mukhopadhyay_dfad.html" title="Jyotindranath Mukhopadhyay">Jyotindranath Mukhopadhyay</a>.

<dd>There is a small problem with <a href="../../../j/y/o/Jyotindranath_Mukhopadhyay_dfad.html" title="Jyotindranath Mukhopadhyay">Jyotindranath Mukhopadhyay</a>. The thing is, this is the transliteration of the name জ্যোতিন্দ্রনাথ মুখোপাধ্যায়, while Jatindranath Mukhopadhyay is the transliteration of যতীন্দ্রনাথ মুখোপাধ্যায়. (If you don't have a Bengali unicode font: jyoti and jati are two different words in Bengali). So, the redirect <a href="../../../j/y/o/Jyotindranath_Mukhopadhyay_dfad.html" title="Jyotindranath Mukhopadhyay">Jyotindranath Mukhopadhyay</a> is perhaps mis-transliterated.

<dd>Both Dwaipayanc and Ragib are right in their reading of the problem; for clarity's sake and to avoid confusing readers, I think <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagha_Jatin_7e1e.html" title="Bagha Jatin">Bagha Jatin</a> can simply be redirected to <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jatindranath_Mukherjee_b950.html" title="Jatindranath Mukherjee">Jatindranath Mukherjee</a>. Here I have noticed one detail. While <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taraknath_Das_0a5c.html" title="Taraknath Das">Taraknath Das</a> was the current spelling (in two words), at times it has been split into <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarak_Nath_Das_a25d.html" title="Tarak Nath Das">Tarak Nath Das</a> (three words, as we do usually with Bengali names). If we search for the first spelling, we learn that there is no such article, whereas the article exists with the second spelling. Similarly one has to look for <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anushilan_Samiti_6f91.html" title="Anushilan Samiti">Anushilan Samiti</a>; simple Anushilan is not recognised. Do you have any brain waves to solve this&#160;? Hearty thanks for your attention. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobClive_b842.html" title="User:BobClive">BobClive</a> 10:48, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
