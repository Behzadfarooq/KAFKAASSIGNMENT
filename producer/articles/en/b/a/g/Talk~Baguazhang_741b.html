<p>This is a very narrow view (only Xie Peiqi's version). The translations 'Pakua Hand Movements' and 'Pakua Circular Dance' are also pretty strange.</p>
<p>Also, should this be Bagua? Bagua zhang? Baguazhang? How do we separate this?</p>
<p>Finally, dragons, phoenixes, and especially unicorns seem out of place here. While 'dragon' and 'phoenix' are often (mis)translated from 'long' and 'fenghuang,' unicorn is not often used as a translation of qilin (kirin) anymore. <a href="../../../e/d/e/User%7EEdededed_5554.html" title="User:Edededed">Edededed</a> 06:53, 25 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, some of those alternate translations just seem confusing to me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I prefer the spelling "Baguazhang" instead of "Bagua zhang", as I believe this is the most correct <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> form, and according to <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a>, this also seems to be the most popular of the two. Just "Bagua" could be confusing as that could also refer to the theory of the eight trigrams itself (as described in <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Ching_a792.html" title="I Ching">I Ching</a>). I think, however that all the others should redirect to the same place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know enough about the style to comment on the animal translations, but I have never heard of the unicorn in any other <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_martial_art.html" title="Chinese martial art">Chinese martial arts</a>. Feel free to change this if you have time, and it would be great if the animal names in Chinese and Pinyin could be included too.</dd>

<p>Yes, this is the Xie Peiqi version mainly. I understand other bagua systems do not contain all of these eight animals. I think it could be wise to mention those "wrong" translations of the animal names, since people use them, and point out that it is not so correct. Since the page <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long.html" title="Long">long</a> only contains other meanings of the word, I'll point the link back to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_dragon.html" title="Chinese dragon">Chinese dragon</a>. Don't think the link to Snake kung fu has much to do with the snake in bagua? <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 02:01, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I made some corrections/deletions today, mainly:</p>
<p>1. Yin style is not the only style that has large weapons 2. Guo Yunshen did NOT practice Baguazhang, so I deleted that paragraph 3. Toned down the writing a bit to make it sound more serious (i.e., 'ridiculously large', etc. expressions changed, discussion board mention deleted, etc.)</p>

Nice article, folks! Just wanted to drop a note and put my name on that anonymous edit, which I made before getting a username. Apologies if I stepped on any toes, as I'm new here; not quite sure what the ettiquette on prose style editing is, but from the articles I've read I've gotten the impression it's "jump right in" so I did. I tried to stick to rephrasing the prose and avoid changing the content much, being a wikipedia newbie and only a bagua dabbler... <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJes37226_d988.html" title="User:Jes37226">jes37226</a> 12:00, 28 Sep 2004</p>
<dl>
<dd>The rephrasing is an improvement, thanks. Welcome to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 14:03, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How technical should this article be? For example, I could say that Crossing from Hsing I is closely related to the Single Palm Change in Ba Gua, but would that be too technical?</p>

<p>Well, my subject says it all, really. I am certainly no expert, but what I read here seems quite different from what I've been taught.<br />
<br />
I'd like to provide a couple of links for your viewing pleasure:<br />

<a href="http://www.pakua.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.pakua.us/" rel="nofollow">Pa-Kua USA</a><br />
<a href="http://www.pakuaaz.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.pakuaaz.com/" rel="nofollow">Pa-Kua Arizona</a> (This is specifically where I'm training.. and I also maintain the webpage, so if you see any errors, please let me know!)<br />
<br />
I'm not going to do any editing of this topic, because I don't want to do any toe stepping, and it sounds like these are simply different lineages with different stories of how it was passed down, and obviously very different modern day styles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think I am in part guilty to the bias in the article, since I early on added external links to Xie Peiqi Yin Style pages. Later I noticed lots of info kept coming from those pages to the article. Currently I actually don't know how large part of the article is Xie Peiqi Yin Style... but the eight animal thing is specific to him, right? The problem is, so few people have an overall picture of all variants of bagua! and when ten people of different lineages writes bits here and there, the result is often disastrous. Take a look at <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">karate</a> for example. Lots of people have written "facts" about karate that are true onely in their styles or schools, later corrected to "in some schools" leaving the article as a mess of "in some karate styles" etc.</dd>

<dd>I do think though that it would be valuable if you tried to add your version. Then we can hopefully merge it in some way. It is not so easy to clean it up, but we could try... /<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 23:25, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a member of Pa Kua International, but we consider Pa Kua to be a more complete martial art than Pa Kua Chuan.. I, however, am not familiar enough with Chuan to say with great accuracy that the difference would be. Oh, and to my knowledge, in China, the Pa Kua martial art(Pa Kua is the correct spelling; bagua is a phonetic equivelent. Like Peking and Beijing) regarded as somewhat mysterious.--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVercalos_9f82.html" title="User:Vercalos">Vercalos</a> 08:17, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Baguazhang is the correct spelling, as per Pinyin romanization; Wade-Giles romanization spells the same thing Pa-Kua-Chang. Neither will produce the correct sounds when given to a typical English speaker to read without teaching them the respective romanization. Bagua = Pa-Kua = 八卦. The Zhang/Chang (掌) or Quan/Ch'uan (拳) at the end of the name signifies that it is a martial art; without that suffix, Bagua/Pakua is a name of a certain philosophical idea (see the respective article) and not the name of a separate martial art. However, English-speakers often feel that Zhang or Quan makes the word too long, and thus chop it off - thus we have "Tai-Chi" and so forth, when the original word is Taijiquan/Tai-Chi-Ch'uan.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The difference in spelling in Peking and Beijing is more complex; Beijing is Pinyin; Pei-Ching is Wade-Giles. Hundreds of years ago, however, they really called the capital something like "Peking" or "Beiking" - thus the old name. However, pronunciations change, and thus we have the new spelling and the new name.</dd>

<p><cite>About 1796: Shang ch’uan, or "Turning Palms," is created in Anwei Province, perhaps by a man named Tung Meng-lin. Although often said to be a Taoist movement art, shang ch’uan was widely practiced by Chinese Muslims during the 1850s. It gained its modern name of pa kua ch’uan, or "Eight Trigrams Palms," during the 1870s. A boxer from Hopei Province named Tung Hai-ch’uan may have been responsible for the latter name change. (He was not Muslim, but Taoist.) Be that as it may, the pa kua ch’uan practiced by the White Lotus rebel Wang Lun in Shantung Province from 1751 to 1774 is an unrelated martial art.[1]</cite></p>

<p>I hope this comment will show up in the appropriate place -- I'm not quite familiar with the Wikipedia system.</p>
<p>In any case, I seem to be running into either a display or detail issue with how the table with the eight trigrams is showing up; while the trigram names match the "animal" forms (qian trigram corresponds to lion form, kan to snake and so on), the trigram images appearing -- at least on my browser (Firefox 1.0) -- do not match either the trigram names or the associated forms. The equivalent tablee on the <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagua_%28concept%29.html" title="Bagua (concept)">Bagua_(concept)</a> page does not seem to have this problem, so I doubt that my browser is the issue here.</p>

<p>The "title" column in the Table is somewhat biased in that not all (and probably only one) systems of Baguazhang use these forces/movements as each of the trigrams. The animals themselves, however, are not biased, in that the animals are already defined in terms of Bagua philosophy, even though they are not used to name forms or movements in each baguazhang style (however, more than one style makes use of them, including Xie Peiqi's version, Sun Lutang's version, and others). In a rut, I think that perhaps this column should be either removed or removed and moved to another section of the article to either more generalize this article, or if everyone wants to make it more specific, add sections for each baguazhang style with specifics included in those sections.</p>

<dd>On this point; the Yijing is actually not considered by most modern Sinologists to be a "Daoist" text (I'll find evidence of this, naturally - but when I learnt Chinese, my Chinese civilisation lecturer made a point of calling the Yijing a Confucian text, rather than a Daoist one). Of course, it predates both Daoism and Confucianism, but it is most often considered to have semi-Confucian overtones. In any case, it is never defined, when one is talking of so-called "Daoist" martial arts, what kind of Daoism they are supposed to reflect - philosophical Daoism never seems to be part of it, and it is only the religious/degenerate Daoism that is supposed to be represented in Baguazhang/Xingyiquan/Taijiquan. I think we have to bear in mind that the founders of these styles were illiterate, and since Daojia Daoism (philosophical Daoism) is associated with the intelligentsia, it is only to be expected that the martial artists would base any philosophical/scientific foundation on the populist forms of Chinese religion. Actually, most martial philosophy and science strikes me as reasonably Neo-Confucian (Lixue). It is important, I think, not to isolate martial arts in China from Chinese culture, which is something that happens too often; if martial artists bandy around the terms "Daoist", "Buddhist", "Confucian", "Yijing" etc, without proper definition as accepted by most sinologists, then martial arts might not be seen as the dignified representations of Chinese culture that they are.Blackjamm 11:00, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We should probably cull the links that are on the page - I think that only links that provide a good source of historical and/or technical information about baguazhang should be included; perhaps it would be good to leave only those sites that are considered good, accurate sources by the majority of practitioners as well.</p>

<dd>IMO I found that only one or two of the links seemed to offer any real content. The rest of the websites seem to promote their own schools, and I think a bias should be avoided. (If there is a really good source on a particular school's website, could we link to the particular article and not the main site?) Perhaps I'm somewhat stubborn, but I think we should go down to 1-3 links for the time being.</dd>

<dd>Agree. Remove all links that have only commercial value. Only link to pages that really add value to subject. If major information is found in a link, consider adding the essence of that to the article and remove link. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohJak2_1b9b.html" title="User:JohJak2">JohJak2</a> 11:38, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not include links to schools, excepting those that can be qualified as an unbiased resource for general practitioners of the art. Neither the Tai Chi nor Xinyiquan articles have such a slew of personal sites.

<p>A brief lookup in the manuals or even the offical sites for the games on the web <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena_%28DOA%29_9c0d.html" title="Helena (DOA)">Helena</a>'s style has always been called "Pi Qua Quan". <a href="../../../l/i/n/Ling_Xiaoyu_74e2.html" title="Ling Xiaoyu">Ling Xiaoyu</a>'s, the exact wording is "Hakke Ken, Hike Ken &amp; Various Chinese Martial Arts" They have never been described by the games creator's as having Baguazhang style of fighting.</p>
<p>I feel that these entries and related links need to be removed as they are not correct, as for the others I don't know but perhaps they need checked as well.</p>
<p>Unless I am missing something that their styles are related or were once mentioned being Baguazhang style. Altherix 20:48, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I checked the Japanese site (<a href="http://www.tekken-official.jp/tkdrpsp/character/xiaoyu.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tekken-official.jp/tkdrpsp/character/xiaoyu.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tekken-official.jp/tkdrpsp/character/xiaoyu.html</a>) and it says that Xiaoyu practices "Piguaquan, Baguazhang, and other Chinese martial arts." (Also note that Pi Qua Quan is a misspelling of Piguaquan, as "qua" is simply not standard romanization of Chinese (yes, Helena practices Piguaquan).)</p>

<p>Regarding Tanemura Shoto:</p>
<p>What is this "grandmaster" nonsense? Also, as it is highly unlikely that a student's teacher AND his teacher's teacher will both grant discipleship to him, so perhaps sources would be nice? (I.e. Sato Kinbei AND Li Ziming (not "Li Zu Ming") cannot both take Tanemura as a disciple.)</p>
<p>Also, as Tanemura seems to be either teaching only ninjutsu and not baguazhang or at least ninjutsu as his main specialty, mentioning him seems hardly relevant in regard to the main distribution of baguazhang practitioners. (Also note that the paragraph relates to geographical distribution of baguazhang in China.)</p>
<p>The blurb about He Kecai (Ho Ho Choy) also seems rather long compared to the short phrases given to most lineages; seems a bit strange to give a large blurb for everybody (should we also add one for Sun Lutang, Gong Baotian, etc.?). These should probably be added to their respective pages instead.</p>
