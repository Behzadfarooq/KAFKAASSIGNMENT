<p>Bagong Henerasyon Foundation Inc. Is a Non-Stock, Non-Profit and Non-Government Organization and was established year 2001, as a result of a thorough study made to fully understand the true level of existence of the KMK group, or the KABATAAN (youth), MARALITA (poor) and the KABABAIHAN (women). Our foundation is focused on a 4-POINT PLAN, dubbed as H-E-L-P, as follows: HEALTH</p>
<p>One of the most noteworthy activities under our BANTAY HEALTH program is our supplemental feeding program. Initially, 650 children suffering from 2nd to 3rd degree state of malnutrition was enrolled in a 3 month feeding program initiated by the foundation, together with our primary partners such as the Philippine Medical Association of Oklahoma, QC Health Department, Nutrition Center in Taguig, Brgy. Nutrition Scholars (BNS) and the Brgy. Health Workers (BHW). The program was designed to rehabilitate the so-called “risk-group”. To date more than 1,000 malnourished children was nursed back into good health. The QC Health department saw the results and decided to adopt the program within the whole city. NGO’s and private companies, some of who continues to sponsor BHFI’s supplemental feeding program in other baranggays is now adopting the same program.</p>
<p>EDUCATION</p>
<p>We saw the proliferation of the Out-of-School Youth (OSY)/ Out-of-School Youth (OWY) in Quezon City. They are usually public school graduates with so much potential but do not have the means to further their education. To counter act this waste of human resource, our foundation, in partnership with the AMA-Education System, the SK Council of Brgy. Bahay-Toro, in Project 8 Quezon City and LEXBER Inc. established last September 2002, the BAGONG HENERASYON COMPUTER LEARNING CENTER. It is a learning center that offers quality and best of all free, computer education. To date BHCLC was able to graduate more than 2,500 students in 15 batches. From an original 4 courses: Business Application Software (BAS), Desktop Publishing, Basic Secretarial and Basic Technician, it has offered an additional 3 courses: Advance Technician, HTML Webpage Design and Internet.</p>
<p>Last January 12,2004, the concept paper we had submitted to the 1st Philippine Development Innovation Marketplace competition initiated by the WORLD BANK was short-listed into the top 120 finalists, from among the 1,800 other hopefuls. And as luck, sheer hard work and prayers would have it; the foundation’s project won a 1.2 Million-Peso grant from the AusAID-PACAP of the Australian Government. Another dream materializes and more youth benefited. Since March 8, 2004 to date, 822 beneficiaries from this roving school had graduated and some were already employed.</p>
<p>LIVELIHOOD</p>
<p>For livelihood, we have a partnership with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority or TESDA. We firmly believe with the saying that “give man a fish and he will eat for a day, but teach him how to fish and he will eat for a lifetime. BHFI as an advocate of the true “Pinoy-Entrepreneur” spirit, we continuously gives out seminars and workshop on a regular basis, the most popular among it is the Basic Hair Cutting Technique and the Basic Reflexology Training, for this specific learning can be started out immediately even without a capital. And to give credit for our efforts, we were recognized by TESDA as the “BEST COMMUNITY TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT COORDINATOR OF THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION FOR THE YEAR 2002”. Other seminar workshops we give out are as follows: a. Hand painting Techniques Seminar/Workshop b. Flower Arrangement Seminar/Workshop c. Candle Making Seminar/Workshop d. Embutido &amp; Square Ham Making Seminar/Workshop e. Empanada Making Seminar/Workshop g. Paper-Bag Making Seminar/Workshop h. Perfume Making Seminar/Workshop i. High-Speed Sewing Training Seminar</p>
<p>PEOPLE EMPOWERMENT Youth Empowerment – Access to good education particularly computer literacy and information technology, skills training, arts and sports development, had continuously to be the top priority project of the foundation. Our tie-up project with the Department of Internal Local Government or the DILG dubbed as “NEGOSYOUTH”, is still currently being implemented. Almost 1,000 out of school and out of work youth were identified within 10 baranggays, small grants were given to them to finance their proposed livelihood business.</p>
<p>Women Empowerment – We saw that there is a need to elevate the status of women in our society since the number of abused women and young ladies in our city is alarming, not counting still those who chooses to remain silent and just accept their fate. In order to attain such an objective, continuous personality development and productivity and capability-building programs are being given out, as it is necessary for their eventual employment and development as entrepreneurs. Under the Sikap Buhay project in partnership with Novadesi Micro Finance Company and our foundation, 1,000 women were given orientation on how to start up their own small business, 200 are presently undergoing training and almost 50 had their papers already processed.</p>
<p>Poor People Empowerment – Now that various skills had already been given to them, the foundation also assists them to get capital money for their proposed entrepreneurial activity; this is in partnership with Novadesi a Micro-Financing company.</p>
<p><b>MOVING FORCE BEHIND THE COW</b></p>
<p>This is Baby Holstein, BH for short, our COW. But before we tell you how she was conceived, allow us first to introduce ourselves, her “parents”.</p>
<p>We are the Bagong Henerasyon Foundation Inc., and NO, we are not the Philippine subsidiary of Pepsi Cola, just because our name literally means the “New Generation”.</p>
<p>We are a non-stock, non-profit, non-government organization registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2001, whose vision and mission is to empower the poor, especially the youth and the women, by helping them free themselves from the clutches of disease, ignorance, poverty and helplessness.</p>
<p>A tall order you might say, but one which we have been trying to address through our four (4) pronged advocacy on HEALTH, EDUCATION, LIVELIHOOD and PEOPLE-EMPOWERMENT, and which when taken together form the acronym HELP, the essence of our being.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ONE OF OUR 4 PRONGED ADVOCACY</p>
<p>In EDUCATION, we had entered a partnership with AMA Education System, Lexber Inc., and the SK Council of Brgy. Bahay Toro, year 2002, to establish the Bagong Henerasyon Computer Learning Center, which has been providing for almost 2 years now, FREE, quality computer training and education to the Out-of-School and Out-of-Work Youth, the socially-disadvantaged women, the elderly and the retired, and the lowly rank-and-file private and government employee. To date more than 2,500 beneficiaries have so far availed of this program.</p>
<p>But it was much later, more than a year after we have started operating the said computer center, when we seriously considered putting up a Computer school-On-Wheels or C.O.W.</p>
<p>HUMBLE BEGINNINGS OF COW</p>
<p>The need became apparent when we observed that despite our FREE computer education program, many target beneficiaries still failed to avail of the program because of accessibility and time constraints. Our computer center located at Project 8, Quezon City, was simply too far, too time consuming, and too expensive to travel to from their places of abode. So we thought, and without malice to our Muslim brothers, “if the mountain cannot come to Muhammad, shouldn’t Muhammad go to the mountain?” Indeed, why not?</p>
<p>Well the “NOT” or the drawback to the idea was the large capital requirement of the project. It was therefore providential when we came across the newspaper ad, about the same time last year, for “WORLD BANK’S: Philippine Development Innovation and Marketplace Grant Competition. Here at last, we said, was the answer to our prayers. And the rest, as the cliché goes is history.</p>
<p>The concept of the C.O.W. is quite simple, and therein lays its beauty, so to speak: “Bring the right SERVICE to the right PEOPLE at the right PLACE and TIME. So, in a nutshell, what we did was to: RECYCLE a used 20-footer container van; CONVERT it into a mobile classroom; OUTFIT it with computers and peripherals; HAUL it to pre-identified “baranggays” or location; PARK it beside the baranggay halls or any suitable vacant lots; TAP into the electric mains of those baranggays; TURN-ON the power and PRESTO! We now have a fully operational computer-learning center right at the very doorsteps of our target location.</p>
<p>We had a very short learning curve, less than a month actually, when we activated the C.O.W. because we simply provided the same schedules, applied the same methodologies; and worked with the same partners. As the Americans are wont to say, “why fix it, if it ain’t broke?”</p>
<p>But still, 6 months into our implementation of C.O.W., we had received only positive feedback and overwhelming support and reactions from all the locations we have already visited. Some of our beneficiaries have seen changes in their lives after under going computer training from our C.O.W., some have found employment, some have been promoted in their jobs, still some have marked improvements in their studies. More baranggays are now requesting for us to visit them and by now we know that another C.O.W., as an expansion program, is inevitable and it is what we really need for us to reach more locations and to educate more out-of-school and out-of-work youth. FUTURE PLANS And so we thought, why not another C.O.W.? But this time, we will recycle an old BUS instead of a VAN, and we will call it the “Computer school-On-Wheels Jr..” The C.O.W. Jr., is an innovative approach to an existing problem, it is cost-efficient, as it’s a school in a bus that is now both self propelling and self sustaining, compared to a van that needs hauling every time we change locations, and it is replicable that it can be duplicated any time, any where and in any part of the country without much difficulty, even to areas with different conditions</p>
