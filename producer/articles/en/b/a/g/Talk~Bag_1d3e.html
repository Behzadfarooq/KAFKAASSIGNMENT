<p>It seems to me to be yet another case of people trying to turn Wikipedia into a dictionary, or people just being amazed at the ability to self-publish. Or hypertext newbies thinking it's cool to link every noun in every article. I mean, what is the point of defining "bag"? "Sometimes a travel bag has a lock." *rolls eyes* How interesting.

<p>"Bag" has meanings in contexts other than the obvious, <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bag_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Bag (mathematics)">Bag (mathematics)</a> for example. Thus there needs to be some trivial explanation as to the common meaning of the word. There's no need for you to talk down to Wikipedians in this way.

<p>"A common misconception is that a 'bag' with an over the chest strap is actually a bag, this conflicts with commonly acceptable definitions of 'bags'. The trend for such 'bags' has become popular in the early part of the 21st Century and displays another prominent example of the erosion of our civilised culture." Actually this nonsense should be deleted right away, but just in case somebody cares about this, I'll leave it here.

<p>HI!</p>
<p>I'm from sussex county and I'd just like to add, with regards to bag as an insult, that the term is in full use in my high school. I'd go so far as to call it an epidemic! Its just so easy to say, even among foreign exchange students. And what with its 3 letters, its amazing none of you have seen it around the internet, I sure have!!!!</p>
<p>People don't know its origins, and that is actually why I did a search for bag on wikipedia in the first place!! My lunchlady called me a bag, but i think she thought it originated from 'drag'.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to add another use to the colloquialisms having to do with bag, and that is 'bagdad'. If you're girlfriends father is a real unpleasant guy, this qould Certainly describe him!</p>

<p>I don't understand why people keep removing the alternate definition from this page. First of all, an article that just simply defines bag doesn't belong here it would belong on wiktionary. Also, clearly people use it/have heard of it or else it would have never been posted/reinstated by other people. In addition, I go to rutgers university, and have cerainly heard it being used here, as well as a bit more southern New Jersey where I am from/went to high school. Stop removing this post, it turns a worthless article that doesn't belong into a useful, informative one. If your going to remove the alternate meaning, then the whole page might as well be deleted or moved to wiktionary.</p>

<p>Can somebody write anything about drinking alcohol from bagged bottles? Is it really legal to do it out in the open in front of a police officer (I'm talking about America now)?

<p>I go to Suny Buffalo, and I have heard bag used here as well, I don't know if it originated in jersey, but I know some of the people that say it are from jersey, so it certainly exists as an insult and seems to be very popular in jersey</p>
<p>As far as it being on wikipedia, it's not really a word it's coloquial and as such does not belong in wikitionary, It is part of the culture and it belongs in an encyclopedia because it speaks about an aspect of the youth culture.</p>

<p>In the Royal Navy an ugly member of the opposite sex was referred to as a one bagger or two bagger. This referred to the practise of putting a paper bag over your partner's head, and in extreme cases a supplementary bag over your own head, in case of slippage of the main bag.

<p>Once again, of the definitions in urban dictionary, only one corresponds to the ones cites in the list: <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bag" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bag" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bag</a> specifically, the fourth definition.
