<p>Here's some extra tips to help you get around in the 'pedia!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to play around with your new Wiki skills the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Sandbox</a> is for you.</li>
<li>You can sign your name using three tildes (~). If you use four, you can add a datestamp too. Five will get you the datestamp only.</li>
<li>You may want to add yourself to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_user_log_052c.html" title="Wikipedia:New user log">new user log</a>.</li>
<li>If you ever think a page or image should be deleted, please list it at the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">votes for deletion</a> page. There is also a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">votes for undeletion</a> page if you want to retrieve something that you think should not have been deleted.</li>
<li>If you're still entirely confused, or would like to get a better grasp of your wikipedia skills, and you have an <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> client (or don't mind getting one), check out the <a href="../../../b/c/_/WP%7EBC_a86f.html" title="WP:BC">Bootcamp</a>. It's not what it sounds like, but it is fun and can help you with your editing skills.</li>

<dd>Well, firstly you have to "claim importance" so that it will not be <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedily deleted</a>. However, even if you do so, an {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} process may be used in an attempt to delete it - if a debate is successful - so you need to explain why it is important and convinve the community that it is worth keeping. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 08:29, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I deleted it basically for the same reasons that Blnguyen has mentioned.

<dd>Hi there. Try not to take it too hard. Kimchi is a great guy and it was merely meant in the form of the personal advice, which he thought would benefit your ability to make your point. At Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mariano Anton Bruno Mascarenhas, the subject of the biography <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">User:Doctorbruno</a> made extremely incessant pseudo-personal posts which managed to irritate some people. You haven't done anything wrong so far, it was just Kimchi's opinion of what is effective conduct.

<p>Threw my vote in. The guy is extensivly published and I fail to see where that guy draws his dubious claim about the publishers.

<p>I reverted the partial Amazon.com links <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Jeremiah&amp;diff=73881680&amp;oldid=73864542" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Jeremiah&amp;diff=73881680&amp;oldid=73864542" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> because wikipedia does not offer business to book retailors. Imagine if every single book on wikipedia followed this suit; all books would be linked to one business. However, adding in the ISBN number, publisher, city, year, and page numbers would be good. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 05:56, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your assertion is that the page isn't sufficiently sourced and as mentioned above that no publishers and unknown publishers are dubious. I provide the evidence and you revert it because you think it provides business to Amazon?

<dd>You seem to see everything through rose colored glasses. No where in that sentence is a requirement to join some "mission group", or a claim that someone owns a Wikipedia article, but a suggestion to discuss with others what should and should not be included in a Wikipedia article. Stop being inflammatory Jestax and learn to work with others. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85"><font color="DarkGreen">Shazbot85</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShazbot85_611d.html" title="User talk:Shazbot85">Talk</a></sup> 20:20, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Look a clan X is not supposed to be the active maintiner of its very own article. It results in <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POVs</a>.

<p>Really? Can you show that clan X has a mission group actively involved on Wikipedia? Or are there just vauge statements about suggestions someone made about how someone might discuss topics? Can you show POV in any article you might be suspecting of? As it stands, no POV statements have been made about the article at hand. It is encyclopedically written and various editos have edited it to make it as neutral as possible. What exactly is your argument here, because you're not providing anything solid for you to stand on.

<p>Maybe to make it clear again, what I don't like: <i>you will see that I asked <b>our members</b> for appropriate articles to help demonstrate <b>our notability</b></i> - this violates <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, - <i>You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest.</i>. And is thus not a GoodThingTM. With <i>our members</i> are the clan members ment, by the author creating this article in wikipedia beeing a clan member, and now having the whole can forcing this article into wikipedia. Look I don't decide now on notability, its however not a good idea to make it this way around. --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 20:53, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, i'd like to see what is POV about the article. I'm not conceeding you're right as you havn't proven the author is a member, but I am curious about how you relate any of this to the article.

<p>I believe you are mistaken Jestix. The Shadowclan article was put up for deletion (As you noted for a third time) and the reason given was NN. Instead of having to go through all the work myself dating back to 1997, I asked for assistance to demonstrate that Shadowclan was notable. You seem to be saying that it is wrong to ask for assistance in demonstrating the notability of Shadowclan. I'm not sure why that would be wrong. Perhaps you can explain yourself further?<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 00:28, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't tell me, with 3548 posts you are somebody not very closely affialiated with them.</dd>

<dd>Shazbot, by all love you do look with pink eyeglasses on it. When the no-auto paradigm also suggests e.g. not to write articles from corporations you work, this goes ass well for the clan. Especially since the clan admin announced that there is a "mission control group that puts together the wikipedia page". This is not good, and I hope you see that. That does however not affect the notabilty of the lemma per se. The author had over 3000 posts on the clan forums, that does not suggest a neutral view if you ask me. --06:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you'd like to work towards a solution with a problem you have then I'll work with you. also, the admin didn't make the claim that there is a "mission control group that puts together the wikipedia page".

<p>Look, I think everything that has to be said has been said, why do you want to keep discussing. It is not a good idea for closely affiliated clan member to work on the clan page, its not a good idea the clan hierachy to effect on wikipedia, like clan admins telling their people what to do or not to do on wikipedia. Does it change anything on the article? No. Should the clan group be advised to let it go? Yes. Should a closely affiliated guy not have written the article in first place? Yes, since when notable enough there are many others that must have an interest on the article, who are not clan member.--<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 08:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jestix, I did take your advice and read through WP:AUTO. I can see the point the author of WP:AUTO has and how it can lead to trouble with NPOV. But we're just going to have to agree to disagree over how far to take WP:AUTO. I see your point and I disagree with its application.

<p>All I ask is for, is closely affiliated shadowclan members, especially adminship or the "mission control group" <b>in future</b> to take a fair distance from participating on wikipedia page <b>about them</b>, in love to maintaining Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">neutral stance</a>. Is that so difficult to grasp? Since if the clan is really so notable there should be plently other people willing to write/edit it, who have a far lesser danger of beeing POVed. They are however welcome to participate about anything else. Additionally I do ask people not to use power hierachies (clan-hierarchy) that exist outside of wikipedia to control who writes what on wikipedia articles. --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 10:29, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok..? The admins don't take part in editing on Wikipedia as far as I know, nor am I a part of any "mission group", nor am I required to be. of whatever group they have is a requirement. All it showed was that people got together and discussed what was going on. I have iterated and reiterated this point several times, and you continually overlook it.

<dd>To summ it up as a rule of thumb: If you are closely affiliated with something its a good idea TO NOT create an article about it, or be a main editor in charge of it. Trust when the subject is notable enough sooner or later somebody comes along who is not closely affiliated with it. Or second rule of thumb, if you consider if you won't do it (or some else who is closely affiliated), nobody ever will create/maintain an article about that thing, thinking it might be interesting/notable enough for him to make the worry, it just isn't interesting enough for wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 15:41, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Be very careful what you add to the wikipedia page. The page was set up with what it has on it, and how it presents the data, for a reason. Wikipedia has certain policies on what it allows and what it doesn't.</p>
<p>Wikipedia does not allow 'advertisements' or 'recruiting pages'. It requires objectively reported facts of interest to the general populace. It's not a place for vanity posts.</p>

<p>I have read through a lot of material in the last hour or two. This talk page, the RfC, Arbustoo's talk page, the articles you have both edited, etc. My eyes are watering but allow me to share with you an observation, one that might get me in trouble. When I first came to Wikipedia and thought to get involved in editing I came across the Intelligent Design article. I made a couple of immature and snide comments in the talk section because I thought the article was poorly written and clearly not a neutral point of view. Regardless, I ducked out of the discussion quickly and never bothered to go back because I was new to Wikipedia and didn't feel like getting involved in such a discussion as a newbie. I did however read through the history of the talk page and was pretty amazed at the lack of scholarship. Instead what I saw was folks like FeloniousMonk and Guettarda doing everything in their power to make sure the article was written from a negative point of view. Since that time about a couple of months have gone by.</p>
<p>Now comes Arbustoo, who seems to want to throw in negative points of view on every article involving the slightest hint of Christianity. Not only that, but the exact opposite is true when it comes to articles critical of Christianity. It seems as though he cannot be neutral when it comes to discussions connected to Christianity.</p>
<p>Then comes the dispute between the two of you. If it could be classified as such (Although this is really a rather poor classification in regards to you Vivaldi) it seems that you have been placed on the pro-Christian side of the fence (Even though you probably don't place yourself there) and the anti-Christian forces have lined up against you. Suddenly, from out of no where, comes FeloniousMonk and Guettarda. Coincidence?</p>
<p>I guess my point in writing this to you is to tell you that some of us read your work and appreciate it. Do not let them gang up on you and wear you down. If you want to see what I mean about FeloniousMonk and Guettarda, I suggest you read through the Intelligent Design talk page. It's no accident that they showed up out of the blue to condemn you. Good luck and keep up the good work here at Wikipedia! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bagginator_d7a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bagginator">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I find your attacks on my religious beliefs incredibly offensive. I have no idea where you get off calling me unChristian. I have no idea who you feel you are to stand in judgement of my relationship with God. I try my best to edit in accordance with NPOV. If I fail with respect to Intelligent design it is more because ID is an attack on Christianity than because it is an attack on science. ID is nothing but a well-designed deception, lies to mislead the gullible and the poorly informed. I find it hard to see how people who serve <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">deception</a> are supposed to be serving God. Intelligent design reduces God to nothing but a tinkerer, incapable of grandeur. And yet you seek to disparage my Christianity? Intelligent design is bad science and terrible theology. Yet you try to call me anti-Christian for being interested in truth and accuracy? Not sure where you got your understanding of Christianity from, but lies and deception <i>in the name of God</i> are far less compatible with Christianity than anything I have said or done in my life.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a project to write an encyclopaedia. It is <i>not</i> a place to spread mistruths about your fellow editors. Your actions are disgusting. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 20:20, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I, as of now, have no stance on the ID debate, I have little interest in the squabblings of scientists as they are often concerned with all things unimportant. As of now, I simply hold that God did in fact create the entire universe and all existing realms that fall outside of our knowledge or current understanding. In what ways does Intellegent Design reduce God to a tinker? As far as I know about what ID is, is that it is a theory erected in order to put theistic views in the classroom along with possibly atheistic views (science is only atheistic if you make it such, which most people do try to do, incorrectly, as God did create science). I fail to see how offering a competing theory is deception anymore than raising the <i>theory</i> of evolution as <i>truth</i> is to impressionable youths, which is practiced regularly in public schools. I would consider that deception and lies to mislead the gulliable and uninformed (as youths more often than not are). The only point where I got a teacher or prefessor to conceed and explain the unstable and subjective nature of the theory of evolution was in my junior year of college in a geology class. Sad really, my tax dollars are wasted on inadequate education, for more reasons than just that which I described, but I digress.

<p>I've notice you also most exclusively voting in and commenting on various pages that I edit in or AfD's I nominated. I am referring to your edits from Sept. 7 thru today- the 17th (of 50 of your edits in the last two weeks about four edits were not tied to me in some way). Are you following me around or is this mere coincidence? I ask because of your various comments surrounding an ongoing ArbCom case<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vivaldi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74869931" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vivaldi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74869931" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and wanting to get invovled.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Vivaldi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76177835" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Vivaldi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=76177835" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>I'm a fan of schools and if there is a justifiable defence to be made to retain a school article in the face of an AfD I am more than willing to do so. The B. H. Carroll article may have started in too deep of a hole to be redeemed (at least on Wikipedia) both in terms of the article content and the tenor of the AfD, but a review of the institute's web site and the available third party material made it clear to me that this is a genuine school of higher learning. I have still seen nothing on the school's website, google references or within the AfD that justify the "diploma mill" charge so many are using as a justifiction for deleting an article about a two-year-old school. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 10:35, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to talk informally with the editors on a talk page, this is often the best solution. However if this is not sucsesful if both partied <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMED_be36.html" title="WP:MED">mediation</a> is the next step in the process, again this step is usually very successful</p>
<p>If problems then need taking further from here and the dispute is about content then an article content <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> can be useful for involving outside parties to determine consensus of what the content should be.</p>
<p>If at any point your unsure of how to proceed or wish advice in presenting your side and how process works, then feel free to drop me a note on my talk page or if im not around at <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">WP:AMA</a> where someone can help you further. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenon_e558.html" title="User:Benon">Benon</a> 23:10, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What you are doing would seem right, and it is good to see that <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> has been mantained there, if discussion begins to stagnate again an article rfc may be the way foward, one tipbit "The world will not end tomorrow, if it does whats on wikipedia is irrelevant if it dosent then we still have plenty of time to disscus, wikipedia is a work in progress" <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenon_e558.html" title="User:Benon">Benon</a> 05:21, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One thing you could try could be a <a href="../../../s/t/r/WP%7ESTRAW_60a4.html" title="WP:STRAW">straw poll</a> on the talk page for the comepeting options to help clarify the consesu, if this fails i would then move it onwards to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">requests for comment</a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenon_e558.html" title="User:Benon">Benon</a> 01:31, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this is about as far as i can take this case to be honest, currently i dont have vast amounts of on wiki time and certianly not enough to help out with an rfc, however i have passed this on to steve at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Thadman#rfc" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Thadman#rfc" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> so if you drop in there he should be able to help you out, This isnt a reflection of you or the dispute, just a lack of time for it on my side , thanks <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenon_e558.html" title="User:Benon">Benon</a> 20:37, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem we have here is a disagreement over leading proponent. You would like it to be a very limited term applied only to a very limited number of people. We disagree. If news reporters are referring to people as leading proponents they are leading proponents. I see no reason to limit the term.

<p>To be more clear, calling someone a leading proponent is like calling someone pretty. It is an opinion. According to <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a> <b>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth.</b> As long as the opinion comes from a reliable source it can be included in the article. Obviously edits could be made to the page to add in all kinds of media published accounts of people not affiliated with the Discovery Institute being called "leading proponents" like George W. Bush and Rick Santorum, but that is not my preference. This is why my suggestion is to change the sentence instead of add all of those cites to the article. If the consensus however ends up being that the sentence should not be changed then it may be necessary to seek consensus to add such cites.<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 09:58, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look, you've failed to make your case for the simple reason you've presented no notable, compelling evidence for the change you've proposed. Consensus never trumps NPOV or verifiable facts, and you've come up short there on both. There is no "deadlocked debate" because there can be no legitimate dispute to be deadlocked over where no compelling evidence for a change has been presented.</p>

The San Francisco Chronicle, August 28 2005 calls Norris Gravlox, "a leading proponent of the intelligent design theory" thereby meeting both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>Having read your comments and reviewed the archives the fact that you see this disagreement as <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">disruptive editing</a> is instructive. You have constructed a circular argument in which no person could possibly be a leading proponent of intelligent design unless they are affiliated with the Discovery Institute. Therefore, when someone points out to you those who are leading proponents of Intelligent Design you experience a sensation known as <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_dissonance.html" title="Cognitive dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>. You are having two conflicting thoughts at the same time. Here are verified, reliable sources that are calling people not affiliated with the Discovery Institute, "leading proponents." Since, in your mind, it is not possible, it must be something else, like disruptive editing.</dd>
<dd>I suggest taking a break from Wikipedia for awhile. Sometimes it helps us to clear our thoughts and our minds and recharge and refresh ourselves and when we come back we are then able to see things in a whole new light.

<dd>I'll respond to your general questions on my position on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> etc. on the ID page. As for Jack Cashill I consider him 'lightly' connected to the DI since I expect that for the article to be reproduced it would need the consent of the author given it would now be archived (unless the DI has messed up the date). Without further notable backing I would be wary of using him until confirmation that there had been no contact between them. I will respond to the issue of William Harris slightly later, also on the ID page. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavril2020_6819.html" title="User:Davril2020">Davril2020</a> 12:38, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you feel the need to propose a change to how 'leading proponent' is determined then go ahead and we can discuss it. For myself, I do not believe that reporters should or should not be used to cite whether individuals are leading proponents or not; it should be related to how <b>authoritative</b> that source is. A statement saying Umana was a leading proponent of intelligent design would be absolutely fine by my so far as changing the intro goes, if it was contained in a source I considered to be authoritative. My own definition for this would be an article by a reporter dealing specifically, from start to finish, with intelligent design, in which they referred to Umana in this fashion. Alternatively, it would be an article on Umana which dealt specifically with with his ID beliefs, in which he was stated to be a leading proponent. Tangential references cannot be authoritative as far as I am concerned and reporters cannot be authoritative simply by virtue of being authoritative. I'm considering proposing we clarify what is meant by a leading proponent on the talk page, so that people coming into this issue can at least establish what sort of sources they need to find. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavril2020_6819.html" title="User:Davril2020">Davril2020</a> 11:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This issue simply comes back to how we ought to mediate what is and is not an authoritative source. Since we differ, if you feel the need to raise it again you can re-open the matter on the ID page. However, based on precedence I would anticipate the current use of sources and phrasing to remain the same or very similar (remember that this consensus version has been in place with only minor changes for about eight months). --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavril2020_6819.html" title="User:Davril2020">Davril2020</a> 00:52, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To wit: A debate requires more than, for example, one side merely <i>insisting</i> that a particular source is reliable. As for your question concerning the mininum necessary number of involved disputants for there to be a controversy, there is obviously no non-arbitrary minimum number. However, I need not provide a number in order to say that one person is not enough. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 02:00, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no interest in holding the same futile back-and-forth that has gone on at <a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EIntelligent_design_be07.html" title="Talk:Intelligent design">Talk:Intelligent design</a> on our own user talk pages. It is a fact that, rightly or wrongly, all except you do not consider the law.com article a reliable source (or, if they do, they do not consider the statement labeling Umana a "leading proponent" as one worth taking seriously). I, myself, am not so quick to revert any bold attempts you may make to add him to the article, but others clearly are. Therefore, your only remaining alternative that has any hope--however little--of seeing your goal here met is to move for a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a>. I recommend ceasing further discussion on the ID talk page as this would increase the likelihood that someone will act on their belief that you are a ceaselessly partisan disputant and make an RfC against you. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 03:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bagginator, I'm <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a>, a volunteer advocate with the AMA. I have seen your case, and have decided to accept it. I have looked at your extensive summary (which is always a nice thing, more summary means the quicker I can respond), and it does seem you have found a real big problem. ID is a <i>very</i> controversial topic. When you made reference to Bush not being affiliated, it did make total sense, because as the US President he does have lots of power and influence. You have thought about going for a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>, but I think that you should probably back up a bit and start at <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a>, which requests a third opinion from an uninvolved editor on the matter. Just because it's been brought up before doesn't mean it can't be questioned.
