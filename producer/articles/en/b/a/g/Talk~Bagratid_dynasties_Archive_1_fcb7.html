<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bagratids</span></h2>
<p>I have moved this page from <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagrationi.html" title="Bagrationi">Bagrationi</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagratids.html" title="Bagratids">Bagratids</a>. All the references I've looked at use the form "Bagratid", which I suspect is closer to the local name. "Bagratid dynasty" did not seem like a good title, since the article covers both Georgian and Armenian Bagratids, including the history of the family before they were kings. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 18:42, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Levzur, I explained why I moved the page. Why didn't you explain yourself before moving it back? More importantly, why did you revert back to a much earlier version of the page? I expanded the article with material from multiple academic sources. The Bagratids were not merely a Georgian dynasty; they were originally from Armenia; only one branch of the family became a Georgian dynasty. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 22:05, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Levzur, if I'm wrong and you're right, the only reason to blank the talk page would be to spare me embarassment. For the record, I don't mind having the page remain, so quit blanking it.

<dd>You keep saying that, and I still disagree. They were two parts of the same family. I researched this subject thoroughly. Doesn't it seem odd to you that everyone else thinks they are related? Once I've double-checked my research, I intend to restore something close to my earlier version of this article. You reverted the entire thing without even looking at most of the content, and eventually I will reintegrate all the work I did. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 23:09, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have not read the Georgian chronicles. However, it occurs to me that just <i>maybe</i> those chronicles are incomplete or inaccurate, as many medieval sources are.

<p>OK. Finally had a chance to do a little research. Here's some results:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The principle branch came to an end when, in 1045, the Byzantines perfidiously bullied King Gagik II into abdication in favour of the Emperor Constantine IX, granting him in compensation domains in Cappadocia and a palace at Constantinople, and then had him murdered. The younger line (founded by Smbat VII's brother Vasak) passed to Iberia after the events of 772 and there acquired the State of the Guaramid line of the royal house of the Mihranids-Chosroids; in 813, it acquired, with Ashot I, the hereditary office of Presiding Prince of Iberia, to which the Imperial Court attached the dignity of Curopalate; in 888, with Adarnase IV, it restored the Iberian Monarchy dormant from 580; and in 978, it inherited the Crown of Abasgia (Colchis or West Georgia); and in 1008 (with Bagrat III) it began the unification of all the Georgian lands, having assumed in 994 the title of King of Kings</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>-<i>Studies in Christian Caucasian History</i>, Cyril Toumanoff, p.203</p>
<p>And here's another quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The extinction of the Guaramids and the near-extinction of the Chosroids, the two royal dynasties, allowed a branch of the Armenian Bagratids to gather their inheritance.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>-<i>The Making of the Georgian Nation</i>, Ronald Grigor Suny, p.29</p>
<p>Do you disagree with these scholars? I have not been able to find <i>any</i> text stating that the Armenian and Georgian Bagratids are not related. All of them acknowledge a family connection. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 23:55, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I (and other Georgian historians) fully disagree with these scholars! The works of Cyril Toumanoff and Ronald Grigor Suny are very tendentious. Unfortunately, they ignored data of the Georgian historiography and the Georgian sources. The first representatives of this family were Georgians (Georgian Bagrationi's are descendants of Georgian Bivritiani's and Parnavazians). Armenian Bagratuni's are descendants of Georgian Bagrationi's from the old Georgian town Speri. Your work is not "research", it is a compilation without any research. I inform you also, that I'm descendant of the Imeretian branch of Bagrationi family and I research the history of this family since 1986. -- <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a> 14 May 2005
<dl>
<dd>Yes, my work is compilation, not original research. That would be because Wikipedia IS a work of compilation, not a work of original research. We even have a policy to that effect: <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. If you have a problem with that, you can always quit writing for Wikipedia and spend more time writing for scholarly journals.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, if there is a disagreement between Georgian historians and historians in other countries, the correct thing to do according to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">NPOV</a> policy is to explain that there is a disagreement, not to present only one side.</dd>
<dd>If you were aware of the dispute, you should have explained yourself. It's not <i>my</i> fault that you disagree with all of the scholarly research published in English. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 03:34, 15 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, have you ever read Toumanoff or Suny, or do you call them "tendentious" because they disagree with you? <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 03:36, 15 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your last reasoning completely testify that you have not any notion about the Georgian historiography and Georgian historical sources. Unfortunately, "Wikipedia" infringes all rules and standards setting for the encyclopeadias, since any user (including dilettantes) can change its articles as he likes. It is a very wrong "tradition". All articles about the history of Georgia or history of Bagrationi royal dynasty should be based on the data of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a>. Primary sources for the history of Georgia are Georgian historical sources: Chronicles of "Kartlis Tskhovreba", the chronicle of Sumbat davitis-dze (Bagrationi), the chronicle "Moktsevay Kartlisay", the work of Giorgi Merchule "The life of Grigol Khandzteli", etc. Secondary sources are the outstanding works of distinguished Georgian scholars. If somebody writes about the history of Georgia, first of all he must know this material! As regards my competence you may look at my CV (<a href="http://lurushadze.tripod.com" class="external free" title="http://lurushadze.tripod.com" rel="nofollow">http://lurushadze.tripod.com</a>). I'm a professional historian and I am well acquainted with both Toumanoff's and Suny's works and the works of many other historians... <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a> May 18 2005</dd>

<dd>You are not disagreeing with me; my opinion is irrelevant because I am not a historian, as you correctly point out. However, the men I cited <i>are</i> historians. Their opinions do matter. And please do not assume we are just discussing just two works; every book I have checked disagrees with you. You are disagreeing with a group of scholars who are your equals. In such a disagreement, Wikipedia needs to present both sides of the issue. Wikipedia is not an academic journal; it is inappropriate for it to take sides. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 00:36, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>palmistry</p>
<p>This is absurd. What is the source for this claim? All non-Armenian/Georgian historians state that the family originated in Armenia and eventually branched out into Georgia. This should be disputed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, origins in Georgia! Unfortunately, your assertion is absurd. Main historical sources of the history of Bagrationi family are old Georgian sources and all Georgian sources state that this family originated in Georgia (in old Georgian town Speri, now terrirory of Turkey). The sources: Chronicle of Sumbat Davitis-dze (Bagrationi) about the Bagrationi's of Tao-Klarjeti; Chronicles of the collection of the old Georgian chronicles "Kartlis Tskhovreba"; The work of Giorgi Merchule "The life of Grigol Khandzteli"; Chronicle of Vakhushti Bagrationi, etc. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a> June 9, 2005

<dd>I will mark the article as disputed. Levzur, I'm sure you're going to remove the disputed tag, so here's a preemptive warning: DON'T.

<dd>I don't know who you're appealing to. The people on the English Wikipedia are mostly English-speakers. All the secondary sources in English say that you are wrong, and that the Bagratid dynasty in Georgia was an offshoot of the Armenian dynasty. Anyone else who looks into this is going to come to the same conclusion I did. I suggest that you get used to talking with me, unless you are willing to have the article remain protected indefinitely.</dd>
<dd>From your discussion, am I correct in inferring that you haven't read any of the Armenian sources on that period? Perhaps that's where Western historians are getting their history? There is, after all, a substantial Armenian literature. If so, the article should reflect all sources, not only the Georgian ones. I doubt that Western historians invented the idea that the Georgian Bagratids are related to the Armenian family. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 06:06, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course they are an offshoot of the Armenian family, much like the Armenian Arsacunis were an offshoot of the Parthian Arsacids. To claim otherwise is ridiculous and an utterly shameless fabrication. Bagratunis had the hereditatry title of coronation of Armenian Kings since late antiquity and acquired their power during the Arab conquest as a result of their diplomatic skills and the decline of the warrior nobility, particularly the Mamikonians. --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 14:23, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's Robert H. Hewsen's take. Isomorphic i'm not sure if it's allowed to print copyrighted material in the discussion forum, so if it's not remove it, but I think it's a good and neutral piece.</p>
<p>[The House of Bagratuni</p>
<p>The Bagratid family was not only the most important Armenian princely house but ultimately the most important in the whole of Caucasia. Probably a branch of the Orontids originally holding Bagrewand as their share of the royal domains, the Bagratids at first claimed descent from their tutelary deity, the sun god Angl-Tork', until their conversion to Christianity. Thereafter, they claimed descent from Hayk, the mythical progenitor of the Armenian people, through whose supposed great-grandfather, Thorgoma, grandson of Noah, they, like many of the other princely houses in Armenia, attempted to link themselves to the genealogy of nations in Genesis 10. Later, encountering some tempting parallels between certain Bagratid and Jewish names in Josephus, the Bagratids claimed a Hebrew descent, and still later, after assuming the crowns of both Armenia and Iberia, a royal descent from King David himself. Bagradates, commanding general of Tigranes II (95-56 B.C.) and his viceroy in Syria, is the earliest known member of the house, which served as coronant of Armenia, possessing the exclusive right to crown the king and on ceremonial occasions to place the crown upon the king's brow. The importance of the house can be determined by the one thousand cavalrymen it could supply to the king in time of war.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, the Bagratids lost Bagrewand, and, at the time of the conversion, we find them reigning in the Sper in the far northwest of Armenia, sitting at the castle of Bayberd in the broad valley of the river Voh, inhabited, at least to a certain extent, by the Georgian Canians or Cans. The Georgian branch of the Bagratuni family may be traced back as far as the second century A.D., when we hear of them holding the duchy of Ojrxe. Later, the Armenian Bagratids acquired the principality of Kogovit in central Armenia centered at the castle of Daruink', and the lands of Mokk' and Tmorik' in the extreme south of Armenia, the first centered at the town of Moks and the latter centered at the fortress of T'man.</p>
<p>Under Arab rule, twelve Bagratids held the position of presiding prince of Armenia, three of whom also bore the Byzantine title of kouropalatos. Briefly set back by the failure of the Mamikonid-led revolt of the Armenian princes against the Arabs in 771-772, the Bagratids gained power steadily in Armenia as the house of Mamikonean, previously so prominent, subsequently declined. Acquiring the Mamikonid principalities of Tarawn and southern Tayk ', the house soon got control of Bzunik' and Bagrevand, and also of the great principalities of Arsarunik' and Sirak, which they purchased from the declining house of Kamsarakan. In or about 885, the Bagratids, under Asot V, revived the dormant monarchy of Armenia, and three years later Adarnase IV of the Georgian branch of the house revived that of Iberia as well. From the Armenian branch, centered at the great city of Ani, there subsequently emerged the princes of Tarawn, the kings of Kars, both annexed by the Byzantine empire, and those of Lori-Albania and Kaxet'I, both conquered by Georgia.</p>
<p>In 1008, the Bagratids succeeded in uniting the whole of Georgia for the first time in its history, upon which, together with the senior Armenian branch, they formed a condominium that ruled the whole of Caucasia for over two hundred years. During this time, a series of brilliant rulers, culminating in Queen T'amar the Great, brought Georgia to the height of its glory. Originally ruling from K'ut'aisi, the Bagratids moved to Tp'ilisi after seizing it from its Arab emirs in 1122. The Bagratids, whether in Armenia or Georgia, showed themselves to be great patrons of literature and the arts, producing or sponsoring distinguished historians, raising remarkable churches and other buildings, and founding monasteries that became famous centers of learning.</p>
<p>The Mongol invasions in the mid-thirteenth century brought this period of efflorescence to an untimely end. In the late fifteenth century, after suffering the invasions of Timur and the Turkoman chieftain Uzun Hasan, Bagratid Georgia broke into three kingdoms: K'art'li (Central Georgia), Kaxet'I (Eastern Georgia), and Imeret'I (West Georgia), each ruled by a different branch of the family K'art'li and Kaxet'i merged in 1762 only to be annexed by Russia in 1801; Imeret'I was annexed in 1810. The Bagratonis, as they were known in Georgia, however, still survive; the aunt of the present heir was married to Grand Duke Vladimir, the claimant to the Russian throne until his death in 1992. In 1991, the newly independent Georgian Republic briefly considered a restoration of the Bagratid monarchy. In Armenia the Bagratids of Lori may be traced as the princes of Norberd, east of Lake Sevan, near where, in the eighteenth century, the meliks of Barsum claimed descent from them. One sometimes encounters Armenians calling themselves Pakradooni but without proof of such descent.]</p>

<dd>Dear friends, primary sources of the history of Bagrationi Royal Dynasty of Georgia are Georgian historical sources of the VI-XVIII centuries. The Erismtavari (Grand Duke) of Kartli in 575-590 was a grandson of Vakhtang I Gorgasali (mother's line) Guaram I Bagrationi (Kurapalate). All Georgian Bagration's are descendants of Guaram. All the secondary sources in English are works of modern historians. Many outstanding works of Georgian historians are published in English and French ( works of Professor Kalistrate Salia (France), Dr. Alexander Manvelishvili (France-USA), Dr. Andro Gugushvili (UK) and others). In his "History of Armenia" Movses Khorenatsi (one of the Greatest Armenian historians of Middle Ages) traces the family origins of his sponsor Prince Sahak Bagratuni to non-Armenian roots. One of the greatest Armenian historians of the XX century, Full Member (Academician) of the Russian and Armenian Academies, Director of Ermitage, Professor Ioseb A. Orbeli wrote (based on the data of Armenian sources), that all BAgratids originated in Georgia (Southern Georgia, Tao-Klarjeti, now territory of Turkey). Please, see the site "The Bagrationi (Bagration) Dynasty" by Christopher Buyers ( <a href="http://4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/georgia.htm" class="external free" title="http://4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/georgia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/georgia.htm</a> ). --<a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a>, 9 September 2005

<dd>Unlike Mr. Urushadze's claim primary sources on Bagratids are NOT Georgian historical sources of the VI-XVIII centuries but much earlier Armenian sources. Guaram I the Guaramid the presiding prince/kuropalate of Iberia was NOT a Bagratid, one can only guess where Mr. Urushadze got that false assumption. The first Bagratid ruler of Georgia was Ashot I Bagratuni, kuropalate for the Emperor and the Caliph in 813-830. Notice his name was Ashot. Ashot is an Armenian name, so is Bagrat. In later centuries the name was appropriated by Georgians with a local Georgian form of Shota (for example the great Georgian writer Shota Rustaveli). Again, in later centuries the now fully Georgianized bagrations all use Georgian names, unlike their predecessors. A.E. Redgate (The Armenians) &amp; M. Chahin (The Kingdom of Armenia) provide a good genealogy of the Bagratid clan in their respective research. <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses_of_Khorene_4885.html" title="Moses of Khorene">Moses of Khorene</a>'s account of Bagratid's exotic jewish origins were merely an attempt to make the clan seem the oldest in the world as well as being Biblical by tracing it to King David. It was just an attempt to please his lord Isaac/Sahac Bagratuni. Btw the region of Tayk (Georgians call it Tao) has been a terriotory of Armenia for a lot longer than Georgia, it was an Armenian province virtually under all Armenian dynasties from Orontids to Arsacids. In the Middle Ages when for a period of the time the region was under Goergian rule as an Eastern Roman client, the population mainly consisted of Chalcedonian Armenians of Byzantine rite (they were called Hye-Horoms by non-Chalcedonian Armenians). --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 04:32, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a>: 1. Primary sources of history of the Bagrationi Royal Dynasty of Georgia are GEORGIAN SOURCES; 2. Unfortunately, you NOT KNOW works of Georgian historians about the first representatives of this family; 3. You not know data of Georgian sources about this question also; 4. Ashot I Bagrationi (not Bagratuni!) was founder of the Royal Dynasty in 809, he was not the first representative of this family. He was a King of Tao-Klarjeti (Southern Georgia) in 809-829; 5. Georgian Bagrationi's were from Speri (now - Ispiri, Territory of Turkey). They were descendants of Laz (Georgian) feudal family. -- <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a>, 10 September 2005</dd>

<dd>Let me clarify: you don't dispute that the Georgian and Armenian Bagratids are two branches of the same family. You just say that they were Georgians, not Armenians, originally.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historiography of Georgia</span></h2>
<p>Obviously this is a very disputed topic recently, even though only three people thus far have participated. I am a world historian with an emphasis on Early Modern Europe. Georgia is far outside my scope except in a geopolitical and genealogical sense. It would be in those two terms that I write this. I am very interested in the interrelations of Georgian kings to other local kingdoms and empires, yet this dispute just gets me mad. There are thousands of problematic dynasties in the world; even the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> royal family is not entirely confirmed. Yet this argument is not even about dynastic relations, it is about the origin. So the Bagrationis may be <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenian</a> in origin instead of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28country%29.html" title="Georgia (country)">Georgian</a>, what does it really matter? They became rulers in Georgia, that is certain. If another family became rulers in Armenia thereafter or before, then list them as a possible cadet branch of some sort. Also, remember that no country 1300 years ago was defined as it is today and borders shifted frequently. Perhaps what is now Georgia was once Armenia, or perhaps Georgia controlled Armenia at that time; they do always claim in their title "The Most High King [...], by the will of our Lord, King of the Abkhazis, Kartvelians, Ranians, Kakhetians and the <b>Armenians</b>." It seems to me that they <i>always</i> have claimed Armenia therefore making such a place of origin possible, yet still allowing them to claim Georgian descent as well. Primary sources are not always any more accurate than secondary sources and, in this case, perhaps some research from local, <i>but not Georgian,</i> primary sources may be necessary. Since the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Trebizond_7876.html" title="Empire of Trebizond">Empire of Trebizond</a> was partially founded by a Georgian monarch, why doesn't someone look into their old records. Maybe the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> itself has something that could be of service. I, for one, would trust old <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> records of periphery dependencies much more than local ones because local records are usually biased in favour of the country in question. I am not discounting Georgian records, but I am not discounting other sources either. Just because something originated outside of Georgia does not mean it isn't evidence in favour of alternate scenarios. On the other hand, the most direct sources should come from the country in question because it was <i>their</i> history. I think a compromise must be made on this page. Edit the dynasties, clean up the page, then mention the conflict. I am just as interested in Georgian history as any historian should be, and this mess of an argument is over minor matters that should not disupt the portions of this history that can be unbiased. Note conjectures on both sides, and leave the proven information alone. For those seeking a fairly certain descent of the Georgian monarchy from <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashot.html" title="Ashot">Ashot</a> onward, I too would recommend Christopher Buyers's page (The Royal Ark | <a href="http://4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/georgia.htm" class="external free" title="http://4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/georgia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/georgia.htm</a> ). <a href="../../../k/u/a/User%7EKuatofKDY_24f2.html" title="User:KuatofKDY">KuatofKDY</a> 11:34, 9 September 2005 (PDT)</p>

<dd>My complaint comes because I put a lot of work into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bagrationi&amp;oldid=10883214" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bagrationi&amp;oldid=10883214" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of this article. I got my facts through academic secondary sources in English. I didn't use primary sources since I don't read Georgian or Armenian and since Wikipedia is a work of compilation and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">does not permit original research</a>. Levzur simply reverted the entire version, which I think was an accurate and unbiased article. I'm not Armenian or Georgian, and am interested in the history of both countries. I don't have a stake in either one, but I want the articles to accurately reflect academic consensus.</dd>
<dd>Every book I've checked states that the Bagratids ("Bagrationi" is not the standard form in English) were originally part of an Armenian noble class, and that a branch moved to Georgia. That seems to be the consensus of Western scholars, both those who study Armenia and those who study Georgia. Those who dispute that consensus all seem to be Georgian. I would have no problem with a wording like "blah blah blah but Georgian historians dispute this". I have a major problem with the entire article reading from a purely Georgian perspective. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 06:16, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bagratids, Bagratuni, Bagrationi</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a>, Ashot I was not a king. He was a hereditary prince/kouropalates under the Byzantine authority. Georgians called this principality <i>Kartuelta Samtavro</i> (Principality of the Georgians), and the Byzantines knew it as the Kouropalatate of Iberia. The title of the King of the Georgians was received by his descendant, Adarnase, in 888, but nominal dependence to the Byzantine Empire continued until the reign of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_the_Builder_7d35.html" title="David the Builder">David the Builder</a> (1089-1125).</p>
<p>Since the English-speakers are hardly familiar with the Georgian sources I tried to summarize the information given in various works.</p>
<p>An idea about the Biblical origins of the dynasty was championed by both <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses_of_Khorene_4885.html" title="Moses of Khorene">Moses of Khorene</a> and Sumbat Davitis-dze (sometimes spelled as Sumbat David in the non-Georgian literature) in Armenia and Georgia, respectively. Moses is known to write his history by the request of Sahak Bagratuni, while Sumbat is thought to be a member of the family. The Biblical theory is defended by some modern authors but without any success.</p>
<p>As for Guaram, there is no common idea of his biography. Sumbat never claimed Guaram was the first Georgian Bagrationi. This information is added to his text by the 18th-century revisers (this version is known as Vakhtang’s Edition after King Vakhtang VI of Kartli who chaired a commission for the revision of old Georgian manuscripts). The medieval Georgian historian Juansher (11th century) asserts Guaram’s mother was a daughter of <a href="../../../v/a/k/Vakhtang_I_Gorgasali_c50c.html" title="Vakhtang I Gorgasali">Vakhtang I Gorgasali</a>, who was, unlike <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevzur_80ee.html" title="User:Levzur">Levzur</a>’s claim, from the Iberian/Kartlian branch of the Chosroid house (the last Pharnavazian king <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farnadjom_of_Iberia_98b0.html" title="Farnadjom of Iberia">Farnadjom of Iberia</a> was dethroned in ca 93 BC). Other Georgian sources say Guaram was installed as a prince by the Georgian nobles during their struggle against the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a>, and the Byzantine court, warring with the Persians at that time, granted him a title of kouropalates. A surname Guaramid mentioned by <a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> is conventional and is most probably invented by Tourmanoff.</p>
<p>There is no consensus about the origins of the Bagrationi even in Georgia. Most historians (not all, however) agree they descended from a powerful clan from the region of Speri (Armenians call it Sper, around the present-day town of Ispir, Turkey) whence they branched out in Armenia and Georgia. The area was not purely Armenian or Georgian, but was obviously controlled by the Armenian nobility during the reign of Artaxias (2nd century BC), a foster-son of Smbat, the son of Biwrat Bagratuni, who fought a joint invasion by the Alans and Iberians. This account provided by Thomas Artsruni and Moses of Khorene agrees with that of Leonti Mroveli, one of the authors of the Georgian Chronicles. I don’t know any argument to defend an idea of the <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazica.html" title="Lazica">Lazi</a> origin of Smbat, son of Biwrat, i.e. Sumbat Bivritiani of the Georgian Chronicles.</p>
<p>Some historians think a Georgian branch emerged in the 5th century AD (not in the 2nd century as stated by Robert H. Hewsen), and governed the province of Odzrkhe (also known as Odzrakhe or Ojrxe). Probably, the above-mentioned Guaram was the first to be installed as a hereditary prince of Iberia/Kartli, but it is very difficult to trace his ancestry. None of the following presiding princes of Iberia are mentioned as the members of the Bagrationi house before Ashot I.</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> Ashot was not an émigré from Armenia, however. Most probably his father, Adarnase, or grandfather, Vasak (son of the Armenian prince Ashot the Blind) came to settle in Georgia. They adopted Chalcedonian faith and quickly Georgianized.</p>
<p>I think BAGRATIDS should be a disambiguation page with the links to BAGRATUNI and BAGRATIONI. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 10 September 2005</p>

<p>I support Kober's proposal above. That is to create a disambig page for Bagratids, with a link to Bagratunis and Bagrations.

<p>I have one issue with the proposed solution above. "Bagratuni" and "Bagrationi" do not appear to be the standard forms in English.

I just cannot understand why you oppose the idea of mentioning all theories. We are working on an encyclopedia with a strong policy of neutrality and we should follow its rules. At last, the ethnic backgrounds of a ruling family are not so important. The main thing is a political and cultural orientation. Throughout the history, there have been only a few nations ruled by a dynasty of a local origin.

<p>Bagratuni is an Armenian form, and Bagrationi a Georgian one. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 15 September 2005</p>

<dd>From what language is "Bagratid"? It doesn't sound like an English form; English-speakers would probably tack "-ian" or "-an" on to a dynastic name, so we'd have called it the "Bagratian dynasty". <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 06:05, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The suffix -<i>id</i>, or <i>idae</i> (in its Latinized form) comes from classical Greek, and means a family-the children and family.

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a>, I,m also not mystifying the history of Georgia and Georgian People, but I,m historian, specialist in the field of Source Studies of the History of Georgia and the Caucasus. You wrote, that "the ethnic backgrounds of a ruling family are not so important..." but, my dear friend, Georgian Bagrationi's are not descendants of Armenian Bagratuni's. You and your friends in "Wikipedia" fully ignored the important data of Georgian historical sources and data of outstanding Georgian historians (Ivane Javakhishvili, Simon Janashia, Giorgi Melikishvili, David Muskhelishvili and others). Yes, Kober, I'm patriot. During 12 years I and my friends fighted against Shevardnadze's regime in Georgia but not from abroad. Objectivism and impartial approach must be main purpose of any true historian. Finally, in Georgian again: <b>როდესაც თავს უფლებას აძლევთ ასეთ მნიშვნელოვან თემაზე საჯაროდ აზრის გამოთქმისა, ცოტა მეტი სიფრთხილე გმართებთ და ცოტა უკეთ ცოდნა თქვენი ქვეყნის და ერის ისტორიისა. ე.წ.

<p>Kober or Alexander Mikaberidze? Hmmm… I thought my last name was Koberidze. I don’t think that your political activities during the rule of Mr Shevardnazde are relevant to this discussion. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 17 September 2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>I find Levzur's political activities during the rule of Shevardnazde <i>very</i> important. Most because they prove beyond a reason of a doubt the biased nature of any article published on the Bagrationi's by Levzur. The nationality (a very loose term indeed since this time perior is long before nations could be defined) of the Bagrationi's and/or Bagratuni's is irrelevent to this article. While it would be nice to know where they came from, it is not essential. In regard to the argument on origin establishing patriotism, remember that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> has been ruled by <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxon_people.html" title="Saxon people">Saxons</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman.html" title="Norman">Normans</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angevin.html" title="Angevin">Angevins</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_people.html" title="Welsh people">Welsh</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_people.html" title="Scottish people">Scottish</a>, and finally <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_people.html" title="German people">Germans</a>. No where in their monarchy has their been an actual <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">Briton</a> king since before the Anglo-Saxon Conquest. Yet their nationalism is as strong as ever. Perhaps since Georgia has experiences more outside conquests than Britain, Levzur deems the origin of the royal family as necessary. Origin does not establish authority, the ability to conquer and rule establish authority.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually this isn't too unusual. Most European ruling families have had foreign origins. The Spanish and Swedish kings are of French descent, the Belgian king is of German descent (as are the former kings of Greece and Bulgaria), the Dutch royal family is of French-German descent and the king of Norway is of Danish descent. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 10:23, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also, maybe this little fact has evaded everyone's minds, as well: Bagrat-ioni, comes from the name Bagrat, referring to Bagrat I, Prince of Kartli (the grandfather of Adarnase II, the first king of post-Arab Georgia), and the appendage -ioni, which means family of. This means that Bagrationi is the family of Bagrat I. I find it difficult to associate the Armenian Bagratuni family with this family due to differing linguistic, not racial, reasons. This doesn't discount a possible connection but it does discourage it.</dd>

<dd>I have cleaned up the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_Kings_of_Georgia_efa4.html" title="List of the Kings of Georgia">List of the Kings of Georgia</a> page, erased the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Kings_of_Iberia_80d9.html" title="List of Kings of Iberia">List of Kings of Iberia</a> page, and created a <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Imereti_731a.html" title="Kingdom of Imereti">kingdom of Imereti</a> page. To compliment the arguments of all involved, I did not establish any place of origin for the Bagrationi lines. I suggest doing a similar thing on this page or scrapping the page altogether. Creating separate pages with Bagrationi descended monarchies may prove a more effective method of avoiding this conflict while still giving people what they seek when searching in the Georgian and Armenian pages.

<p>I think it is rediculous and unbeneficial to try and revise Georgian history.</p>
<p>What Georgian nationalists? What has gamsakhurdia or Shevardnadze have in common with the issue of Bagrationis?</p>
<p>i would probably call it more as armenian nationalism (trying to prove that everything came from armenia). None of your sources are valid. Armenians have many times manipulated historical facts in their favour. Im not sure how it will benefit armenians to change the origins of bagrationi dynasty. As for qartlis chovreba, the book is used by many historians such as David Lang, The Georgians, 1966. It corespond with what lavzur is trying to say.</p>
<p>I did not see any historians here or relatively knowladgable people who can present us with strong point of view with the backing of valid sources. Only oppinions were raised and by pro armenian members here.</p>
<p>Georgian historical sources are mostly acceptable for many non georgian historians.</p>
<p>lavzur</p>
<p>Im not sure how beneficial for you it is to hold arguments with Armenian cheuvenists or with confused wana be historians here?</p>
<p>Georgians have tendancy of react very negatively to armenian revised historical events, i have seen it in the past.&#160;:)</p>
<p>I hope none of you will claim that kings of Abkhazia were also from Armenian decent.</p>

<dd>"Armenian chauvinists"? Here's a dose of hard reality: I'm an American. Most of us couldn't find Georgia or Armenia on a map. I'm better-read than most Americans and I happen to find the Caucasus interesting. In fact I'd like to visit the region when I get the chance. But as far as I'm concerned, they're still small far-off places inhabited by foreign people. I have no personal stake in your ethnic grudges, and I find it amusing that you would think I do. I only read, and try to reconcile what I read with what's in the article. As for the Abkhaz kings, of course I wouldn't claim they're Armenian, because they aren't. I haven't read up on them but I suppose that they're probably Abkhaz, meaning they're closer-related to the Adyghe than to the Georgians or Armenians. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 05:04, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow an American interested in Caucasus. That’s nice, good job. However, you knowledge of Kings in Caucasus has shown that you have not yet fully studied the history of this region. Abkhazia never had "Adigey" Kings. Adigeys never had Kingdom or Kings. They were tribe nation living in North Caucasus and not in south-Abkhazia. Abkhazia had Georgian Kings mainly. Only when Abkhazia was under Ottomans, they lost the connection with the rest of Georgia.</p>
<p>Abkhazia in past was Lazica or Kolchis. An ancient Georgian kingdom which later became Abkhazeti under the unified Georgian kingdom (by King Bagrat III) in 10 century. Predominately, Abkhazia was populated by Mingrelian speaking people, however in Kodori by the Svans. Abkhazeti kingdom in middle ages stretched from modern city of Sochi to Kutaisi.</p>
<p>Well finally mother Russia invaded North Caucasus and they started to kill, rape, destroy every living being in the Vainakh areas and Adigeo-Circassia. Two main groups in Adigey, the Shapsugs and Apsuas were ethnically cleansed by Russian Tsarist forces due to their resistance against the invader. To flee Russian killing machine, they migrated to Abkhazia (at that time named Egrisi). Local Count Shervashidze (Count of Abkhazia) has sheltered these people. He appealed to Tzar for end of the slaughter of the Shapsugs and Apsuas. Tzar somehow ended the hunt.</p>
<p>Apsuas and Shapsugs have settled in Abkhazia and mixed with local Mingrelians.</p>
<p>I just mumbled all of this just in case, so next time you don’t have to show us your poor knowledge in Caucasian history and claim that Abkhazia had Adigey Kings. Abkhazia had only one independent king from Georgia. Levon I and that was due to Byzantine policy of splitting Georgian kingdom. However, Levon was Georgian ethnically.</p>
<p>As for Bagrationi connection with Armenians. I hope you will study and research more about this matter, so in future you may have a solid point.</p>
<p>Im very happy that Americans take interest in our region</p>
<p>"most of us couldn't find Georgia or Armenia on a map."</p>
<p>Both of them existed for many centuries on the maps. It is not our problem you did not receive proper history lessons in US.</p>
<p>"I have no personal stake in your ethnic grudges"</p>
<p>This is not Bosnia or Ruwanda. There are no ethnic grudges, just despotic empires trying to divide and rule these "wild Caucasians". In fact, Armenians and Georgians are very much connected culturally and historically. And they know it very well.</p>
<p><br />
Definitely visit Georgia and Armenia. You will discover many things which you may not find in books.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

<dd>Yeah, I realize I'm not an expert or anything close. I have my areas of expertise, but Caucasian history is just a hobby. I just wanted to emphasize that I'm not an "Armenian chauvinist" - I have no reason to be biased. The fact is that Western scholars believe that the Bagratids were Armenian.

Hi. Can you please tell me which books? I have mentioned David Langs book on Georgian History. He has done great research and used hundreds of reliable sources. His first book was published in 1935 in US. He was a specialist in Armenian history and later in Georgian.</p>
<p>How about Lord Wardrops book on Georgian history? An English lord who has studied Georgia for 20 years. He has amazing book.</p>
<p>Well how about David Bagrationi himself. A prince who wrote a book on Georgian History in Paris 1900s. I have his book and i can scan it and fax it to you or email. Bagrationi himself writes about the background of his great family. I think he can claim fairly due to fact that he has more sources on his family than anybody else.</p>
<p>All of the book mentioned above are just few examples which have contradicted your claim. In fact your claim is not western. It is more eastern (Russian, Armenian, etc) therefore biased due to their anti-Georgian tendencies. You did not show us any reliable sources. Can you please quote any sources which are not based on Armenian bagratunis but more in study of Bagrationi dynasty?</p>
<p>which western scholars or historians are you referring to?</p>
<p>History is not a hobby but a serious study, which needs an open mind and exploration of every side of its complexities.</p>

<p>There was an attempt on this page to modify the information which linked the Armenian Bagratuns directly to the Bagrationi Dynasty of Georgia. The attempt to link the two families is incorrect historically as well as inaccurate at best since the Bagrationi Dynasty of Georgia emerged from the Tao-Klarjeti (Speri) region of Georgia which is located in present-day Turkey and had nothing to do with Armenia. This Dynasty (also known as the "Bagratid Dynasty" in the West) were the rulers of <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberia.html" title="Iberia">Iberia</a> or the various kingdoms of Eastern Georgia (including <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kartli.html" title="Kartli">Kartli</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/k/Kakheti.html" title="Kakheti">Kakheti</a>). Eventually, the leaders of this dynasty also spread to the kingdoms of Western Georgia (i.e. Imereti Kingdom and their bloodline reaches as far west as <a href="../../../a/b/k/Abkhazia.html" title="Abkhazia">Abkhazia</a> by the 11th century). In the 11th century, the Bagrationi Dynasty became the ruling family of a unified Georgian State (by the 12th century Georgia did include and had jurisdiction over the majority of the Armenian territory). Therefore, the attempt to prove that this family had a direct link with the Armenian Bagratuns is unfounded at best. On another note, it is a well-known fact (not just for scholars) that Iberian-Caucasian peoples (including Georgians or Kartvelians, Abkhazians, Chechens, Balkars, Avars, and others all belong in the same cultural family of <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian.html" title="Caucasian">Caucasian</a> Peoples) have no direct cultural link with Armenia (which belongs to the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_fc7a.html" title="Indo-European">Indo-European</a> family). The Georgian royal bloodlines are therefore mixed with their Abkhazian counterparts and it would be more accurate to say that the Bagrationi Dynasty is not a relative of an Armenian family but that this dynasty is a Georgian-Abkhazian Dynasty more than anything else. The next time someone tries to argue that the two families are linked together directly, please provide relevant and direct evidence that this is the case before providing inconclusive facts on this page. --Promethe -5 Nov, 2005</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Levzur and Astamur:),</p>
<p>I agree with you both. This is just an attempt (for one reason or another) to make the Georgian kings out to be the descendants of some Armenian royal line (the last representative of which died in the 11th century by the way:)). It is a fact that the Bagrationi Dynasty was not of Armenian descent, and several participants of this discussion ignore the Georgian historical accounts, which either they have no idea about or simply choose to ignore. This might come from a lack of information about the subject or from just having a strongly pro-Armenian perspective which advocates for some humorous reason that Georgian kings were from Armenia:). It would be analogous for us to say that some Armenian kings came from Georgia which is simply inaccurate and not true or to claim that the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtiberian.html" title="Celtiberian">Celtiberian</a> culture, a part of which comes from Ireland and France is of Georgian descent. The information being put forth on this discussion page therefore still advocates a one-sided perspective about the Georgian kings which is incorrect and tries to make this dynasty "Armenian" which as you know is not surprising:). --Promethe 5 Nov, 2005</p>

<dd>There is little doubt that the Bagratids were Armenian. Their original name was Bagratuni, a typical Armenian derivation. I'm afraid that Levzur is thoroughly brainwashed by President Ssaka-shvili's crusade against the Armenians living in the Southern regions of Georgia, where a Russian military base is situated. Armenia is known as the great champion of Russian influence in the Caucasus and is always keen to remind Georgians that it was Russia who saved them from total annihilation in the hands of the rapacious 18th-century Muslim powers - Ottoman Empire and Persia. Therefore everything Armenian is perceived as a threat by Georgian nationalists. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> 16:56, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Guys, one should not get involved in this stupid dispute. Isomorphic is clearly of Armenian origin and unfortunately it is a well-known fact that the Armenians are notoriously famous for exaggerating everything that has a slightest relation to their history. If one conducts a thorough research IT MAY BECOME CLEAR THAT D'ARTAGNAN WAS ALSO ARMENIAN! And a person who wrote before me is a Russian or (at least) half-Armenian. So naturally biased!

<p>The name of the title of Article should be changed to Bagratid, not Bagrationi or Bagratuni. Either specifically points to Armenian or Georgian, clearly this page deals with both Armenian and georgian branches, so should be named Bagratid ...</p>
<dl>
<dd>The prevalent form of name for this family, including both Georgian and Armenian branches, is "Bagration" in English. Google shows 10,500 hits for "Bagratid" (used as both noun and adjective), 501 hits for "Bagratids", 17,000 for "Bagrationi", 16,600 for "Bagratuni", but 90,900 for "Bagration". Nor, apparently, does Bagration suffer from being more identified with Georgian than Armenian in Western usage. And current members of the family, at least in the West, seem to use "Bagration". So I think "Bagration" should be the name of the article, "Bagratid" should be used as the adjectival form, with redirects from that and the other forms to "Bagration", including careful explanations of the historical and cultural contexts of each form in the article. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 04:16, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That is false. All Westerm scholars refer to Bagratids primarily. Bagrations are only the junior Georgian branch and Bagratuni is the native name. Bagration returns more results because of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bagration_53fd.html" title="Operation Bagration">Operation Bagration</a> and nothing else. Current members of the family are descendants of the Georgian branch. The Armenian branch has been extinct for a while and their blood only survives within Western Euopean royal Houses. For example in the West, Arsacid is used instead of the Armenian Arshakunis (junior banch) or the Pahlavi form (senior branch) --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 04:30, 2 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When the Google search is set to exclude "Operation Bagration" the word "Bagration" occurs 73,700 times, still far more often than any of the other forms combined. With regard to "Bagratids" being preferred among scholars and "Bagratuni" being the native name, Wikipedia's Naming Conventions for articles is clear; "This policy in a nutshell: Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature." I think very few scholars or others are likely to think that "Bagration" excludes Armenian family members when redirected, since the article explicitly includes the Armenian dynasts and should include an explanation of the various versions of the names. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 04:50, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Lets also exclude Petr Bagration (Georgian-Russian) as well then shall we. Anyhow, I still disagree. Bagration exclusively refers to the junior Georgian branch of the clan. Bagratid refers to both. Bagratuni to the original Armenian one. For example look at Brittanica: <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011759" class="external free" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011759" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011759</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since I was expressing the view that no version of the dynasty's name should be excluded, I don't understand the sarcastic suggestion to exclude "Petr". Although I addressed two of the points you raised (i.e. "Operation Bagration" does not explain why "Bagration" is so much more common than all the other versions combined, and that Wikipedia policy states that the most commonly used term in English should be the main consideration in decisions to name an article), your references have convinced me that "Bagration" is usually not used to refer to the Armenian branch or its members. Therefore, I stand corrected, and now agree with you that "Bagratids" should be the article's title. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 00:57, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lezvur, you have right to prosecute me? Gee, I really did not think I was on trial here, but I will get more serious if I am being accused of homocide .... I will try to address some of your points here:</p>
<p><i>immoral and insulting expressions ("crazy theory", "unprofessional and narrow minded provincial manner", "sockpuppet"...).</i></p>
<p>These expressions reflect the image of you that has been build up by your postings and deletions of any Armenian opinions posted. You really are provinical: outside your little world, there are millions who have different opinions than you, no? You may be right, and you may be wrong, but it does not mean you should force others as you have here. I think with a division of Bagratids to seperate pages, each side can express their own opinion, no matter how disagreeable it is by the other side. A simple concept of freedom of expresion of thought, no?</p>
<p>As for you claiming to be a "Dr." - and you spend your time trying to "prosecute" people you do not even know and argue against them online? Real doctors and reaserchers do better things then try to exert their nationalistic points on others on the internet ...</p>
<p>And if you are indeed basing your opinions on so called hgistorical resources, remember everything cited in the article is from Georgian sources a far cry from neutral sources, therefore, I argue them to be unreliable. Really, with use of Armenian sources, I can say anything from Tbilisi to Moscow may be considered Armenanian. Proffesionalism and reasearch lies in looking at many points of view and assesing them, not cutting and pasting what you like from where you want, not really reaserch, but spread of Georgian propaganda.</p>

<p>The fact is that Bagrationi is distinctly Georgian, and Bagratuni is distinctly Armenian. I think that nobody argues this.</p>
<p>Consequentely the only appropriate title for an article which deals both with Bagrationi and Bagratuni would be nothing but Bagratids, and by no means Bagrationi or Bagratuni. For Bagratids is a scientific term coined exactly for reference to Armenian Bagratuni and/or Georgian Bagrationi when their common origin is assumed and/or is meant to be emphesized.</p>
<p>However there is really little what Armenian Bagratuni and Georgian Bagrationi share except their probable common origin. Armenian Bagratuni became extinct by 12 AD, while by this time Bagrationi in Georgia only begin to gain the political importance which this dynasty has had in the country in the following centauries.</p>
<p>Consequentely I do not know what would the problem be with separate articles about Bagrationi and Bagratuni, and maybe also one additional article with the title Bagratids. In fact this seems to be the only logical thing. <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamokk_cb9e.html" title="User:Tamokk">Tamokk</a> 08:24, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

There are many sources where this can be validated. Claiming that Ashot was from Armenia is a POV. To avoid any confusion the author should separate the article. He should also look into W.E.B.

You have pro Armenian POv because you are Armenian and therefore your argument is not valid in terms of NOPV. Whose Lang? Its best knows western historian of Georgia and Armenia, David Marshall Lang. Read, study, research more, not only what armenians are dreaming about and writing in their books. regards <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Noxchi Borz</a> 18:25, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Eupator, please don't be so sarcastic. I don't think that any Georgian, even a taxi driver, will say Rustaveli was Armenian, but I did hear it from Armenians (not at an official level, of course). Anyway, this is not relevant to the present discussion.</p>
<p>I hesitated to make any significant contribution to the article because I had no time and energy to engage in edit wars. Splitting the article is a good idea and it's high time to put an end to this fruitless discussion. Some sources say the Georgian Bagrationi were an offshoot of the Armenian Bagratuni, but some say they were a separate family (and not only Georgian authors, BTW, e.g., the above-mentioned Lang <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22David+Marshall+Lang%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22David+Marshall+Lang%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">(results from google)</a>, also Brosset). As for me, it's quite possible that the Bagrationi could have Armenian origins. However, it isn't our aim and competence to judge which claim is true. I don't see what would the problem be with mentioning all existing theories.</p>
<p>Noxchi knows about Georgia much more than any other non-Georgian wikipedian. You cannot call him a troll. Thanks, <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 20:50, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hearsay, does not amount to fact. Anyhow, I don't mind mentioning an alternative Georgian nationalist theory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can you provide me with lines from Lang and Brosset and their citations? PS: The noxchi still seems like a troll to me despite your assurances. What is he a chechen or something? Edit: I do see why you like him after reviewing his edits on Abkhazia&#160;:) --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 20:55, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"<i>An alternative Georgian nationalist theory</i>" from the 10th century??? Huh...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The theory claiming that the Georgian Bagratids are a separate dynasty comes from the 10th century chronicles by Sumbat who attempted to link the reigning royal house directly to the alleged Biblical ancestors. Prince Vakhushti (18th century) also subscribed to that point of view. The info provided by Brosset and Lang are based on these records. The Georgian Bagratids might well have been derived from the Armenian dynasty, but you cannot call the alternative theory <i>nationalistic</i> just beacuse you don't like it. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 21:31, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Precisely! That's not good enough. By then there was already a well established Georgian branch for over two centuries. That's merely a Georgian pov. The Armenian Arshakunis rejected any connection to Persians in the 2nd century and beyond that doesn't mean that they weren't seeded by Parthian Arsacids. I don't like many things about Georgia which i'm not going to talk about here obviously, the fact that an alternative theory is mereley a Goergian pov is simple logic. Not to mention that the first Armenian source (Khorenatsi) is written in the 5th century.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 22:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Eupator, I'm not interested in what you don't like about Georgia and why, and I'm not going to discuss it here as well.</p>
<p>As such, nationalism emerged in the early 19th century, and it's too ridiculous to consider the early medieval accounts nationalistic POV. Sumbat developed his version to please the ruling dynasty to which he purportedly belonged. Last month we had a few messages back and forth with an Armenian user <a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetoum_3d11.html" title="User:Hetoum">Hetoum</a>, and decided to cooperate on controversial Armenian-Georgian topics. Unfortunately, he has gone offline since then. Please be so kind to refrain from personal attacks in the future, stick to the subject and give me a clear answer to what I've suggested above, i.e.,</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. separating the articles</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. creating a disambig page about the Bagratids</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. creating a section in the article about the Georgian Bagratids which will list all versions pertaining to their genealogy.</dd>

These are not people who will cooperate or communicate in civilized manner. Just ignore them completely and continue your wonderful contributions to Wiki. It’s difficult to fight ultra-nationalism and in most cases it’s even futile to do so. Lets concentrate on interesting sources and documents which I mentioned to you. I will soon forward you Sir Olivers work on Kartvelian studies. You have real background in History of Caucasus region and we can work together to make our articles more informative and in accordance with academic rules, so the reader will get a fair information.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Georgian Question</span></h2>
<p>Can anyone tell me please what is going on here? I am Georgian and I am completely shocked by this article. If you believe that way why don't you have a separate article for Bagratids. But, by no means Bagrations are same as Bagratids. This is unacceptable. Armenians don't even have any source for their information and they don't even have a COA of their Bagratid family. I respect Armenian peole and their history, but they should not interfere in our history. Please don't interfere in our history!!!!!!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Separation</span></h2>
<p>If Eupator and other Armenian users will agree, I think it’s wise to separate these articles. Both families have great history and need more info on them. I don’t think it’s wise to merge them into one article. This will definitely create controversy and conflict which I think Wiki should avoid. Both great families existed separately for centuries. If we have them separate, we can add and edit freely concentrating only on one family, therefore avoiding overlapping with the other. I think there should be a vote on that. I’m sure both Armenians and Georgians will find compromise. Both are brotherly nations with very rich heritage and history.

<p>Again, I was the first one here to propose a separation; however, if the end result is going to be having two articles each claiming different and opposing things on the same topic than that's just a preposterous solution.</p>
<p>Georgian attempts to link Bagratids to Guaram I are just as ridiculous as Khorentasi attempting to connect Bagratids to Biblical roots and King David in order to appease marzpan Sahak Bagratuni in 481. So these two things should be mentioned in their proper context not as actual facts.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 18:15, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Georgian Bagrationi article is actually going to have all versions represented without claiming which is true and which is false. It will (ideally) list all theories explaining which is more accepted and which is not. Only I'll need more time to better organize the article. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 18:57, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>See that's not what I had in mind in regards to separation. The idea was to have a main page with early history and background info and two links leading to the Georgian and Armenian Bagratid monarchies. a) Origin page with info until the foundation of both Kingdoms b) Armenian Bagratuni monarchy page c) Georgian Bagrationi monarchy. This way there would not be two different pages with the same information. --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 19:19, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="What_about_three_articles.3F" id="What_about_three_articles.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">What about <i>three</i> articles?</span></h2>
<p>OK, I stumbled into this because I saw <a href="../../../s/o/s/User%7ESosomk_cf5f.html" title="User:Sosomk">Soso</a>'s new page <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagrationi_Dynasty_7fb9.html" title="Bagrationi Dynasty">Bagrationi Dynasty</a> at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> and became surprised, as I took it for granted that an article on the Bagratids already existed. Looking at the closer, I realized that it presented an entirely Georgian POV, completely neglecting anything else. I discussed the issue with Soso and explained that articles should be separated based on topic, but not based on point of view, as the NPOV policy needs to be upheld in all articles. Wikipedia doesn't work through balancing two POVs in two different articles.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to do it this way. Three articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Origin of the Bagratid dynasty - this article can discuss the early history and the various Armenian or Georgian medieval or later attempts to explain the origin the family and hypotheses on the relationship between the Armenian and Georgian branches etc. All well-referenced in every detail, using the cite.php (&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) system, which makes sources easy to check.</li>
<li>Bagratid dynasty (Armenia) - on the Armenian Bagratids. Keep to the better attested periods and leave anything controversial in the genealogy or origins to the "Origin" article.</li>
<li>Bagratid dynasty (Georgia) - same thing for the Georgian dynasty</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Armenian and Georgian editors and anybody else who is interested can agree to keep the controversy to the "Origin" article, we can at least avoid having controversial and contradictory explanations being introduced into the other articles. Is this a good solution?</p>
<p>As I pointed out to Soso, I'm Swedish and really don't have any stake in this. I would just like to see consistently well-sourced scholary historical articles here rather than various pseudohistorical articles upholding various nationalist POVs. There is far too much nationalist POV crap in various nooks and corners of Wikipedia. Try to avoid that. Just present the various views as factually as possible.</p>
<p>I realize that these articles are difficult to write without using sources in Armenian or Georgian, but please try to find as many secondary sources in English, French, or German (or even Russian) as possible, as it will make it easier for those of us who don't know either Georgian or Armenian to check the references. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 19:50, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with our Swedish friend. It’s a good proposition and a fair one. But let’s avoid labelling people as nationalists and pseudo-historians just because they mentioned Georgian sources (are all Swedish sources nationalistic or pseudo-historic?). I agree, we must place greater importance on western scholars which I have mentioned before (<a href="../../../w/e/d/WED_Allen_dcd2.html" title="WED Allen">WED Allen</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Marshall_Lang_ab66.html" title="David Marshall Lang">David Marshall Lang</a>, Dr. Andrew Ansersen, <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Oliver_Wardrop_49c0.html" title="Sir Oliver Wardrop">Sir Oliver Wardrop</a>, etc).</dd>

<dd>p.s Also the name of Georgian article should be Bagrationi Dynasty. Georgians call their dynasty Bagrationi and not Bagratid. In Georgian bagrationta dinastia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then we would have Bagratid, Bagratuni and Bagrationi. A litle confusing for those who don't know anything about the topic. Since this is an English Encyclopedia we need to use the English term. Bagrationi Dynasty could redirect to Bagratid Dynasty (Georgia) and Bagratuni Dynasty can redirect to Bagratid Dynasty (Armenia).--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 20:24, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">From Soso</span></h2>
<p>Hi First of all, I am sorry that I made an emotional post on the page. The reason that I created separate page for <b>Bagrationis (Georgian dynasty)</b> is that Bagrationis were Georgian Kings, so I think that there should be separate article about <b>Georgian Bagrtionis</b> and <b>Armenian Bagrtids</b>. So that people can find out more about the monarchs of Georgia and Armenia. <b>Many royal families in Europe are related to one another, so since Georgia and Armenia are different countries they should have diferent articles about their monarchs</b>. However, <b>I am not saying that Bagrationis and Bagratids do not have connections and I have nothings against Armenian culture, because it is quite unique and they have a great history.</b> My point is that Bagrationis and Bagratids should have different encyclopedia articles.<br />
Sincerely<br />
Soso</p>
<p><br />
I absolutely agree with you. I myself, and many other users, have requested seperate articles many times before. And I do not know why is it that seperate pages do not yet exist. Is somebody realy against this? If yes I have not heard yet upon what reasons.</p>
<p>Armenian and Georgian Bagratids are distinct. That they are related by the supposed common ancestry does not mean that they do not deserve separate articles. Also this does not mean that a general article about Bagratid dynasty should not exist. But again separate articles about each of them <i>should</i> exist.</p>
<p>I am a new user and not familiar with the system yet, but cannot we make a poll about this? <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamokk_cb9e.html" title="User:Tamokk">Tamokk</a> 08:21, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I completely agree with Tamokk, we should definately have poll/voting about this. Common origins does not mean they have same history. They are indeed very distinct families. <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Noxchi Borz</a> 15:38, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi , I just wanted let you know that I have created an artcle about Georgian Bagrationis already "Bagrationi Dynasty" and I want to link "Bagrationi" link to the proper article. However, somebody keeps changing it to "Bagratid Dynasties" link. <b>I think there should be a link "Bagratid" link, which goes to "Bagratid Dynasties" and "Bagrationi" link should go to "Bagrationi Dynasty".</b> That's why I was blocked for 24 hours because I changed it three times in a row. I am going to change it and if somebody disagrees with that, please discuss it first before you decide to link it to improper article. Noxchi Borz, thanks for your ideas and support. I am a Georgian student in Virginia and I was very impressed by your page. It's totally awsome.<br />

<dd>Hey Khoi, <i>Bagrationi</i> does refers to the dynasty of Georgia, and <i>Bagratuni</i> to that of Armenia. These two are the native forms of their common Hellenized name <i>Bagratids</i>. I've checked all the pages that link to <i>Bagrationi</i> and all redirects are correct. What we need is to make disambiguations in the articles which link to <i>Bagratids</i>. But there is no problem with Bagrationi. So I'm reverting back to my version, because the curerent disambig page can cause a great confusion.
