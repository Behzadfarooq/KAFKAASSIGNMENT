<p><b>Raymer</b>, no, I don't live in Baguio, but I've been there several times on vacation, and I've gone to most of the tourist spots there. What the page needs are some pictures of Baguio City (public domain pictures if possible), and a map, too (public domain as well). Do you live in Baguio? —<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeav_e019.html" title="User:Seav">seav</a></p>
<p><b>Seav</b>, I have lived in Baguio for about eight years now. I think that I can arrange for some pictures of Baguio by way of a friend who does photography for PhilStar. The map, well, I have permission from the Mayor's office to republish the city engineer's office map, but that is entirely too big. I think I can probably get permission from the Department of Tourism. As with you, I'm pretty busy but I think that I can squeeze some extra material from friends and family and professional acquaintances. —<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymer_0e70.html" title="User:Raymer">Matthew Raymer</a></p>

<dd>Thank you very much. His site should not be placed on there. The only reason why I continue to place BaguioDirectory.com is because I travel to Baguio City all the time. I found them through Wikipedia. They are a directory of all the businesses in baguio city. I cannot find anything when I am there so it is very helpfull to me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I beg to disagree, as Gomi mentioned, clickthecity.com is a more convenient, accurate, and updated directory with everything you need, including lists for reputable internet cafés. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So you are saying that we should put clickthecity in the external links for 'Baguio City?' So why are you fighting so hard for iBaguio which does not provide any of those qualities? Would the Administrator even allow clickthecity.com to be listed on the Baguio City page? If so, great, let's get started. If not, what's left? Obviously that is why I push for baguiodirectory.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
iBaguio.net, although aesthetically appealing, does not help baguio city at all, there is ALMOST NO CONTENT! Look at the tabs for places, lodging, dining, people. It goes to an error page. So why does he keep self-promoting? If his site is considered. this site makes money from the end user though its store and google ad words. That is as commercial (for profit) as it gets.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quote: "(ibaguio) does not help baguio at all" - I'm sure a lot of other site visitors will disagree with you. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am sure a lot of visitors 'would' agree with me, so I'm not sure I understand the point you are trying to make.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If sites were disqualified because of Google Adsense (not ad words), then thousands of sites in external links sections should also be removed. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Haldamir, it doesn't seem that you are able to address the real issues. iBaguio removes baguiodirectory.com on the basis that it is commercial, but feels that their own site is not commercial? Here is what I suggest; using wikipedia, type in commerical, then you will get the definition, then click on the word advertising. Would you say that iBaguio.net is not commercial also? Of course it is. So I am saying that he shouldn't be a hypocrite.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if the content for iBaguio is currently sparse, there is nothing in the guidelines that disqualify the inclusion of the site to the external links section as it provides additional information other that what is in the Wiki article. And you mean to tell us that baguiodirectory and baguiohotel are not commercial sites? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Who said anything about disqualification. Wouldn't you have to 'qualify' your content first? Who did that the site administrator?</dd>
<dd>"And you mean to tell us that baguiodirectory and baguiohotel are not commercial sites?" And you mean to tell me that iBaguio.net is not a commerical site? I never said those two sites were not commercial. You two are making the boisterous claims. All I am saying is that if iBaguio.net can be in the external links, so should baguiodirectory.com and baguiohotel.com</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>the other site Baguiodirectory.com does not make money off the end user. Only business in Baguio so that people like me can get the helpfull information. I travel to Baguio and there is not Internet Connection in the hotel. What am I supposed to do? I need a site like baguiodirectory.com to tell me where the nearest Cyber Cafe is. My fellow travelers need this site.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If there was no internet in the hotel, you wouldn't even be able to log on to baguiodirectory, isn't it not? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good point. I retract that statement. However, it is interesting that you could not address the real issue: "...Baguiodirectory.com does not make money off the end user. Only business in Baguio so that people like me can get the helpfull information." With that, what if I did have internet connection, will iBaguio.net provide such information?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Who in Baguio City would look up 'Baguio City' in Wikipedia. Yes, maybe a few locals, but I am sure it is more focused on future tourists or future residents. would they want to go to iBaguio with 'sparse' information? Doubtfull.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I looked at the helpfull link you posted:</p>
<p>Occasionally acceptable links</p>
<dl>
<dd>"2. Web directories: When deemed appropriate by those contributing to an article on Wikipedia, a link to one web directory listing can be added, with preference to open directories (if two are comparable and only one is open). If deemed unnecessary, or if no good directory listing exists, one should not be included."</dd>
</dl>
<p>iBaguio is not a directory,and has no content. So BaguioDirectory should be considered over iBaguio; otherwise please leave both of them out.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are a classic case of the Filipino "talangka mentality" that I have seen in quite a while. Just because your preferred site is disqualified from inclusion does not mean that other qualified sites should be excluded. Your statements are baseless, I'm a frequent visitor to the old ibaguio site and it had considerable information on profiles of local artists, business investment opportunities, mapping information, travel guides, and relevant news. I personally know the site owner, his redesign was long overdue and I'm guessing the current void is merely a sign of growing pains as they move to the new design (which was made by somebody here). <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No need to try and insult me. Do you usually make assumptions? Also you continue to use the plural version of the word site. I only do not like iBaguio.net because it provides almost no content. What is the point of it being one of the only two sites listed that do not have content? I am not the only one who removed iBaguio.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I am sure you do know the site owner. Once they are done with their growing pains, then go ahead and resubmit his site. I didn't know you were an expert on 'baseless-statements.' So far it seems that all your comments are based only on opinion, assumptions, and no actual FACTS.</dd>

<p><b>In response to 70.170.111.228:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In the first place, I did not put the ibaguio link here, the link was already up (with about a dozen others) when I registered and began adding content to the <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baguio_City_ce7f.html" title="Baguio City">Baguio City</a> page. If you check the history, the external link section was cleaned up by <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolaron_cd38.html" title="User:Polaron">Polaron</a>, your site baguiodirectory.com and baguiohotel.com was removed, the edit summary was tagged as "removed spam links". The only two links left were baguio.gov.ph and ibaguio.net.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Ey gomi, I was the one who added the link (no, I'm not directly associated with ibaguio and I added it unregistered around 2004 if I'm not mistaken) it was at a different domain before when I added, obviously it has been updated. I got your text yesterday, cul8r@sbc. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I didn't add baguiodirectory, yet I am accused of it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I do not understand why <b>you have continously removed other links and inserted your own</b>, and that is the contention here... you didn't have to remove the other links, there have been several instances were baguiodirectory.com was placed on top of the list while other sites were put down. The history does not lie, just check last year's page history.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As I've said earlier, actions speak louder than words. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>very wise.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Please do not think that your IP is not traceable, as it shows up in the logs for baguiodirectory.com. Why don't you register properly in the wikipedia?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>What is that supposed to mean? Trace it all you want. Feel free to see me anytime.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>FYI: iBaguio was formerly the official site for Baguio since 1997 before the official site went up there are signed papers with MosCom Baguio (the operators of the site) to substantiate this. I do not work for MosCom Baguio.</li>
<li>ClicktheCity.com is a better source of directory information for Baguio as well as other cities in the Philippines.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Ditto. I have yet to meet a Baguio citizen who even uses the "other site". Seriously. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>hahaha Why would a Baguio Citizen go to Wikipedia.org, then type in Baguio City, just to go to iBaguio? "Seriously"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Ibaguio does not sell anything. How sure are you that the store link on the site will sell anything? Baguiodirectory.com sells ad space and bookings through baguiohotel.com (which you also added after removing other links), a listing here in the external links section is ultimately intended to drive traffic to the sites revenue earner. Ibaguio does have content, albeit thin. The official baguio site is even thinner in traveller information.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What information do you provide to the traveller, besides events? You mean the offical baguio's City Demographics, Background, Historical notes, are "thinner" traveller information? What about events and News, Forum. etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Please cite valid reasons why ibaguio should be removed from the links as it also provides valid and updated information on whatever content that is actually there.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have sited plenty. I do not really care if iBaguio is removed or not. However if baguiodirectory.com is removed, then iBaguo should not be up their either.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Please also explain why you were deleting the other links, are you being anti-competitive with a clear bias towards the sites that only <b>you</b> like? That was why you were given the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">Vandalism</a> warning several times.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What other links do you refer too?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I'm not into this "editing war" I was only reverting your edits, which were already identified as spam links by another user.<a href="../../../g/o/m/User%7EGomi_3c34.html" title="User:Gomi">Gomi</a> 08:18, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Doesn't the guidelines state that any link can be considered as long as it provides information in addition to the info found in the wiki article? Even if we assume that ibaguio was only one page, it does provide additional info. Perhaps Gomi does not want to mention it but there negotiations to acquire and transfer the site's ownership. However, even if Gomi eventually owns ibaguio, I see no reason why another wiki user cannot add the site to the external links section. If this issue needs further clarification, please message me so i can get you in touch with the current site owner<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 05:28, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The old site located at baguio.com.ph (it's the same one, different domain that had to be dropped when the gov.ph site went online) had a comprehensive list of tourist attractions and traveller information, it's still being updated to the new design including updates to the articles which are being rewritten (some of the original was more than five years old) which explains the lack of pages at the moment. <a href="../../../g/o/m/User%7EGomi_3c34.html" title="User:Gomi">Gomi</a> 11:17, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

With that said, iBaguio does make money from the enduser, because of the Google adsense. I have encountered this before and the people <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUniversity_of_Santo_Tomas_c1ce.html#USTexchange.com" title="Talk:University of Santo Tomas">told</a> me that if the site have ads, better not put it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>i see nothing in the guidelines that prevent sites with ads from inclusion, only <b>objectionable amounts of advertising</b>, just like baguiocity.com <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 14:07, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although clickthecity looks a like a viable alternative, as much as possible Wiki needs to have a local site.</p>
<dl>
<dd>sorry, that was only cited as an example that there are better alternatives, directory wise. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 14:07, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although BaguioDirectory has content, it is primarily a directory, hence should only be "occasionally considered".</p>
<p>Even if it does have content it the policy states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>iBaguio and BaguioDirectory both fail on this one. Another one:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i># A website that you own or maintain, even if the guidelines above imply that it should be linked to. This is because of neutrality and point-of-view concerns; neutrality is an important objective at Wikipedia, and a difficult one. If it is relevant and informative, mention it on the talk page and let other — neutral — Wikipedia editors decide whether to add the link.</i></dd>

<p>Mr. 70.170.111.228, how are you connected to baguiodirectory.com and web coast design? Be civil and professional about this. Please don't try to hide behind an anonymous IP address, it's very easy for me to ask friends around who you are. Baguio is that small. I feel it is a great disservice to wikipedia users that useful sites are not included that provide additional information apart from what is in the Wiki article. The guidelines do provide leeway for "commercial sites" to be added, I request for reconsideration. Mr. Duck, since you obviously have more power than most users, on the topic of the two contested sites, which one is more commercial? ibaguio or baguiodirectory and baguiohotel.com? baguiodirectory is disqualified on two counts: one it being a site that sells services and primarily a forum <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldamir_c82a.html" title="User:Haldamir">Haldamir</a> 07:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) you lack the 'ability' to address specific issues and are unable to hit them head on. 2)obviously enjoy aurguing, and have no sense of common-courtesy or decency. Howard the Duck asks "Do you want both sites up or down?" yet you dodge his question too. 3) Based on the last statement, you make accusations and cannot back anything up. Use humility, and learn to compromise, otherwise, you will continue to have problems. 4) It is funny how I mention the iBaguio.net forum to Alf (administrator), and now the forum has been removed from iBaguio. hypocrite.</dd>

<p>Another point why baguiodirectory should definitely not be included: I went over baguiodirectory's directory... most of the listings are obsolete, it doesn't even list the big internet cafes here. Even lists cafes and computer shops that openly use pirated software. You have to be a local to know this... so much for being a "well-informed" american in the u.s. assuming he knows more about Baguio than the locals. Sheesh.</p>

<p><br />
Hi, I don't mean to intrude in your very animated discussion regarding which external link should be included, and this is my first time at Wikipedia Talk, and would like to clarify a few things:</p>
<p>1. Lisa Araneta, a resident of Baguio since 1991, and a lover of Baguio since 1970, is the webmaster of <a href="http://www.gobaguio.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gobaguio.com" rel="nofollow">Go Baguio! Your Complete Guide to Baguio City, Philippines</a>, not any of the ones included in your list. She has worked on the website for years to provide site visitors with as much free information about Baguio City and strives for it to be one of the most helpful sites on the internet.</p>
<p>2. I don't think that you should limit the links to just one, because the whole point of Wikipedia is to be as complete a resource as possible. It will also limit the reader's choices. Websites that do not have any content can be deleted and later on re-included (like <a href="http://www.ibaguio.net" class="external text" title="http://www.ibaguio.net" rel="nofollow">Ibaguio</a> when the webmaster finally decides to add content to his beautiful design).</p>
<p>3. Sites with Google &amp; other ads are not necessarily money-making or commercial websites, and certainly do not contain "objectionable amounts" of advertising. Pay-per-click (PPC) ads allow a website to earn ad "cents" to pay for the costs of maintaining a website, and earn only IF the ads are clicked. They are limited as to the amounts of ad units allowed, and most do not make that much money at all! The great thing about it is that, with it, webmasters may now give as much free information without having to limit their endorsements to particular advertisers. The whole point is, info sites with PPC ads can "sell" Baguio more effectively and that's a good thing.</p>
<p>4. I think that those sites that appear in the major search engines should be included and not considered spam as they can only appear in the search engines if they have content. You know how hard it is to get listed on those. This avoids judgment calls by few persons and allows the internet marketplace to determine which one gives them the relevant info they need. And the readers deserve this.</p>
<p>5. Without meaning to put <a href="http://www.baguio.gov.ph" class="external text" title="http://www.baguio.gov.ph" rel="nofollow">Baguio's Official Website</a> down, it does turn off some folks because of the membership requirement. I, myself, have been discouraged by this feature many times and have not entered the website simply because sometimes I just want to browse, not join a mailing list. You can imagine how may others have immediately clicked the "back" button and moved on to the next website on the list. Also, while it is No. 1 in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=gmail&amp;q=baguio" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=gmail&amp;q=baguio" rel="nofollow">Google</a>, it appears only in the "lower" pages of <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=baguio&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;vc=&amp;fp_ip=PH" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=baguio&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;vc=&amp;fp_ip=PH" rel="nofollow">Yahoo</a>. So maybe you should reconsider this decision and include other websites that are content-rich also, if you truly want to be fair.</p>
<p>6. Other destinations (like <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila" class="external text" title="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila" rel="nofollow">Manila</a>) have more than one external link, so why should Baguio be limited to one? For example, those who provide free maps should be included. Directories, no matter how incomplete can be included because the valid listings are not invalidated by the obsolete ones. Visitor info websites and portals are very important to a destination. Their research can give more precise and in-depth information to supplement those posted by Wikipedia contributors.</p>
<p>Guys, by including others we have nothing to lose and Baguio has everything to gain! --Creativenative 04:41, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think Creativenative is right. By including others, Baguio has everything to gain! Especially in tourism. As long as the external link is a simple domain link, and the target isn't up to anything indecent I see no problem why it should not be added. -nox Rnocom 02:48, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Other than adding to the load time of the wiki article, what is the purpose of the barangay listing? Unless it had demographic information per barangay I suggest the whole section be removed.</p>
<p>For reference, the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a> page does not have a barangay listing. <a href="../../../g/o/m/User%7EGomi_3c34.html" title="User:Gomi">Gomi</a> 07:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, Manila has 800+ barangays, it would be a very looooooong list. --<b><font color="orange"><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">Howard</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howard_the_Duck_47a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">the</font></a> <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHoward_the_Duck_380d.html" title="User talk:Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">Duck</font></a></font></b> 10:05, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Manila does not list its barangays not because it will be a long list, but because it does not really matter what the barangay names are. But since folks do use Wikipedia as a research tool sometimes, and Baguio's section contains comparatively very little info about Baguio, I think we can keep the barangay list in the meantime (as a "filler," which is what it is right now) until the Baguio section gets really large. The suggestion about demographics is good though. Maybe someone with info will add to that soon. --Creativenative 05:26, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
