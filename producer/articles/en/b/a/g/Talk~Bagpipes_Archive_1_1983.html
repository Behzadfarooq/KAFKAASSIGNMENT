<p>Oh bugger - I meant to look that up *before* posting. Oh well. It would have been easily found using Google (unless it hasn't been spidered yet). OTOH, there's a case that potentially inaccurate information should obviously be such, and I understand that that's better than no info at all, or authoritative looking incorrect info. But that's just me. I'm off to bed now, but I shall try and remember to look it up at some point soon.

<p>There's probably no consensus, but I'd say that information that is likely to be significantly wrong shouldn't be in the article at all, but that information that is either likely to be correct, or likely to be incorrect in only a fairly trivial way (such as the spelling of someone's name) should be included in a "best effort" way.

<dd>With any kind of artistic endeavour, there's folk that don't like it. Some don't like Bob Dylan, some don't like reel-to-reel tapes of Tommy Reck (an Irish folk musician). Some don't like piping. Their choice. Not very interesting, to be honest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bagpipes do have the handicap that it is very easy to be very bad at them. Indeed, until fairly recently, for a bagpipe to be correctly tuned was unusual in any kind of public performance. So, a lot of people don't like bad piping. Me neither. Unfortunately, a lot of folks have never heard good piping. -- <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalum_ff26.html" title="User:Calum">Calum</a> 16:32, 23 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm just combing through this page yet again to try and tease out the unclear from the disputed from the Just Plain Wrong. I'm going to flag up everything here that I'm outright changing with a note as to why.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the GHB was developed. There is insufficient evidence as to whether it came first in Ireland or Scotland. Ireland's references are earlier, but Ireland was far more literate prior to the Reformation. In any case, the mouthblown nine note bagpipe with one or more drones on the shoulder was pretty much universal at this time. I would say the GHB didn't exist in a recognisably modern form until the high days of the MacCrimmons at the earliest, and even examples from this period that survive (quite a few) vary hugely in major ways, including such detail as the pitch of the leading note!</li>
<li>400o year old pipes in Co Wicklow. These weren't bagpipes, dunno where the meeja got that from. They were basically pan pipes: the interesting thing is they seem to have played a major pentatonic scale in Eb.</li>
<li>Popping valve: this was actually invented by the Taylor brothers in America round the turn of the century, and although many modern makers will make one on request, none I know of fit one as standard. Those players who have used one suggest it is unreliable and doesn't offer a sufficient advantage to be worth having.</li>

<dd>What quote is this? I have to say I am generally skeptical - most quotes about bagpipes from early literature turn out to refer to flutes, hornpipes, or other instruments, and have been translated as 'bagpipe' more on the grounds of optimism than serious academic likeliness (that said, there are quite a few references that have been mistranslated into other things, as well). In any case, any bagpipe in Roman Spain is most likely to have been very different to what is played in modern times. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalum_ff26.html" title="User:Calum">Calum</a> 16:48, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have changed a few things regarding Great Highland Bagpipe music (piobaireachd, light music, etc.), "Irish Warpipes"/Brian Boru pipe, "skirl" (stupid word anyway, i almost got rid of it again), please do not add incorrect info, I have been an active piper in an active pipe band for 12+ years, and read about the bagpipe for more, competed in the World's twice, worked for two years in a machine shop making pipes, I can document any changes made in these areas, I can also answer questions if need be; there is a whole world of real pipe band knowledge, music, that is beyond the notice of many. in fact lots more info about a lot on this page, like other bagpipes, history, music, good page - spettro9 2005/05/16</p>
<p>"The slight change from being exactly in Mixolydian mode is to allow it to play three different pentatonic scales." whoever wrote this gem had better write a really long explanation of why they think the bagpipe cannot be tuned in just intonation... and should also talk about how there really are 5 different modes one can play in on the Highland pipes, and all without changing any tuning (Mixolydian in A, Aeolian in B, Ionian in D, Dorian in E, or Lydian in G); They should also comment on how old chanters were quite compromised in their tuning, and generally by now we have gravitated to just about just intonated - listen to any and every winner of the World Pipe Band Championships in recent years (1990s on)- it is just intonation, no compromising of tuning,<br />
And they wrote something about Auld Lang Syne - well it was removed, by me, as it has nothing to do with any bagpiping other than being Scottish..... (you can't play it, the notes go to high, I believe it is the part with the lyrics "...brought to mind...", and we don't bother transposing the high notes down in this case, unlike tunes such as Sean South of Garryowen or others....)... sorry to write so much about such spettro9 2005/07/22</p>
<dl>
<dd>In order for the D on the GHB to form a correct interval with the rest of the D pentatonic scale, it has to be slightly sharp to the drones(ie just intonation). I can't remember if I originally wrote what you're referring too (I didn't use those words, and I don't feel like combing the changelogs), but it is technically right. I think John MacLellan and Donald MacPherson were/are the last pipers to actually tune this way. As for modern pipe bands, there is plenty variation there too - the Vale's flat Ds and Fs and still a fair variety in choice of pitch for the high A. Soloists all choose slightly different pitches for low G, B, D, F, high G and high A.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On a totally different note, there is way too much stuff on this page. It really does need to be split into seperate articles; the discussion on different types of pipes has taken over and there is just way too much information for what is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalum_ff26.html" title="User:Calum">Calum</a> 11:56, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In just intonation, a perfect fourth above the tonic is 2 cents lower than an equal tempered fourth. A perfect fifth is 2 cents higher than an equal tempered fifth. The difference is very small, though, in comparison to a just third, which is 13 cents lower than an equal tempered third. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 19:29, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apologies for being unclear. I'm not talking about the difference between just and equal temperament. With a nine note mixolydian scale there are three major pentatonic scales that can be played (A,D,G). Assume you tune the notes of the A pentatonic in line with the drones, which are tuned to A. Now in order for the D to sound in tune with the D pentatonic scale, it has to be sharp to its just tuning. Which means it is sharp to the drone. For the last hundred odd years or so, piping has been moving steadily away from revering the pentatonic, so this tuning has come to sound wierder and wierder. Bear in mind also that the majority of pipers just tune to what sounds, to them, correct. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalum_ff26.html" title="User:Calum">Calum</a> (11-Oct-05)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Military instrument</span></h2>
<p>At the moment, the history section seems to make little mention of the use of bagpipes as a military instrument. I don't know the details, but I imagine they were used by Scottish regiments in place of the buggle during the 18th and 19th century. As with other military instruments, they would probably have a duel role in supporting moral on the battlefield, whilst also conveying simple commands. However, with the bagpipe, you also hear (possibly apocryphal) accounts of them being used to instill fear in the enemy. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 10:22, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

I have to agree on this one. It's presence under the Uillean pipe header is misleading. The picture may be OK, but it is the wrong picture for that place and it is doesn’t add anything to the article since it is a GHB.

<p>I think it´s a matter of developing this other article, since it seems to be a nice idea to develop each bagpipes model separatelly. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyjeff_cfe5.html" title="User:Tonyjeff">Tonyjeff</a> 18:40, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Restructuring the article</span></h2>
<p>I think that this article has potential to rise to featured status. Not sure how much I could help (maybe it could be suggested for collaboration of the week?) but here are some thoughts on how it could be done; please comment.</p>
<p>First, I think that most of information about various bagpipe types should be moved to separate articles, with them being marked as main articles. As someone noted above, article on the Great Highland Bagpipe is shorter than its section here. Then, we could add an overview of various types. I don't like the practice of calling local bagpipes by their local name. First, because there are some kinds of bagpipes which are the same but could be called with various names in various countries. Second, because the same or practically the same name could refer to different types; there already is some confusion between gaida, gajdy and gajde. Third, because local name oftenly isn't proper name but simply means "bagpipes" (for example, Serbian "gajde" simply means "bagpipes", so I guess that great highland bagpipes are called "velike gorske gajde" in Serbian while northumbrian bagpipes are called "severnoumbrijske gajde" etc. You got the point.</p>
<p>Does a systematisation of bagpipe types exist, so that the we could structure the article according to it? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 09:58, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone created an article on the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galician_gaita.html" title="Galician gaita">Galician gaita</a>. Perhaps most of the relevant section from this article should be moved to that article, leaving here only a paragraph with the most noteworthy and distinctive features. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorge_Stolfi_00bf.html" title="User:Jorge Stolfi">Jorge Stolfi</a> 21:06, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Agreed. I inserted some links to other bagpipes article in order to develop the idea. I think that only one article to talk about every kind of bagpipe would be insane. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyjeff_cfe5.html" title="User:Tonyjeff">Tonyjeff</a> 18:42, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There was mention of a few German bands using the pipes, but it is more than just a few. It is quite popular, and some bands like <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corvus_Corax_db5f.html" title="Corvus Corax">Corvus Corax</a> use various bagpipes exclusively. In other words, its not just an interesting side note as with KoЯn, but a bagpipe scene unto itself almost. Not sure what to do with this, but here are just some of the bands who use pipes in their music: <a href="../../../../de/m/i/t/Kategorie%7EMittelalterband_5a11.html" class="extiw" title="de:Kategorie:Mittelalterband">de:Kategorie:Mittelalterband</a>. Perhaps deserving of its own little section, or not?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Aren't these Medieval bands? Mittelalter means "Medieval," right? So they're not rock bands? You can go ahead and list whatever you know about that's not already listed and you think is relevant. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 03:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Plus on related instruments. I'm no musicologist, but in books I've read on the bagpipe they do make mention of the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pungi.html" title="Pungi">Pungi</a> being very similar (especially to the chanter). May not be hisorically related, but in the sense of an instrument family I think it and the various reed instruments from around the middle east (i.e. those you hear accompanying belly dancers) might be worth a mention? <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhirad_33fd.html" title="User:Khirad">Khirad</a><sup><small><a href="../../../k/h/i/User_talk%7EKhirad_db89.html" title="User talk:Khirad">talk</a></small></sup> 02:47, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Except that the gourd isn't a bag. There are lots of instruments that have multiple pipes that aren't bagpipes, like the Chinese sheng and hulusi, Sardinian launeddas, etc. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 03:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was just about to add Ryofu<a href="http://www.ryofu.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ryofu.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a band that plays metal on the Northumbrian Smallpipes. They hit the headlines last year as the pipe player received death threats (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/4075998.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/4075998.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/4075998.stm</a>) from Folk Music Purists... They're quite well known locally, and it is interesting to have a link to a band that plays the Northumbrian smallpipes.. but I'm right in thinking they're _too_ local to go on the list of artists who play rock on pipes, aren't I?</p>

<dd>What a strange combination. Go ahead and add them. We do, in fact, have contributors from Northumberland here. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 12:18, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About Iberic pipes</span></h2>
<p>The text about spanish and portuguese pipes is very poor. Firstly because "gaita" is a generic term such as "bagpipe" in English, and they do distinguish the models by toponims, like "Gaita Galega" or "Gaita Transmontana", exactly as "Great Highland Bagpipe". Futhermore, the article treats all these bagpipes -- Galician, Transmontan, Asturian, Sanabresa, Catalan -- as the same model, what is an absurd. In the case, it seems that the article is talking about the Galician bagpipe. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyjeff_cfe5.html" title="User:Tonyjeff">Tonyjeff</a> 15:50, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly, I would like to say that this is a terrific article and I am glad to see that the non-celtic forms of the bagpipe get a bit of a run. I have some very good references at home that discuss the Sicilian bagpipe. For the moment, the only thing I wish to clarify is that the Sicilian name is <i>ciaramedda</i> and not <i>chiaramedda</i>, and while it is a dying art, it can still be found in use not only in the province of Messina, but further south as well in the province of Catania, where it is also traditionally used at Christmas time. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 00:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
