	    <p>Well done with the Guisborough and Gisborough Priory stuff! Are you local? <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">Nevilley</a> 23:21 Jan 6, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks. I indeed grew up in Guis, though for 5 1/2 years now I've been away at uni, so it's not as fresh in my mind as it could be. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a> 14:21 Jan 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I used to live in Lowcross Ave, just off Hutton Lane! <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">Nevilley</a> 22:29 Jan 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was down on Thames Ave, though my dad's now on Woodhouse Road, near the footie club. I'd guess you went to Newstead School as well? <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a> 02:51 Jan 9, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Heheheh. Well sort of. I am a *touch* older then you I suspect! I went to Newstead for my last 2 terms of primary, after Hutton Lowcross (up in Hutton Village) closed down. That was in - ermmmm - about 1967 or 68! <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">Nevilley</a> 08:41 Jan 9, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>It occurred to me after I'd written that that I'd assumed you were about my age - a bit of a silly thing to do. I suppose I arrived around 18 years after you left, having spent my first two years at Kemplah. I didn't even know Hutton Village used to have a school. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a> 18:32 Jan 9, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yep it certainly did, it's the thing that is now 3 houses facing the "dig field" up above Mr Wilkinson's farm. Down a lane on the L at the point where you would turn R for blue lake.

<p>I think my sister has a friend who lives down there. By the way, why don't you add anything to the Guisborough article? <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a> 17:24 Jan 10, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey. I just noticed the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub_quiz.html" title="Pub quiz">pub quiz</a> article. I like it. I like it when someone fills in an empty link I created.

<p>Mintguy, did any of your research into football history cover the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offside.html" title="Offside">offside</a> rule? <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a></p>

<p>Do you want to take a look at the first part of my bit about the History of football, it needs another eye looking over it.

<dd>I'd come across that before, but don't quite see the relevance. Still, I'm hardly bothered by its being there, just seems unnecessary. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a></dd>

<hr />
<p>I ordered a couple of books (in fact three) on football history from www.abebooks.com to aid my research. I was recommended by someone to get a book called <i>The History of the Football Association</i> that was published in 1950 (not the similarly titled book published in the 1990s, which I'm also getting). All second hand bookshops that had it in the UK, had it at about £100, but a US bookshop had it for $25, so I'm getting it shipped over. The other books I'm getting is called <i>Code Wars</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></p>
<p>Good call in the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a> article. I'm glad that you made that change. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>

<p>Just wanted to straighten this out – you added a comment to <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooliganism.html" title="Hooliganism">Hooliganism</a> about crowd violence being common at Canadian hockey games. On what incidents or studies were you basing that generalization?</p>
<p>The sticking point for me may be the description of it as common. Certainly there has been crowd violence at hockey games, but it seems pretty infrequent to me (although it seems to be more frequent in the States, it still seems rare there). There is certainly nothing to match the mass violence which is common in soccer. Both teams' fans still sit together at hockey games.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm easily persuaded. If I've been missing something I'll restore the point, or perhaps we can come up with something acceptable to both of us. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 16:30, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're still interested, that was based on reports in the Canadian papers. My comment went a lot further than was justified, but what I think I was thinking was that if some minor violence at cricket matches deserves to be in, then so should stuff at hockey matches. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a> 23:45, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I've <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html#Free_the_Rambot_Articles_project" title="User:Rambot">started a drive</a> to get users to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Wikipedia%7EMulti-licensing_5622.html" title="Wikipedia:Multi-licensing">multi-license</a> all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> Attribution-Share Alike (<i>CC-by-sa</i>) v1.0 and v2.0 <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_License_4fc5.html" title="Creative Commons License">Licenses</a> or into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> if they prefer.

<p>To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" template into their user page, but there are other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>.

It seems to be a natural adaptation of the second-last sentence, bolded below:</p>

<dd><i>The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. <b>The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.</b> They have a world to win.</i></dd>
