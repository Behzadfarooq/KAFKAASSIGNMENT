<p>CEO: Gentlemen, I am obliviously disappoitned at your attempts to control the spam eating population. We must put them to an end!</p>

<p>CEO: Now, will anyone else obliviously disappoint me?</p>

<p>CEO: Gentlemen, I am obliviously disappointed that members of the Spam eating gang are still at large. We must put them to an end.</p>
<p>Peon: But sir! We already got rid of the leaders as well as three other members!</p>
<p>CEO: I am obliviously disappointed at your attempts to remind me. You will DIE!</p>
<p>Peon: Oh no! *Gets shot*</p>
<p>CEO: Now onto the Obliviously good plan part II. We have used tracking location in our Spam to track down the gang's hideouts to three different parts of the city. We must viciously obliterate all these hideouts. We also have allies placed in these locations. Our allies include Ness and Tony Jones. Our other allies consist of former Kids Next Door teenagers and Magi. But don't take the remaining spam eating gang lightly! No one knows what they are armed with, but we can assume it's Boy-band music and/or Sharp Paper. Now let's eliminate them now!</p>

<p>Shopkeeper: Their deaths will not be in vain. With their help, we can revive the previous fallen gang members, stronger than ever before! You laugh this much!</p>

<p>Warning: Spoilers below</p>
<p>The Spam Eaters is a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trilogy.html" title="Trilogy">Trilogy</a> Wikipedia Sandbox entry about a company that makes <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam.html" title="Spam">Spam</a> and mails it to people. However, there is a gang called "The Spam eating gang" that is eating their spam and the <a href="../../../c/e/o/CEO_8589.html" title="CEO">CEO</a> wants it to stop. In the first entry, the leaders of the Spam eating gang are revealed to be <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numbah_1.html" title="Numbah 1">Numbah 1</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Possible_5e05.html" title="Kim Possible">Kim Possible</a>, and the gang consists of several <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kids_Next_Door_00a8.html" title="Kids Next Door">Kids Next Door</a> members (No one knows what they're doing with the Spam eating gang) and retards. They are armed with Boy band Music and sharp paper. At the conclusion of the first Entry of the Spam Eaters Trilogy, the CEO eliminates the leaders and a few high ranked members.</p>
<p>The second entry takes place a week after the first. In the beginning, the CEO instructs his peons and allies to eliminate the remaining members of the Spam Eating gang.More members of the Spam eating gang are revealed but they are eliminated by his allies. One of his Allies, <a href="../../../a/a/n/Aang.html" title="Aang">Aang</a>, has joined the Spam Eating gang and plans to destroy it from the inside. However, before the third and final stronghold is destroyed, it is revealed that the Evil Gypsy Shopkeeper has the remains of the lost members from the first entry in a jar and plans to bring them back to life, stronger than ever before. She also planned to have an army of [Scarabs] to assist them in taking over the world. As the final members are destroyed by the Spam company, the Shopkeeper's plans are a complete success and the members come back to life.</p>
<p>When the Third and Final entry of The Spam Eaters Trilogy begins, the Spam Eaters have complete control over the Spam company, a majority of the metropolis <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, and the Department of Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense They have imprisoned a number of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a> and plan to convert them to Spam eaters. The CEO and his allies hide in one of the few safe places and plan on taking back Wikipedia from the Spam Eaters. They create a lot of Sharp-paper Spam and prepare for an epic battle. Meanwhile, Aang prepares for his assault. He frees imprisoned Wikipedians and builds an army to turn back the Spam eaters in the few safe places left. The CEO then sets the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandbox.html" title="Sandbox">Sandbox</a> as his base, and then he and his allies set off to the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> to take back Wikipedia and restore the Spam company. While the Spam Eaters are occupied with the CEO's gang, Aang sends his army of Wikipedian rebels to the back door. Numbah 1, Kim Possible, Ron Stoppable, and Pikachu are destroyed, but Hamtaro manages to escape to the Shopkeeper and Lizzie McGuire to inform them of the news. The <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climax.html" title="Climax">Climax</a> has the rebels chasing the three remaining Spam Eaters to the tallest tower of the [Main Page] and the spam eating gang is destroyed once and for all. The Spam Eaters Trilogy ends with everyone rebuilding Wikipedia, and thus vowing never to repeat their mistakes and never letting anyone eat spam again.</p>

<p>REUTERS,AFP- In the news today, a grave tragedy occurred with the death of a goldfish. We have this account from the owner: The Goldfish Tragedy<br />
I used to have three goldfish, kept in a little [glass] bowl in my kitchen. My friends decided to name them, always wanting to be helpful. One was named Fishler, after Hitler, for his little one-third of a fish mustach. The next was named Pythagoras, no apparent reason was given for this name. Finally there was a fish named TouchieTouchie, named for a band that had never and would never exist. These fish lived to be fourteen years old, before succumbing to the great fishy sleep in oddly appropriate ways. Fishler lept to his death, after his little castle had become the home of TouchieTouchie. Pythagoras contracted some [disease], and spent his last days endlessly swimming around the edges of the bowl. TouchieTouchie was touched to death by my four year old cousin, snatched out of his bowl and felt and rubbed to death by little toddler hands. This toddler now does not like fish anymore.</p>
<p>Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their disctator</p>

<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: God made the world in six days.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: That is your belief.</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: No, that is a fact.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: It is your opinion that it is a fact.</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: No, it is a plain fact, opinion is irrelevant.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: Well, in order not to offend those who believe differently, I will have to represent it as a belief or opinion.</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: If you do that you will offend me.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: But I have to maintain a Neutral Point Of View.</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: By all means: say that it is a fact that God made the world in six days, and there are some people who don't believe that fact.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: Supppose that I say that it is a fact that you assert that God made the world in six days.</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: That implies that my assertion is just a matter of opinion.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: Well, that's my opinion.</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: So your opinion trumps the facts.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: No matter what I say I am bound to offend someone.</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: That is true, but a NPOV compels you to stick to the facts, and it is a fact that God made the world in six days.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: I think I see the problem. In order to maintain a NPOV I have either to represent all points of view as facts or as opinions or beliefs.</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: That is certainly a solution. But, in either case I can't see what value your wiki can be. In the first case you will be inconsistent. In the second, all facts become irrelevant. Why would anyone be interested in reading either? You should just stick to the facts, and the fact is that God made the world in six days.</dd>
<dt>me</dt>
<dd>&#160;: Can you give me a reference?</dd>
<dt>Tom</dt>
<dd>&#160;: Surely. The book of Genesis.</dd>

<p>I can edit here. I feel special</p>
<p>You should.Because you are special. God bless. The Invisible Pink Unicorn loves you. BBHHH. PRAISE HER! PRAISE HER!! Oh THE INVISIBLE PINK UNICORN, you dont know how much I love even the reverberation of an atom from a vibration of thought that utters Her holiness.</p>
<p>NO ONE ON THIS BOARD KNOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE THE INVISIBLE PINK UNICORN!!</p>
<p>I would KILL GOD for The Invisible Pink Unicorn. THATS how much I love The Invisible Pink Unicorn!!</p>
<p>Every page on Wikipedia should be about The Invisible Pink Unicorn.</p>
<p>We should repo every car and place "I love The Invisible Pink Unicorn" bumper stickers on them.</p>
<p>Why don't you put an "I Love The Invisible Pink Unicorn" header at the top of every page on Wikipedia?</p>
<p>I don't know its a very good question, but yes The Invisible Pink Unicorn is awesome!</p>
<p>I feel special too! Vitamin IPU!</p>

<p>Found at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Village Pump</a> "new projects" proposals, so not officially belonging here, but its relevant</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandbox.html" title="Sandbox">Sandbox</a> really doesn't give much to the imagination. Have you ever played in a sandbox as a child? There's <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sand.html" title="Sand">sand</a>, and that's it. Therefore, I propose that the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a> be renamed and moved to Wikipedia:Play-Doh Super Fun Factory. <a href="../../../d/r/z/User%7EDrZoidberg_faab.html" title="User:DrZoidberg">DrZoidberg</a> 17:32, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Wikipedia is not for advertising. We can't use <a href="../../../p/l/a/Play-Doh_d993.html" title="Play-Doh">Play-Doh</a> in any case, as that's a trademark. And I beg to differ that a <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandbox.html" title="Sandbox">sandbox</a> isn't evocative enough. Read the article—it's spawned some interesting metaphors, and some interesting vandalism, which I just reverted. And you have seen Wikipedia:Sandbox In-sand-ity, right?</dd>
<dd>Oh, and nice attempt to get into <a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_jokes_and_other_deleted_nonsense_9356.html" title="Wikipedia:Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense">Wikipedia:Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense</a>, by the way.

<dd>I was serious! But if it's really that stupid, then never mind, I guess... <a href="../../../d/r/z/User%7EDrZoidberg_faab.html" title="User:DrZoidberg">DrZoidberg</a> 17:55, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd><i>Stupid</i> is a big word. "Interesting in an amusing sort of way" covers it better. Hey, it's the Sandbox. It's tradition. We'd sooner <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_users_should_not_be_allowed_to_edit_articles" class="extiw" title="m:Anonymous_users_should_not_be_allowed_to_edit_articles">disallow anonymous users to edit articles</a> than rename the Sandbox.

<dd>Hey, I just realized something... If the Sandbox was located at Wikipedia:Play-Doh Super Fun Factory that would get rid of all those problems with people editing the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandbox.html" title="Sandbox">Sandbox</a> article. (There's currently no article at Play-Doh Super Fun Factory). <a href="../../../d/r/z/User%7EDrZoidberg_faab.html" title="User:DrZoidberg">DrZoidberg</a> 18:08, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I was sorely tempted, sorely <i>sorely</i> tempted to turn that into a redirect to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a>... but I didn't.&#160;:-) Why not Wikipedia:Anything goes, then? Or Wikipedia:Edit me? Or... I've got it... Wikipedia:Quicksandbox? B-) <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 18:17, 2004 Dec 8 (UTC)

<dd>Let's make a whole bunch of them!

<dd>I like "Letters to the Editor" a lot. This could easily be a valuable page for <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> from regular contributors. Especially the implication that Wikipedia has an editor is hilarious. Of course, we shouldn't encourage people to waste time on not contributing to articles...
