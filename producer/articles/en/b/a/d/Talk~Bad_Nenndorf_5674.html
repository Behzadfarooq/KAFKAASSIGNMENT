<dd>KarlV, I am not sure what your particular concerns are. You have claimed inaccuracy and POV, and have chosen to frame your concern in terms that could be interpreted as a personal attack on fellow editors, but you have given no justification for your claims. This and your 3RR violation make you less likely to be taken seriously.</dd>
<dd>As for the content of your edit, I can only emphasise once again that the prison at Bad Nenndorf meets all the formal criteria of a concentration camp, even if the sources do not use that particular word: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Concentration_camp</a></dd>

<dd>First of all I think that I am complying with the formal criteria of the article <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internment_camp.html" title="Internment camp">Internment camp</a>. And your mentioned article is, instead of that I have mentioned without good sources (see e.g. definition). Secondly, what is that, there are good sources, no one of them is talking about <i>concentration camps</i> but because of a definition, which IMHO seems to be POV, you want to tell me, that, even the sources do not use that particular word, it meets formal criterias? Criterias which are not proved? So, you want to tell me, that we do not need sources? Third - no, I do not want to bring in an error in this article, but, there was a German User (who was now suspended because of vandalism, plese be so kind an inform yourself), who wants that the British Internment camp is called concentration camp, which is simply wrong (see the sources and the formal criteria of the article internment camp). See what happened with the German article and the User. So I want to bring an error out of this artcle and nothing else.

<dd>From the very article you referenced: "The term concentration camp lost its original relatively innocent meaning after Nazi concentration camps were discovered, and has ever since been understood to refer to a place of mistreatment, starvation, forced labour, and murder. The expression since then has only been used in this extremely pejorative sense; no government or organization has used it to describe its own facilities, using instead terms such as internment camp, resettlement camp, detention facility, etc." As mistreatment, starvation etc. took place at this location, it very well fits the definition of concentration camp. Also, it gives the reason that official sources would not use that term, (no government will use it, even if it is correct). This is quite clear. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia should use the most common term the sources use, and I only see "internment" in the sources listed. Does anyone have a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source</a> that calls Bad Nenndorf a "concentration" camp? <a href="../../../h/g/b/User%7EHGB_8569.html" title="User:HGB">HGB</a> 21:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, no government calls anything a concentration camp, even when it fits the definition. Its too much a charged word. Should we bow to their cowardice and POV? What I'm saying here, is that we shouldn't be replicating the bias of sources. That does no good for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"As one minister of the day wrote, as few people as possible should be aware that British authorities had treated prisoners "in a manner reminiscent of the German concentration camps"". Now that is a direct quote from one of the sources, and although the facts are hedged upon, calling it a concentration camp is exactly what that minister did. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are plenty of camps explicitly called "concentration camps" but no one, so far as I can find in any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, actually calls Bad Nenndorf a "concentration" camp. This link you mention which only says Bad Nenndorf is "reminiscent of the German concentration camps", it's really pushing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> to try to label it as such, and it's not in Wikipedia's scope to engage in novel research to rename things other than what they're commonly called. I suggest this quote you mention (if it qualifies as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>) be quoted in the text, but the heading should be what everyone commonly calls it, "internment" camp. <a href="../../../h/g/b/User%7EHGB_8569.html" title="User:HGB">HGB</a> 21:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>that's from one of the sources already listed, not anything I just made up or is unreliable. It isn't OR to call something what it is. matching something with its definition is not OR either.

<dd>The more I look at this, and I was trying to find a compromise way of even using this quote calling it "reminiscent" of German concentrations camps, it's just unusable. The only person even making a comparison is some vague unnamed "minister of the day". And yes, it is OR to rename something from it's common usage to something no one else explicitly calls it. I'm changing it back to "internment" unless someone can find something better to back up the "concentration" camp label. And since you're an admin who stepped in to block another editor on this very issue, you probably shouldn't be involving yourself in the debate and making reverts yourself like you did to me.

<dd>Yep, you're right, it was Samsara not you. I had the two of you confused, I apologize. Admins are discouraged from blocking other editors on pages in which they are editing so it would have been better had s/he found a neutral admin who hadn't been involved here to block the editor violating 3rr. Samsara may want to take note of that for future reference. <a href="../../../h/g/b/User%7EHGB_8569.html" title="User:HGB">HGB</a> 05:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In such clear cut cases of 3RR such as that it is perfectly acceptable for any admin to block. Stopping an edit war is a completely different thing than actually edit warring, and while the difference can be subtle, there is a difference. Just because one is a previous contributor, doesn't mean one can't stop an edit war. That block was not controversial in the least and the wording being reverted was not originally inserted by Samsara, rather it was the choice of another editor. If the call on #3RR had been dicey or the page protected, that would be a different story. However, this is not the place to discuss blocking policy. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 05:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At any rate, it's free advice for Samsara (and you as well since you're an admin) to take it or leave it, no need to further discuss. <a href="../../../h/g/b/User%7EHGB_8569.html" title="User:HGB">HGB</a> 06:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>My feeling is still that what the sources <i>call</i> it is irrelevant (in fact, you're onto a definite loser there as most of the sources are in German); more relevant is what was going on there, and what is the appropriate way to refer to the activities. As such, I propose to call it interrogation camp, since that was the original purpose of the facility, even if it was subsequently deviated from (in that known innocents were "interrogated" - what for, one cannot imagine). In fact, I would question calling it a "camp", since it has nothing camp-like. Camp sounds makeshift, but this was not even in a purpose-built building. More of an interrogation centre, perhaps.</s> - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 22:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just one problem: I've looked up the original coverage in <i>The Times</i> of 1948 and at no point does it call it a "torture camp". The term is extremely POV and purely the invention of the Guardian. The article itself is also very unsatisfactory. It's obvious that the Guardian didn't bother looking at the contemporary coverage - if it did, it's well disguised. The case wasn't some new scandal which nobody had ever heard about before the Guardian wrote its report, as there was extensive coverage in the press over a period of several months in 1948 (and probably 1947, when the scandal appears to have broken). Very little that the Guardian printed in 2005 seems to be new info; much of it came out in the 1948 courts martial and is in <i>The Times</i> reports, in a far less sensationalist form. Since my local library has access to <i>The Times</i> digital archives, I'll rewrite the article to reflect what was said at the time, rather that just relying on the Guardian's rather exaggerated account. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you've missed my point. The investigation certainly found evidence of torture - I'm absolutely not denying this. The point is that we shouldn't take every <i>allegation</i> of torture as being confirmed, and the reports from the courts-martial do strongly suggest that many of the allegations weren't regarded as reliable. This isn't to say that abuse never happened, merely that not everything that was claimed to have happened was judged to have happened. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:37, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, then to be absolutely NPOV, you need to write it exactly like that: state what the witnesses and victims said, state what the tribunal found. But don't massage the article to convey the findings of the tribunal as fact. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 09:01, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Key-word "torture" cant be found in the lemma any longer. I would suggest to make clear torture happened.

<dd>The new article is in the category "Human rights abuses" alongside Abu Ghraib, and with Torture as a subcategory.
