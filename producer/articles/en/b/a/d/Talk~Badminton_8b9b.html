<p>Important: The IBF has agreed on adopting the experimental scoring system as the new rules for the game untill at least the 2008 olympic games. The entire rules section should be changed to the new rules. <b><a href="../../../g/e/m/User%7EGemertp_c539.html" title="User:Gemertp">Gemertp</a> 09:47, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>In the beginning of the article, it says "The game of badminton is not reccommended for high school students, especially participation classes." That should be elaborated upon.</p>
<p>I removed this unsubstantiated claim from the History section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is now the second most popular sport in the world behind Soccer.</i></dd>

<p>I find this hard to believe, especially since good stats on such things are hard to come by. <a href="http://www.johann-sandra.com/popular.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.johann-sandra.com/popular.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> tries to settle the debate, and concludes that badminton is in fact 6th, not 2nd - but then it also unearthed the fact that 1 in 6 of the world's population play <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a>. Hmm.</p>
<p>If someone has some hard facts, free free to add them in, but I don't believe the 200 million figure for badminton quoted on that page either. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> 09:08, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I came across a couple of 1850s punch cartoons (54 and 59) implying Badminton was already popular enough then to be a nuisance on the Streets of London so I query if if really only arrived in the UK in the 1850s.

<dd>The cartoon shows the game of battledore and shuttlecock which goes back to medieval times and out of which Badminton evolved.

<dd>Sure seems out of copyright but I think out of courtesy, also as it is the only attribution to author and date, and also as most of the work in these old things is scanning and cleaning the pictures you should link to the site it was lifted it off which was <a href="http://john-leech-archive.org.uk" class="external text" title="http://john-leech-archive.org.uk" rel="nofollow">John Leech Archive</a> which I will do.</dd>

<p>I found a great picture of a jump smash which I would like to add but I'm really new here and the image copyright policy is so detailed... I think I can manage it. Need to e-mail the author of the picture. Qazx 9:25, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am going to edit to illustrate badminton as a sort of mixture of tennis and volleyball. While much of play is similar to tennis (singles and doubles) the feature of the 'ball' not being allowed to hit the playing surface is in common with volleyball. All three have similar court proportions and the feature of a net.</p>
<p>I edited the following lines: "The game of badminton may look easy to play, but it can be physically more tiring than tennis since the tennis ball travels at a much slower speed as compared to a shuttlecock. When you play a shot in tennis you use the whole of your arm in one sweeping action, whereas in badminton you use the flick of your wrist and a step to give maximum power and accuracy." 1.It is doubtful that tennis ball travels at slower speed on average, given that badminton shuttle slows down a lot at the end. I reworded this a little to correct that. 2. It's a common misconception that badminton involves mostly flicks of wrist. Everything is used in badminton: finger pressure, arm pronation, arm extension, shoulder rotation, waist... Even fast flat drives involve a lot more than wrist flicks.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Under Equipment-&gt;String: "Racquets strung at lower tensions (18 to 21 lbf or 80 to 95 N)provide greater control while racquets strung at higher tensions generate greater power (21+ lbf, over 95 N) ." I would have thought it was the reverse. Higher tension produces a stiffer string bed, allowing more control over power generation.Hagane 03:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a sub header to the Rules section to explain the IBF experimental scoring system, and added in the History section that the experiment will last untill May, when the IBF will decide if the rules become permanent. I thought adding a new section was better than to add comments to every line saying what the rule would be in the experiment. <a href="../../../g/e/m/User%7EGemertp_c539.html" title="User:Gemertp">Selar</a> 16:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>I agree that the article will benefit from two or three action photographs. As nobody has added anything since the above comments were posted, I have added a photograph that I took myself, about 4 years ago. It is the only action photograph I have ever taken where the shuttlecock was clearly visible. The photo isn't all that good - so anyone should feel free to replace it when they find something better.

<p>Ive been to a sports store, and they talked to me about offensive and defensive racquets, offensive beeing pointed at the end, vs defensive have a larger surface. Is this point real? should i add it into the article? <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaat_e5ec.html" title="User:Paat">paat</a> 21:00, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are only two shapes that I know of: Isometric shape and normal (oval) shape. Isometric shape provides a larger surface area, theoretically increasing the size of the sweet spot, while the oval shape are smaller in surface area of racquet. In terms of offensive and defensive racquet, I believe that these additional surface area (due to strings, and a slightly larger racquet) does contribute to the offensive and defensive style: My observations:</p>
<p>- Yonex produces AT800 Offensive and Defensive, both head-heavy (more weight on the frame than handle) and isometric head shape. The primary difference between the two are the shape of the frame - AT800 DE are more conventional (triangular), whilst AT800 OFF are more of a boxed shape. Their hypothesis for a defensive racquet is to allow minimum air friction.</p>
<p>- Alternatively, a head-light racquet are often considered a defensive style racquet as well. These racquets are designed to be more maneuverable, hence allowing better defence.</p>
<p>The second point are my perception, based on my experiences with various racquets.Hagane 03:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we should avoid allowing any racket manufacturer's marketing terms to penetrate the encyclopedia article.

<p>What's with the weird spelling? Surely the normal spelling is racket? I've <i>never</i> seen the spelling <i>raquet</i> before, the OED has raquet as an alternative to racket.

<dd>I suppose it's originally french (raquette) but <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racquet.html" title="Racquet">Racquet</a> seems to be correct english. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenullian_5249.html" title="User:Venullian">Venullian</a> 19:58, 26 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>OED says it's of <i>uncertain origin</i>: <i>Forms: 6 rackat, -it, Sc. rakkett, rakcat, 6-7 rackette, 8 -ett, 5- racket; 6-9 raquet, 7 -ett, 9 racquet. See also RAQUETTE. [a. F. raquette (16th c.) = Sp., Pg. raqueta, It. racchetta, lacchetta, of uncertain origin (see Littré and Devic): hence also Du. raket (in Kilian racket), G. rakete, -ette.]</i>, and has this quote from <i>1624 CAPT. SMITH Virginia II. 27 <b>The Beaver..His taile somewhat like the forme of a Racket.</b></i>. so racket is not a particularly modern usage. I didn't say that raquet is not correct, I said that it is not in common usage. It seems strange to me to be using antiquated or obscure spellings in a modern encyclopedia. But it may be that the spelling <i>raquet</i> is used more commonly outside the UK, in which case I</dd>

<p>Not sure about other countries, but at all the clubs I've played with in Australia, you can only score on service, as in tennis i.e only the player or team who served the point is able to win a point; a dropped service does not mean the opposite player/team is awarded a point. Maybe it's just me, but the way it read in the article in a few places made it sound like either side could win a point at any time? Can someone clarify? Also in Aus, it is spelt "racquet".</p>
<dl>
<dd>The IBF have changed the scoring rules to "rally point scoring", which means that either side can win a point at any time. Wikipedia should primarily reflect the current scoring system, not the old one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Racquet" is an acceptable alternative spelling; but in issues of variant spellings we should prefer modern usage. "Racket" is more common and is just as correct. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Hopley_0f36.html" title="User:Mike Hopley">Mike Hopley</a> 10:21, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, just to further explain - in the 'chapter' on point scoring this is explained well, but in paragraph two it is noted "in either case, the winner will add a point to his score" and then in comparisons to tennis "in tennis the serve is dominant to the extent...". I feel these confuse the issue a bit?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm guessing they say it like that because you can rarely hit an ace or something like that in badminton. You can easily score points on the opponent's serve, which is more difficult in tennis I guess. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenullian_5249.html" title="User:Venullian">Venullian</a> 05:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article has become fairly long, partly because I've added lots of information to it. It currently contains over 7000 words of main text. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia: Article size</a> says, "Readers may tire of reading a page much longer than about 6,000 to 10,000 words". We could potentially split the article. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the scoring system development to another article (readers are generally not interested in the minutiae of IBF changes). We would, however, need to leave a short indication that the scoring system has recently changed and explain the difference.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Summarise the history section and move the existing section to a new article (could combine with scoring system development).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Remove the detailed stroke descriptions to another article. Unfortunately, we can't really do this without removing the strategy section as well, and I can't even think of a satisfactory way to split the strokes.</li>

<p>Use of plastic shuttles tends to be limited to beginners/intermediates. The pros do NOT use plastics for practice.</p>
<p>The flight and feel of the shuttle is significantly different. Plastic shuttles tend to go very fast at the beginning because the skirt crumples, then slows down very rapidly once the skirt is restored. Feather shuttles do not exhibit this behaviour. Most badminton clubs seem to use cork based plastics if they use plastic shuttles. Plastic/synthetic "corks" are very different to feather shuttles.</p>

<dd>The vandalism, some of it quite obscene, happens on average (over last 10 days) once or twice a day, with most edits being reverted in a few minutes, but with a couple reverted only after a few hours. This level of vandalism is clearly manageable but the question is, is the vandalism staying long enough to cause real problems for the article/Wikipedia.

<p>Later, the choice of 18 (13 for women's singles) was deleted. I'm sorry, but my english is very bad to change it in the article. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanNito_ef37.html" title="User:MontanNito">MontanNito</a> 22:51, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have two suggestions for this article -</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a See Also section at the bottom (common with other articles e.g. see <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">Tennis</a> theirs is probably a bit long).</li>
<li>The scoring system could do with a part at the top saying that this system has only just come into force (IBF/date) and that some people may be still be using older systems - link to historical section above. Also the scoring system is still very hard to read not sure how to make better - but makes much more sense when you read IBF's version.</li>

<dd>There is a very good reason for having a See Also section - loads of people wont read the whole article and will just want to see where else they can be led to within Wikipedia - hence the See Also section. So for example in the article on George Bush there will be a see also section with a wikilink to the Republican party even though it will have a link in the text. You can use wikilinks more than once - and at the mo this article in under wikilinked.</dd>

<dd>Okay fair enough remove some of the dates - but keep the 1860s one as culturally relevant and the dates of set up of Bad and IBF as important to compare with other events. And with respect to the See Also section - you must have this in, and it should contain the most sort after 5 links on Badminton in Wikipedia at least - to not do so is silly.

<p>The article states <i>"It is a common misconception that lower string tension increases power, and higher string tension increases control. Higher string tensions actually increase both power and control, until the player reaches a maximum playable tension."</i></p>
<p>While I believe that this is correct, the misconception does appear to be <i>very</i> common indeed, including on Ashaway's website (and the same article reproduced at badminton.tv), so it would be great if someone could find a good reference.

<dd>Can someone explain why the string is not strung diagonally, both ways of course, across the racquet face? The longest length in this pattern is shorter than in the conventional up-and-down, side-to-side pattern. Under the same tension, the string will response a little bit faster.Zymogen 21:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have rewritten the <b>basic strokes</b> section as continuous prose, replacing the long list that was a complaint in the Featured Article nomination. If this goes down well, I will give <b>advanced strokes</b> a similar treatment, and both will be subsumed under the new heading of <b>badminton strokes</b>.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wikipedia prefers content in prose rather than long lists.</li>
<li>I think the new prose gives better context.</li>
<li>Three headings are removed from the excessively long Table of Contents, with a further four headings to disappear later.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Update</b></p>
<p>Okay, the advanced strokes section is now prose too. I haven't kept absolutely every stroke that was in the list; I think illustrating the general ideas of badminton skills is more important than a complete taxonomy of every possible stroke and deception.</p>
