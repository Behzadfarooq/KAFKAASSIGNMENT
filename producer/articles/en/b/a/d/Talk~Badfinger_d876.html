<p><i>Peter</i> Ham has always been referred to as <i>Pete</i> Ham (see for example <a href="http://badfingerlibrary.freeservers.com/SoloBadfinger/PeteHam/PeteHamLibrary.html" class="external free" title="http://badfingerlibrary.freeservers.com/SoloBadfinger/PeteHam/PeteHamLibrary.html" rel="nofollow">http://badfingerlibrary.freeservers.com/SoloBadfinger/PeteHam/PeteHamLibrary.html</a> ), so shouldn't we change that again? <a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">KF</a> 11:01 Nov 29, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, KF. I've never heard him referred to as "Pete". In fact, I've never heard Tommie Evans referred to as "Tom" before either. Like them, I come from the Swansea area, and I was basing what I've written on little snippets I've picked up over the years. But it may well be the case that a lot of people called them "Pete" and "Tom" - you probably know more about it than I do. Can we have a redirect? --<a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think a redirect is necessary. I've just removed the two r's. And no, I don't know more about them than you do: It's just that on the LPs/CDs I have he is always called Pete Ham. Thanks a lot, and have a nice evening. --<a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">KF</a> 19:17 Dec 28, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with the Jan. 2006 wiki message that the Badfinger information presented here is haphazardly pieced together. The general info is good, but there are far too many superlatives to suggest to the reader that it is objective. I don't know if it needs a complete rewrite or just some diligent editing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some diligent editing I think. I'll come back periodically, and good to see you've had a crack at it today too. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:40, 25 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, a professional reading should refer to individuals by surname only once they have been identified by full names (unless there is a link attached). I made these changes where I could, and removed several redundancies. Some loaded adjectives were neutralized, unless they were attributed to a third party ("reviewers said it was wonderful," etc.). It still has problems with flow.
<dl>

<p>There was barely any information in the Pete Ham article that was not already covered in the Badfinger article. The only notable exception was the inclusion of his suicide note. Is this information really warranted, or does it fall under the category of 'morbid curiosity?' <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 23:08, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's short. If it's genuine I think it should stay as it sums up his frustrations more eloquently than we could. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 00:55, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK. I know it's genuine. The remark about "tragic irony" of Ham's early support of Polley can be left out. I know it is a fact as it has been stated by many, many people, but it's a little awkward here anyway. I'll see if I can source it and find some other place for it.
<dl>
<dd>The removal of Ham's separate biograpy resulted in the loss of his birth/death information, which means anyone researching the man will not be able to use Wikipedia as a source of that information. People of less significant historical importance than Pete Ham have retained a listing. I note Joey Molland has retained a listing. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">Anonymous</a> 02:34, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would need to be fixed then. We can also make sure that the Pete Ham redirect is all in the right categories, so people will still find him but will be taken to this page when they click on his name. The reason for the merger was this - that there isn't much which is verifiable and enyclopedic to say about Pete Ham which isn't also part of the Badfinger story. We can certainly think about this, revert if neccessary or at least ensure he's covered to your satisfaction in the article. Note that for a favourite band of mine you may not have heard of, there is a similar situation. To most long term fans of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shamen_0089.html" title="The Shamen">The Shamen</a>, William Sinnott was the guy who made a big mark on the band, brought some soul to the band, pushed them forward. A lot of people regard <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._C_8228.html" title="Mr. C">Mr. C</a> as a rapping Cockney wide boy. And yet, Mr. C has an article because he is <i>notable for things outside that band</i> whereas Sinnott (who also died early) is notable only for being in that band. So, what we've done here isn't unusual or illogical and certainly isn't meant as a slight against Peter Ham. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:12, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The rationale for removing the Pete Ham article is that there is barely anything to be said about him outside of the Badfinger context. The same applies to Tom Evans and Mike Gibbins (although these two did have some minor exterior work). Both Joey Molland and Bob Jackson have extensive recording histories before and after Badfinger, either solo or with other bands. This exterior information can be pertinent but otherwise would not fit the Badfinger article. I am a huge fan of Ham, he's my favorite artist from the group, but his musical legacy is completely interwoven with Badfinger. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 23:42, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pete Ham has only one solo record fewer than Joey Molland does, thanks to Dan Matovina. At any rate, none of this addresses the peculiar lack of biographical information that remains about the man. When was he born? Where? Far less notable people can be found here with their biographical details intact. That the founder of an entire genre of music (PowerPop) cannot be is, IMO, a travesty. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">Anonymous</a> 17:45, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>The version of this listing as I found it made two references to Paul McCartney playing piano on "Come and Get It" and another Badfinger track. The recordings themselves do not list such a credit, nor could I find such a credit in other reference books. McCartney played piano on his original demo for Badfinger, but I find no credit for him on the finished product.

<dl>
<dd>The claim of McCartney's piano involvement on the two tracks comes from Ron Griffiths and Mike Gibbins. I believe (not sure) that Tom Evans also stated as much. You might want to check the link to <i>Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger</i> and query the author, Dan Matovina. He interviewed the three band members. There is also an unsubstantiated suggestion that McCartney does some yells and "whoops" in the background on the track "Rock Of All Ages," which many people claim to hear (including myself). At any rate, any McCartney connections beyond production is not a big deal.

<dd>Actually, McCartney initially wasn't even credited as <i>producer.</i> According to Neil Aspinall (ref. biography), the Beatles were "modest" about their contributions to artist recordings. The original production credit for "Come And Get It," "Rock Of All Ages" and "Crimson Ship" was not stated on the singles or albums.-- <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 20:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Remember that there were many performances not credited in those days due to restrictions placed on musicians by their recording companies. Clapton played on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" from the White Album and was never credited. I don't think George Harrison was originally credited for his slide guitar solo on "Day After Day" for that matter. Considering the involvement of the various Beatles in the career of Badfinger, it's not hard to believe that Sir Paul may have played piano on "Come and Get It".</p>

<p>You recently edited some information pertaining to Warner Bros. and Badfinger and the escrow fiasco and I did some more research and found out more information saying that it was 600,000 not 100,000. For instance a <a href="http://userweb.suscom.net/~badfinger/newstand/art003.htm" class="external text" title="http://userweb.suscom.net/~badfinger/newstand/art003.htm" rel="nofollow">Rolling Stone Article</a> claims this</p>
<p><i>Still Badfinger's worst problems began when the Apple contract expired and the band signed with Warner Bros., which offered more money. Shortly after the 1974 release of Wish You Were Here, Badfinger's second album for the label, an audit of a band account that had held approximately $600,000 of advance money in escrow came up empty. Warner Bros. immediately yanked the album from record stored. It had been bulleting up the charts and selling 25,000 copies a week. Although the band members hadn't raided the escrow account and the money was later returned, the momentum had been halted. "It killed the album outright;" says Molland. "It broke up the band, and Pete died six months later</i></p>
<p>Again here from the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll <i>...when Warner Bros., claiming (erroneously it would turn out) that $600,000 in a band escrow account was missing, pulled the album from stores.</i></p>
<p>If its alright with you I'm going to change the Badfinger article back to $600,000 and adding it was a false claim. If you have any issues with that please don't hesitate to tell me and I'm glad to see a fellow wikipedian steadfastly monitoring an article, for me I do <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_%26_The_Dominos_d2ab.html" title="Derek &amp; The Dominos">Derek &amp; The Dominos</a> and I think its really beneficial when a person monitors an article, it helps prevent small vandalism that gets hidden and helps to ensure accuracy.

<dd>Well, I can only tell you that the Rolling Stone article is based on off-the-cuff comments by Joey Molland, and it is certainly wrong. I'm sure other articles referenced Rolling Stone, but they would be equally wrong. It is an error that is feeding on itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Dan Matovina and myself went through the lawsuit complaint by WB with a fine-tooth comb and there was <i>never</i> any claim about $600,000 missing from an account. What happened is that there were <i>two</i> escrow accounts set up by WB Publishing: Account 1 for $500,000, Account 2 for $100,000. The first account always had a correct balance in it, with deductions being made for two Badfinger albums. WB never complained about this account. The second account, however, was completely emptied - presumably by Stan Polley. Polley was allowed to make two deductions from the second escrow account, which should have left a balance of of about $83,000. So, in a sense, WB wanted to know where the $83,000 went.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When the dust settled in the late 1970s, the courts found Polley owed WB something like $45,000(?) (I can't remember now how they came up with a lower figure). But it has been a blatant falsehood for decades when people claim Badfinger was ripped off for "millions of dollars." When properly calculated, the actual figures are far, far lower. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 15:49, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that when referencing information, Patman is correct. But there are many legitimate sources for faulty information. The cause has been Joey Molland's word being taken as gospel by reporters when the man is relying on a faulty memory, coupled with his tendency to exagerrate dollar figures. Believe me, Polley never stole "millions" from Badfinger, and Polley was never accused of taking $600,000 from WB. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 15:49, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suspect you're right, and I preempted it with a recent edit summary where I said that a music magazine feature based on interviews with band members is hardly a reliable source for fact. It might be best to find an interview source where Molland is cited as claiming it was 600,000 (and if he mentions Polley by name that would be good too) and we can quote him <i>directly</i>; and then find another source which disputes the figure. It's quite alright to be indefinite in our articles; if controversy exists we should document both sides and let the reader draw their own conclusions I think (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in a way).

<dd>There are many articles online citing the $600,000 amount, but they are always offerred in paraphrase. Some are culled from Molland interviews, and others are based on previous articles. Here's a link to a discussion board that comtains article snippets that is closer to reality (and you'll note they reference the actual lawsuit). You'll have to scroll down to Badfinger:</dd>

I said $83,000, but it may be $183,333 because the two accounts were accessed by Polley. Remember, some deductions were legitimate although WB claimed they weren't. So the truth of the matter lay in the middle somewhere. If memory serves, Badfinger was allowed to draw escrow compensation for two LPs (<i>Badfinger</i> and <i>Wish You Were Here</i>), and for three LPs worth of publsihing (<i>Badfinger,</i> <i>Wish You Were Here</i> and <i>Head First</i>).</dd>

<p>OK, from <i>Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger,</i> page 227. On December 27, 1974, WB Music (publishing division) requested a writ of attachment from Badfinger for US$175,969.27. A Superior Court judge approved US$20,000, but the rest had to wind through the lawsuit. Matovina does not have the amount in the book that was actually claimed, but Richard Dilello cited it as US$183,333 from the court documents (see link higher up). In October 1975, WB Records (record division) demanded Polley return US $250,000 from a different escrow account, because Badfinger had not finished its contract with the label (page 304). This amount was settled out of court. On December 8, 1978, Judge Julius Title ordered that Polley pay back WB Music (publishing division) US$42,000. So... according to the courts, Polley took US$42,000 from WB Music that was not his. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 04:24, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although this issue hasn't come up yet, I would like to address it now since the missing escrow amount is being contested. Molland has often claimed Polley stole "millions" from Badfinger. His amounts have varied through the years (depending on the interview), but has generally fallen between $2 million and $6 million.</p>
<p>Matovina and I calculated Badfinger's income from 1970 through 1975, when Polley managed the band, and we were able to account for most of their recording and publishing income. Polley took a hefty sum from the band from these income sources, but it was a legal amount per his contract with the group - hence, very little could be considered "stolen." We were unable to account for the band's concert income, as the receipts are no longer available, and they were handled through Jeff Franklin's company. We were, however, capable of putting together a ballpark figure based on ticket sales and group expenses.</p>
<p>The amount Matovina and I arrived at was somewhere between $800,000 and $1.5 million. This would be money that should have gone to the band but did not. Noteworthy here, band money also had to be divided five ways; 4 band members, plus Bill Collins (all equal splits, if not counting publishing splits). The amount we arrived at that Molland <i>may</i> have had "stolen" from him was approximately $100,000 to $200,000. The amount would be higher for Pete Ham and Tom Evans, due to the higher split they receive for <i>Without You</i> publishing (which is the cashcow for Badfinger).</p>
<p>I wanted to address this now in case it comes up later. If need be, sources might be provided to verify these calculations are close. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 18:34, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With respect for the 3-revert rule, and since the new editor obviously is unfazed by reverts (and does not read this discussion board), I guess the best strategy now is to wait it out until the editor's motivation wanes; At which time I will revert again. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 22:36, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If he's adding nonsense or slander, just revert it. Unfortunately I don't know enough about the band to know if his contributions are good or not (although the English certainly leaves something to be desired). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 22:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's not nonsense or slander. The information (in my opinion) is peripheral to the overall biography, as well as inadequately sourced and poorly written. I suspect the editor is a youngster trying his hand at editing on a favorite subject. My hope is that his enthusiasm deteriorates soon - or he greatly improves his style and content. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 22:55, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see. Tough situation - I had similar with The KLF. A new editor's contributions were way below par (we were working towards FAs and his edits were barely coherent), but I didn't want to appear to be trying to own the articles. He got tired of it in the end though so hopefully the same will happen here. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 23:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'll never have to worry about Badfinger becoming an FA!&#160;:) Anyway, you're correct. I don't want to appear possessive about the article, yet nearly all of these recent additions are painful. I couldn't find a single edit that I felt was worth improving, much less keeping. I'll give him a couple weeks to lose interest. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 17:04, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
