While gentrification deals with social class, <i>per se</i>-- the wealthier classes expel the poor from a given region-- goatsefication is class-neutral; it refers to the influx of unpleasant individuals-- known colloquially as <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">assholes</a>-- into a given region or occupational sector driven by a lust for money or power. As assholes are observed in all social classes, goatsefication cannot be blamed upon any single class of people; rather, it is a pervasive and powerful sociological force.</p>

<p>Goatsefication is feared but sometimes inevitable at high levels within <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporation.html" title="Corporation">corporations</a>. The massive downsizings of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>, as well as the hypercompetitive "striver" culture, have been attributed to a thorough goatsefication of the American corporate workplace.</p>
<p><big><b>Goatsefication in gender relations</b></big></p>
<p>It is often observed (see: nice guy syndrome) in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> that <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attraction.html" title="Attraction">attractive</a> <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women.html" title="Women">women</a> have a preponderance to date and be attracted to antisocial, deviant men, preferably of below-average intelligence. The rewarding of negative traits in the male gender has multiplied said ills (see: degradation by selection), and a goatsefication of massive swaths of the male sex is feared to be underway.</p>

<p>Hi my name is crystal. i would like to have my room made over because my room is never organized at all every thing is mainly like all over the place. I am in a couple of sports basketball, and softball as well and i enjoy them both. What can i say about my self i am mostly quiet unless i know you then i can be very out going and loud. I love to write poems. i would like to turn my room into a more grown up room. so there is not kiddy stuff any more, except for my care bears i can not live with out my care bears. And shane West i am a huge fan of his my dream in life is to meet him personaly. When i moved into the basement my parents made my room and all it is about is them and nothing to do about me at all. Yes i do have a boy friend we have been dating for a while now and we are vary happy with each other. i want to also make my room look a little more romantic as well. samantha, and crystal are like my two best friends . And i could never live with out my cat lucky she is like a person to me. i know i probably sound like a dork but you can ask any of my friends i need a new room just to chill and also my boy friend will agree with you also. And i will be a senior this year and after i graduate i am going to college and i am so exciting to be graduating.</p>
<p><br />
well i hope this helps you</p>
<p>sincerly yours,</p>
<p>crystal</p>

I Need help my room is like a torchure chamber!!! Dear Knock First,</p>
<p>My name is Jane Doe, and I'm 13. I live in Anywhere, PA. Right now i have to share my room with my older sister Jill when she comes home from college. We both kinda have our own likes and dislikes. And we like different music and things like that. We need help getting the room into our own "groove". I would really like a place i could hang out, do my homework, listen to music and when the time comes chill with my boyfriend. My room looks horrible... it hasnt been done since my mom and dad added it on to the house. Its an ugly color blue and the carpet is old and wore-out.I have had to share a room with one of my sisters all my life. I have a mix of things i like in there right now like hourses, stuffed animals, music, awards, and clothes. I'm into dancing, music {most kinds}, clothes/fashion. But my most favorite thing i like doing is dancing because its a way of expressing myself my own indavidual way. I try to go to all of our school dances. Most of the shows i watch are like MTV, VH1, Knock First, and Trading Spaces. My mom and dad dont have the time right now to do it or the money with my sister going to college. If there is anyway possible I would love it if you could come and redo my room. Its in need of some major make-over help. This would be like a dream come true if you could help me with my problem. P.S. please help me!!!</p>

<li>The reading public is entitled to know that not all of Mr.Kerry's injuries were of the same severity. What is the point of saying: Injured. Injured again. Injured for a third time. Where is the richness of detail in that account which allows a person to fully appreciate the sacrifices that our fighting men and women make for USA? Also, my comment should have been discussed more prior to the tag-team changes being made by Neutrality and Wolfman Rex071404 04:34, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Each of the wounds and treatment are described in exacting detail. I even know that Kerry's sore ass was treated to a warm soak. That's pretty rich detail in my view. Also, there is no "tag-team". I explained my edit carefully above. I am not in collusion with Neutrality or anyone else. Now, as you asked, I have politely waited for another response. I still disagree with you edit for the reasons carefully explained above.Wolfman 04:42, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<p><b>Hearties, Dikky</b> (1886-1932), Norwegian dancer, choreographer, and theatre actor. Born in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordkapp.html" title="Nordkapp">Nordkapp</a>, Northern Norway, Hearties began training as a dancer at the age of six and made his debut at the Theatre Royal in Estonia, in 1903. In 1906 he joined the dance company of Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova on its first tour of Austria and Luxembourg. In the early 1910s he went to Britain to further study Ballet. In 1913 he began dancing full time with the newly formed Sadler's Wells Ballet (now Royal Ballet), becoming its lead dancer only three years later. He made his acting debut on stage as Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare in 1917. In 1923 Hearties became the principal choreographer of the Royal Ballet.</p>
<p>Soon after, he started experiencing symptoms of what is now understood to be the early stages of bowel cancer yet managed to perform many highly acclaimed ballets he is associated with include Hamlet, Miracle in the Gorbals, Comus, and The Birds. In 1928 he became terminally disabled, no longer able to dance he returned to Norway and joined the Royal Norse Ballet to work as a choreographer. The following year he became its joint artistic director with Bare van Rolloffle. He left ballet in 1931 when the treatment he was receiving turned him senile, Hearties would go through phases where he believed himself to be an African, in August of 1932 he passed away in his sleep. Hearties received many national and international honours for his outstanding contribution to the world of ballet.</p>

<p>batman touched my junk liberally. he strapped me in to his batmobile and he couldnt keep his offensive hands off of me. he was performing many red flag touches. i couldnt believe what the fuck was going on. i told batman the city would not approve of a millionaire touching an underage kid for free.</p>
<p>can you believe it? batman did all this. he picked me off the street, strapped my arms and legs down in the batmobile's passenger seat, and just wouldn't stop fondling my cock'n'balls.</p>
<p>they definately were red flag touches. the goddamn referee he had in the back seat kept on raising up this red flag every time he touched my junk but did batman care? NO WAY! he just kept on doing it. I couldn't believe what the fuck was going on, indeed. I pleaded with batman but to no avail. I told him the city would not approve of such a wealthy man touching an underage kid like me (at the time I was 13) without at least compensating me for the trauma and the use of my body as his own personal plaything.</p>
<p>this got to him, worrying about his image. he continued to fondle me, all the while ignoring the referee's red flags. then he drove the batmobile to my house and ejected the seat i was in! it was amazing. but surprisingly, after I woke up the next morning, my bank account had $150k in it!!! Can you believe it?????????????????????????</p>

<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Fairy bread (or faerie breade(OE)) is white bread lightly spread with margarine or butter, and then sprinkled with hundreds and thousands (also known as sprinkles or fairies, consisting of small balls of coloured sugar).</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>Fairy bread is most commonly served at children's parties as a sweet yet more filling alternative to lollies. The earliest known historical reference to it was during the witch trials of the middle ages in Europe, where its production was considered to be a sign of 'charming'. Since then it has lost its stigma and since its introduction to the 'speak-easies' of the United States during prohibition in the 1920s has steadily increased in popularity.</p>
<p>International variations</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> fairy bread is found almost exclusively at children's parties. Slices of the bread are typically cut into triangles and stacked tastefully on the host's paper plate.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belize.html" title="Belize">Belize</a>, the consumption of fairy bread (or ferrille brae) is food eaten traditionally the day after the winter solstice, to encourage the fairies to bring spring with the warm Mediterranean winds.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, fairy bread is thought to be an aphrodisiac and is often given by the woman to the man as a sign of willingness to engage in sexual activity.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> there is a variation in the recipe, where instead of using sprinkles (fairies) the chefs use winkles (elves). These are green in colour and are beleived to bring good luck.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> fairy bread is outlawed due to its links to witchcraft.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> uses olive oil in place of margarine and coloured anchovies in place of fairies.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a>, believed to be one of the earliest consumers of fairy bread, historically erected temples to the Queen of Fairies, Jaap T'Hooftendenhaagenvandrooselveltbreadsprinkleendonut. Today, the complex rituals conducted in the 9th century AD have been reduced to a quick prayer before consumption. The Dutch also credit her with the creation of <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doughnuts.html" title="Doughnuts">doughnuts</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about fairy bread, ask your local fairies (found in your local supermarket).</p>
