<p>Redball is not only a game, but a way of life. Named after the ball that is used to play the game, its origins are mysterious and will be never fully known.</p>

<p>Not much is known about where the redball came from. It appeared one day in the Social Studies office of a Maryland high school. A teacher, leaning back in her chair, accidentially knocked it from a bookshelf onto the desk. Since no one knew how the ball had come to be on that bookself, it is believed by most that the ball was a gift from above and descended from the heavens.</p>

<p>Redball is played with a minium of 6 players. Only those special enough are allowed to partake in volley of Redball. These are the Social Studies teachers themselves and those few known as the F.O.S.S. (Friends of Social Studies). Only teachers can become a F.O.S.S. and is not open to students. The goal of the game is not beat an opposing player or team but to break the previous record of continous volleys (currently standing at 202). The redball is bounced around the room and a successfully passage from one player to another counts as one volley. The same two players can only have a total volley of five, before hitting to another player.</p>

<p>The game's only venue is that very same Social Studies office were the ball was found. It is known to most only as "The Arena." Many landmarks are in The Arena, those most notable are: in the middle, the "Blue Box"; and between two bookselves, the "Crack of Doom."</p>

<p>FHF or Fried Human Fucking is an attempt to break all the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_deadly_sins.html" title="Seven deadly sins">Seven deadly sins</a> at once. This ultimate sin includes killing a human being, frying them, and having sexual intercourse with them. The sins are broken in the follwing way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lust. Well you are fucking a human, so that one is taken care of.</li>
<li>Gluttony. You are eating the human while you are fucking them.</li>
<li>Greed. You obviosly cant eat the whole human, and you are not going to share him/her.</li>
<li>Sloth. There are several ways this can be considered as sloth. You are not doing what God wants you to do, or you had a servant do the killing and the frying of the human.</li>
<li>Wrath. You hate that particular human for no reason in particular.</li>
<li>Envy. You secretly want to be hated murderd fried and fucked yourself.</li>
<li>Pride. You are pretty proud of yourself for breaking all the other 6 sins at once.</li>

<p>Novemberween is a holiday to celebrate the indyness of modern society. Too many people these days, especially teenagers, are falling into a money-gulching state of mind where they feel they have to have only brand-label things. They want the $300 pair of Nike shoes rather than the $30 pair of other shoes, when they both would be just as good to wear. This holiday provides materialistic people a chance to just let go and not worry about what kind of clothes they're wearing, and much they cost.</p>
<p>Novemberween truely begins when the first snowflake falls. When this happens, faithful Novemberween followers will take a gutted-out <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pumpkin.html" title="Pumpkin">pumpkin</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>, Napoleon brandy and a <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighter.html" title="Lighter">lighter</a> to an out-of-the-way location whereupon they will fill the pumpkin with gas and light it on fire. Whilst drinking the brandy, one member of the group will proceed to kick the flaming pumpkin. This flaming pumpkin is a pre-warning to those who do not exchange gifts on Novemberween that they will be pelted with much the same pumpkin for neglecting to partake in the holiday's most honoured <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tradition.html" title="Tradition">tradition</a>.</p>
<p>Every 25th of November Archibald the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin.html" title="Penguin">Penguin</a> of Novemberween stirs from his igloo fortress on the Southpole and flies across the sky in his chariot pulled by four large flying <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orcas.html" title="Orcas">orcas</a>. As he flies overhead he shouts praises and happy fortunes on those who give each other homemade presents. Those that do not give presents are pelted with gasoline-filled pumpkins.</p>

<p>Novemberween begins on the first snowfall and lasts until the snow dissapears, but the actual day to celebrate this holiday is the 25th of November.</p>
<p>The mascot for this memoriable teenaged holiday is a mischivious penguin named Archibald who wears on his head a blue and silver party hat and a banner wrapped around his shoulder bearing the letter "N" in silver lettering. On this note, silver and grey are the official colours of Novemberween: blue signifying the sky, and grey signifying everything else (snow, clouds, ect.)</p>
<p>As with Thankgsgiving and Christmas, Novemberween has its own food staples. The most prominent food stuff is the BaconDuck - succulent duck with crispy bacon. Accompanying the BaconDuck is stuffing, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sushi.html" title="Sushi">sushi</a>, potatoes, baby corn, and many cans of cola.</p>
<p>Those participating in the festivities gather early in the day to help make the wonderful <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feast.html" title="Feast">feast</a>. Everyone brings something to put into the meal, be it salmon for sushi or bacon for the duck. Once the baking is done, partygoers indulge in <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_games.html" title="Video games">video games</a> and <a href="../../../d/%26/d/D%26D_ed3a.html" title="D&amp;D">D&amp;D</a>, take and/or take part in interesting <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pictures.html" title="Pictures">pictures</a>, and of course exchange homemade presents.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This isn't really a "project". This is one in a long series of collections of comments, articles and contributions which, yes, are inappropriate to the encyclopedia but which were <i>so</i> bad that people thought they were funny. Kind of like an outtakes reel for a movie. They were sliced out of the encyclopedia space (because they're not encyclopedic) but kept because they have some value for stress-relief. I personally don't find most of them to be funny (though a few are hilarious) but others clearly do. These pages may not help the encyclopedia but isolated as they are, they don't really hurt the encyclopedia either. Regardless, they should <b>not</b> be moved to meta.

<p>Warmal inwork is quantified by <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temperature.html" title="Temperature">warmature</a> (<i>e.g.,</i> the physical property of a system which underlies the common notions of "hot" and "cold"; material with the higher warmatures are said to be "<i>hot</i>"). <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat.html" title="Heat">Heat</a> (also <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_change.html" title="Heat change">heat change</a>) is the transfer of warmal inwork between two bodies which are at different warmatures.

<dd>After escaping to a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monastery</a> for a while, immersing himself in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_Chants_eb9a.html" title="Gregorian Chants">Gregorian Chants</a>, Sir Kevin fled to Norway where he joined <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leif_Ericcson_ea84.html" title="Leif Ericcson">Leif Ericcson</a> on his journey to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>.</dd>
<dd>After this adventure, it is said that he journeyed to Arabia and enjoyed the newly-discovered caffeine––medically, of course. He traveled back to Europe, however, in time to fight bravely in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hastings_16cc.html" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, where he is said to have met his end at the hands of a large group of warriors from the valley.</dd>
<dd>Sir Kevin, over time, became of a person of renown, not just because of his reputation as scholar and warrior, but also because of his skill as a wit. He once outmaneuvered a court jester; Sir Kevin, a philosophical creature, was speaking of human nature, and how we, as humans, desire everything. The jester told Sir Kevin that he did not desire <a href="../../../s/y/p/Syphilis.html" title="Syphilis">syphilis</a>, to which the cunning Sir Kevin responded, "ah, but you desire the means to get it."</dd>
<dd>After his death, tales were told of Sir Kevin's greatness, until they grew out of proportion. He was soon seen as a legendary figure, much like <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beowulf.html" title="Beowulf">Beowulf</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Arthur_40ce.html" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a>, and, like them, was thought to possess mystical powers. People began to think that he couldn't possibly be dead.</dd>
<dd>Nowadays, it's commonly thought that saying the word "like" inappropriately summons the wrath of Sir Kevin.</dd>

<p>The Whipping_of_the_Juggalos is one of the most forgotten wars in history. It was long ago, shortly after the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, the Pope claimed that he would discuss peace to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestants.html" title="Protestants">Protestants</a>. Thousands, maybe even millions of Protestants came, excited to hear this news. However, a Protestant leader named Lord Ackbar yelled "It's a trap!" and shortly afterwards, the Pope's army of trained Elites came out and attacked the Protestants, also known as Juggalos. After this event, an alliance of Protestant and non-Christian nations and groups formed an alliance. Under Sir John Michalotte's control, the alliance was out to kill the Catholics. The war ended a few years later, in a complete stalemate. If the war never occured, however, the Pope would surely have us in bondage <i>today</i>.</p>
<p>There is also a page about this "subject" at <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Whipping+of+the+Juggalos" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Whipping+of+the+Juggalos" rel="nofollow">Urban_Dictionary</a>. There is also a book by the title "Whipping of the Juggalos," which suggests that this article may or may not be a "joke" or "nonsense."</p>
<p>Who told you about the whipping of the Juggalos Did they tell you that the pope suceeded in his pursuit he found himself a nice little juggalo boy to have whipped privately Thus concluded the greatest war ever fought in the name of Pedophilia and perversion Hail the pope for he is almighty -Ethiopian</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/h/i/Ching_Shih_2bbc.html" title="Ching Shih">Ching Shih</a>, who is Chinese, was a naval general in the war. If it weren't for her innovative strategies, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> may not have been successful.</p>
<p>Sir John Michalotte, leader of the alliance agianst the Catholics, is said to be schizophrantic, and was known to talk to, worship, and obey the face of a dead person. These accuzations are probably true, or atleast misleading.</p>
<p>Pope W, the Pope at the time, executed the Protestants because he thought he was awesome.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._T_d006.html" title="Mr. T">Mr. T</a>, an ex-Archbishop, was super pissed that the Pope would do something like this. The Pope also betrayed Mr. T in the past.</p>
<p>The Magic Train was a black guy who did nothing but stir up trouble in the alliance.</p>
<p>Master Exon was a Madalion who was recovered from a Catholic jail cell during the war. (The book doesn't mention where he actually was before he entered the scene)</p>

<p>Battle of Rome</p>
<p>Ching Shih deployed ground forces lead by a man called "The Crossing" near Rome, and this battle erupted (actually, in the book, The Crossing never did this). The Catholics held off the Alliance for many days, when The Crossing revealed his secret plan. They would leave and attack neighboring cities. When the Catholics seperated their armies to attack the Alliance from behind, a hidden unit of the Alliance came out and sacked Rome.</p>
<p>Battle of London</p>
<p>Mr. T drove the <a href="../../../a/-/t/A-Team_2969.html" title="A-Team">A-Team</a> van all the way to London, stepped out, and brutally pummeled Queen Mary I (<a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Mary_5db1.html" title="Bloody Mary">Bloody Mary</a>). She was known as Bloody Mary not because she killed Protestants while trying to convert England back to Catholicism. She had been given that name from the Janitors who spent 6 years trying to clean the blood from over 6,000 square feet of walls, floors, and ceilings in a castle. Mr. T was later pitying the Janitors.</p>
<p>Battle of Darhan</p>
<p>Deep in the jungle of Mongolia, near the city of Darhan, Rastafarian Native camps were quickly under seige by a Catholic land unit. With the lucky help of a squad of comandos that arrived shortly before the battle, a few elite Rastafarian Natives escaped alive.</p>

<p>The sport of extreme dressing is very new and practised by only a few people in the South California region. Essentially an extreme dresser takes the everyday task of dressing and puts an extreme spin on it.</p>
<p>A foundation is in the process of starting and will probably be giving the following initials: "EDF". The founder of the sport, Mike St.James, is an avid skydiver and base jumper with over 100 jumps in the last three years.</p>
<p>The way in which the sport works is reasonably simple, and is not goverened by points per say, but style. The typical extreme dresser will dress in remote or unusual places, such as in the air having jumped out of a plane. It is not known if anyone has successfully dressed extremely whilst base jumping.</p>

<p>Potential harm can result from holding in flatus. Although flatulence is not <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisonous.html" title="Poisonous">poisonous</a>, attempting to hold it back can result in small explosions within the stomache and even spontanious human combustion. Discomfort may develop from the build-up of gas pressure. In theory, pathological distension of the bowel, leading to spontanious human combustion could result if a person holds in flatus. Several people in South Park Colorado were reported to have died as the result of holding back flatulence.</p>

<p><b>GENERAL INFO;</b> A kabungalee is a mythical animal made of a cross between a penguin and a bowl of jello. kabungalees have claws and mohawks, and wear grass skirts. They have no feet, but rather move by hopping around or soaring through the air.</p>
<p><b>NATURAL HABITAT;</b> kabungalees generally live in sparsely populated areas of new york, the cayman islands, hawaii, and cranston,RI. Though rarely seen, it is said that to catch one is a feet beyond all other, because of its sheer land and air speed.</p>
<p><b>COLORING;</b> Northern kabungalees are a light yellow hue, with a black outline and straight grass. The southern kabungalee is more of a golden color, and has wavy grass.</p>

<p>Mythical creature, such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicorn.html" title="Unicorn">unicorn</a> or <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunyip.html" title="Bunyip">bunyip</a>. In official U.S. parlance, usually mentioned by the government or state run television "<a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_journalism.html" title="Yellow journalism">journalists</a>", the capture or killing of this creature usually is seen as a milestone and turning point in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_terror.html" title="War on terror">war on terror</a> (see <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_elections.html" title="Iraqi elections">iraqi elections</a>).

In societies with a functional investigative journalism apparatus (sometimes known as <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracies.html" title="Democracies">democracies</a>), the idea of a repeatedly killed and captured "al Qaeda's #3 Man" would be ludicrous.

<p>Thuan is a common given name for Veitnamese males.</p>
<p>Thuan is also a phenomenon that exsists and is kept alive by loyal friends and Gamestop employees. As the story goes, there was once a man named Thuan who worked for Funcoland. A fellow employee likened his name to the sound of a rubber band snapping and resonating. He began to deface many hidden and/or out of the way surfaces around the store by writing "Thuan" on them. Others joined in and their graphitti became more brazen. Thuan's name ended up on walls and countertops throughout the store. As well as on registers, the bottom side of drawers, staplers, tape despensers, and other various surfaces on which pernament markers would draw.</p>
<p>Funcoland later was bought out by GameStop and the original store had changed it's sign to GameStop. However, many employees had stayed and the "Thuan revolution" hadn't lost any steam. As new employees were hired the phenomenon had grown, and so had the creativity of the perpetrators. "Thuaning" as it had become known, was often used to prank new managers in good clean fun. Such pranks include; removing the contents of a draw and replacing it with a large sign saying "THUAN", or using a stack of post-it notes to make a large "THUAN" on the glass cabinets behind the cashwrap counter.</p>
<p>Some employees had transfered to other GameStop stores and spread the Thuan phenomenon to those stores. Thuan was also written on many boxes of store-to-store shipments.</p>
<p>The "Thuan phenomenon" still thrives today. Three GameStop locations that have been "Thuaned" and confirmed. They are: Carle Place, NY; Lake Success, NY; and Merrick, NY.</p>
<p>If you wish to join the "Thuan Revolution" and perpetuate the "Thuan Phenomenon" go ahead and write "Thuan" somewhere in your store. Then contact <i>information deleted</i> with your store number or location.</p>

<p>Lord Namis appears in several differet historical texts. His origin is never the same nor are his powers and skills. What is remnent in all texts regarding Namis is that he was a being of great power and prestige. One quality that is constant throughout all legends surronding him is his inability to die through any means at all.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, Namis appears in many different myths and legends involving Gods, magic and war. He is mentioned or appears in the texts of the following myths and religions:</p>
<p>- Christianity - Kiaoism - Faerunian History - Chinese History and Myth</p>
<p>He is also mentioned in many organized crime histories and records as a main figure in the Chinese Mafia (The Triads). It is likely that he was a real person working with the Triad and the legends were based on this figure although it is impossible to say since he was never seen by anyone other than his victims and his closest followers.</p>

<p>Christian scriptures speak of a being aliged with neither Heaven nor Hell that was created by God as a perfected, flawless, superior version of himself. This being was known as Namis, the name spawning from the word Nemesis. The name Namis means "Superior enemy" or more appropriately under the curcumstance "Superior enemy of God" hence the Christian meaning of the word "Bane of the Lord".</p>
<p>Namis was said to be born before the war in heaven and as such played a part in the conflict. He was instrumental in the recruiting of over 36,000,000,000 angels to the side of Satan and almost single handedly won the war for the rebellious angel and would have if not for his lack of intrest in the war or for that matter in anything but himself. He had no disire to get any more involved in the conflict than he already was and after Satan's constant nagging Namis left the battlefield to live out the rest of eternity exploring the universe as an unseen entity.</p>
<p>In these texts he has the following powers: - Immortality - Invincibility - Time manipulation - Shape Shifting - The power to possess other beings - The power to become invisible - Instant teleportation - Weather control - Instant smite (can kill anything or anybody instantly) - The power to fly (presumably with wings)</p>

<p>In these scriptures Namis is given the last name Orion and is the evil parallel to the Kais (Gods) He is more powerful than all of them combined, while the Kais revealed themselves to the Universe straight away Namis chose to train himself in all fighting styles before he made his presence known. Once he was sure he was the most powerful being in the universe he surprisingly chose to just travel the universe and seek out the best fighters.</p>
<p>He was described in these rightings as, elegent, 6'1", brown hair, thin green and gold eyes, yellowish tanned skin and sporting many scars including one horizontal on his forehead, one horizontal on his belly, one diagonal across his chest and many smaller ones that were scattered.</p>
<p>In these texts he has the following powers: - Immortality - Invincibility - Time manipulation - Shape Shifting - Instant teleportation - The ability to use his ki (energy) as a weapon - The power to fly using ki (energy)</p>

<p>In these writings Namis was given his full name of Lord Namis Lucifer Orion. He started life as a mortal and his family was put to death by the Shoon Empire because Namis was born outside of wedlock. Namis (now 36) slue a potential God (Emperor Shoon himself) and ascended to Godhood. He became Greater God of perfection, racism, capitalism, vanity, temptation and disire. He is the most powerful of all the gods under the rank of over deity and is known to work closely with the only over deity Lord Ao.</p>
<p>He was described in these rightings in a very similar way to how he is in the Kiaoist texts as elegent, 6'1", brown hair, thin green and gold eyes, yellowish tanned skin and sporting many scars including one horizontal on his forehead, one horizontal on his belly, one diagonal across his chest and many smaller ones that were scattered. His clothing is also described. He dresses in gold plated adimantium samurai style full plate body armour strategically studded with the rarest of red diamonds and no head accessories. On his right ring finger he wears a giant gold ring of universal elemental immunity adorned with a large emerald. He carries his masterwork katana and gold plated adimatium large shield studded with the same priceless red diamonds. He also wears an ornate orange necklace blessed with holy power by the three most powerful monks (Master Kain, Master Kan and Master Po) of the cloud peak mountains and a full cape made from great wyrm prismatic dragon hide and lined with silk.</p>
<p>In these texts he has the following powers: - Immortality - Invincibility - Many magic spells - The power to create any item out of thin air - Shape Shifting - Instant teleportation</p>

<p>Namis was given a last name in this version of his existance, his name was "Lord Namis Sun". Namis was the most highly sortafter mercenary for hire during the "Three Kingdoms" period of Chinese history (184 A.D.-280 A.D.). Legend has it that Namis was born in 84 A.D. and was already 100 years old when the conflict began. Namis was hired mostly by Wei's ruler Cao Cao but after Cao Cao's death Namis was not employed by Wei again. His main employer now was Wu and with Namis's help Wu survived longer than the other three Kingdoms but was destroyed almost instantly when Namis "defected" to the Jin empire. Legend has it that Namis only had four soldiers in his entire army but single handedly won battles and routed vast armies. After this period Namis took his army and left China never to be seen again.</p>
<p>Namis had been to Japan and was in possession of a samurai sword and samurai armor which he was always seen with in battle. Namis was involved in every major battle during this period and often played a major role in the victory of Wei, Wu, or Jin. He was also credited with defeating the legendary warrior Lu Bu at the battle of Hu Lao Gate while under contract from Wei.</p>
<p>He is described as a giant (probobly just big for a China man of that century) with long grey hair and eyes of pure white all dressed in gold.</p>
<p>This is the most probable of all the texts in which he appears to be the true story of Namis. He was most likely a great warrior of an old age with a smallish army and an average height for a westen male of the 20th century. He seems to have no real powers, he was just a great fighter who lived a long life but if you were to go on the pretence of the myth you would say he had the power of immortality.</p>

<p>Namis is almost always linked to a Chinese woman named Chun-Liu. She was a great fighter as well and is usually killed in battle by another woman in all texts in which she appears. In the Faerunian story she is killed in one on one combat by Emperor Shoon's wife in Namis's last duel as a mortal. In the Chinese story she is a member of his army and is killed in battle by an unnamed female Wu warrior. She does not appear in the Christian story and is not killed in the Kiaoist version.</p>

Mike, Hubert, Ted, Kevin and Matthew were all sitting around a Hubert's house playing <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldeneye.html" title="Goldeneye">Goldeneye</a>, Mike made a humiliating kill, so he yelled out 'humiliation' to ensure that he got respect for the kill. Everyone present, however, heard 'humiliAzn' instead. The three asians present garnered themselves nicknames with <a href="../../../a/z/n/Azn.html" title="Azn">Azn</a> as a component - Hubert became Humiliazn, Ted became Azn SensAzn and Kevin, being half Polish, became Half Azn-Half AmAzn and Matthew, being fully white, became a guest star.</p>
<p>Thus, Team 3 was born.</p>
<p>Following this formation, Team 3 became a regognisable force on Asian Avenue, and with thier definitions on <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dictionary_cc65.html" title="Urban Dictionary">Urban Dictionary</a>, Team 3 gained limited popularity.</p>
<p>Eventually, Team 3 became associated with infamous asianavenue member and <a href="../../../b/m/x/BMX_aa44.html" title="BMX">BMX</a> genius Kinnard, another student at <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Mills_Collegiate_Institute_6d98.html" title="Don Mills Collegiate Institute">Don Mills Collegiate Institute</a> whose Asian Avenue Account name was Roka_Chan.</p>

<p>Team 3 not only represents the 3 main members. It also represents their interests.

<p>This is Ian's last statement from his site: 17th Oct. '05 8/Flint To all my fellow passengers on planet <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">earth</a>, THANK YOU…I'm laying here thinking about whether I'm going to continue my life. I feel very relaxed, calm and as though I've accomplished a lot for a life time. I am feeling very sleepy I don't know if I fall asleep if I will wake up again… so I want to get this said… Actually, I don't have a whole lot more to say other than, THANK YOU… and to let you know that if I do pass I'll be joining with the legions of Light ~ Workers, who are to assist everyone else through these changes from the "Otherside." Being as I've not been on the "Otherside" this time around, we will have to see how this works out. I will be attempting to stay in contact with Madaline, so that she can keep you up to date. Whether this is the end of my life or not I have a request that each of you pick up what information I have brought concerning the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayan_calendar.html" title="Mayan calendar">Mayan calendar</a> and with renewed <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigor.html" title="Vigor">vigor</a> pass this information to as many people as possible. It is my personal belief that we each have a <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred.html" title="Sacred">sacred</a> duty to find what works in the world in what ever arena we are familiar and then pass that <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a> as straight as we can for the benefit of others. This is basically what I have done with Dr. Carl J. Calleman's work and if I'm granted the time what I will continue to do for as long as I can from here too.</p>

<p>This is the last journal update from his website: November 16, 05 12 - Star (Lamat) At 2:35 AM, Ian Xel Lungold passed from his physical body into the waiting hands of God. I held him to my chest while he took his last slow, comforting breaths. His work will continue on, with the love that he's spread through the world. I'm honored to have been by his side, to love and comfort him through his transformation. I love you Ian and everyone you've touched loves you. Matty ~ Ian</p>

<p>Famous Patient Syndrome is where a doctor or surgeon are afraid to act quickly or instinctivly when confronted with a famous patient. Due to the patient's celebrity status, the doctor will be scared to do anything, knowing that if anything goes wrong, he will face grave retribution.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Cyde</dt>
<dd>So, if you see more than one Bigfoot at once, would you be seeing a pack of Bigfeet? Or would you be seeing a pack of Bigfoots? Also, what is the proper plural collective name for a pack of Bigfeet? I.e. a gaggle of geese, a pod of dolphins, etc. What is the estimated population size of Bigfeet? Are we talking about only a few hundred, making them an endangered species, or are there a lot more of them out there? I am absolutely shocked that they have not been put on the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endangered_Species_List_87ae.html" title="Endangered Species List">Endangered Species List</a>. If we don't act quickly we are going to destroy all of their habitat with housing developments and they will, unfortunately, go extinct.</dd>

<dd>If the people shooting at them don't kill them all. I've wondered about the plural as well. And have there ever been any baby Bigfoot sightings?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>It occurs to me that a baby Bigfoot should be called a Littlefoot and if you are ever lucky enough to run across a creche of Bigfoot babies, you should exclaim, "Greetings, Littlefeet!"</dd>

<p>Many photograph specialists have over the years debated who is actually depited in this picture, taken by one Won Fazio Drilo. Drilo died just days after posting this photograph in his Flickr account.</p>
<p>Scientists currently have two possible candidates for the man, Colombian rap singer and bread-eater <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakira.html" title="Shakira">Shakira</a> or famous poet <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_4636.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>.

<p>Dr. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Chesney_f38a.html" title="Kenny Chesney">Kenny Chesney</a> argues that Poe is the most probable candidate. "Everything fits," he declared in an interview with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> in the famous news program <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a>. "It is Edgar Allan Poe being carried by British businessmen to the Rio Marga-marga. A Swedish businessman holds an umbrella in the manner of servants who once shielded poets from the sun."</p>
<p>However, Dr. <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Keys_d525.html" title="Alicia Keys">Alicia Keys</a> disagrees with Chesney. "Nothing to see," she declared in an article entitled <i>The Photograph Controversy</i> which appeared on the prestigious newspaper <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Onion_8d8e.html" title="The Onion">The Onion</a></i>.

<p><b>Golden Rock's</b> is a Bosnian rock band, officially formed in 2005 in Gracanica. Our highly retro style of music seems to be influenced by 1970s rock bands like Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Rainbow, AC/DC, Whitesnake, Queen, T. Rex and Led Zeppelin, and 1980s rock bands such as Van Halen. Lead singer Jasmin Imamovic' soaring falsetto makes them immediately distinguishable from other present-day rock bands.</p>

<p>Dave Gillespie is known by those close to him as more than just a hat and Civil War fanatic. "He is a sixty-year-old man trapped in the body of a sixteen-year-old," says lifelong friend Bill Decker.</p>
<p>Dave's hobbies include sweaters, reinacting the Civil War as seventy-three year old Union Lt. Zachary Pope, and saving the world, specifically Africa. "The Civil War is a fascination whereas Africa is an obsession," says arch-adversary Ben Andres.</p>
<p>Dave's fascination with history goes beyond the narrow confines of the Civil War (though not by much)--he insists on answering the phone with the salutation "Ahoy-hoy," the greeting he insists would have been the favorite of Alexander Grahm Bell.</p>
<p>Dave is a drummer at Trinity High School where "he gives it his best shot," says Bill Decker. He is in the marching, concert, jazz, and newly formed steel drum band, most of which are conducted by the immortal Gary Ulysses Bricker (GUB, yes his initials are gub)</p>
<p>Dave wears sweaters. Always.</p>
<p>People like Dave. He's a "jolly good man" stipulates Jon Lorenz, all that is man, who recently ate a rabbit.</p>

<p>Wechina is an awesome (omg censorship). He pwns you beyond belief. He has awesome friends, awesome genitals, and an awesome chick. Hes so awesome that if you were to try to even touch him he'd have a magnum so far up your nose you'd experience cerebral palsy and crabs for 5 minutes and then it would be gone. He could take a hairpin, three yo-yos, and seven apples and create a lazer beam that can blast a guy and turn him into a lady. A hot one at that. But where does this overwhelming awesomeness come from?</p>

<p>Your name starts with a C. It also contains eight consonants and 3 vowels.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris is 1/8th Cherokee. This has nothing to do with ancestry, the man ate a frickin Indian.</p>
<p><br />
Chuck Norris uses ribbed condoms inside out, so he gets the pleasure.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris' tears cure cancer. Too bad he has never cried.</p>
<p>When Chuck Norris has sex with a man, it is not because he is gay, but because he has run out of women.</p>
<p>Macgyver can build an airplane out of gum and paper clips, but Chuck Norris can kill him and take it.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris once roundhouse kicked someone so hard that his foot broke the speed of light, went back in time, and killed Amelia Earhart while she was flying over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris doesn't read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.</p>
<p>If you ask Chuck Norris what time it is, he always says, "Two seconds till." After you ask, "Two seconds to what?" he roundhouse kicks you in the face.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris only masturbates to pictures of Chuck Norris.</p>
<p>Rather than being birthed like a normal child, Chuck Norris instead decided to punch his way out of his mother's womb. Shortly thereafter he grew a beard.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris appeared in the "Street Fighter II" video game, but was removed by Beta Testers because every button caused him to do a roundhouse kick. When asked bout this "glitch," Norris replied, "That's no glitch."</p>
<p>Chuck Norris lost his virginity before his dad did.</p>
<p>Since 1940, the year Chuck Norris was born, roundhouse kick related deaths have increased 13,000 percent.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris sold his soul to the devil for his rugged good looks and unparalleled martial arts ability. Shortly after the transaction was finalized, Chuck roundhouse kicked the devil in the face and took his soul back. The devil, who appreciates irony, couldn't stay mad and admitted he should have seen it coming. They now play poker every second Wednesday of the month.</p>
<p>Filming on location for Walker: Texas Ranger, Chuck Norris brought a stillborn baby lamb back to life by giving it a prolonged beard rub. Shortly after the farm animal sprang back to life and a crowd had gathered, Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked the animal, breaking its neck, to remind the crew once more that Chuck giveth, and the good Chuck, he taketh away.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris's girlfriend once asked him how much wood a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood. He then shouted, "HOW DARE YOU RHYME IN THE PRESENCE OF CHUCK NORRIS!" and ripped out her throat. Holding his girlfriend's bloody throat in his hand he bellowed, "Don't fuck with Chuck!" Two years and five months later he realized the irony of this statement and laughed so hard that anyone within a hundred mile radius of the blast went deaf.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris built a time machine and went back in time to stop the JFK assassination. As Oswald shot, Chuck met all three bullets with his beard, deflecting them. JFK's head exploded out of sheer amazement.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris is not hung like a horse... horses are hung like Chuck Norris Chuck Norris was the fourth Wiseman. He brought baby Jesus the gift of "beard". Jesus wore it proudly to his dying day. The other Wisemen, jealous of Jesus' obvious gift favoritism, used their combined influence to have Chuck omitted from the Bible. Shortly after all three died of roundhouse kick related deaths.</p>
<p>To prove it isn't that big of a deal to beat cancer. Chuck Norris smoked 15 cartons of cigarettes a day for 2 years and aquired 7 different kinds of cancer only to rid them from his body by flexing for 30 minutes. Beat that, Lance Armstrong.</p>
<p>There are no disabled people. Only people who have met Chuck Norris.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris does not have AIDS but he gives it to people anyway.</p>
<p>There is no chin behind Chuck Norris' beard. There is only another fist.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris once lined up to kick the winning field goal of a high school football game. When the football went flat, he persuaded the referees to let him kick the field goal with a 3 month old child. Chuck roundhoused kicked the baby 60 yards through the uprights and then proceeded to bang every girl in the stadium.</p>
<p>The original theme song to the Transformers was actually "Chuck Norris--more than meets the eye, Chuck Norris--robot in disguise," and starred Chuck Norris as a Texas Ranger who defended the earth from drug-dealing Decepticons and could turn into a pick-up. This was far too much awesome for a single show, however, so it was divided.</p>
<p>The chief export of Chuck Norris is pain.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris is currently suing NBC, claiming Law and Order are trademarked names for his left and right legs.</p>
<p>When Chuck Norris plays Oregon Trail his family does not die from cholera or dysentery, but rather roundhouse kicks to the face. He also requires no wagon, since he carries the oxen, axels, and buffalo meat on his back. He always makes it to Oregon before you.</p>
<p>It was once believed that Chuck Norris actually lost a fight to a pirate, but that is a lie, created by Chuck Norris himself to lure more pirates to him. Pirates never were very smart.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris recently had the idea to sell his urine as a canned beverage. We know this beverage as Red Bull.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris used live ammunition during all shoot-outs. When a director once said he couldn't, he replied, "Of course I can, I'm Chuck Norris," and roundhouse kicked him in the face.</p>
<p>If paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper, what beats all 3 at the same time? Answer: Chuck Norris.</p>
<p>If you can see Chuck Norris, he can see you. If you can't see Chuck Norris, you may be only seconds away from death.</p>

<p>Later sources, however state that these spiders do exist and do not only eat camels, but whales. They dig into the sand and find their way into the the ocean, where they attach to the whale's head and, using a paralyzing injection, start eating their brains. Only two human casualties are known of this spider, but their heads looked like they exploded from inside out which leads us to believe they lay eggs inside their victims' heads. The spiders live in a colony, led by a queen spider who is approxaimately 8 inches tall and lays around 10.000 eggs a day.</p>
<p>Renowned world traveler Vincent has encountered these animals in the Mojavkawa desert. He claims they are very aggresive and if he wasn't armed with two machine pistols, he would have never got out of there alive.</p>

<p>Karl vs Charles is the story of the fued that ignites between two friends, when one (Karl) finds out that his good friend Charles has somehow made it to the quarter mark of life (age 25) without having experienced the seemingly universal male "tragedy" of being kicked in the balls. Having made this discovery, Karl sets out to ensure that Charles does not make it through his life without tasting this great pain and in this way completing his journey into manhood.</p>
<p>Karl himself grew up as one of three brothers and currently participates in martial arts submission competitions. He is a Ninja. So understandably, he has recieved several such wounding blows himself over the years. This explains his excited outrage at Charles abhorrent lack of experience.</p>
<p>Charles on the other hand is an intellectual to the point of oblivion. At least, that is the running joke amongst his circle of friends, who reguarly poke fun at his love for Lasers and his affectionate devotion for guitarist Joe Satriani. He is considered by many to be an evil Mad Scientists in the making.</p>
<p>This all cumulates into an epic battle between two archetype personas manifest in their north american suburban setting. In essence, it is the conflict between a hispanic "ninja" vs. a "mad white scientist" that makes Karl vs Charles the compelling drama that it is.</p>
<p>There are also rumors that Karl vs Charles is soon to be translated for the big screen, but nothing has been confirmed at this point. <a name="From_Category:Wikipedia:Suspected_sockpuppets_of_Willy_on_Wheels" id="From_Category:Wikipedia:Suspected_sockpuppets_of_Willy_on_Wheels"></a></p>
