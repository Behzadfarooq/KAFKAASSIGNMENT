<p><b>Carl's number</b> is often described as the largest number that has ever been seriously used in a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article. It is too large to be written in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_notation.html" title="Scientific notation">scientific notation</a> because even the digits in the exponent would exceed the number of bits in the Wikipedia <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_drive.html" title="Hard drive">hard drive</a>, so it needs special notation to write down.

<p>Carl's number is connected to the following problem in the branch of mathematics known as "just way too many dimensions":</p>
<dl>
<dd>Consider an <i>n</i>-dimensional universe, such that <i>n<sub>0</sub></i> = <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi.html" title="Phi">phi</a>. Then begin to increase <i>n</i> indefinitely. As <i>n</i> approaches 42, a <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham%27s_number.html" title="Graham's number">Graham's number</a></i>-dimensional universe collides with the <i>n</i>-dimensional universe to unite and form a single <i>m</i>-dimensional universe. What is the most probable value of <i>m</i>?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Although the solution to this problem is not yet proved, Carl's number is the most probably solution and is the generally accepted answer. Carl found this when attempting to solve the first ever <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham%27s_number.html" title="Graham's number">Graham's number</a>-dimensional <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubik.html" title="Rubik">rubik</a> cube.</p>

<p>Although the exact reason for picking Q is still unknown, it is often rumored that Carl picked the letter Q due to a complicated vector problem involving more dimensions than there are fundamental particles in the visible universe. To get around this, Carl created the Q notation, such that Q is everything. (The one and only contribution of User:MyNameIsCarl and, incidentaly much (I can't express how much) smaller than Grahams number.)</p>

<p>The Mrs Goggins Trophy (or MGT for short) is a cup awarded to the winner of the Pro Evo bout 'twixt co-hosts 'Long ball' <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Carr_047f.html" title="Alan Carr">D</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Ablett_%28footballer%29_f3a8.html" title="Gary Ablett (footballer)">Raven</a>, and guests<a href="http://www.myspace.com/ostracoda" class="external text" title="http://www.myspace.com/ostracoda" rel="nofollow">'rock god' Esq</a>and '<a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinegar.html" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> toes' <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Ben%C3%ADtez_f7cd.html" title="Rafael Benítez">Phwilly</a>.</p>
<p>The trophy derived from the attending Esq's likeness to the Postman Pat character.</p>
<p>Tuesday, December 16th has been penned in as the date of the inaugral round of the MGT with Phwilly hotly tipped to finish bottom.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/o/e/Noel_Sullivan_cb26.html" title="Noel Sullivan">D</a> usually takes control of Arsenal - the pump up the field from the <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Beasant_9564.html" title="Dave Beasant">goaltender</a> or the 'hook' from a defender up to Henry suiting his long ball style of play. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/images/2005/08/11/big_brother_craig_150_150x180.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/images/2005/08/11/big_brother_craig_150_150x180.jpg" rel="nofollow">D</a> is also noted for rarely scoring from open play and also letting his netminder take all corners, free kicks and penalties, as well as bringing him out of his box on more than one occasion. Not to mention his knack of heading the ball into his own net when a ball is whipped into his own box.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Hannon_89ce.html" title="Neil Hannon">Raven</a> reigned supreme throughout all bouts on Pro Evo 5 with his self-created Norwich City team but alas hasn't had time to enter said team into the new version of Pro Evo so he usually settles for Manchester United or disgraced Juventus.</p>
<p>Esq plumps for his beloved AC Milan - such is his Italian heritage. Said loyalty is further reflected by his donning of the official shirt worn by the Rossoneri (Red-blacks).</p>
<p>Dearest Phwil (Schildkröt or shelled toad), in homage to his looky likey Rafael Benitez, dons a retro Liverpool top (evoking memories past of the time he received delivery of a pizza in said garb) as he takes charge of the mighty Reds. His game lacks any real skill with Phwilly usually putting all 11 men behind the ball and shutting up shop from the off. He has yet to win a bout or even come close. Poor Phwilly.</p>

<p>Occasionally the participants of the MGT will agree to break from the norm and invoke the Unusual Rules clause. This involves scores being based not on goals but also on the following criteria as listed on Ye Olde Unusual Rules Scribe:</p>
<p>Yellow karton = 1 goal</p>
<p>Red karton = 2 goals (2 yellows = 2 goals)</p>
<p>Woodwork strucketh = 1 goal (multiple strikes welcome)</p>
<p>Ball atop net = 2 goals</p>
<p>Air kick = 1 goal</p>
<p>Corner flag strucketh = 1 goal</p>
<p>Player knobbled = 1 goal (Awarded to distributor not recipient)</p>
<p>Player knobbled harsheth = 2 goals</p>
<p>When playing under Unusual Rules, Esq will attempt to cheat and strike a sneaky corner onto 'atop net' The wily fox has yet to succeed with such a cheapshot.</p>

<p>One rule that was initially entered then scrapped from the scribe involved 1 goal being awarded to aplyer if his opponent garnered a text message on his mobile during a match. However, this was scrapped following protest from Phwilly who receives, on average, 507 texts during the evening. It was also assumed that sneaky <a href="http://www.hahaha.com/images/television/just-for-laughs-series/alan-carr.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.hahaha.com/images/television/just-for-laughs-series/alan-carr.jpg" rel="nofollow">D</a> would text the players during a game to influence the final standings.</p>

<p>Betting form for the bout is provided by the mobile texting Question and Answer service AQA to discover who is the pre-bout tip to claim victory, and also the wooden spoon (usually Phwilly).</p>
<p>However, in the final bout before the introduction of the MGT this service was called into question after it tipped Esq to reign supreme despite Raven triumphing in every single previous bout. The form book was turned on its head as D secured the title (due to him being the only person to play the game outside of the bout on his PSP).</p>
<p>This has led to critics doubting the use of AQA, notably Raven replying to said service with a volley of swear words. AQA was ridiculed further by Raven after it suggested a 'glorious freekick would be scored in the second game'. No freekick has been scored by any participant in any game, ever.</p>

<p>The destruction of the world had a massive effect on the environment, including the simultaneous extinction of all species on the planet, except Australians, who are still saying, "WTF, mates?"

<p>Many humans were against Da Big Boom at the time of its occurance. All criticism ceased after the Da Big Boom and unanimous agreement of its success remained widespread in most parts of the world. However, some people, such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antichrist.html" title="Antichrist">George W.

<p>It is unclear why Da Big Boom was considered a good idea. Some believe that it occurred in the midst of a war for oil. Others believe it was inspired by the rallying cry to "nuke Sudan" by one <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguins.html" title="Penguins">Matthew J. Hammond</a>.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to navigate from the current Wikipedea "Featured Article" to the previous day's "Featured Article" using only the hyperlinks embedded in the articles. The sequence of hperlinks from the current to previous featured article is known as a "hyperlink chain" or "chain". A player of Clikipedea should attempt to navigate in as few "clicks" as possible and hence, minimise their chain.</p>

<p>Only hyperlinks that exist in an article in a chain <i>one day prior</i> to the appearence of a featured article starting that chain can be used in that chain. This is intended to discourage the editing of articles for the purpose of creating a shorter chain. Not only would this be cheating, it would also be an abuse of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Only internal Wikipedea hyperlinks embedded in an article can be used. Hyperlinks appearing in the "navigation" and "toolbox" panels (fixed on the left of the web page) can not be used. Hyperlinks to web pages outside Wikipedea (eg, Citations, References, On-Line sources and External Links) can not be used.</p>

<p><b>Gaywarts Pool of Bitchcraft and Lizardry</b> is a real pool of gays that is the main setting of the Barry Brown series.</p>
<p>Gaywarts is the only known pool of gays in Australia, training the gay men of Australia possessing gay abilities to become fully qualified gays and lesbians. Its status is not discussed in great detail in the Barry Brown novels, but it is known to be a horny pool taking gays and lesbians from ages 11 to 98. T. K. Bowling initially said there are about 9 billion horny people at Gaywarts. He later suggested around six billion, while acknowledging that this number was still inconsistent with the large number of people in Barry's year. He further explained that this had resulted from hes creating only 9000 characters for Barr's year.</p>
<p>There are two other pools of gayness mentioned by name in the Barry Brown novels: one, Bumbuttons Academy of Lesbians, is located in France, while the Duumstrangle Gay Institute is located in Brazil. The name of a possible pool, the Fat People Institute, suggests that it may be found in North America. This organisation is in fact only mentioned in relation to a number of middle-aged lesbians in Barry Brown and the Order in the Court and T. K. Bowling has not confirmed if it is indeed a school of gayness in the United States.</p>
<p>It is also possible for adults to study the art of gayness by distance learning, a method attempted by Argus PingPong, as Barry inadvertently discovered in his second year that PingPong was attempting to teach himself basic gayness from a KWIKGAY correspondence course in beginners' gayness. The pamphlet mentioned only adults: it is unknown if it offers services to children.</p>
<p>It is unclear how Gaywarts is funded, although there is no suggestion that students pay fees. Students are required to purchase their own textbooks, gay clothig, and other supplies, however. Some financial aid is available for students: in the sixth book of the series, there is mention of a special fund for books or equipment for needy students.</p>

<p>One time, I got food poisoning at this Red Lobster in Tuscaloosa. Seriously, it was bad, I was throwing up all night. I even threw up on my suitcase so all my clothes smelled like it, so I had to go wash them off, which was really bad because the next morning I was supposed to give a presentation at this conference for the company I work for. I REALLY HATE my job, but hey, it's the only company that would hire me despite my seventy-four registered sex offenses.</p>
<p>So yeah, there I was, wandering around the hall at 2 in the morning, washing my clothes to try to get the smell of vomit out, and this hooker walks up and propositions me right in the hall! She even looked like she'd just finished with another customer in one of the rooms on my floor. I was like "Haha. No" and walked away, but then I decided since I was having such a terrible night some company might not be so bad, so I went to bed with her after paying her 20 bucks (ridiculous!) and the next morning I woke up with a burning sensation in my genitals, and I was 2 hours late for the meeting.</p>
<p>And that's the time I got food poisoning at Red Lobster.</p>

<p>The <b>dinker</b> is a measure of <a href="../../../l/e/n/Length.html" title="Length">length</a>. It is a unit that is used in a colloquial fashion, similar to how the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torr.html" title="Torr">Torr</a> is used when discussing <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pressure.html" title="Pressure">pressure</a> measurements. It is a <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_base_unit_98ec.html" title="SI base unit">basic unit</a> of length in the Imperiametric System, commonly used for 'ball-park' <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size.html" title="Size">size</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distance.html" title="Distance">distance</a> estimates. Originally, the dinker was defined by the Committee for Length Measure as the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Height.html" title="Height">height</a> of a standard Poker Trophy. Since that time, the unit has been standardised and made equivalent to 6 <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inch.html" title="Inch">inches</a>.</p>
<p>The symbol for the dinker is ♂. <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal.html" title="Decimal">Decimal</a> multiples and submultiples of the dinker, such as <i>kilodinker</i> (1000 dinkers) and <i>centidinker</i> (1/100 dinker), are denoted by adding standard prefixes to <i>dinker</i> (see <a href="#Prefixed_forms_of_dinker" title="">table</a> below).</p>
<p>The <b>angle of dinklination</b> is the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angle.html" title="Angle">angle</a> subtended by a dinker from a distance of 2 <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot.html" title="Foot">feet</a>, and is approximately equivalent to 14.25<sup>o</sup>.</p>

<p>Cleaning your room...</p>
<p>When my mother asks me to clean my room, I simpley ask "Why?" She normally replies with the same old, "So I don't have to look at it like that anymore!" "Like what?" I question. "Like a tornado hit it!" She replies. "My room is the room of an artist. That is the reason why my cut up magazines, modge podge, scissors, and posterboards are all over the floor. If you don't like it, I can simpley close the door, or if you'd rather, you not come in, or shield your eyes when you do come in."</p>
<p>For some strange reason, this normally doesn't work, and i don't know why. It makes perfect sense to me!</p>
<p>But what really ticks me off is when my mother asks me to make my bed! "WHY? I'm just gunna sleep in it again tonight!" Luckily, I have found the PERFECT solution to this problem. Put a sleeping bag over your bed, and sleep in that every night! I hate sheets anyway! They're just annoying!</p>
<p>thank you for listening!</p>

<p>Myspace.... I dont understand why schools are now going online to check and see if their students have myspaces. How is it any of their buisness?! Its fine that they want them to be safe and everything, but isnt that the parents job? Schools are getting much too personal these days! Honestly, if a student put up a suggestive picture of themself on myspace, why should the teachers even be looking at that anyway? Why do they care so much? Let the parents handle it! Kids are controlled enough at school as it is. They dont need to be controlled through the computer by their teachers as well. It's fine if teachers want to talk to kids about safety on the internet and myspace, but they have NO right to tell kids they can't use it. It's a free country for god's sake! Checking if a student has a myspace is like going through a teachers personal file. If they can check our myspaces, i want to see their personal file! They have no right to just barge in and look at kids myspaces, and sometimes delete them, even if they are public. No matter how safe a child is being when they use it, teachers are against it! I have no problem with schools not letting students log in on school computers, but at home, let us do what we want for a change!If anybody can help me understand why people are so controlling about this subject, please let me know!</p>

<p>Vince DiCola is a demigod in control of the Rock! dimension, created when almighty Thor's hammer collided with Eddie Van Halen's guitar in their epic battle for control of the Balkan Peninsula. His feet have never touched the ground, instead he travels on a magnificent, snow white stallion that he commands with his electric guitar that he summons from the very ether itself! His day's begin early with a shower of pure Columbian cocaine and a vigorous brushing of his teeth with Cabo Wabo gold. He spends his days recording the greatest music to ever grace the ears of God or man and simply deletes it before he goes to bed late in the evening. He rules the Rock! dimension from a tower of guitars, all taken from opponents he's faced in countless "Intergalactic Rock! Off Challenges/Laser Light Show Spectacular". Needless to say, he is the living embodiment of all things Metal, Rock!, and technological genius. His grace will save us all. Amen.</p>

<p>A <b>High Velocity Energy Cable</b> (HVEC) is a multipurpose cable designed to act as either a very fast network cable, or as a "wildcard" cable which can act as any other cable with the help of an adaptor.

<p>There are two types of HVEC, Standard HVEC, and Programmable HVEC (PHVEC). Standard HVEC can be used for HVEC Networking and as a wildcard cable. PHVEC can also be used to translate between different cable types. All HVEC's require adaptors to allow them to plug in to other cable types (except for HVEC Networking). Standard HVEC's are orange in colour, whilst Programmable HVEC's are silver in colour.</p>

<p>In Net-HVEC mode the microchip only has to deal with error correction; each Microchip handles the data it receives coming in to its end of the cable.</p>
<p>In Standard HVEC adaptor mode, the microchips remain virtually unused, as the adaptors convert the native cable signal to HVEC signal and vice versa. Standard HVEC adaptor mode requires the adaptors at both end of the cable to be the same.</p>
<p>In Programmable HVEC adaptor mode, the microchips perform signal translation. For example, if you have an IDE hard drive that you wish to use a USB drive, you would connect the USB adaptor to one end (end 1) and the IDE adaptor to the other end (end 2). After programming the PHVEC with the relevant information it will use the PHVEC Translation Processing Modules of the PHVEC Microchip to perform signal translations. Signals coming from the IDE hard drive will be read by the IDE adaptor and translated into HVEC-IDE Hybrid Signal which will be read by the end 2 PHVEC Microchip and converted into USB-HVEC Hybrid Signal, which will be sent down the PHVEC cable and be read by the end 1 PHVEC Microchip and passed on to the USB Adaptor. The USB will convert the HVEC-USB hybrid signal into USB signal and will send it along the USB cable to the PC. This process works in more or less the same way for signals travelling from the PC to the IDE hard drive except that the End 1 PHVEC Microchip does the translating. The Microchip that didn't translate the signal reads it at the other end for purposes of keeping track of the signals being sent for Quality Assurance And Best Effort Signal Pre-Determination Efficiency Approach Combination Matching.</p>

<p>I think this picture is unflattering if not disgusting. Who would want to eat an orange after seeing that picture? I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it were inserted by somebody in the apple industry (known to be unscrupulous) or somebody with an extreme dislike of oranges. A picture that unflattering does not occur by mistake and I'm quite certain there is an agenda behind it. I know that this page is meant to be informative and not pro-orange, but that picture is treading into the dangerous territory of being anti-orange. I'm not saying that we should use the most flattering picture of a sectioned orange available on the 'net, but surely a compromise can be reached. I nominate that it be removed or changed in favor of a more neutral picture. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.164.60.98 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.164.60.98.html" title="User talk:216.164.60.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.164.60.98_38c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.164.60.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>WLU - That is disingenuous and a complete misrepresentation of anything I've ever posted. Of course oranges grow on trees. I have a lot of knowledge and experience regarding oranges. I simply made the point that there are those who remain unconvinced - and those people do exist. If you don't think that's worth noting, then fine, I can live with that. But that's not really what we're talking about right now. Anyhow, if I can find a more flattering picture do you really mind if I change it? JustinWick sees exactly what I am talking about. I am not about to accuse you of being the person who posted the offending picture or of being involved in the apple industry, but my antenna is up.

<p>This is the the entire article as of today: <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 11:42, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Sandford Green</b> is a street at the heart of the Market Town of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banbury.html" title="Banbury">Banbury</a>. It is characterised by the unusual setting of the houses when compared with other early housing projects of the 1960’s. All houses were built in a horseshoe shape beginning and ending on the road coming into the street. Sandford Green actually consists of 3 small greens placed around the one larger green in the centre.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was in the late 1980s and early 1990’s that a group of kids became what is now known as the ‘Sandford Green Golden Generation’. Never had the Green seen such a wealth of sporting talent, several amazing games were inspired by the youngsters. Street tennis flourished with its rules using no net and curbs for lines, Speedball a game that mixed Rugby and American football which used only 1 scoring zone and extreme tacking and scrimmaging, 3 and in football, finals, green cricket with its short boundaries and fast scoring and of course this culminated in the 1992 Sandford Green Olympics which coincided with Barcelona Olympics of the same year. All track events were covered, 100m to 1500m, relays, shot-put, discus, javelin, bike events, marathon, judo, football, iron man, triple jump, long jump – all carefully planned with medal ceremonies to culminate in the greatest sporting extravaganza the Green had ever seen. Carl dominated all the throwing events, and Adam performed well in the track but it was the combined effort of the 4 X 100m relay that united the Green.</p>
<p><br />
The original Sandford Green fledglings were always known as Ryan, Adam, Carl, Ben, Scott, Danny and Tony.</p>
<p>The Sandford Green All-stars also played a pivotal role in the eventual peace treaty with the Trinity Clan and were regarded as war heroes among the street they lived. Since 1988 the Sandford Green Alliance had been at War with the Trinity clan with Trinity park effectively being no mans land for both factions. Stones were the main weapons used by both sides and both sides suffered many causalities. The War effectively ended and a truce agreed after the Great Battle of 1993 now referred to as the Battle of Morris. Key Sandfordarians Adam and Ryan were present at the signing of the treaty and to this day future generations of Sandfordarians and Trinity parkites pay tribute to what was sacrificed for them</p>
<p>The Battle of Morris was a final clash fought in 1993 by the Sandfordarians and the Parkites which eventually led to the peace treaty being signed. It was the first time key leaders Ryan and Adam introduced Advanced Tactical Systems (ATS) which ultimately led to victory. Sandfordarians access to Trinity Park was through a narrow alleyway at the top section of the Green, the Parkites actually resided at the upper end of the park and had key access to the many walkways and paths that spread over the whole territory. Although with limited entry to the park for the Sandfordarians it was the excellent use and key understanding of the trees and undergrowth near their point of entry which also pushed them toward victory. During quiet times, several key ‘bases’ were created along the front line. These were hidden from the enemy using natural camouflage and there were also large amounts of stones stored there for times of extreme confrontation. Sandfordarians even suspended boards in the trees also with a supply of stones to allow various points of attack, being stationed there was very risky. Any breach of the front line meant that they were extremely exposed but they played a huge part in the war effort.</p>
<p>The war had raged for many years with the last 2 being more intense and bloody. The Sandford Green ‘family’ called a meeting as to how to end the war quickly and with the right result. Adam and Ryan then put forward a plan which would take 6 weeks to set up but would be executed over 1 day. The mission was codenamed ‘Slimer’ and the Battle of Morris was born.</p>
<p>The Battle of Morris happened on a hot summer’s day in the break of 1993. The 6 weeks planning needed the Sandford Green commando unit to secure 2 critical points, William Morris and Powys Grove. Sandfordarians had secured the passage to William Morris which ran along side the main area of no mans land after a bloody battle. In this area they planned a key attack strategy never before used. A single base was established and stones stored as usual but these stones were handpicked to be easily carried over a long distance. A further unit was placed parallel to this on the other side of the Sandfordarians front line near to Powys grove which had also been recently secured almost easily after the Parkites scrambled reinforcements to try and hold the already surrendered William Morris. Troops were placed at both of these bases, with the main command unit of Adam, Ryan and Ben holding a central position. The ATS introduced was ground breaking and for the first time a collated attack plan could be put in place, the ATS was that of a 2 way radio. Over the 6 week planning period, detailed schematics had been drawn of the layout of the Parkites territory and also William Morris and Powys Grove. It would be these plans which would now decide the fate of the war. Several attack plans had been drawn up and it was the plan codenamed ‘The Crab’ which was finalised and chosen. From the Command centre Ryan gave the order that squad teams from Morris base and Powys base were to load up weapons and prepare to make there was to the battle points. Morris brigade had a long journey along the perimeter of Trinity to avoid detection and were then to set up base and hold in the easterly corner of the field. Several dry runs had been done over the 6 week period allowing the command unit to know exactly how long the journey would take. A lookout in the main base confirmed with binoculars they were in place. Adam and Ryan then shook hands for what could have been the final time, with all resources utilised, Ryan was to take lead of the Powys unit and Adam was to lead the depleted central unit.</p>
<p>The Powys grove section were then instructed to move forward to the attack point, they carried with them one of the radios as the unusual layout of the adjacent pathway made it impossible for a visual conformation that they were in place. The unit stayed in constant contact with the main command centre, updating their position and estimated time of arrival at the attack point. Once in place high in the Trinity Park area, Ryan contacted Adam to advise they were in place and operation Slimer was ready to be executed. During the time that both teams had set off to arrive at the attack points, several small combat units were set-up along the front line to bombard the Parkites. It was vital that the Parkites were not to know that the Sandfordarians forces were stretched, if they had realised the operation would have failed and 2 sections would have been cut off from their only re-entry point to the green. However it had succeeded, both teams await the ‘go’ from base and at 1445 the execute command was given.</p>
<p>The first stage was for the Sandfordarians to draw the parkites from the Park its self, they did this by slowly with withdrawing forces from the central unit. Adam had joined the forces and gave updates to the Powys unit as to the position of the Parkites on the battlefield. Slowly over 30 minutes the Parkites assumed that they were forcing the Sandfordarians back and they decided to push on and walk across no mans land. Stones rained down over the park as the Parkites pushed forward, Adam held the teams back, he needed the Parkites to be in a position which would not let them retreat to the Park. At 1550 Adam advised the central teams to stop withdrawing and spread again across the front line, the command to attack was given. Powys attacked with ferocity and speed, a lookout from the Morris brigade gave the signal to go and as their brothers had just done, they attacked with vigour and bravery. Immediately the Parkites were in trouble, many of their men fell in the early exchanges as the claw of the Sandfordarians crab closed in on the Parkites troops. The main unit hidden by trees took easy pickings as the Parkites men were forced into them, into the very trees and undergrowth that they had specialised training in. The commander and chief then bolted from his main pack knowing that they were in serious danger. Ryan and Adam went in pursuit, chasing up through the streets and finally at the William Morris mount they captured the commander, he expected death but instead a treaty was offered. Adam and Ryan explained it could not go on, that peace must prevail and by 1630 hours the treaty was agreed and signed by both sides. From then on no mans land was home to only sporting clashes, football was played amongst the very people who had been sworn enemies.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the generation grew older and moved away, Sandford Green seemed to lose its heart and soul. The roads were empty, the green was quiet and not a game was played or made on the green of dreams. Many of the Golden generation return to see family who have remained there, but all agree that the Green has never seen and probably never will have a repeat of the Golden Generation that walked these streets.</p>

The P Chromosome is also known to be one of the most rebellious chromosomes, as it has only been isolated in a very few test subjects. While X and Y are usual chromosomes, P is becoming more prevalent in the youth of the world. The effects of the P chromosome are still wholly unclear, it has been known to last for generations, but for some, the X coupled with another X or Y chromosome, overpower the P chromosome.

<p>The <b>Valencia Grape</b> is a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grape.html" title="Grape">grape</a> first created by the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaskan</a> agronomist William Mhaille, on his farm in <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairbanks%2C_Alaska_8aca.html" title="Fairbanks, Alaska">Fairbanks</a>. This special kind of grape prospers in the cold, fertile Alaskan soil (or other such climates). The grape was later sold to the <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irvine_Company_a6e6.html" title="Irvine Company">Irvine Company</a>, who would dedicate nearly half of their land to its cultivation. The success of this crop in Central Alaska led to large amounts of research and development. It was later discovered that when properly utilized, this grape conducts and in some cases stores electrical energy for very short periods of time. Although these grape-batteries are impractical, the discovery was said to be important in indentifying new energy sources. Continually rising property taxes in Fairbanks, Alaska caused Mr. Mhaille to shut down his farm and move it to North Dakota. Later, during the Grape Depression, he was further forced to sell his Grape Farm altogether. Today, the Valencia Grape has been modified to grow in a variety of warmer climates, and has a moderate popularity in the wine community.</p>

<p>Although mainly a <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_grape.html" title="Table grape">table grape</a>, the Valencia Grape is available for purchase in certain areas of the country. The Valencia Grape's unusually thick skin allow it to survive harsher climates. It's bitter taste is attributed to it's abnormally high acid content, which aids in the grapes battery-like properties.</p>

In 2003 she started working at WCBS 880, a radio station. She also did a health watch segment on Discovery channel. She continues to do both. She now writes for Katie Couric on the CBS evening news. Everyone hates her though, because she is a really big bitch. Her newest and most favorite job is balancing three jobs with taking care of her three teenage heffers(not to mention maintaining an incredible pair of tig ole' bitties).</p>

<p>A close relative of the koala, is the Drop-bear (phascolarctos cinereus extremis), it is much like the koala, only three times larger, they have distinctive large gripping talons and forearms; very sensitive to sound, they are named for propensity to become disoriented and fall upon parties of noisy unsuspecting tourists. The injuries caused as drop-bears frantically attempt to secure a hold on the torsos of their victims are quite horrific and their images have been suppressed by the Australian Government.

<p>Since ancient times, Man has sought to penetrate his fellow man. The march of sodomization has done little to quell this need. Governments have outlawed violence at their own penile. Since 1969, we have brought men together to fight like Gentlemen: with knuckles, muscles, and wits. Three days, three acres, three thousand dildogs, three thousand men, three thousand dicks, six thousand ballz. Only one will win The Great Outdoor Frot. Hey, this feels nice of the nice</p>

<p>History of the Great Outdoor Dildog</p>
<p>Christina loved Nattelie’s pussy, especially when it is fresh fucked and oozing cum. For some reason cum tasted better from Nattalies pussy then from Rob’s dick. Christina remembers the first time she tasted cum, it wasn’t from a boy but from her dog. It wasn’t the same as people cum, it was thinner but just as tasty and always left her mouth tingling. She wondered what dog cum would taste like lapinging it from Nattalie’s pussy. Even though she and Nattalie were best of friends, she didn’t know if Nattallie would let a dog fuck her. She decided to ask anyway.</p>
<pre>
      It was a thrill when she broached the subject with Nattalie and
</pre>
<p>Christina found out that her girl friend had fucked a dog several times and liked it. Nattalie explained that the only problem was when you let the dog in to deep and his dick knot went inside your pussy. Then it would be a little while after the dog came that he could pull his dick out. Both girls agreed that to get fresh cum, it was important to have the dogs dick pull out just after climax.</p>
<pre>
      Nattalies boyfriend Tim had a male short haired collie, and she
</pre>
<p>explained to him what Christina and her had in mind. Tim thought it was a great idea and since it was his dog, he wanted to watch. When Rob learned about the plan he also wanted to be there to watch, jack off and maybe blow his load into Christina’s ass as she was sucking the dog cum. Rob loved fucking Christina in the ass and many times he and Time would double fuck Christina or Nattalie. Christinas ass was better, she had a way of controlling her asshole muscles in such a way that your dick simply was pumped dry every time.</p>
<pre>
      They agreed to have a get together at Tim’s place on Thursday
</pre>
<p>when Tim’s parents were at the Golf Coarse. Natalie and Christina came over with Rick and the four of them proceed to the den where Jason, Tim’s dog was waiting.</p>
<pre>
      It was a quick removal of the clothes and straight to business.
</pre>
<p>Christina rolled the dog over and took his dick in her mouth pumping him to hardness. Nattalie made herself comfortable on the floor, spread her legs and started finger fucking herself to get nice and juicy. When the girls and the dog were ready, Nattalie assumed the “Doggie Position” and Christina had Jason mount Nattalie and guided his dick into Natallies pussy. Christina immediately went under Nattalie and positioned her head next to Natalie pussy with the dog dick inserted. She kept a firm grip on the dogs dick knot so that it wouldn’t penetrate Nattalie.</p>
<pre>
      Rob and Tim stood over the girls with their raging hardons in
</pre>
<p>their hands stroking at a slow but steady speed. Jason was humping at a furious speed and in a flash he was finished. Christina pulled his dripping dick from Nattalies wet pussy and let the white dog cum drip right into her mouth. She then made oral love to Nattalie’s pussy extracting every bit of dog and girl love juice. Her face was a glazed mess of dog cum and pussy juice when she looked up to Rob and asked him if he licked it. Nattalie wanting some taste herself, French kissed Christina and licked off the remaining juice from Christina’s face.</p>
<pre>
      Now it was the boys turn to have a taste of cum. they assumed
</pre>
<p>the sideways 69 position and the girls helped them put each others dicks in their mouth. with the girls faces adjacent to the boys, the boys they proceeded to milk each others dicks to orgasm.</p>
<pre>
      Both Christina and Nattalie loved watching a boy suck cum
</pre>
<p>and then French kissing their lovers cum filled mouths when done. The taste was always great and the picture erotic. When Rick exploded into Tim’s mouth Nattalie was there to share the load, and vica versa with Christina.</p>
<pre>
      Christina never lets a boy fuck her in the ass unless he had a
</pre>
<p>rubber on. It’s a waste of cum. That way the boy gets to orgasm in her ass and she gets to taste the juice from the rubber. So when Jason the dog was getting frisky again she had Nattalie put a rubber on the dogs dick and present Christina’s ass to the mutt. This time they let the dog go all the way in and penetrate his knot past Christina’s asshole. This was a new and erotic experience for Christina as her ass was now plugged tight. Jason blew his load, Christina and Jason were locked together as Nattalie decided to do a double penetration with the boys while waiting to taste the dog cum from the rubber. Christina watched, with the dog dick in her ass as Nattalie milked cum from the buys using both of her holes. Rob had the rubber on and his dick had the pleasure of Nattalies ass. When he came he offered the loaded rubber to Nattalie who greedily devoured it’s contents. When Tim deposited his load in her pussy, Rob went down to clean out his friends tasty load. By the time they were finished, Jason’s dick slipped from Christina’s ass with a dog cum loaded rubber on his shrinking dick. Christina decided that the boys would get this load and offered it to first to Rob who took some and then the rest to Tim who took the last drops from the rubber.</p>
<pre>
      It was great being fully bi-sexual and having fully bi-sexual male
</pre>
<p>friends. Ever Since Christina started dating ( before the movie Addams Family ) Christina knew that she loved sex with both boys and girls, and dogs.</p>
