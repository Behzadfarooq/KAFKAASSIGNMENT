<p>"You are apt to choose cheeses that dare to defy the limits, like spicy Jalapeño Jack, smoked Gouda or an intensely flavored Gorgonzola."</p>

<p>In the increasingly competitive world of <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business.html" title="Business">business</a>, where cost cutting is essential, a new trend in labour is being embraced. With many businesses failing to reap rewards of traditional <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outsourcing.html" title="Outsourcing">outsourcing</a>, a different source of labour is being exploited, <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnome.html" title="Gnome">Gnomes</a>.</p>
<p>Why Gnomes? Well first of all Gnomes are not human, so do not apply to the traditional human rights laws, and the currency of the Gnomes (called gnorbs) is nominal to humans. A well paid Gnome can be paid 100 000 gnorbs a year (Equivilent to US $20).</p>
<p>GNOMES are employed in various sectors, skilled and unskilled. Internet media giant <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">Fark.com</a> has recently set up customer service centre that exclusivley employs Gnomes (<a href="http://webpages.charter.net/paladeacon/totalfarkcallcenter.jpg" class="external text" title="http://webpages.charter.net/paladeacon/totalfarkcallcenter.jpg" rel="nofollow">See here for details</a>). A recent report also published by Fark.com shows various careers that gnomes participate in (<a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=1014371" class="external text" title="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=1014371" rel="nofollow">See report here</a>).</p>
<p>While human workers despise this trend, Gnome unions welcome the trend, long bored by their careers in the garden, they are increasingly becomeing a politcal force in business. President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> has employed many gnomes as part as his election campaign.</p>
<p>Other creatures are also getting in on the act. <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elves.html" title="Elves">Elves</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairies.html" title="Fairies">Fairies</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">Geeks</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolls.html" title="Trolls">Trolls</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monkey.html" title="Monkey">Monkeys</a> are also making inroads doing the "dirty work". The old quote is, "It's a dirty job, but someone has got to do it" is answered by the labour forces of these creatures.</p>

<p>The term 12th man refers to the fans in American Football. The name derives from the fact that there are 11 players on a side, but the presences of the fans in the stands impacts the game play as well, hence they are "The 12th Man." Fans impact the game play in many ways, both tangible and untangible. One obvious impact is the effect of the noise. 80,000 screaming fans makes it difficult for the opposing team's offense to call a play at the line of scrimmage. Lineman and wide receivers are unable to hear the snap count and are likely to go offside or be late coming off the snap. Having a large supportive crowd motivates players, so a home team that is playing well will reap the morale boost and play even better. Similarly, an opposing team that dominates play will take the fans out of the game, and the home team will have a packed but silent stadium. Often, when a team is significantly behind in the fourth quarter, fans (see traitors) will begin to head for the parking lot to beat the traffic back. This is usually a good sign that the game is over for the home team.</p>

<p><i>Our <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discordian.html" title="Discordian">Discordian</a> friends have dropped another rare gem on us.</i></p>
<p>A collection of works on Discordia, written by various Discordian saints, sinners, popes, priests, madmen, miscreants, degenerates, straight-arrows, etc... Compiled from various non-copyrighted (or Kopylefted) sources by Reverend DrJon Swabey and published sometime in the 21st century (the date on the document says 2001, but we're not going to fall for that one).</p>
<p>Although some Discordian cabals consider the work to be canonical (some even going as far as considering it the only canonical Discordian work), there are also many who discount the validity of the document. Others amongst the Discordian movement discount the idea of there being any canonical literature other than Dr. Ramos Montecino's 1667 work <i>Howe to Mayke a Cannon.</i> Most people would probably agree, however, that there are far better things to do with one's time than to shoot works of literature out of any firearm whatsoever.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of Rev. DrJon, many Discordian writings have been brought together in one place where without him, they may have been lost to the grainy particles of temporality -- leaving us free to peruse or ignore the work at our leisure and for overzealous lunatics to print copies of it so that they may have something to feed the bonfires that warm their cold, empty hearts.</p>

<p>Manson and Twiggy star in a snuff porno movie, which consists of naked Manson blowing his brains out over two naked girls, and naked twiggy. It is hilarious.</p>

<p><b>Wikipower</b> is the corrupt actions undertaken by a certain <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clique.html" title="Clique">clique</a> of Wikimember elitists who attempt to prostitute their way up, attaining more powerful <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative.html" title="Administrative">administrative</a> positions by harassing non-administrative members of the community.</p>
<p>The purpose for such actions is to win approval from their higher-up's, so that they might be nominated for progressively higher Wikimember ranks, including special privileges, like the ability to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban.html" title="Ban">ban</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censor.html" title="Censor">censor</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> Wikimembers who are ranked lower than they are, especially Wikimembers who do not login, and instead simply use their <a href="../../../i/2E/p/I.P._address_1f61.html" title="I.P. address">I.P. address</a> as their name.</p>
<p>Such Wikimembers who make use only of their I.P. address, and not some cheesy, unentertaining <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_name.html" title="User name">user name</a> or <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> are considered substandard Wikipedians by those in the upper-class of Wikimembers. Such discrimination is <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> of the highest order, yet the upper-ranking Wiki members refuse to acknowledge this. Several Wikimembers have become high on Wikipower, which creates an exaggerated sense of self-importance and the closed-minded ignorance that those members are always "right" and any who oppose them are always "wrong".</p>
<p>Several such members who have taken part in abusive actions due to Wikipower have gone so far as to ban or censor other members without any explanation--they feel no explanation is needed. Any questions posed to the Wikipower addicts are either ignored or immediately deleted. At present, Wikipower threatens the integrity of the entire Wikipedia project, as several people who are high on Wikipower have even broken <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> <a href="../../../l/a/w/Laws.html" title="Laws">laws</a>, such as those of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander.html" title="Slander">slander</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a>, <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_abuse.html" title="Psychological abuse">psychological abuse</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a>, extorion, <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_crimes.html" title="Hate crimes">hate crimes</a>, and could possibly be charged <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminally.html" title="Criminally">criminally</a> with <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extortion.html" title="Extortion">extortion</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a>, and/or <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>, for violation of the U.S. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">Constitution</a>, namely that which states that all American citizens have the right to defend themselves in court.</p>

<p>Rather than a genre, Spirit Music is more related to execution. Spirit Music can be generally be classified by an overal lack of musical ability, and the complete disregard of the quality of sound by the person playing. A good example of Spirit Music would be on the Peal Street Mall, where timeless classics are regularly butchered by drunk/stone hippies who insist that thier out-of-tune-banjo-solo completely surpasses the masterfully produced quality of the original artist. In many cases entire songs are recreated with Bongo drums, where every instrument of a particular song is reproduced with a different bongo. Even the lyrics. Aside from the irritating and sometimes murder-inspring sound, Spirt Music is more times than most, accompanied by the horrific smell of the person(s) playing.</p>

<p>almost entirely a discreet lavender shade to royal purple in it's natural state, the rainforest amethyst python is mostly misunderstood as a predator. chameleon-like, it is able to assume the colors of it's environment, and the vibratory state of it's zeitgeist, so as to appear practically invisible to the naked eye. having an advanced, reptilian mind - the rainforest amethyst python prefers energy to blood-letting. it is mostly a vegetarian, deriving elusive thought densities from trees and vegetables, unless it's *primal urges* are unleashed. in which case, statistics have shown it to be a viable force, often resulting in amelioration of the victim. but these cases are rare - the amethyst python does not like to be surprised, and with it's advanced reptilian sensitivities, it is a cold day in hades when this python can be bothered to strike anyone, at any time, for any reason. but cases have been documented where it has been disturbed to the extent that it has become stricken agog by puppies, kittens, rainbows, and cute little children. this has caused the python, in all cases, to molt to a higher level. beneath the scaley exterior of this sublime snake, lies a map to some treasure. the trick is resonating with it's feral aspects. there is no previous history for such a phenomenon, and no proof that it is true. over 12 feet long in it's stockinged feet, this misunderstood predator reached peak popularity back in 1968, when it was being chopped up and sold as 'pendants' for airy-fairy flower children who were too zonked for cost-comparison. as a result of this, many native cultures began making jewelry and touchstones out of the shed skin, resulting in the "endangered species" qualification of the sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties, and into the new millennium. nobody much cares about this python, as it is ineffectual when it comes to violence and rock and roll. As a result, the rainforests in Brazil are being cut down at an alarming rate, and being replaced by flatulant cows. the glaciers are melting and the coastlines should rise between 1 and 3 feet in the next two years. a meteor, strategically endowed by a superior alien race from somewhere in alpha centauri, is scheduled to hit the earth between 2004 - 2012 C.E., aimed at the rainforest pythons, but not guaranteed to hit them. poetic at heart, the totem of the python was exemplary in the souls of Elvis and John Lennon. That they were called to such violent deaths is another example of the lethal power of the rainforest python. whatever the python inhabits becomes destroyed eventually, thus far. those silly guys dressing up like Elvis should be construed as imposters. IF your path should cross that of a rain forest python, be sure that the wind is at your back. endowed with a superior sense of smell, the rainforest python is certain to identify you by your scents.</p>

<p>very similar to street fighter zero ( great game, yet only released for sega saturn&#160;:( ). i believe this game to out-do sf-zero for the fact that it has more characters and you have the 3 secret characters from street fighter zero already on the selection screen without having to put in a code or do anything special. (on a scale of 1-10) game-play = *9*, graphics *9*, character development *8*, and game-quality *10*. this as you can see is one of my favorite games of all time. i love street fighter. this game is a hard game to find... it was released november of 96 in japan, but was delayed in america. it came out later in 98 when nintendo 64's were selling like hot-cakes when everyone was ancious to see what the new graphic and advanced games were like. so as everyone lost interest in super nintendo and quickly became interested in saving there cash for the 64, street fighter alpha 2 was also lost. not many ppl own this game. it is a hard one to find. i found it on www.ebay.com . i think that it is the #1 arcade-like fighting game for snes.</p>

Actress Ann Atmar, who plays Shatner's sister, committed suicide mere weeks after the film wrapped. The daughter of actress Eloise Hardt was kidnapped and murdered. William Shatner starred in a Gene Roddenberry series.</p>

<li>In seriousness, since this game apparently has several variants, let me follow <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>, but suggest that since <font size="8"><i>"PENIS"</i></font> is not technically a profanity, we describe a general version of this game, with <font size="10"><b>"VULVA"</b></font> as an example, at Vulgarity shouting game, and redirect?

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure if this redirect idea (to vulgarity shouting game would be appropriate. I mean, nobody ever calls it that. In America I've never personally heard any version of this game except "Penis" actually played (although others have been tried, without success), and most everyone I know calls it "The penis game." I'm not sure about other countries like England, but if the only other version there is "Bogies", then I propose to Keep it under the current title, as that title is what it is very commonly known by, and give good mention to "Bogies", and perhaps redirect the title associated with that to "The <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_game.html" title="Penis game">penis game</a>". Wikipedia is not a place for "Original research," and calling this style of game a "Vulgarity shouting game" almost comes down to "original social research," since you're catagorizing and analyzing it in a way that hasn't been notably done before.<br />
Ah, and for those of you who have their "<b>Faith in humanity</b>" destroyed, or think the "<b>mental age</b>" has decreased, I don't think I need to remind you that there is a world out there much worse than a few guys shouting penis at the top of their lungs. Laugh at it, and you might actually feel a little better (: <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"></a>—<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">o</a> 03:48, Jul 17, 2004 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>This game is known in England. I have it on reliable evidence that British troops stationed in Germany play a variant in local drinking establishments, called 'Gestapo'. So if Penis had to go, aside from profanity shouting and vulgarity shouting games, we would also need an article for 'words of historical embarrassment shouting games'. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 14:52, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Naturally, the playing of the game results in tensions between players and other customers. I think this case is revealing in that it demonstrates that the 'offence word' serves mainly to test whether a player is more loyal to in-group or to out-group norms of behaviour. The winner is the one who is most 'in-group', obeying the rules of the game slavishly, and who is least sensitive to 'out-group' pressures. If played in an environment populated entirely by in-group members, the game is not fun, as it provides no such test.</li>
