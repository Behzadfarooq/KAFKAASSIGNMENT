<p>Badfinger originated with guitarist/keyboardist <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Ham_2594.html" title="Peter Ham">Pete Ham</a> and a group called <b>The Panthers</b>. Ham, Ron Griffiths (<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a>) and David 'Dai' Jenkins (<a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a>) went on to form <b>The Iveys</b>, named after a street in Swansea, Wales (and a pun on influential <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_group.html" title="Beat group">beat group</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollies_a38f.html" title="The Hollies">The Hollies</a>). By <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, Mike Gibbins had joined as the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">drummer</a>, and the band began playing locally with such groups as the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spencer_Davis_Group_b9b2.html" title="Spencer Davis Group">Spencer Davis Group</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Moody_Blues_2e82.html" title="The Moody Blues">The Moody Blues</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Yardbirds_9c9b.html" title="The Yardbirds">The Yardbirds</a>. The following year, The Iveys moved their base to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, performing both for <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Garrick_e60b.html" title="David Garrick">David Garrick</a> (a local singer) and as a solo act. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Jenkins was asked to leave the group and was replaced by Liverpudlian guitarist <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Evans_%28musician%29_992d.html" title="Tom Evans (musician)">Tom Evans</a>.</p>

<p>Although a respectable stage act on the London circuit, performing a wide range of covers from <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motown.html" title="Motown">Motown</a> artists to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, the abilities of the members to write original material was not evident with the public. In reality, the band's demos were almost entirely original songs. The group garnered some interest from record labels, but their personal manager, Bill Collins, later said the offers were not acceptable. It wasn't until <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal_Evans_db0e.html" title="Mal Evans">Mal Evans</a>, an employee of The Beatles' <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Records_84af.html" title="Apple Records">Apple</a> label, took up their cause that enabled them to be signed with his company. They were accepted by <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Records_84af.html" title="Apple Records">Apple</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> after several demo tapes were brought in by Mal Evans, finally getting approval from <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>. The Iveys recorded and released the single "Maybe Tomorrow" in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, which reached the lower levels of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_Hot_100_a584.html" title="Billboard Hot 100">Billboard Hot 100</a>. An album of the same name was issued in Italy, West Germany and Japan in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> (See <i><a href="../../../m/a/y/Maybe_Tomorrow_%28The_Iveys_album%29_9b11.html" title="Maybe Tomorrow (The Iveys album)">Maybe Tomorrow</a></i>). Plans to release the LP in the UK and U.S. were halted without official explanation from Apple.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">McCartney</a> gave the group a boost in 1969 when he offered them their breakthrough song "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Come_And_Get_It_%28song%29_76f0.html" title="Come And Get It (song)">Come And Get It</a>" he wrote, intended for the soundtrack to the film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magic_Christian_%28film%29_981d.html" title="The Magic Christian (film)">The Magic Christian</a></i>. McCartney produced the song for the band, as well as the group's original compositions of "Rock of All Ages" and "Carry On 'Till Tomorrow." These three tracks would appear in the film and on the soundtrack album.</p>
<p>Shortly after the McCartney sessions, Griffiths was asked to leave the group. The Iveys all shared a common home in <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golders_Green_7b48.html" title="Golders Green">Golders Green</a>, along with their personal manager and various roadies. Reportedly, the primary reason Griffiths was dispatched was because he was the only married occupant of the home and he was also raising a child there, creating a friction with Evans. The Iveys remained a trio for the next couple months, which included at least two Apple photo sessions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badfinger.html" title="Edit section: Badfinger: the Apple years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Badfinger: the Apple years</span></h3>
<p>By November 1969, with a new single pending, and seeking a harder edged sound, The Iveys decided it had to change its dated name which had often led to confusion with The Ivy League. The group changed their name to Badfinger (passing on McCartney's suggested 'Home' and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s suggestion of 'Prix'). The name "Badfinger" was suggested by Apple's <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Aspinall_f020.html" title="Neil Aspinall">Neil Aspinall</a>. This was a reference to 'Bad Finger Boogie', an early working title of "<a href="../../../w/i/t/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends_b233.html" title="With a Little Help from My Friends">With a Little Help from My Friends</a>" (from <i><a href="../../../s/g/t/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band_4fdc.html" title="Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></i>) after Lennon devised that melody on a piano using a solo finger due to having hurt his forefinger. Any previous recordings by The Iveys would henceforth be released to the public as "Badfinger" recordings by Apple, with the exception of much later CD reissues and Iveys compilations.</p>
<p>After unsuccessfully auditioning bassists, Badfinger honed in on Liverpudlian guitarist named <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Molland_1462.html" title="Joey Molland">Joey Molland</a>. The addition of Molland required Evans to shift to the bass guitar, which Evans was wiling to do for expediency of getting the ball rolling again.</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../c/o/m/Come_And_Get_It_%28song%29_76f0.html" title="Come And Get It (song)">Come And Get It</a>" was released in December 1969 in the UK and January 1970 in the US. It was a hit throughout <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the United States, where it reached the Billboard Top 10. Badfinger's album <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Christian_Music_563c.html" title="Magic Christian Music">Magic Christian Music</a></i> was released several months after the film's premiere and peaked at #55 on Billboard.</p>
<p>New Badfinger recordings commenced in early <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. The album <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Dice_c974.html" title="No Dice">No Dice</a></i>, which peaked at #28 on Billboard, was released later that year. It was accompanied by the single "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Matter_What_%28song%29_ea15.html" title="No Matter What (song)">No Matter What</a>," which reached the Billboard Top 10. More notably, another track from <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Dice_c974.html" title="No Dice">No Dice</a></i>, "<a href="../../../w/i/t/Without_You_b973.html" title="Without You">Without You</a>", became a bigger hit when recorded by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Nilsson_9a97.html" title="Harry Nilsson">Harry Nilsson</a> in 1971 (where it reached the Billboard #1 slot) and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> in 1993, and was eventually covered by hundreds of artists, including the recent <a href="../../../i/l/_/Il_Divo_eb78.html" title="Il Divo">Il Divo</a> Italian version from 2006.</p>
<p>In preparation for their first American tour in 1970, Badfinger hired a New York manager named <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Polley_c4fc.html" title="Stan Polley">Stan Polley</a>. Although Polley's reputation was impressive at the time, his alleged connections to organized crime and dubious financial arrangements would only later become known to the group. Under Polley's direction, Badfinger toured in America and were generally well received, although the group complained they were living in the shadow of The Beatles because of the their close connection to the band. Media comparisons between Badfinger and The Beatles frustrated the group for years to come.</p>
<p>The band's popularity began increasing exponentially. They recorded many sessions for fellow Apple Records labelmates, notably playing acoustic guitar on tracks from <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a>'s "<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Things_Must_Pass_7196.html" title="All Things Must Pass">All Things Must Pass</a>" and providing backing vocals on <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringo_Starr_ef1f.html" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a>'s single "<a href="../../../i/t/_/It_Don%27t_Come_Easy_df61.html" title="It Don't Come Easy">It Don't Come Easy</a>." Evans and Molland performed on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s album <i><a href="../../../i/m/a/Imagine_%28album%29.html" title="Imagine (album)">Imagine</a></i>, and all four members of the band appeared as backup musicians throughout George Harrison's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert_for_Bangladesh_6ae6.html" title="Concert for Bangladesh">Concert for Bangladesh</a> in August 1971.</p>
<p>Badfinger's second album, <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Up_%28album%29_81ed.html" title="Straight Up (album)">Straight Up</a></i>, was released in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> and spawned two successful Cashbox Top Ten singles, "Day After Day" and "Baby Blue." <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Rundgren_d96f.html" title="Todd Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a> took production credits on the LP (Badfinger's most commercially successful record) with Harrison and Ham trading slide guitar solos on "Day After Day". ' Decades later, <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_Up_%28album%29_81ed.html" title="Straight Up (album)">Straight Up</a></i> ranked as the most-requested CD release among out-of-print albums in a readers poll for <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldmine_%28magazine%29.html" title="Goldmine (magazine)">Goldmine</a></i> magazine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the group, Apple Records' finances in the post-Beatles era were in chaos. Also, Polley did not negotiate well with <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Corps_d5cb.html" title="Apple Corps">Apple</a> President <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Klein_1f7c.html" title="Allen Klein">Allen Klein</a>, causing the former to seek out a new record label. Even more egregious for the band's fortunes, Polley had been misrepresenting and exploiting artists he had contracts with, according to several of his clients (including <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Christie_439d.html" title="Lou Christie">Lou Christie</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Kooper_1a13.html" title="Al Kooper">Al Kooper</a>).</p>
<p>The sessions for what would be Badfinger's fourth and last album for Apple, <i><a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_%28album%29.html" title="Ass (album)">Ass</a></i>, began in September 1972 at <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Studio_27cc.html" title="Apple Studio">Apple's basement studios</a> at 3, <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savile_Row_4635.html" title="Savile Row">Savile Row</a> and would continue at five recording studios over the next nine months. During the recording of <i>Ass,</i> Polley negotiated a multi-million dollar deal with <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._Records_a338.html" title="Warner Bros. Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> that included an album from the group every six months. The <i>Ass</i> release date would be held up by legal proceedings which followed Badfinger's departure from Apple. <i>Ass</i> featured a metaphoric record cover of a donkey (Badfinger) following a carrot (a coming lucrative record contract with Warner Bros.). Both <i>Ass</i> and its accompanying single, "Apple Of My Eye," failed to reach the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_Top_100_86d5.html" title="Billboard Top 100">Billboard Top 100</a>.</p>

<p>Six weeks after the <i>Ass</i> sessions were completed, Badfinger entered the studio to begin recording material for their first Warner Bros. release, <i><a href="../../../b/a/d/Badfinger_%28album%29.html" title="Badfinger (album)">Badfinger</a></i> (the intended Warner title, <i>For Love Or Money,</i> was accidentally excluded). Neither <i>Ass</i> nor <i>Badfinger</i> were well-received by music critics. <i>Badfinger</i> and its two accompanying singles, "Love Is Easy" (UK) and "I Miss You" (US), also did not reach chart positions. <i>Badfinger</i> did manage to maintain U.S. fan support as a result of several American tours. A performance at the Cleveland Agora in March 1974 was released on CD in 1990, although it became a subject of great controversy because of Molland's later studio overdubbing and <a href="http://hjem.get2net.dk/Badfingernews/lawsuit.html" class="external text" title="http://hjem.get2net.dk/Badfingernews/lawsuit.html" rel="nofollow">takeover of the group's royalties</a> for the project.</p>
<p>Following the group's last American tour, Badfinger recorded <i><a href="../../../w/i/s/Wish_You_Were_Here_%28Badfinger_album%29_28cf.html" title="Wish You Were Here (Badfinger album)">Wish You Were Here</a></i> at the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribou_Ranch_ecc8.html" title="Caribou Ranch">Caribou Ranch</a> recording studio in Colorado. Unlike their previous two albums, Badfinger's <i>Wish You Were Here</i> was very well received by <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> Magazine and other periodicals upon its release in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.</p>
<p>Internal friction centering on band management, money, and group leadership had been growing within Badfinger for a couple years. By 1974, Molland's wife began taking a more assertive role in the band's politics, which did not endear her to Molland's bandmates, particularly Ham. Just before the band began rehearsals for an October 1974 UK tour, Ham suddenly quit the band during a management meeting, stating his decision was because of Mrs. Molland. He was temporarily replaced by guitarist/keyboardist <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jackson_b5ce.html" title="Bob Jackson">Bob Jackson</a>. However, just before the 1974 tour began, Ham rejoined the group. Jackson remained as full-time keyboardist, making the band a short-lived quintet. After the tour, it was Molland's turn to quit the band, claiming his decision was based on a lack of consensus on their management situation, though the other band members and personal manager Bill Collins claimed it was Molland's frustration that Ham had re-entered the band and his control would be lessened.</p>
<p>With Polley's insistence, Ham, Evans, Jackson and Gibbins reconvened to record a quick follow-up to <i>Wish You Were Here.</i> The album, <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_First_%28Badfinger_album%29_4902.html" title="Head First (Badfinger album)">Head First</a>,</i> was recorded in two weeks at Apple Studios in December 1974. Warner Bros.' publishing division refused to acknowledge the <i>Head First</i> recordings because it was preparing to launch a lawsuit against Badfinger Enterprises, Inc. (the group's management company) and Stan Polley. The <i>Head First</i> album became lost in the litigation and was never issued by Warner Bros.. Bob Jackson retained a rough mix by engineer Phil McDonald on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_15.html" title="December 15">15 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. This tape is the basis of the 2000 Snapper release of Head First. In reference, biographer Dan Matovina <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~crimson3/bkxcrpthead.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mindspring.com/~crimson3/bkxcrpthead.html" rel="nofollow">wrote in detail</a> about the events surrounding Head First.</p>
<p>The lawsuit launched by Warner Bros.' publishing division against Badfinger Enterprises, Inc. in December 1974 would work its way through California courts until 1979. At issue was the disappearance of US $100,000 in a publishing escrow account which Polley had access to. When Warner Bros. inquired as to the money's whereabouts, during a several month period, Polley reportedly never responded. As a result of this legal fray, <i>Wish You Were Here</i> and all other Badfinger releases by Warner Bros. were stopped and shelved in early 1975. Coupled with the termination of Badfinger's Apple contracts, there soon was no Badfinger product available on record store shelves anywhere.</p>
<p>From the beginning of <i>Badfinger Enterprises, Inc.,</i> the contract Polley had with the band stated that most recording and publishing royalties would go to a holding company that was controlled by Polley. This led to a salary arrangement for the group, of which they complained was sorely inadequate compared to their gross earnings. Shortly after the WB lawsuit was filed, Polley reportedly discontinued sending the band members their salaries. The member with the least amount of financial stability to endure this lack of income was Ham.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badfinger.html" title="Edit section: Death and decline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death and decline</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_24.html" title="April 24">24 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Ham, nearing financial ruin and contractually confined, hanged himself in his garage studio in Surrey. His suicide note, addressed to his girlfriend and her son, blamed <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Polley_c4fc.html" title="Stan Polley">Stan Polley</a> for his misfortunes: <i>"Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better. Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard. I will take him with me."</i> More than a decade later, Polley would plead <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nolo_contendere.html" title="Nolo contendere">Nolo contendere</a> to an unconnected money laundering charge. Ham's daughter was born one month after her father's death.</p>
<p>Badfinger disbanded after Ham's death, and for years afterward, lawsuits and bankruptcies haunted the members on both sides of the Atlantic. Evans and Molland were both unsuccessful in separate new band projects, and by 1977 they were both out of the music business; Molland was laying carpet while Evans worked as a plumber. That year guitarist Joe Tansin recruited Molland for a new band he was putting together, and when they needed a bass player Molland suggested Evans. Pressure from record companies led to the decision to call themselves Badfinger, and together they recorded their "comeback" album <i><a href="../../../a/i/r/Airwaves_%28album%29.html" title="Airwaves (album)">Airwaves</a></i> which was released in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. Tansin left the band immediately after the album was recorded.</p>
<p>To promote the album, Molland and Evans recruited Peter Clarke (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stealers_Wheel_f961.html" title="Stealers Wheel">Stealers Wheel</a>) on drums, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Kaye_%28musician%29_5941.html" title="Tony Kaye (musician)">Tony Kaye</a> (<a href="../../../y/e/s/Yes_%28band%29.html" title="Yes (band)">Yes</a>) on keyboards and Bob Schell (aka Spider Cobb of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollywood_Squares_%28punk_rock_group%29_18d5.html" title="The Hollywood Squares (punk rock group)">The Hollywood Squares</a>) on guitar and vocals. The single "Love is Gonna Come At Last" reached #69 in the US. They recorded and released a second album, <i><a href="../../../s/a/y/Say_No_More_%28Badfinger_album%29_b41f.html" title="Say No More (Badfinger album)">Say No More</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, with that year's touring line-up. This LP was distributed on a much smaller independent record label. It's single, "Hold On," reached #56 in the US. Ultimately, Evans and Molland split acrimoniously in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Molland and Evans briefly operated rival bands, both using the name Badfinger. Evans teamed again with Bob Jackson (and occasionally Mike Gibbins) and they toured mainly in the eastern United States. During this time, Evans and Jackson signed a spurious management contract with a Milwaukee businessman. Both were later sued (Evans for US$5 million) when they abandoned the contract due to their claim of management obligations being unmet.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">19 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Evans and Molland argued on the telephone, reportedly about the publishing royalty division of the song "<a href="../../../w/i/t/Without_You_b973.html" title="Without You">Without You</a>." Following the argument, Evans hanged himself in the garden at his home in an eerie replay of Pete Ham's 1975 death scene.</p>
<p>In August <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, Molland, Gibbins and Jackson played a small number of U.S. dates as part of a 20th Anniversary of the British Invasion in America package tour. In 1986, Molland and Gibbins reformed Badfinger, until Gibbins left for good in 1990.</p>
<p>Molland continues to tour as Joey Molland's Badfinger and has released three solo albums. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, posthumous collections of Ham home recordings were released on separate CDs, <a href="../../../7/_/p/7_Park_Avenue_0290.html" title="7 Park Avenue">7 Park Avenue</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golders_Green_7b48.html" title="Golders Green">Golders Green</a>. A detailed biography on Badfinger came out in 1997 entititled Without You: The Tragic Story Of Badfinger.</p>
<p>Mike Gibbins died in his sleep at his home in Oviedo, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">October 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. He was 56. He is survived by his wife, as well as three sons, who perform together in the Orlando based rock band the Seven Sisters. The City of Swansea planned a museum exhibit commemorating the Welsh members of Badfinger. A Badfinger convention in Swansea in June 2006 brought together Jackson, Griffiths, and several surviving family members of Ham, Evans and Gibbins.</p>

<p>Evans and Jackson formed The Dodgers after Ham's death in 1975. Molland formed Natural Gas with former <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humble_Pie_4bfb.html" title="Humble Pie">Humble Pie</a> drummer Jerry Shirley in 1976, and Mike Gibbins went into session work, appearing on <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Tyler_a940.html" title="Bonnie Tyler">Bonnie Tyler</a>'s 1978 hit single "It's A Heartache."</p>
