<p>I saw that you voted against the adminship of William M Connolly. I reviewed said candidate's actions on the Cold Fusion article and determined them to indeed be very biased and uncivil. I haven't looked at WC's actions on the aetherometry article yet though. The vast support for WC is truly disturbing. I am a candidate for the arbitration council. William M Connolly is precisely the type of biased and uncivil person that I would fight against.</p>
<p>I request that you review my candidate statement and questions at: <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_Vote_LawAndOrder_e876.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections January 2006/Vote/LawAndOrder">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections January 2006/Vote/LawAndOrder</a> , and consider voting for me, though only if you have suffrage for arbitration committee elections (registered before 9/30/2005, and have over 150 edits before 1/9/2006). The votes are vastly against me, so I will not win, but I have very few support votes, so voting for me will at least show that I (who is on your side) am less of a pariah. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawAndOrder_8da2.html" title="User:LawAndOrder">LawAndOrder</a> 21:20, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Jeff,</p>
<p>A colleague and I are working on a Boston Globe story about wikipedia, and we are looking for a few local folks -- we have talked to several already -- who like to contribute and have views about the project. Will you call me at xxx xxx-xxxx? Or you could also email me at (e-mail removed)@globe.com if you want to suggest a number where and time when I could call you. I'm thinking of a short chat on the phone. Also, it's possible that we would want to take your picture.</p>
<p>Thanks so much,</p>

I agree that sometimes articles get deleted that shouldn't and it sucks when that happens. But consider how much time is wasted when a hundred people have to read an AFD and comment on it over a period of 5 days, just for the article to be deleted. Those people could have spent time creating other articles. I don't think this is a "deletionism vs inclusionism" issue; it is a "how do you spend your time most efficiently" issue. It's more efficient to delete and undelete the mistakes than be ultra-conservative. In Computer Science there is a maxim: "it is easier to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission".

<dd>Well, I'm still convinced the most efficient way to do it is to, you know, not nominate notable articles for deletion. Instead of just tagging something AfD, people should take a minute to see if they can improve it.

<p>You're correct that I've nominated a lot of junky bands for deletion lately. I don't think it's cool that I have to weed through a zillion junky bands that have less notability than people in my neighborhood just to get to bands that are actually worthwhile. And I'll continue to "clean up". Before you get to the point of blindly voting Keep on every one of my Afd's (it looks like you never vote to delete any music bands ever), take a look through my contributions and see how many bands I've saved by adding discographies and other hints at notability and how many others I've tried to start improving by tagging as uncat and unsourced, etc. Afd is not as evil a thing as you make it out to be. If we could get to a point where every band was clearly above a certain line, we wouldn't need to delete any others and Wikipedia wouldn't have the feel of a giant electronic one-cent used-CD store anymore. Just my two cents... —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 15:40, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not planning on trolling your nominations, I have no time or interest for games to make a point nor could I possibly track them down and do research on them legitimately if I wanted to. I have major issues with a lot of band nominations, and I find a lot of AfD nominations for bands to be extremely lazy. If you're not part of that group, good, but there's a religious adherence to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> that is somewhat disturbing, and the amount you've done lately makes me question it. I'm glad you're attempting to improve some of them, though, that's more than we can say about other folks. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 15:56, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>FWIW, there are plenty of bands that clearly don't make WP:MUSIC that I pass over because they seem to be starting out and have some following. As far as how appropriate WP:MUSIC is itself, I'll confess to not having data to back it up - I think it was established long before I got here. If I wanted to raise the issue of things like the definition of "major label", I could tie up Afd forever on black metal bands alone - but I'm more interested in getting rid of obvious crap (like a death metal band called Paracoccidioidomicosisproctitissarcomucosis — please). —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:05, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Now that I think about it, I'd be all for discarding Afd's for WP:MUSIC if we could somehow segregate the smaller less notable bands away from all the more popular bands. I realize that people - such as yourself I assume - like seeing lists of every band ever and I don't have a problem with that. But I don't personally like such lists and get frustrated when they are blindly mixed in with the bands that have already made a name for themselves. If we had categories like Category:Less-notable independent bands, I'd be all for it. I don't think many others here would agree though... —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:18, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since this is kinda getting beyond the scope of the talk page... Yeah, this is how I tend to close AfDs, but honestly this was a very borderline case between "keep" or "no consensus". I was trying to err on the side of caution. I realize it might be seen as making an article more likely to get nominated again... so I'll take your comment into consideration in the future.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel any better, the one time a decision of mine has ended up on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> it was because someone wanted me to say "no consensus" when I'd said "keep".

<p>Hi Jeff, I figured this would end up at deletion review however it was closed, and if you'd like to take it there I encourage you to do so. I'd be interested in the results. I did examine the prior keep vote, though a prior AfD does not alter the guidelines or criteria used in closing any subsequent AfDs. However, I do personally feel that later AfDs probably should bear a slightly higher "burden of proof" if they are to succeed, so this was one variable that pulled me in the direction of a "no consensus" judgment. As for verifiability, clearly the existence of the site and its various features are verifiable, but that's not the issue. What are sorely lacking are reliable secondary sources that characterize and describe LJ Drama. Without those, the article's prospects were very poor, and its potential scope extremely narrow. Regardless, the AfD met my typical definition of a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermajority.html" title="Supermajority">supermajority</a> for delete (normally I look for 66% of all good faith, reasoned votes), and I didn't find adequately extenuating circumstances to outweigh that supermajority. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 05:00, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One's with absolutely no attention, locally or nationally. If they do a regional tour and create a few albums, it shows they've been able to expand past their locality, and that's more than good enough for me. The touring requirement is hell for many indie bands, there's no consistent idea as to what's a worthy label to make an adequate guideline, and the "major music magazine" requirement knocks off niche-magazines and technically doesn't allow things like newspaper coverage, which is dead wrong. I'd keep the majority of bands that can demonstrate that they've done more than rehearsed and played locally, or that have shown an effort to gain expanded fame (such as the band who you originally came here for). --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 17:59, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mainly so many worthwhile articles being deleted. It's kinda pointless to create guidelines, ignore them for some articles, and then make them too strict for other worthy articles. It's not only trying to be a typical encyclopedia, but trying to be something more, that whole "sum of knowledge" thing. So I approach articles with one question: "Why should this article be here?" If I can't make a good rationalization as to why (and there are very few things that don't have a legitimate answer to that question), then it's probably not worth having. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 21:19, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The AfD for <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popaganda%21%21%21.html" title="Popaganda!!!">Popaganda!!!</a> is not based on notability, as you point out it is a notable band. But the album is not yet released and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" rel="nofollow">wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>.

<dl>
<dd>So in your mind, any album not currently on the shelves today shouldn't be here? I'll note from the policy that you note (and I agree with!): "It is appropriate to report discussion and arguments about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects or whether some development will occur, provided that discussion is properly referenced." --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 21:38, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If one read the article that's used as a source then one would see the band isn't even sure about the title. That's the problem with crystal ballism, what if the album changes name (as appears possible, if not likely, from the reference)? An encyclopedia is for what is - not what may be.

<p>I take the charge of vandalism very seriously. You have been distorting the facts on the LewRockwell.com page. It's easy to find small exerpts to back up a certain POV, but the fact is that the IHR is a group which argues that the Holocaust was conducted on far lesser scale than we currently consider it to have occured at, and IHR also argues that the Holocaust wasn't meant to exterminate Jews but only to put them into camps. Sobran's comments about Jews, found in <a href="http://www.marwenmedia.com/articles_images/SobranJewishFaction.html" class="external free" title="http://www.marwenmedia.com/articles_images/SobranJewishFaction.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marwenmedia.com/articles_images/SobranJewishFaction.html</a> make it clear he is an anti-semite. Please do not distort these facts anymore. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDookieMan_561c.html" title="User:TheDookieMan">TheDookieMan</a> 22:08, 23 March 2006 (UTC)TheDookieMan</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have not been distorting any facts. For one, you continue to restore the incorrect assertations of WFB regarding Joseph Sobran, even with the facts being spelled out to you. For another, I posted exactly what IHR claims to be, and you instead decide to restore an incorrect version false claiming what they say. To accuse me of vandalism in the face of actual facts is incorrect, and will be dealt with on a different level if need be. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 22:12, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

No one is trying to "protect anti-semites." We're here to write an encyclopedia, and that means <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">representing sources</a> accurately. The aforementioned guideline states, <i>Disputed edits can be removed immediately and placed on the talk page for discussion, or where the edit is harmless but you dispute it and feel a citation is appropriate, you can place {{citation needed}} after the relevant passage.</i> <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 22:16, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concur with Dick, and would add that even if nobody disputed that Sobran was an anti-Semite and deserved to be reviled, Wikipedia is not the place for doing that.

<p>Hi Badlydrawnjeff, I came here after seeing your vote on the AFD for <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flies_Inside_The_Sun_b9d3.html" title="Flies Inside The Sun">Flies Inside The Sun</a>, and then read your thoughts on WP:MUSIC. It's great to find someone who feels the confines of WP:MUSIC are too restricting, as this is a view I share. I've been creating entries for many New Zealand artists from the 1990s - mostly those involved with the 'free-noise' scene. Back in the day, I really dug this scene, though following its nebulous personnel changes was a hefty task (especially before the internet was in wide use). Wikipedia is great for this task, but I'm fearing these bands are too obscure for WP:MUSIC and the deletionists who use it. Anyway, I was just dropping by the say "keep up the good work". <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 05:17, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Several days ago, you recommended undeleting the article for myg0t. I'm not sure to what extent you based your opinion on the prior AFD discussions. Since your comment, I discovered that the second AFD discussion in question had been vandalized by an anon user between the closure of the discussion and the start of the deletion review. The vandalism obscured several valid comments and made the strict vote-count appear to be a "no consensus" decision. If the prior AFD discussion played any role in your decision, could I ask you to review the unvandalized version of the AFD discussion? Thanks. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 19:17, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding your comment on this user's page, I draw your attention to the section "Who do you think you are?". Note in particular the reference to the quote on his (other) user page.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that his attitude towards such criticisms was to say <i>"You seem to have confused me for someone who cares what you think. It was an honest mistake, I'm sure."</i> then tell me not to use his talk page. Which seems pretty much to confirm that he has his own agenda, and plays the rules selectively when it suits this.</p>

<p>Look, I don't know how much you know about Joe Sobran, but he is an anti-semite, racist, and homophobe. Whether or not (and I'm not saying you do) think those things are okay, the fact is that his article should reflect the fact that many have stated that. I think the article in general should refelct a holistic consideration of Sobran, specifically concentrating on what makes him significant to the greater public. Those are the justificiations for my edits. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerman_d209.html" title="User:Rogerman">Rogerman</a> 20:25, 18 April 2006 (UTC)Rogerman</p>

<dd>The article DOES reflect that, that's all. The article clearly lists the situation, as well as a FACTUAL basis for the accusations, including who said what, and plenty of links to back it up. Your version, unfortunately, makes a false claim about what WFB said, and is not nearly as good a version as DCM's are. I do suggest expanding the National Review section if you feel it's not properly addressing it, but you should probably explain why WITHOUT adding POV edits. Whether he's an anti-semite or a green man from Mars is irrelevant, we need to be factual and well-sourced to make such claims. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 20:30, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(As a side-comment, and I'm not trying to start a war or anything, I personally like the first interpretation a lot better.) -- <a href="../../../h/i/r/User%7EHirudo_8b5b.html" title="User:Hirudo">Hirudo</a> 22:29, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I meant "here" as in Wikipedia. I see what you're saying, though, but the idea was for people to approach an article saying "This is why we should have this article on Wikipedia," y'know? Maybe I'll rephrase a little bit, I never saw it that way. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 22:31, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting indeed. I guess the tone of that question suggest an exclusionist attitude to me, which seemed to clash with your relatively inclusionist behaviour; that's probably why I thought you intended the other meaning. I suppose this shows yet again that written text isn't as unambiguous as we'd like. <a href="../../../h/i/r/User%7EHirudo_8b5b.html" title="User:Hirudo">Hirudo</a> 22:46, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I'm coming here to cut to the chase since we seem to be arguing over the top of each other and not actually listening to what we're saying. I think the meme guidelines are insane because if we apply them to any other topic, and believe me people will, they'll allow anything. Now internet related articles are a hard area, but I'd rather we had a list of people or sites who were considered reliable sources, rather than just allow a meme once it is a year old. A meme shouldn't get an article just because everyone is doing it, it should get an article because it's been reported that everyone is doing it. That's my opinion. I think that's what being an encyclopedia means. That's my take on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I'm going to post this at <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">WP:MEME</a> too, but I'm dropping it here too because I'm that sort of bloke. I would like to know why an article like <a href="../../../i/c/y/Icy_Hot_Stuntaz_7ba6.html" title="Icy Hot Stuntaz">Icy Hot Stuntaz</a> requires no third party sources when <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states that <i>Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy</i>. Appreciate it if we can at least get on the same page on this. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">The wikipedian meme</a></small> 10:08, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I promise I'm not trying to talk past you here. Here's my deal, as I noted over there: primary sources are a-okay in extreme circumstances, per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Verifiability has never been an issue on internet memes, only notability. I forget where I posted that, but it's out there. I don't like the proposal <i>as written</i> right now, but given the ups and downs of internet meme AfDs combined with the same debates over and over, that's where I think this is necessary. The "internet meme guidelines" wouldn't be applied to, say, the pets of wikipedians. That can be made clear. But it seems like the concern continues to come from an area that isn't an issue from this end. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 12:36, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
