<p>It occurs to me another way of splitting it might be to go down a country of original publication route, so have a List of American comic strips, and list of British comic strips, and so on and so forth. What's your thoughts? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">The wikipedian meme</a></small> 21:02, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sounds fine to me. The only question would be how many categories to include? I know that Adamson was syndicated under a variety of names in the US for some years, and I'm not sure how many countires of origin beyond the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, etc. should be included. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 23:40, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Not sure I understand your point. What do you mean when you say categories, and who or what are you referring to when you say Adamson? As to countries of origin, when someone wants one I don't create, they'll most likely create it. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:06, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>And my boundless thanks to Mr. Steve Block, the Wikipedian meme, for his work on fixing my my mistakes on the list cited above. I know that he doesn't like having his own talk page cluttered with too many effusive thanks, and I feel strange putting it here myself, but such thanks are certainly in order in this instance. Thank you again, sir. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 13:10, 12 June 2006 (UTC) My mistake. I should have stated that we should have at least one list of strips from countries other than the UK, US, Canada (categorized by nation of origin), and the other significant producers. Adamson is the title of a (Swedish?) wordless comic strip which ran for several years, and, if I read it right, was maybe syndicated three times under different titles in the US market. However, I do think that separate pages for at least the US and UK strips would be probably the best way to go with them, as that is consistent with the way that things are done elsewhere here. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 01:33, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The two L's aren't a typo, that's really how it's spelled. <a href="http://comics.com/creators/momma/index.html" class="external text" title="http://comics.com/creators/momma/index.html" rel="nofollow">see for yourself</a> <a href="../../../j/f/p/User%7EJfpierce_b555.html" title="User:Jfpierce">Jfpierce</a> 04:30, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not disagreeing with you, but I do note that the [<a href="http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lazarus_m.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lazarus_m.htm" rel="nofollow">Mel Lazarus page on the Lambiek Comiclopedia</a>] and a few other sites as well go with the single L in the name Mel Lazarus, although they indicate that his actual name is spelled with two L's. I'm not really sure which would be preferable. Please advise. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 13:20, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would say the way Lazarus spells his first name on his comic strip and the way his syndicate prints his first name, which is Mell with two L's. <a href="http://www.creators.com/comics_show.cfm?comicname=mom" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.creators.com/comics_show.cfm?comicname=mom" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I don't know why Lambiek uses the one-L spelling, but I see no reason to go against the cartoonist's own use. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 01:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good work on some of these subcats. I have been meaning to work on some of those.

<dd>Thanks for creating these! I just found your note at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Wisconsin_aac8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Wisconsin">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Wisconsin</a>, and wanted to let you know that they're being well-used already. I'm using AWB to better populate them (starting with Wisconsin, I have some other states I'm interested in too) and already (just a few weeks later) surprisingly few people are present in the state category who need to be moved down -- the majority of the additions I'm making are articles that had no origin cat whatsoever. Anyway, they are proving useful and used! --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 12:07, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I cannot find an article on Hugh Buchanan, but <i>Argyleshire</i> is an archaic spelling of <i>Argyllshire</i>, the anglified version of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyll.html" title="Argyll">Argyll</a> (abolished 1975), which is now (mostly) part of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyll_and_Bute_54eb.html" title="Argyll and Bute">Argyll and Bute</a>.</p>
<p>If you are doing an article on this chap, you should probably put him in Category:Natives of Argyll and Bute. Hope that is of assistance. PS. there is a very famous street in Glasgow called <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyle_Street_fb98.html" title="Argyle Street">Argyle Street</a> which uses the old spelling. See Argyle socks too!

<p>Hi Bill, You commented on an article I was working on around the tenth of this month. I have it done now, and before I post it, I was hoping you would have a moment to look it over. The article is located <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomnabot_Sandbox2_8788.html" title="User:Somnabot/Sandbox2">Here</a>.

<dd>Sorry about the delay there. The article looks fine. The only objection I can imagine is that it might be a bit long for a state legislator, and that others might see it as being a piece of propoganda. But that accusation gets levelled at all articles about sitting politicans, so I wouldn't necessarily pay any attention to it. I wish any of the pathetic little stubs I've put together on politicians were as good as this. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 23:51, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Bad Bill, I just read your latest comments at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Council_9e52.html#Public_Relations" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Council">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Council#Public_Relations</a>. A lot of what you are proposing is already being done, albeit slowly, at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Work_via_Wikiprojects_42db.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Work via Wikiprojects">Work via WikiProjects</a>. You can see a typical posting and response <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Anglicanism_89bd.html#Key_articles_for_Wikipedia_1.0" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Anglicanism">at the Anglicanism project</a>, and the resultant worklist <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Anglicanism_Assessment_6138.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Anglicanism/Assessment">here</a>. Likewise the Cathlicism is generating <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Catholicism_articles_by_quality_0ef9.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Catholicism articles by quality">their worklist</a> via the bot. All of this information is then collected <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_WPPhilrelig_f550.html#Wikipedia:WikiProject_Anglicanism" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/WPPhilrelig">here</a> and summarized <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_List_of_WikiProjects_0be0.html#Philosophy_.26_religion" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/List of WikiProjects">here</a> (this last one needs an update). Our main goal is to get lists of the best and most important articles from all WikiProjects, then try to put those all together for a CD, DVD or paper version of Wikipedia. The secondary goal is essentially the same as the new WP Council, to help projects (and notice boards) talk to each other and share ideas - and this has indeed happened. We have already contacted most of the projects that were listed on the main list about a year ago, this posting is in fact our "second round".</p>
<p>I was wondering if you might be interested in helping out with this project. We have only had a handful of people, typically only 2 or 3 active people at any time, and only one (me!) active right now. At the same time, this small project helped to promote the idea of article assessments and key articles, and was instrumental in arranging for Mathbot to work for the WikiProjects. So I think the time invested in this project has been extremely fruitful so far - and, quite frankly, exciting at times. We have also already laid the foundations for the inter-project discussions you were proposing. Would you be interested in working on this a bit? I'd really appreciate some help! Thanks, <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 23:13, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for signing on! Regarding contacting individuals from inactive projects, I have in fact done that on one or two occasions, particularly with major subject areas. As for the WP Council, I think we should raise that issue with on the WP Council talk pages (I'm heading home soon, can't do this right now). The other main person likely to work on WVWP is Tito (<a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">User:Titoxd</a>) and he is on the council too, so it won't upset anyone. If you're willing to do some of these contacts, we need to decide how to divvy up the list - in the past this has generally been along the lines of "I'll finish the sciences if you can do the arts ones". You follow up afterwards to check for responses and record the information. Is there a particular set of projects you'd be most interested in contacting? For many of the pages, I need to do a lot of work to set them up - it's very involved so I won't burden you with that part.

</dl>
<ul>
<li>I could fix and fulfill the list of wikiprojects related to science (or more specifically medicine, health)</li>
<li>Maybe we could create a new page for inactive projects for those who would like to maintain one but can't find out how to find a project without active maintainer.</li>

<p>Hi Bill. If you're tagging a talk page with WPBiography|living=yes, could you also add the article to <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> if it's not in it already. If there's no date of birth, add <a href="../../../d/a/t/Category%7EDate_of_birth_missing_4b5f.html" title="Category:Date of birth missing">Category:Date of birth missing</a>, if there's no year of birth <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category%7EYear_of_birth_missing_f709.html" title="Category:Year of birth missing">Category:Year of birth missing</a>.

<p>This is work that humans can do much better than bots, so your help fixing these little issues when you find them would me much appreciated! Cheers. (No reply needed). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 16:14, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey! Very nice work on the list! You might want to take a look at what's currently happening with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Council_Directory_fb19.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory">directory</a>, though; the latest idea seems to be alphabetical listing within broad subject areas, which may remove the need for a second alphabetical list.</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know so you can avoid spending too much time turning the list into charts in case it doesn't get used later on.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 17:28, 5 September 2006 (UTC) <span id="63282571786"></span></p>

<p>Hi bro thanks for the info. I will join the project you told me about from today itself. I wanted to know whether I am allowed to save a copy of page for the project I have started on my userpage.

Thanks for supporting me in the September Advisory Council Esperanza elections. Although I wasn't elected to the Advisory Council, I am very happy with the response I received from my fellow Wikipedians. I was shocked at the support, and was touched by it. Hopefully I will re-apply in March and try again for the job.
