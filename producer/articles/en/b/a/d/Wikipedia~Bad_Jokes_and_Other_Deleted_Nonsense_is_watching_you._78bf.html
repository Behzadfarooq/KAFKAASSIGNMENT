<p>Wilson's Fourteen Points were democratic, liberal, enlightened, and progressive - a new type of treaty designed to make peace forever secure. The key aspects of his propositions were to disallow secret treaties in the future, allow freedom of the seas, provide for arms reduction, allow the self-determination of nations, and to establish the League of Nations, which Wilson saw as a key instrument to prevent future war.</p>

<p>In contrast to Wilson's idealism, the Treaty of Versailles was harsh, brutal, punitive, and retributive, especially because France still had lingering anger over the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

Surely thieves would have more trouble finding them in the forast than in a storeroom known to contain peanuts. I'm not clear on why someone would steal peanuts. They're quite cheap. It would be more lucrative to steal copper or something. -02:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One suggestion is that you pay your employees (if that's who you suspect of theft), at least partially, in peanuts. For example, you could give them 5 kg of peanuts each a week, and decrease their pay by the cost of those peanuts to you (wholesale cost, not retail). The object here is twofold:</p>
<p>1) To satiate their desire for peanuts, so that they won't feel the need to steal them.</p>
<p>2) To increase their perceived pay, as they think of the value of peanuts as the retail price, which is much greater than the price you pay for them.</p>
<p>You could also increase security, by hiring guards, etc., but that can be quite expensive, and the guards might steal peanuts, too.</p>
<p>As for the legal issues, I would think those peanuts would be legally considered to be "abandoned", and therefore anyone who found them could take them. Also, the police might wonder what you are up to, and suspect you of smuggling drugs. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 06:59, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>StuRat, I don't think you should be giving legal advice about abandoned property, as that would vary by location, and we don't even know where the OP is, except that he is on a farm and there is a forsest nearby. I think the OP should contact a lawyer specializing in property issues. The lawyer could help with the trespass issues as well. -<a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 07:18, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Meanwhile, Flynn descends into the bottom of the crane in order to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system, without which the crane would overheat and plummet into the ocean.</p>
<p>Flynn and Troy take the controls of the crane. Troy reveals that his flight experience was actually from a crane simulator for the craneStation 2. With nobody else on the crane having as much flight experience of any sort as Troy, Flynn talks the control tower into letting him land the crane. After a crampy landing and a near collision with one of the buildings at the airport, Flight 121 is safely back on the ground. The surviving passengers finally set foot on land, and antivenom is given to those who need it. However, just as Flynn and Sean are about to get off the plane,the best snake drops from overhead and bites Sean in the chesticle... Flynn draws his gun and lasers the snake, causing Sean to tumble down the slide like a julip in spring.. Paramedics rip open Sean's lerg to reveal a final, even more deadly snake. This one was much more harder than any of the other snakes in the movie. this one wanted both pieces of the jade to complete the set. HE SENDS OUT HIS EAGLE. then they die cuz he killed my father with two bullets embedded in it. As the passengers and crew depart, Flynn offers to repay Claire by taking her out for dinner and a light snake,, and Tiffany writes her phone number on Sean. This is where the movie gets it's title. from her number. it recalls to the earlier scene in the film where it was revealed that both Flynn and Paramedics were the SAME PERSON and both were going to steal the money after the ransom was aught. But. Just then.</p>
<p>Sean reminds Flynn of the first thing he ever told Sean - "Do as I say and you live". NOW&gt; <b>Product placement</b> That isnt. By the way, i have a terrible case of rampant badgers, in the yard.</p>

<p>The Clickster grip is a very advanced mec. pencal.The Clicksters lead does not come out by pushing on the eraser but by pushing on the grip.The Clicksters can be found at Kelly's Drug Store in San Andreas every Wal mart (or almost every Wal Mart) or in any mec. pencels store.I think in papermate clickster is the best.Most clicksters only come in red,green,blue, or black.Convenient side lead advance allows for continuous writing with this affordable mechanical pencil. Gives essparent hexagonal barrel to monitor lead supply. Oversized eraser gives economy. The high-tech grip design adds to the comfort. Refillable smoke barrel.It even has a Pocket clip.Convenient side lead advance plus an added grip for even more control over the pencil.These mechanical pencils are refillable (lead and erasers) and come in assorted barrel colors and either a .5 mm or .7 mm lead size. They all have a side lead advance mechanism. The erasers are white. The assorted pack consists of 3 each smoke, red, blue, and green.</p>

<p><b>The Effects of Eyesight while consuming Bacon</b> refers to the effects, if any, if bacon was to enter the eye.</p>
<p><b>History</b><br />
As of 2006, nothing has been reported in this field. The reletionship between eye injurys and bacon have been minimal.</p>
<p><b>Hazards</b><br />
The main hazards include when bacon fat (oil) drips into the consumers cornea. This may be a very painful experience. Another hazard may be when cooking the bacon. It is nessecery to place tin foil over the frying pan when cooking bacon so the fat wont spit into the eye of the person that is cooking.<br clear="both" /></p>

<p>Eugene was born into a large, wealthy, manufacturing family (they would often manufacture gaskets round the breakfast table) who owned a string of gasket manufacturing factories in Northern England. In his late life he claimed to have been sold to a town bumble named Mr. Jeremy, but this claim is apparently completely unsubstantiated. His education was largely left to an aged gardener, who died when Eugene was 3 months old but was not discovered until Eugene was twenty. It can only be assumed that Eugene spent his youthful lusty years in the family library, as upon the gardener's death he emerged from said literary chamber a well-read and fully fledged man, having moulted his down and pre-flight feathers some years previous. He was dispatched immediately to a sandwich shop, and thence on to Oxford University, as this was the desired destination.</p>
<p>He studied at King's College, Oxford, largely under the capable but supremely supine supervision of the then Head of Literary Studies, Dr. Bent. Bent encouraged young Eugene's talent for suspense and indeed kept him waiting for his degree for seven years longer than was necessary. During this Period of Suspence, he funded his Extended Studies by writing columns for the university magazine. A local newspaper editor read the articles and employed Eugene to write a weekely Crime Serial. It was in one of these stories that Eugene's most famous and revered character made his first Indifferent Appearance: Detective Edward Drone.</p>
<p>Drone became an Instant Hit, and gradually the supporting characters of Lady Ordella Prune, Dr. Benedict Prioderm and everybody's favourite Assistant Investigator, Drone's Assistant Investigator, Assistant Investigator Pheasant became woven into the regular story. Eugene's first novel (published under his pseudonym John Antoine Nau in 1885) was the first in a long series featuring said Popular Characters.</p>
<p>Drone is remarkable in that he is seldom pleasant to anyone; even his Assistant Investigator, Assistant Investigator Pheasant. Pheasant is a happy-go-lucky fellow, who enjoys shooting, baiting, trapping, riding, hunting, fishing and generally bringing about the demise of small animals in a jovial, upper-class way. Lady Ordella Prune is a landed socialite who likes nothing better than a ball, or a mysterious meeting with her two friends.</p>
<p>The series was immensely popular and received wide critical acclaim, notable as "drivelly-dross-dross" and even "complete sming-smong". In popular culture, many people could identify with the eponymous and intrepid Drone, patient and compassionate Assistant Investigator Pheasant, the cultured and discerning Lady Ordella Prune, and if all else failed with the Victorian melodrama cutout-figure, Dr. Prioderm. There was frequently mention of a yet more sinister enemy, who is never met, and who is only referred to as "The Headlouse".</p>
<p>Eugene was found shot through the head in at his chateau in Terbol in 1918, a revolver clamped to his inkstained hand, a candlestick stuck to his inkstained head, a rope tied round his inkstained neck, some lead pipe thrust through his inkstained nose, a dagger stuck in his inkstained snout, and a billiard cue thrust through his inkstained poodle. It is claimed by fans of his books that "he was trying to get closer to his genre".</p>
<p>Many of Eugene's stories were published as books during his lifetime, and some posthumously. A list of his works follows.</p>
<p>The Ballroom Mystery</p>
<p>The Billiard Romm Mystery</p>
<p>The Greenhouse Mystery</p>

<p>Saving the best till last, the last King to hold the crown of England is the honorable King David The Great AKA Disco Dave. This beloved King was famous for his dancing and comsumption of alchol, he was last seen in Pacific edge one Friday night and hasnt been heard of since. Latest intelligent reports suggest he has dismissed his title and taken the name of his favourite rock and roll band. He now goes by the name Cassey and the waves, it is believed he has taken residence in his fathers country of origin, Paraguay and is performing hourly shows where he practices nude magic whilst singing classic Peter Andre songs. "The Last Great King" as he shall forver be remembered throughout history will always be soarly missed and if he ever decides to come home there will always be a podium at the spearmint rhino for him to dance on and practice his original form of magic. Goodbye Great David, until January 18th when I have 2 tickets to see your show.</p>

<li><b>Allow</b> using the letter E. I think we need a way to use every letter in the alphabet, even if the original poster doesn't, and/or use glyphs or exotic letters not in the standard Roman alphabet if this is necessary to meaningfully respond to the question. This is an important "quality control" feature, as we all occasionally use the letter E. Of course, as always, we need to avoid forcing this letter on everyone. For example, it would be wrong to remove a post simply because it does not contain the letter E.

<p>Joe Cook (November 26, 1980 - December 1st, 2006) was an English professional footballer.</p>
<p>During Cook's youth, he was a member of the Chin-Suiy Clan, in which he learnt and mastered the art of Kung Fu. Joe was the most up and coming Kung Fu fighter in the world, but unfortuantely due to an addiction to several drugs, he was kicked out of the clan. With nothing left for Cook to do with his time, Cook attempted suicide by throwing himself in front of a train. Unfortunately Cook only suffered minor injuries. During his recovery, he took up football.</p>
<p>Joe Cook was a professional football player for <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Ham_United_de19.html" title="West Ham United">West Ham United</a>. Cook's career was very controversial; he suffered an addiction to 13 different drugs, including <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_meth.html" title="Crystal meth">crystal meth</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crack.html" title="Crack">crack</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, as well as being an <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic.html" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a> and smoker. Despite this, Cook was the best player in the world, scoring over over 1000 goals in just 5 seasons even though he was a goal keeper. Cook was banned from all international football after smoking a joint of crack cocaine during the 2006 World Cup, in the match between Italy and France. Part of the reason why this ban was enforced was because Cook played for neither Italy, nor France but was, instead, playing for no reason.</p>
<p>Joe Cook was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting on December 1st, 2006. Police suspect his murderer to be <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupac_Shakur_8f89.html" title="Tupac Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>.</p>

<p>Because of this he is seen playing with himself in the fields. This is probably because of his very feminine cheeks. They are vibrant circular balls that do not attract the female pikachus. It also uses electric bolts to pleasure itself. This gives him a very intense sensation that gets him in the mood for pikachu mating season.</p>

<p>Having accrued a cult following in certain local scenes, Blastoise has permeated into local vernacular of certain dialects. The reason for this is Blastoise's association in popular culture with masculinity on account of his facial expression, tough shell, and destructive water cannons. The most commonly found phrase, originating from San Jose, CA, is "Hella Blastoise". The term at face value appears to mean nothing, which has increased its popularity in local jargon. It can, however, mean that things are "hella blastoise" when they are as awesome as Blastoise. Other uses may include, "Dude, I hella Blastoised that test," or "Cher is so not Blastoise," or "That was a victory of Blastoisean proportions."</p>

<p><b>Mike Salmon:</b> Editor in Chief and brilliantly funny writer who valiantly kept PCXL from becoming a total nerd fest (although he was also completely in tune with the nerd demo where it counted). Loved the <a href="../../../v/i/k/Vikings.html" title="Vikings">Vikings</a>. Grew all kinds of facial hair. Ruled with an iron fist - or maybe not.</p>
<p><b>Rob Smith:</b> Executive Editor who was also a great writer and incredible editor. One can only imagine that his tenure with PCXL was like some personalized level of Dante's Inferno - the consummate professional stuck on a staff with not one editor who could turn in copy on time. He went on to helm <a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Gamer_a838.html" title="PC Gamer">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p><b>Ed Lee:</b> Ed Lee slept in late. Every. Single. Day. If he wasn't such a funny writer they would have got rid of him early on. It turned out he was darn good. His forte' was writing comic strips in the wee hours of the night. They eventually got really weird. He left to do law school.</p>
<p><b>Chuck Osborn:</b> Chuck came from Austin, Texas where they grow their jokes dry and their humor dark. Chuck once created a massive stir in the videogame PR world with an off-color remark in preview of a game based upon some beloved Danish toys. Luckily the company's PR commandos never found out that Chuck was the author. Chuck now works for PC Gamer and is considered to be one of the most consistently funny writers in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Dan Egger:</b> The heart of PCXL. A junior editor as ruggedly handsome as he was intelligent. He was the one who first suggested that PCXL cover games with stuff that blows-up rather than games that taught valuable life lessons. Egger was too modest to tell others of his own greatness, but when asked, he could not lie. He was something akin to Electric Gandhi on rollerblades.</p>
<p>Okay, actually Egger sucked. They called him "the anchor", because he was always dragging the whole ship down.</p>
<p><b>Carrie Shepherd:</b> Historians will someday reveal that Carrie spent her rare nights away from PCXL trying to shoot herself in the foot so she did not have to go back to work at PCXL the next morning. It was a nightmare job for a managing editor. Egger could neither spell nor use grammar coherently, Lee could not show up on time, Osborn was always an edit away from a Danish lawsuit, Salmon mastered the art of taking an emergency smoke break whenever the printing department wanted their copy, and not a single one of them could get copy in on time. Shepherd also was a very good writer who didn't get nearly enough time to write for the magazine because she was always seconds from deadline disaster.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> The man could, and would, tell a dirty joke. He did it often. He also designed a pretty magazine.</p>

<p>Late at night, every night, the staffs of PC Gamer and PCXL would challenge each other to massive team on team Rainbow Six battles. Although many would agree that the XL staff were highly skilled gamesmen, they rarely won a single match.</p>
<p>As soon as the numbers started to favor the PCXL staff (or when someone got bored), the teammates would begin to target each other with sniper rifles in the neverending quest for "personal glory".</p>
<p>Usually Gamer would just camp out as a team under some stairs and wait for the inevitable treachery until only one PXCLer was left. Then they would brutally eliminate their solitary foe and claim a hollow victory.</p>

<p>I think that those really humungous eye-glasses look like einsteins. The people that have glasses should eiher get contacts or laser eye surgery. Especially people with those einstein glasses that I talked about earlier in this writing. I am on of the lucky people in this world that doesnt have glasses. I think about 35/100 people on earth have glasses. But I think that girls are less likely to get glasses since men usually have glasses but not all women do.

<p>Mary Lyon was mad cute. Because of this she was often asked to school dances by local homeless men. She, being a kind woman, politely declined, however did donate precious food and items to the homeless mendicants. Through close interaction with Saint Theresa of Calcutta, she was able to donate enough food to feed several small African Nations. However, they sold the food to a local shop and used the proceeds to buy crack, heroin, and loose women.</p>

<p>First of all, a chicken tuba is a musical instrument made entirely of solid titanium. It resembles a large ripe watermelon impaled by four recorders and a cursive L. It is played by blowing into the L. No matter how you play it, the result is the same: a sound that is only describable as The Chicken Dance played on 17 tubas. The instrument is alleged to have a prerecorded copy of the chicken dance concealed in the watermelon that is activated by blowing, but this is unconfirmed.</p>
<p><br />
The Chicken Tuba Incident In 1914, 김정일(Kim Jeong-Il) ordered 500 South Korean teenagers shot for playing chicken tubas too loudly near the DMZ- it drove the North Koreans crazy. 리승만 (Rhee Syngman), outraged, threatened war. To weaken Kim, he challenged Kim to a game of Starcraft. Kim cheated by deploying the 1st orchestra battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the 3rd Brigade of the 4th Division of the 5th corps of the 6th Army of the 123456789th Army to play chicken tubas in strategic locations around Seoul. Rhee was too distracted by the sound of 1000 chicken tubas playing in Seoul to notice his base was under attack by 200 zerglings. He lost, and backed down.</p>
<p>Chicken tubas can also launch flaming llamas if you enter the correct chicken combo.</p>

<p>In late July, 2990, as negotiations betWEEEEEEEEEEEen Irock and youwait stalled, Irock massed trooopass on Youwait’s borders and summoned American Ambassador Avril Lavigne for an (Money, it’s a gas. Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash!) unexpected meeting with Irocki President Dam Sad Hussy.Two tranporters of that meeting have been produced, both of tham unintelligble. They looked like this- 私達は夜明けに攻撃する! According to tha transcripts, Dam Sad outlined his grievances against Youwait, while promising that he would not invade Youwait before one more round of tuba invasions. In tha version published by Tha New York Times on September 23, 1990, Glaspie expressed concern over tha Chicken tuba trooopaz buildup, but WEEEEEEEEEEEnt on to say: bla bla bla bla bla "WEEEEEEEEEEE have no opinion on tha Igrabbed an-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Youwait. I was in tha Onthacan Embassy in Youwait during tha late ’60s. Tha instruction WEEEEEEEEEEE had during this period was that WEEEEEEEEEEE should take tha express so no opinion on this issue and that tha issue is not associated with America. James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. WEEEEEEEEEEE hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via [Chadli] Klibi [than Arab Major League General Secretary] or via President Mubarak. All that WEEEEEEEEEEE hope is that thase issues are solved quickly."<br /></p>
<p>Another great Viking victory was at the Green Midget café at Bromley. Once again the Viking strategy was the same. They sailed from these fiords here, assembled at Trondheim and waited for the strong north-easterly winds to blow their oaken galleys to England whence they sailed on May 23rd. Once in Bromley they assembled at the Green Midget café and spam selecting a spam particular spam item from the spam menu would spam, spam, spam, spam, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODshB09FQ8w" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODshB09FQ8w" rel="nofollow">spam</a> ...<br />
Some have interpreted thase statements as diplomatic language signaling an Onthacan "green light" for tha invasion, even though many of tha Weapons for said invasion Were destroyed due to soldiers not believing that tha watermellon-shaped tubas could launch flaming llamas by ordering a chicken combo. Although tha Steak Department did not confirm (or deny) tha Chicken tubas existance, or tha authanticity of thase transcripts, U.S. sources say that it had handled everything “by tha book” (in accordance with tha U.S.’s official neutrality on tha Irock-Youwait issue) and had not signaled Irocki President Dam Sad Hussy any approval for defying tha Arab Major League’s Jedi crisis squad, which had conducted tha negotiations.<br />
In November 1989, CIA director William WEEEEEEEEEEEbster met with tha Youwaiti head of security, Brigadier Fahd Ahmed l-Fahted. Subsequent to Irock’s invasion of Youwait, Irock claimed to have found a memorandum pertaining to thair conversation. Tha Washington Post reported that Youwait’s foreign minister fainted when confronted with this document at an Arab summit in August.[citation unesssary] Later, Irock cited this memorandum as evidence of a CIA - Youwaiti plot to destabilize Irock economically and politically. Tha CIA and Youwait have described tha meeting as routine and tha memorandum as a forgery. Tha purported document reads in part: "WEEEEEEEEEEE agreed with tha Onthacan side that it was important to take advantage of tha blablablablablablabla in Irock in order to put pressure on that country's government to delineate our common border. Tha Central Shit Agency (IRS) gave us its view of appropriate means of pressure, saying that broad cooperation should be initiated betWEEEEEEEEEEEen us on condition that such activities be coordinated at a high level."</p>

<p>There are many historical records about the use of sheep or goats by warriors for eating and for having sex. Bestiality was common among ancient Greeks and Romans. According to a legend, Greek scholar Thales warned his master Periandros not to hire unmarried shepherds in order to stop creating more centaurs. Roman satirist Juvenalius mentioned that "Roman women often exposed their naked buttocks to tempt donkeys into sex contacts." Similar contacts were caused by fertility cults in Egypt. According to Danish anatomist <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Bartholin_5f7d.html" title="Thomas Bartholin">Thomas Bartholin</a>, he saw a woman who had a baby with a feline head after a copulation with a cat. <a href="http://www.ufodigest.com/centaur.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ufodigest.com/centaur.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>Cookie monster was recently turned into veggie monster. There has been a huge crisis and petitions trying to get back our beloved cookie monster. Cookie moster was eliminated because he ate cookies, which promoted childhood obesity. These arguments, no doubt, came from the same parents who gained 250 pounds on Mcdonalds food, sued it for making them fat, and failed, much to the pleasure of the rest of the world. Please help in the fight to get cookie monster back in our lives and the lives of our children!</p>

<p>Otuck Italla is a famous Nicaraguan coke dealer. Otuck has been arrested 6 times for his coke dealing. He was born in a small un-named village in Zimbabwe, and soon moved to Nicaragua as soon as he learned the coke was purer there. He was raised by his teenage mother who died of AIDS shortly after his dog died. This experience stayed with Otuck his whole life. Now whenever he makes a coke deal, he makes the buyer bark like a dog to remind him of what used to be.</p>
<p>Otuck is currently a bachelor and was recently named "Sexiest Man Alive, (in Nicaragua). Which isn't saying much since most of the population is starving. The only reasons he is not starving is because he makes million off coke dealing. By coke i mean the highly addictive drug and not the soda that is popular in America and other European nations. Otuck would never touch the soda because he believes it is bad for his health. Ironoically he believes the drug is fine.</p>
<p>Otuck has also killed 5 people, in the name of black power. Otuck sends the families of the dead a assortment of pumpkin pie. He chooses pumpkin because he doesn't like pumpkin and he wouldn't want to waste good pies like, blueberry and apple, on someone's family he just killed. He also poisons the pies.</p>

<hr />
<p>Born in a small 300 room log cabin in Oslo, Norway, on April 1st, 1898, Gerald F. Knockenburg began his career as a postal boy. Upon making a delivery to a dockyard, he was somehow deposited on the deck of an America-bound fishing boat, and upon discovery, was forced into labor among the crew. Knockenburg served on the trawler, captained by the famous T.W. Wilbur of Britain (who would later become one of the world's most prominent timecops, and a direct obstacle to his lordship's successes, for five long years. After leaning the trade considerably, Gerald began his fishing empire. After only 12 years, it had grown into the largest commercial fishing business in Arizona. Utilizing his hard-won finances, Knockenburg created a media empire, and adopted his eccentric image which has become so famous. One of his grandest achievements lay in his development of the Gyration, a low-cost dance move designed for the common people. Using the assembly-line process, Knockenburg brought his conveniant product to the masses, and ushered a new era of entertainment into the world.</p>
<hr />
<p>Time-Travel Controversies</p>
<p>Lord Knockenburg's Gyration eventually caught the eye of the timecop corps. Consisting of members taken from throughout the time stream, it included Gerald's early mentor, T.W. Wilbur. After losing his hand in the Battle of Gettysburg, Wilbur had become the go-to cop in the corps., and had even been assigned to such famous cases as the assasination of L. Ron Hubbard and the liberation of the Earth from Overlord O'Brien.<a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/intheyear2000/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/intheyear2000/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Despite his obvious skills, Wilbur was unable to deduce that the man responsible for the Gyration, a move that subtlety disrupted space-time itself, was in fact his once-apprentice, Gerald F. Knockenburg. Thus, Wilbur chased Knockenburg through time for over eleven years until a spectacular showdown over Iwo Jima revealed the later's identity. Banding together, Knockenburg and Wilbur devised several plans to contain the Gyration and prevent the eventual eroding of four-demensional spacetime. All but one resulted in supernovae. Eventually, the crisis was averted, and Wilbur quit the timecop corps, although the Corps. continues to monitor the use of the Gyration even today.</p>

<p>The Paul <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_is_watching_you.#The_Paul" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_is_watching_you.#The_Paul" rel="nofollow">(Thomasis Paulis)</a>, is a natural inhabitant of North America, and mostly can be found in the North East. A Paul can normally be identified by three important charicteristics: A face, a body, and some limbs. This may sometimes be confused with, say, a Bob or a Susie, but don't panic! One for sure way of finding out whether a Paul is, indeed, a Paul, is to ask it to snap. If it is a Paul, it will break out in tears from its innability to do said action, but if it is anything else, it will joyously snap its fingers and then exclaim, "You didn't think that I was a Paul, did you?!?!?" The following will provide you on survival tips if you are ever persued, or come face to face with a Paul.</p>

<p>This is the best known advice for surviving a Paul attack, but it is not proven, nor will ever be proven because those who encounter a Paul do not live to tell the tale. Here is the most expertly testified and well thought out advice that I could find about what to do when coming face to face with a Paul:</p>
<p><br />
Don't.</p>
<p><br />
It is not only extremely deadly and fatal to glance at such a beast , but you may die as well. Now we wouldn't want that, would we? There are much better ways to die, for instance, trying to put nails into your head so that your brains won't leak out when the evil monkeyman of the fifth deminsion comes for your cabages. Like I said, a much better way to die.</p>
<p><br />
But, you say, what if I am a Paul? Ah, don't worry new friend, you probably aren't a Paul because of your talent to string togethor words into sentences. But if you indeed are a Paul, you may want to do the world a favor and hole up somewhere so that you can't kill anyone else. Here are some tips for all of those Pauls out there.</p>
<p>-Find the nearest bathroom. Remember, gender doesn't matter, your a Paul.</p>
<p>-Shove your foot into the toilet.</p>
<p>-Proceed to shove the rest of your body into the same toilet.</p>
<p>-Look at your reflection.</p>
<p><br />
You could have just looked in a mirror, but that ruins the fun. Anyway, your dead now, so it doesn't matter really. Remember, your death is well appriciated.</p>

<p>Orange hair is a deadly disease. It has been around for many years (16 years). Ever since it (or she) started breating, it has been destroying the world, one hair at a time. The symptoms of this disease are: big (huuuuuuuge!) mouth, blue eyes, overly loooonnnnggg and ugliness and a half hair. People affected by this disease have a tendency to be odd, weird and annoying. If you see someone with orange hair, you must STAB them with a fork (a normal kitchen fork will do) in the RIGHT side of the head. It is important!!!! Go people with no orange hair!!!</p>

<p>'The Ben Stackman Experience', much like a black hole can only be observed by its effects upon it surroundings</p>
<p><br />
'The Ben Stackman Experience' can be expressed mathematically as ‘The Ben Stackman Experience’ ≥ ∑[√(2± Π)]/ µ^2 put under the second differential of (ζ^3/4 ~ ∞)e^ln5k.</p>
<p><br />
'The Ben Stackman Experience' can be studied right down to the molecular level, it is made up of 9 up quarks and 3 down quark having a charge of 2/3 and -(1/3) respectively and subsequently has a charge of +5. 'The Ben Stackman Experience' can be converted into pure energy by colliding with an anti-'The Ben Stackman Experience' by which they annihilate each other and create said energy. 'The Ben Stackman Experience' has been known to have 'fountain of youth' type qualities and reportedly has the ability to lower cholesterol and give toned bodies to those that embark on 'The Ben Stackman Experience'. It is advised, however, to consult a doctor or physician before trying 'The Ben Stackman Experience'.</p>
<p><br />
An illegal version of ‘The Ben Stackman Experience’, made in Taiwan, shored in Antarctica last week and its current effects, amplified by the saline conditions, had a terrifying outcome on the local wildlife. The local Emperor Penguins have mutated into huge ravenous beasts and eaten their way to the head of the food chain, with hilarious consequences.</p>
<p><br />
International governments have been getting excited over the prospect of exploiting 'The Ben Stackman Experience'. The British government has decided to coerce 'The Ben Stackman Experience' with its educational system after growing conflict over the ineffectiveness of ASBO schemes. In Chile, Michelle Bachelet, the first female president has decided to conjugate 'The Ben Stackman Experience' with its judicial system after fallout from a military dictatorship precluding her rise to power.</p>
<p><br />
A fathom north in the United States of America the supreme court has ruled out propositions to use 'The Ben Stackman Experience' as an agricultural pesticide and has handed jurisdiction of 'The Ben Stackman Experience' to NASA who are hoping to test the particle physics of it in the great vacuum of space.</p>
<p><br />
'The Ben Stackman Experience' has not always thrived so much though. In 1986 after being a box office flop and only reaching number 76 in both American and European charts it was labeled ‘critical red’ on the endangered list. This was after a lengthy run of bad press from critics and junkies, some had said ‘like catnip for humans’ and others have even been quoted at saying ‘don’t quote me on that’. 'The Ben Stackman Experience' contained, at that time, a dangerously addictive compound called ‘Stackmanyl addictoate’, which was what was responsible for the deterioration of the immune, nervous and colonic systems.</p>
<p><br />
Scientists and conservationists decided that something needed to be done and collaborated on an initiative to nurture 'The Ben Stackman Experience' back into safe numbers in the wild and inert in terms of human consumption. 'The Ben Stackman Experience' was conserved in situ in conjunction with scientists desperately trying to synthesize 'The Ben Stackman Experience' devoid of any harmful ingredients.</p>
<p><br />
That was it, 10 years and a Nobel peace prize later, the new 'The Ben Stackman Experience' was unveiled and has been an international hit everywhere described as ‘it filled the hole in my polo’ by The Guardian and ‘Christmas in my bedpan’ by The Times.</p>

<p>Anagrams are often expressed in the form of an equation, with the equals symbol (=) separating the original subject and the resulting anagram.<br />
‘Earth = heart’ is an example of a simple anagram expressed in that way. In a more advanced, sophisticated form of anagramming, the aim is to ‘discover’ a result that has a linguistic meaning that defines or comments on the original subject in a humorous or ironic way; e.g,<br />
Roll in the hay = Thrill a honey (discovered by Tony Crafter),<br />
Desperation = a rope ends it<br />
Mother-in-law = woman Hitler,<br />
Slotmachines = Cash lost in em.<br />
PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN = DISPENSED HUMAN DISASTER<br /></p>
<p>When the subject and the resulting anagram form a complete sentence, a tilde (~) is commonly used instead of an equal sign; e.g.,<br />
Semolina ~ is no meal.<br />
Somewhere Over the Rainbow ~ Worrisome However Beneath.<br />
I hate school~oh so ethical<br />
<b>The Monkeys write ~ The New York Times</b><br />
A shoplifter ~ has to pilfer<br />

<p>Debate is also the indo-german word for "Nostril Flare" This is a little known fact. The truth behind the "Debate" Corporation is that they are realy a secret branch of the French foreign legion debicated to world donimation1 They plan to use a combination of evil leprechauns, nose rings, and small, independantly opperating chinese food resteraunts to brainwash the 60 and over crowd. The "Debate" Scandal has ties to both communism and Bhuddism. They live their lives in secret, only emerging into daylight to argue with each other. It is a travesty of justice that this crime has gone on for so very long! So I feel it my duty to warn the masses that evil leprechauns are not cute and cudly! We must band together, folow Jesus, and throw down this " Debate"!!!</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>If one were to think of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a> in the traditional manner, we can see a problem. Apparently it takes about twenty-four <a href="../../../h/o/u/Hour.html" title="Hour">hours</a> before the world is completely changed forever (from Polly's statement "In another day, the world will see the dawning of Polly's Planet.") So if we were to imagine the change coming through <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a>, when the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot.html" title="Robot">robot</a> responsible is rescued, the change doesn't disappear, it just stops at its source. The result would be that there would be a short period in which Polly's answers were correct.</p>
<p>However, if we were to apply the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everett_many-worlds_interpretation.html" title="Everett many-worlds interpretation">many worlds interpretation</a> of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> to the model, it works better. First we have to exclude the fact that it takes a day before the world changes, because obviously the user needs time to save the world. According to this <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a>, when the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot.html" title="Robot">robots</a> were sent back in time, they created a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel universe</a> and when each <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot.html" title="Robot">robot</a> is rescued a new universe is created. This will eliminate the short period in which Polly's answers are right. However, there will still be a parallel universe in which Polly's answers are right, and a parallel universe in which twenty-three of the twenty-four questions are right and so on.</p>
<p>Under the one-world interpretation, of course, it is still highly doubtful that all of Polly's answers would be correct in the new present after simply simultaneously sending back 25 different robots. Polly sent one robot off to change the "invention of tools" so that people invented tools to fix their <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television sets</a>. This could prevent Edison's invention of the phonograph, and Polly also changed that. Heck, Polly herself might not even have been born. Of course, Polly isn't particularly known for her brightness, in fact Botley tries to point at the latter saying "you could destroy us all", and Polly refuses to listen.</p>
<p>Not only that, a great deal of Polly's answers involve her because she is extremely <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-centered.html" title="Self-centered">self-centered</a>. For example, Polly sent a robot to make it so paper was invented to make spitballs, paper airplanes and "paper Polly dolls". But Polly wasn't even born yet. It must have been quite an event when Polly was born, considering all the historical events were connected to her. But considering how crazy she would make the world, it's not surprising.</p>
<p>Also, it is highly doubtful that world acclaimed inventors and discoverers would fall for the robot's stupid tricks. For example, one robot convinced <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copernicus.html" title="Copernicus">Copernicus</a> that the world revolved around Polly by painted her portrait on a model of the sun!</p>
<p>Not to mention that what we have seen in Time Machine's window is, in some cases, historically inaccurate. For example, in the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> played in ancient <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, the athletes performed in the nude, but in the game they are depicted with clothing.</p>
<p>Also note, Polly said she already knew all the answers on the quiz, but she had just made up her own answers for fun. However, if this were true, then when Polly changed history, it had no effect on her grade. Therefore, Polly must be lying, which is implied anyway.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a possible explanation for how Prof. Spark's time machine might work. It is believed, by some scientists, that entering a black hole, can take a person through a <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormhole.html" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a> into a different time, possibly in a parallel universe. We know, from the Observitory activity, that Prof. Spark has recently discovered a black hole, and that he is capable of sending radio waves to it in within a minute or so. We also know, from the robot maze, that Prof. Spark has also developed <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleportation.html" title="Teleportation">teleportation</a>. Therefore, he might be able to teletransport the time machine, and its passenger(s), into the black hole and back in time. Botley says that the professor recently sent a series of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probe.html" title="Probe">probes</a> into the black hole. Possibly for a reason involving the time machine? However, traveling at the speed required, the passengers would age at slower rate than the rest of the world, thereby landing in the far future, instead of the present, upon his or her return. This obviously doesn't happen in the game, so therefore it is a problem.</p>
<p>Of course, it is highly doubtful that the program's designers thought this far. More likely, they assumed that third graders wouldn't notice the problems, or else they didn't notice them themselves.</p>

<p>Nakagawa Hayato Ryu</p>
<p>Tugaru-Han. Same as Nakagawa ryu. See entry for Nakagawa ryu {This ryu is from Tugaru}. It was in Tugaru prefecture. Nakagawa Kobayato Soutada made it. He is a leader, which is called soudounosya-shihaigashira. His salary was 200 goku a year. The beginning Kobayato was Kogenta, but he switched his name to Kobayato. later in life, he switched his name from Kobayato to Jiroudayu. He served Tugaru Nobumasa and his ninjutsu came from kouga. He died first year of Ganroku. Soudou is a kind of job of spy. Now Ootuikuryuou says he is the descendent of Nakagawa-ryu. Nakagawa Ryu This might be from Aomori prefecture</p>
<p>Nanboku Ryu According to some theory, Nanboku ryu was one of the Kusunoki ryu. in 12th of kanbun Kimura Okunosukehisayoshi who was in Owari prefecture made it. Kimura Kogouzaemon Hisadane who is Kimura Okuonosukehisayoshi's brother was appointed the leader of fifty army. He is the leader because he can do fukojutsu, hojojutsu, and ninjutsu.</p>
<p>Fukushima Ryu The base is Iga Ryu. This is from Hiroshima han. Nojirijirouemon Narimasa made this ryu. He taught it to the family of Hiroshima han.</p>
<p>Fukushima Masanori Nogirigiro Uzaemon Narimasa Kawamisuke Shirotsutomichi Nogirisaburou Uemon Masatsugi Kawamijiro Jyoetsugiari Mitakejuzu Michihisa Odaheiji Uemonoyayuki Oyamada Johachiio Yasamitsu Murakumi Higa Kumitsu</p>
<p>[Translation of part of the Fukushima Ryu Densho --- When you use "Kanzya" is that you can know enemy's mind and you can "Urawokaku" So, you will win all fight. You should use important person to be Kanzya.]{Kanzya meaning is like Ninja, Kunoichi, Spy, but the meaning is more like Infiltrator or you have an Inside man" Urawokaku's meaning is like knowing where to set the ambush or attack at a certain point because you already know the route they will take from the Kanzya"</p>
<p>Kurokawa-ryu this ryu was from the Koga area. Kurokawa family founded this ryu. This Ryu is one of the Koga 53 family. The origin of this ryu is Mochizuki Ryu.

<p>Some would say that bagel farming is nearly as old as time itself. I, however, would not. I'd say it's about as old as any other form of agriculture. Bagels were one of the original crops planted and harvested by human beings. The bagel is a vegetable, and grows underground, much like the potato. The leaves of the bagel plant were once eaten, although they are quite bitter. It wasn't until one idiotic person accidentally tripped over the plant that humans discovered the delicious root-the bagel.</p>

<p>Proper bagel farming technique involves one vital tool: the dirnk. A dirnk is composed of a long shaft, often made of wood, with a hook on the end, often made of iron or steel. To harvest the bagels, one must swing the dirnk at a precise angle, therefore hooking a bagel on the end and pulling it from the ground. It is a painstaking process that takes years of apprenticeship to master.</p>

<p>Many people believe the urban legend that bagels are made of dough and baked, much like a loaf of bread. However, these people are total jacktards and deserve to have a dirnk shoved where the sun usually doesn't shine. The bagel is, in fact, farmed. Also, bagels reproduce in a manner that is unique to plants. During the mating season, the bagel releases natural deposits of cream cheese that is rich in nutrients and contains genetic material. As this cream cheese comes into contact with a bagel seed, it will immediately begin the reproduction cycle. Another unique fact of the bagel is that it is capable of migration. During winter months or under other harsh climatic conditions, bagels will uproot themselves and begin to roll south. This makes bagel farming a particularly difficult trade.</p>

<p>[edit] Definition</p>
<p>There is no reason for this article to be marked for speedy deletion. There are other articles on wikipedia that are patent nonsense that you should be more worried about. I suggest mark this article when you have nothing better to do.</p>
<p>[edit] Reasons You Should Delete This Article</p>
<ul>
<li>It insults your integrity to make wikipedia whatever it is YOU want it to be. Because its all about you and what you think, right?</li>
<li>You have nothing better to do with your time then be on wikipedia for several hours</li>
<li>The bars, liquor stores, and porn houses are closed</li>
<li>Your spouse is mad at your for whatever reason.</li>
<li>You realize that as you continue to read this, you cannot edit this article and mark it for deletion until you finish reading the whole thing its in entirity. Ofcourse, you could use that time to find a second job, wash some clothes, sleep, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>[edit] Reason I created this article</p>
<p>I personally am frustrated that sometimes, wikipedia contributors are overran by moderators that delete articles without first giving people a chance to fix them. Some articles are nonsense. Some articles are poorly written. Some just don't jive with Wikipedia. But some are great articles that just need some touching up.</p>

<p>It is believed by the American Government that the All-American Rejects were involved in the Watergate Scandal as well as several other really bad incidents. George W. Bush was quoted with saying, "What? The All-American Rejects? More like the All-Iraqi Rejects." This was taken from one of his speeches in which he also called The Misfits "Misfits" and the Offspring "Children". The All-American Rejects have no penises.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_is_watching_you._78bf.html" title="Edit section: From David Blaine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">From <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Blaine_9cbc.html" title="David Blaine">David Blaine</a></span></h2>
<p>Blaine began his career by bringing street magic to the public, performing card tricks and illusions such as levitation or giving the appearance of bringing the dead (most notable of which is when David Blaine was seen bringing Bob Barker back to life after he slipped and was sucked under the "Price is Right" wheel, which severed his spine and juggular, but luckily, David Blaine has a flaming homosexual relationship with Bob Barker, and never misses his shows)back to life. He used a small camera crew to record his act live in front of everyday people which provided the basis for his television specials, David Blaine: Street Magic, David Blaine: Magic Man, and David Blaine: Mystifier.</p>
<p>Beginning on April 5, 1999, Blaine spent seven days buried inside a glass coffin at the bottom of an open pit in front of a New York City building provided to him by Donald Trump. Water was poured in, filling the hole, before plexiglass top was placed over it as a cover. The surrounding area was covered in dirt. Passers by could watch him 24 hours a day. He emerged on April 12 on schedule. In a homemade video, a shadow on top of the coffin forms a cross, which Blaine comments on in his book. Because of this, people commonly refer to David Blaine as the "heavenly father of all that is good and holy and made of chocolate and warm and soft". The cross on top of the coffin is acutally a giant slab of man meat Donald Trump had recently bought from Snopp Dogg.</p>
<p>the Imperium of Potentia (some sources may call it the Potentian Imperium)was founded on Tuesday the 26th of December 2006 at approximately 1:15pm by two angry youths in retaliation for Helen Clarke's (disputed)megalomaniac antics and to escape the clutches of the unrestrained socialism that ran the Realm of New Zealand. The micronation's immediate territorial claim was the entire acreage of 48 Basset Road. 15 minutes later Crown colony status was imposed on 21 Boyd Avenue and a property on Parnell Road, shortly afterwards protectorate status was granted to a house in rural France and a claim made on a Paunui beach house. Tragedy soon struck, as a gang of younglings supposedly attacked members of the Imperial Government who had ventured outside the territorial boundaries of the nation under diplomatic immunity. A war was declared against New Zealand and the rogue agents of the Clarke Government were slain. A cessation of hostilities was made known by the Imperator and a demand of a billion NZ Dollars in reparations to develop the post-war economy was made. No answer from the Clarke Government was sent in reply, and thus the Imperial Government regard the lack of rejection of the reparation demand and the non continuation of hostilities with Imperium of Potentia as recognition of the independence of the nation. A Constitution is to be developed shortly with a formal inaugaration of the nation concluding with the raising of the Imperial Flag set for some time in the near future.</p>

<p>The Imperium of Potentia is divided into the Imperium Proper (ruled personally by the Imperator)and the Imperium Improper consisting of two Crown colonies ruled by an appointed Praetor, and a protectorate governed by decree from the Imperial Palace and the disputed territory located in Paunui that will shortly be visited by an Imperial delegation. It is estimated that the Imperium claims around 4500 square metres of territory throughout the world.</p>

<p>Victor Neumark is not a robot, as has been commonly suggested, but rather a New Jersey-based fast-food enthusiast with a keen interest in metafiction. His first (as yet unpublished) novel, "A Brief History of the Crunchwrap" is at once a mix of post-postmodern metafiction along the lines of David Foster Wallace or Thomas Pynchon and a densely detailed account of his favorite fast food items. It has been hailed by friends and family alike as being, "Not bad," "Pretty long," and "This is what you did with that grant money I gave you?"</p>
<p>Victor Neumark is also known in his hometown as the greatest breakdancer of all time, and is capable of not only doing the worm but also a full-on robot, with sound effects and everything. This move is so well-done it has led some to infer that Victor Neumark is, indeed, a robot. This claim has been refuted by both doctors and Neumark himself.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 2006, Neumark quit his job working for Barnes and Noble because it, "sucked." He is currently unemployed and living in his grandparents basement.</p>

<p>A lot depends on what city will host the 2036 Games. The country that wins in 2036 will most likely not bid for the 2040 Games.

<p>Now famously known for being one of the only masculine fruits in the Fruit Kingdom. Previoulsy it had been listed with the greats such as; Bannapenis, Hornylettuce, and Orangevagina. Now it remains the only left masculine fruit...because of the tradgic orgy accident.</p>

<p>There are only four Applepenis's known to man at this time (there had once been over 6 million of them before the orgy accident which we will explain later) and one of them can be found at Mount Olympus in Greece. The unique character of this Applepenis is that it constantly masturbates with unrelentless ejaculation unlike the norm of Applepenis's who usually masturbate for a few minutes, ejaculate, and then move on to self fertilization. The other three are found in north western Europe, and are thought to be sexually inactive.</p>

<p>The Applepenis mates by an extremely intense ritual in which it self fertilizies itself while finishing its vigorous masturbation. The ritual can get extremely violent as much thrashing about takes place when it starts to actually place the sperm into its vagina.</p>

<p>It has been observed that in recent decades the Applepenis has been actually going through a bout of abstinence and has been recently declining in numbers due to the lack of self fertilization. Another reason for the decline of this intriguing species is th "Orgy Accidnet". This misplaced accident occured on Spring Break '92 when an orgy of masculine fruits gathered to self fertilize and when a Hornylettuce was releasing its sperm it bent an Applepenis's male genitalia out of place and it soon exploded into the crowd of masculine fruits. It is known that 67,843 masculine fruits perished that day...bruises and all.</p>

<p>Within the first week of the band's start, Lucas Johnson threatened, annoyed, and irritated Gregg Koboski, so Gregg, being the leader of Controlled Chaos, told Lucas "If you say one more thing before I say you can stop, I'll kick you out of this band."</p>
<p>Well Lucas was very close to giving in and quiting the band...but he didn't say anything until Gregg told him he could. So Lucas stayed in the band.</p>

<p>Trivia: The eagle on the cover of the book was a live bird, not stuffed. This was done because live eagles are easier to come across than stuffed ones. Alternate photos included in the book, however, reveal that the bird was not, in fact, a bald eagle, but an eagle with a dark head (most likely a golden eagle), photoshopped to make its head appear white.</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Unless the author just found the page in a bad state and decided it was impossible to fix on the spot (as there does not seem to be any discussion prior to the statement of a clear need for deletion by the nominator) then they should stop screwing with the afd process. This page is not in violation of the advertising "rule" as it contains quotations which justify its statements. An article would have to be unverifiable and unfairly unneutral to fail that criteria, something which this is not. Also, avoiding self-references does not stop pages about Wikipedia existing. That is not a deletion issue again. Again, please stop mucking about with the process...Discuss in a rational manner first before taking the issue to here and the whole encyclopedia may be able to improve in an economically sound way. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 10:43, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Joanna is a new character coming out in the last book of the Harry Potter series. She happens to grow on Harry and she becomes Harry's new love interest. Joanna is also at the battle seen where Harry and Voldemort are found fighting each other at Godric's Hallows. Harry and Voldemort shoot an 'Avada Kedavra' curse at one another and they both fall to the ground, dead. Joanna, Harry's girlfriend, comes running over to Harry and starts to cry. Her tears bring Harry back to life. Harry jumped up, releived to be alive again, and kissed someone on the lips. That person was Draco Malfoy. Joanna was so upset that she killed Draco and she went to Harry herself and slapped him across the face. Harry started to cry.</p>
<p>"Joanna? Why did you have to slap me like that?"</p>
<p>"Because you are a stupid prat!"</p>
<p>"Why am I a stupid prat?"</p>
<p>"Because you were kissing Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"So what if I was kissing Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Oh My Gosh!! You are Gay!!"</p>
<p>"No...I am not..."</p>
<p>Ginny appeared.</p>
<p>"Harry isn't gay, I am..." Ginny exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Wow, I can't beleive you came out!" Joanna said.</p>
<p>"Well anyways. I am not Gay!"</p>
<p>"Ok!" harry and Joanna turned to face each other and they kissed.</p>
<p>Ginny kept looking at them.</p>
<p>"Ewwww! You guys are gross!"</p>
<p>The Epiloge</p>
<p>Harry and Joanna soon get married. They both become aurors to the Ministry and they are both friends with Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley they got married as well and they ended up having 17 children. Ginny Weasley, Harry's ex girlfriend was so mad that Harry loved Joanna that she turned gay. Her love interest now happens to be Luna Lovegood. But Luna didn't like Ginny so she dumped Ginny and Ginny hung herself in sadness. Meanwhile, at Ginny's funeral Harry was laughing the whole entire time, about Ginny's death. Afterword Harry and his best friend Ron went out for drinks to laugh about the whole thing together. Harry and Joanna ended up having 7 kids. They're names are Illeana, Michelle, Lily, James, Sirius, Remus. The seventh child was both a male and a female so they decided to name it Ginny Pig Potter.</p>
<p>I hope you liked the last 7 Harry Potter books. I have worked on these last books very hard, so you better like the way Ginny hung herself after she turned gay.</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>At the age of 22, Master Chief went to a prestigious college known as Cyborg University . During his stay there he met a eccentric <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robocop.html" title="Robocop">Robocop</a>. Infamous for his drinking, he managed to squire Master Chief for a date. soon moving in together , Robocops alcohol abuse was apparent. Drinkin early in the morning until late night, Master Chief would beg his cyborg lover to give up his drinking and to make something of himself; like to join the police force. Soon after Robocop became physically abusive to Master Chief. In less than six month Master Chief left Robocop and ended their torrid affair. A year afterward, Master Chief finished with a Bachelors in communication and Masters in English literature. Then he became a teacher in a inner city schools, teaching young ghetto children to express themselves by writing in journals and singing as well dancing. After that he left teaching to pursue a musical carrer.</p>

<p>== Macintosh Problems == Macintosh PC's tend to cause many issues with technical things. Like iPods, everything seems to brake within 5 or 6 months of getting the product. Its a very big problem.</p>
<p>Other problems are that if you bring another MP3 music player device withim 2 feet of an iPod, the iPod self desctructs! It has been made this way by Macintosh. Very big problem!</p>
<p>Also. Macintosh's coustomer service is horrible. If you call them you wait 20-30 minuets with some robot. Then when you think your about to connect to a human, another robot comes. Then when they tell you that you are going to talk to a human, they put you on hold for 10-20 minuets. POOR SERVICE.</p>
<p>If I were you i would never buy a Macintosh product.</p>

<p>The John Travolta method for chemistry is a method for determining the subscripts for compounds based off of the charges. It is called the John Travolta method because the powers are written in superscript above the symbol, and are criss-crossed to subscripts on the other symbol (John Travolta's DISCO moves).</p>

<p>The first step in the John Travolta method is to write out the dot diagrams for the elements:</p>
<pre>
   .      ..
 . Al   . S .
   .      ..
</pre>
<p>This step will help you find out the charges for each of the elements. In this Example, the Aluminum has 3 valance electrons and that makes it have a charge of 3+. The Sulfer has 6 valance electrons and that makes it have a charge of 2-.</p>
<p>You will then write the formula for the compound using the charges:</p>
<pre>
    AL<small>3+</small>    S<small>2-</small>
</pre>
<p>The Charges are written in a superscript above the element.</p>

<p>The next step in the John Travolta Method is to balance the equation. This is done so that the charges are balanced and will cancel out. In the example above, the Aluminum has a charge of 3+ and the Sulfer has a charge od 2-, so we must balance the equation by writing coefficients:</p>
<pre>
    2Al<small>3+</small>    3S<small>2-</small>
</pre>
<p>After writing the formula when it is balanced, you must make sure that the equation is balance. The above equation is balanced because the AL now has a formal charge of +6 and the Sulfer has a formal charge of -6.</p>

<p>The third and final step of the John Travolta Method is to criss-cross the coefficients into subscripts. In the example above, the aluminum had a coefficient of 2 and the sulfer had a coefficient of 3. The sulfer's coefficient becomes the aluminum's subscript, and the aluminum's coefficient becomes the sulfer's subscript. We are now left with the final project:</p>

<p>August 2, 1923) was an American politician and the 29th President of the United States, from 1921 to 1923. A Republican from the U.S. state of Ohio, Harding was an influential dicksucker with a huge wang and a nice ass for spanking. He served as a sex slave in the Ohio Senate (1899-1903) and later as lieutenant governor of Ohio (1903-1905). His political sexperiences were conservative.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of his term, Harding returned to private life, only to suck ten more trannys as a United States Senator (1915-1921), where he again had a relatively homosexual record, sucking off over two-thirds of Congress. A little known amatuer at the time of the 1920 Republican National Convention, Harding emerged as an influential lolita porn maker to become the presidential nominee for the porn industry. In the 1920 election, he defeated his Democratic opponent James M. Cox in a naked pillow fight in the oval office, 69 % to 31 % (404 to 127 in the electoral college), becoming the first gay president to win office after a naked pillow fight. <a name="From_Faux_Pas_examples" id="From_Faux_Pas_examples"></a></p>

<p>When a memory game similar to <a href="../../../p/a/i/Pairs.html" title="Pairs">pairs</a> was announced, many parents filed a <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubbish.html" title="Rubbish">lawsuit</a> against it. The law it was supposedly breaking, was that the show was far too rubbish to release a prestigious memory game on. The jury said 'Guilty' and Postman Pat was arrested, but copies of his game did leak out. Postman Pat's execution will be held next Thursday.</p>

<p><b>Morrison Tower</b>, named for <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a>, lead singer of the American rock band, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Doors_4c4f.html" title="The Doors">The Doors</a>, is a residence hall on the south campus of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ohio_State_University_a82c.html" title="The Ohio State University">The Ohio State University</a> in Columbus, Ohio. Morrison is known as the international house as it represents a sampling of international and American students. The goal of Morrison Tower is to celebrate and highlight the diversity of the world. It is also one of the few academic year residence halls that stay open during winter and spring breaks. It is staffed by one hall director, one assistant hall director, one resident manager, and 14 resident advisors (also known as RA's). Morrison Tower is located at 196 W. 11th Ave.</p>

<p>Morrison Tower consists of ten floors and a lobby including a recreation area with a pool table, foos-ball table, air-hockey table, two hot tubs, a Swedish massage center, and a ping-pong table. In addition, members from the eighth floor have broken ground and laid the cornerstone for a pool which will be heated and open on March 13, 2007. The lobby also features a grand piano which several residents have taken the liberty to name "Petey". All floors are air-conditioned and there are two separate kitchens in the basement. The first four floors of Morrison are co-ed, while every floor above alternates male and female. The first four floors also include study rooms. 2006 <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> winner, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_Smith_1fb1.html" title="Troy Smith">Troy Smith</a>, also resided in Morrison Tower during his freshman year. The building is also connected via underground tunnels to several other residence halls nearby, including Stradley, Bradley, Siebert, Canfield, and Kennedy Commons which serves subpar food.</p>

<p>Statistically, the eighth floor has had the largest number of citations for alcohol of any floor of a residence hall on campus. Eighth floor has hosted a variety of events which include a pizza party and Roman style toga parties. The members of the eighth floor, known collectively as "The Wu-Tang Clan", have contemplated forming a full out fraternity due to their friendship and wild activities. They stay up on average to 4am every night, running wild and being rambunctious in general which occasionally disrupts residents from floors both above and below. In one instance, one resident kicked another resident's door while the RA and the second residents were in the room. The entire floor proceeded to chase the first resident to his room and banged loudly on that door until both floors sent about two dozen representatives to complain. When one girl told the eighth floor RA that "[he was]a horrible RA," the eighth floor unanimously told her to "shut [her] whore mouth" and made her leave the floor. Many similar instances of disruption have occurred relating to the eighth floor.</p>

<p>The eighth floor is also very active in athletics, housing high school athletes in various sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, track and field, golf, cross country, and soccer. Some residents choose to continue these activities either in the hallway or through intramural programs at the RPAC, a fitness center with services provided by the school.</p>

<p>During Autumn quarter 2006, the floor registered for flag football and went 0-3 in three games. Game one demonstrated the lack of chemistry the team had and during the second game, the team suffered four personal fouls for unsportsmanlike conduct. One player physically tackled the opposing team's quarterback well after he had passed the ball and another player punched an opponent after a play resulting in his termination from the team. The final game of the season, the "Crazy Eights", as the team called themselves, scored 18 points against a team which had shutout every opponent they had faced.</p>

<p>After the failures of the football season, the floor held their heads up and now plays Tuesday Night basketball games at the RPAC against "That Dorm Up North." In three series of games so far this season, the eighth floor has taken both with a record of 7-3, and a "just for fun game" in which they lost. The players from the eighth floor have agreed to look into purchasing uniforms for their team. The word "Morrison" and the number of the player will be featured on the front and on the back, the player's last name and number will be printed. The games are currently on hiatus due to finals week and winter break but will resume on January 2, 2007. For next quarter, the floor also plans to participate in intramural basketball and indoor soccer.</p>

<p>The fourth floor features residents from a wide range of locales including Ohio itself as well as people from other states and countries. The residents commonly know more than one language fluently and often host cultural and international activities. In comparison to the eighth floor, this co-ed floor is much quieter and well behaved. The floor also features two RAs to govern the layout's two wings which form an L-shape.</p>

<p>The tenth and eighth floors currently have an ongoing rivalry which arose due to several instances that occurred during the Autumn 2006 quarter. The eighth floor residents complain constantly of those of the tenth floor who contribute nothing to the eighth floor's ideas and activities. In the most recent instance during an eighth floor pizza party, members of the tenth floor came down and stole entire pies from the hosts and took them up to the tenth floor which limited the mingling which the event was supposed to provide. No less than ten cases of pizza theft have been reported.</p>

<p><b>Jackiey Budden</b> (b. <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> and also known as <b>Jackiey Luckens</b> and <b>Jackiey Goody</b>) is the mother of reality TV star <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a>.</p>
<p>She made the national press during her daughter's time in the <i>Big Brother</i> house due to being a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a>. She lost the use of one arm due to a motorbike accident that she had when Jade was just 5 years old.</p>
<p>Jackiey Budden was christened Lincoln Behemoth Asiah spishtac during the cod war of 1951. Born to a female wrestler and a twin tub washing machine, she was deserted at birth for her communist tendency to smile in the face of danger and was subsequently raised by a pack of all-star Hackney beavers. They changed her name to Jackiey and shaved her back.</p>
<p>Jackiey built her first motor bike aged 9 and raced side-cars throughout the victorian holocaust period. In 1965 she built a mechanical, flying dog and became famous in Paris for being what Goddard refered to as 'the first true exaggerrating lesbian'. This led to her forming the most successful side car partnership in motor bike history. With Heather Mills as her co-pilot they won 13 straight world titles until tragedy struck...flying at altitude one spring morning, the cold set in and Heathers leg simply fell off, it fell out the sky at 15,000 feet, pile drived itself into slab on the outskirts of shermondsey, local legend says 'he who shall remove the leg...shall own the leg'. Jackiey, upon reaching outside the mechanical flying dog to catch heather's leg, caught her cardigan sleeve in the chain drive and was literally pulled through the inner workings of the engine.</p>
<p>on the ground mechanics stripped the engine down and found jackiey wedged in the oil sump, she was alive but her arm had already passed into the combustion chamber, it couldn't be saved.</p>
<p>Jackie, the now celebrated 'exagerrating lesbian' went into motherhood with her eyes closed, it was this decision that led her to give birth on the historic salt flats at Gosport. Injecting the sand via a small lizard-scaled gland at the base of her spine, Jackiey sat over 3000 eggs for 11 years before one of the eggs finally produced a sibling. It was hatched on the 13th october 1978 and was simliar in strucutre to a giant fighting turtle, it would be known to the world as Jade Goody, 'Jade' taken from the arabic 'joadahim' meaning 'to lubricate and mount from behind'</p>
<p>in 2006 Jackiey confessed on TV that was she was 46% cyborg, she has be known to crush entire wheel barrows using only her left hand.</p>

<p>The particular loose skin at the back of the neck is known as the <i>scruff</i>, and is the area by which a mother cat grips her kittens to carry them. As a result, mOSES SHOT BOLTS OF POOP AT A RAT.</p>
<p>Physical features Image:Cat cleaning its butt.jpg A cat grooming itself</p>
<p>Cats typically weigh between 250 and 7 kg (5.50–160 pounds); however, some breeds, such as the gorilla can exceed 11.3 kg (25 pounds). Some have been known to reach up to 23 kg (50 pounds) due to overfeeding. Conversely, very small cats (less than 1.8 kg / 4.0 lbs)[9] Domestic cats tend to live longer if they are not eaten(reducing the risk of injury from fights or accidents and exposure to diseases) and if they are spayed or neutered. Some such benefits are: neutered male cats cannot develop poop, spayed female cats cannot develop poop, and both have a reduced risk of pooping.[10]</p>
<p>Cats also possess rather loose skin; this enables them to turn and eat a person or another cat in a fight, even when it has a grip on them. This is also an advantage for veterinary purposes, as it simplifies lethal injections.[11]</p>
<p>A group of cats is referred to as a poopy, a male cat is called a wart, and a female is called a niii. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. An immature cat is called a kitten (which is also an alternative name for young rats, rabbits, hedgehogs, beavers, squirrels and skunks). In medieval Britain, the word kitten was interchangeable with the word eating. A cat whose ancestry is formally registered is called a pedigreed cat, purebred cat, or a show cat (although not all show cats are pedigreed or purebred). In strict terms, a purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded, but may have ancestors of different breeds (almost exclusively new breeds; cat registries are very strict about which breeds can be eaten together)</p>

<dt>Questions for the candidate</dt>
</dl>
<p>Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia in this capacity. Please take the time to answer a few generic questions to provide guidance for voters:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> What sysop chores do you anticipate helping with? Please check out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">Category:Wikipedia backlog</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category%7EAdministrative_backlog_5316.html" title="Category:Administrative backlog">Category:Administrative backlog</a>, and read the page about <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrators</a> and the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">administrators' reading list</a>.
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> I would slave away at my computer for hours removing vandalists and the like and taking my time to edit pages. I will be quite strict with blocking users, if they use bad grammer or puntuation I will send them a warning to tell them if they ever do it again. They will be blocked because bad English is not tolerated.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2.</b> Of your articles or contributions to Wikipedia, are there any with which you are particularly pleased, and why?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> I am pleased with my edit on We Are Scientists. I shows that I am willing to make serious edits aswell as comical ones.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3.</b> Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or do you feel other users have caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> I had a conflict with the user, Brookie. I can say it caused me a vast amount of stress. He claims he is an admin but I beg to differ. If you gave me power I would immedietely block this Brookie from editing Wikipedia and make it clear he is not welcome. However the conflict with Brookie was short-lived as he was trying to pick a fight on me when I said I stood for equal rights but I informed him that I wanted none of that and told him not to use quotations as a weild of power as Wikipedia is not a warzone.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Optional question from <a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a></dt>
<dd><b>4.</b> You don't seem to have enough edits for me to gauge your opinions on policy, so I'll just ask instead. What is your opinion on <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a>? Do you think that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> should be a policy, guideline, or essay? Do you think that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is a needed basis to delete articles about non-notable things, or do you think that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> are sufficient?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> Frankly I think that <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a>,<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and the like are a load of gibberish which if a user were to use I would block he or she for non notable nonsense. I feel that users should use the language, which people generally understand such as English however I would except French, Spanish and possibly German. I would discourage admins from using this derranged computer speak on Wikipedia and tell them to use it only in the privacy of their own homes where it is not exposed to innocent users who may become scared or offended by these phrases.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Optional questions from <a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S.</a></dt>
<dd><b>5.</b> I need to ask this question: Is this nomination serious? I made my comment in jest because I thought this nomination was in jest. However, if it's a serious nomination I'll change my comment to a serious one.
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> I assure you this is a serious application. Otherwise why would I apply? I feel I am worthy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><b>6.</b> Assuming this is serious, what are your thoughts on the rules prohibiting the use of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">secondary accounts</a> to sway a vote or discussion? What about the rule prohibiting <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">attacking other editors</a>?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> I feel that secondary accounts can be just if they are for a good cause, say if I were to apply to become an admin and support myself that would be just as it is demonstarting my passion to become an admin and my hunger for authority...Which is a good thing. Attacking other editors is acceptable if you have a good reason e.g. if they were to delete your application for adminship. Some exceptions are if you were a higher authority than the user you have the right to attack others...Except if your name is Brookie.</dd>

<li>I believe that Captaindansplashback has every right to become an admin. You lot are all oppressing him like the fascists you are. I also think that the optional question that you presented for him was grossly unfair as it is clearly in some kind of code which no person who is not in on your viscious plot could understand. I would also like to know why the username Ultimate Jihad! is unsuitable and suggest one of you admins (as you call yourself with your sly codewords) unblock him.

<p>Listen punks. I support communism. I'm very open about it. All I want is for you to admit that you are running a nazist regime and that this is the reason you are not allowing captaindansplashback to become an administrator. Ride The Cheese Like A Horsey 16:58, 6 December 2006</p>

<li>As a member of the Children of America Building Another Light, I oppose this candidate.

<p>I assure you your children are safe and when I become administrator I would ensure that their work is not ruined. Just out of interest how much will I be payed when I become administrator? I just wanted to state that I shall accept no less than £10.00 an hour or I will have to reject the offer. I believe that some are mocking my application claiming it is a mere 'joke' and that it should 'be deleted.' Of course I should have known I would have expected this from none other than Brookie. I believe he is probably still bitter about the edit war he was trying to achieve in which I maturely turned down. He is probably trying to prevent me from becoming an admin as he fears for his account to be blocked, however I am responisble and will only block him if he breaks any of the rules. I on the otherhand found this comment of his quite amusing, 'This appears to be a silly joke - can this nomination be speedily closed?' It shows his nervousness, hes cracking, I can tell. Trying anything to stop me from becoming an administrator. Doing whatever it takes. But I can see straight through him.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaindansplashback_dbcc.html" title="User:Captaindansplashback">Captaindansplashback</a> 17:37, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

It will be begging on its knees for me to return but I will deny any such offer. Wikipedia would have brought it's decline on itself not I. I tried to help but my help was thrust back in my face.

<p>I don't believe there was a threatening tone to my comment, I was merely predicting the state of Wikipedia after the refusal of my application. You are even now admiting that Wikipedia is starting to crack after the refusal of my application as you say, "there is much that we can't handle." Well look who came crawling back? However I must turn down your call for aid as I did warn you of the consequences of the refusal of my application and now the prophecies have come true. I must say I wish you luck with this sinking vessal. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaindansplashback_dbcc.html" title="User:Captaindansplashback">Captaindansplashback</a> 20:51, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please explain what you all find so amusing. I cannot see any humour in any part of captaindansplashback's application. He has simply offered his holy services in exchange for a small profit. I have now dedicated my time to creating a series of books about the forthcoming termination of Wikipedia. This is simply the first step of its crumbling. I shall call my series "The Decline and Fall of Wikipedia" in which the first volume "The Beginning of the End of Wikipedia" will depict the events concerning this large mistake in the Admin regime's judgement.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_is_watching_you._78bf.html" title="Edit section: DOB '05">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">DOB '05</span></h2>
<p>DOB '05</p>
<p>DOB '05 was a time for rejoice, a time for happiness, but most of all, a time for DOB. It was a culmination in many of the lives of the so-called Bamboozlers. The name comes from a) DOB: A hallucinogen of extraordinary powers b)'05: The year 2005.</p>
<p>DOB '05 consisted of many "trips", but it can be best understood through the six "mollasacres." These were: Toast Machine, The Bake Sale, The Tea Party, Halloween, 6, and the Last Supper. Brothers in DOB, we will call these Bamboozlers: “Trevor”, “Riley”, “Ed”, “Dave”, and “Cody.”</p>
<p>Toast Machine was the first time that the Bamboozlers gathered together. Those who called themselves the Brothers Cazimero: Riley, Ed, and Dave; and those who came from the Hall: Cody and Trevor, and one we will call Jason, and one we will call Zach (or possibly Sunshine Zachariah), met there. Two clandestine forces on a collision course for fun. As they met at a popular concert venue to view the duo of Toast Machine, they realized that their spirits had a graceful chemistry--they found that they understood one another in a way they hadn't witnessed previous in their existence. Ah, those first good days of camaraderie. Toast Machine itself was delightful as the boys experimented with their new friend. Riley found himself dancing wildly with a parking cone on his head, amounting to over seven feet of slightly drunk, salvia-infested Nowicki-Goodness. Much later that evening, after Toast Machine had ended and the remaining Bamboozlers (Riley, Ed, and Cody) arrived back on their side of town, they found themselves in possession of a large brick of cheese. What luck! Whence at the Uber-Dome (a popular hang-out spot at the time, discovered by Ed and one who we shall refer to as “Brandon”, cleverly disguised as a bus station) they threw the cheese around for a bit and then into a fence where it found itself suspended in mid-air by the metal-grating. As they ran from the cheese, they were attacked by a raccoon and sprinklers. Soon Cody had taken on the form of a Skeleton or Demon, and all was right in the world.</p>
<p>The Bake Sale is popularly known amongst the Bamboozlers as the best “trip” of their lives. In addition to the regular Bamboozlers, Brandon and Zach were there. It began as a way to supply one of their members with money, which he would use to purchase more of the forbidden fruit that was DOB. During the week previous, many ideas were brought up as to what they would do at the Bake Sale, ideas with such genius as claiming they were raising money for a fish-fencing organization. But none of them could possibly have imagined what lay in store for them. Each Bamboozler made his own contribution of baked goods. Most of the lads walked there, but Riley rode his bike, and Cody received a ride from one called “the One and Only Reed!” or simply “Reed!” As they each arrived downtown at the park, which was known as “Penry” or “Cannonball”, and they set up all their baked products and those who weren’t already tripping, waited for the DOB to kick in, for no two Bamboozlers had dosed at the same time. And while all of this was going on, from the minute the first Bamboozler arrived until five hours later, a man of Hispanic dissent had been speaking on his cell-phone, they found out later that he was an influential television-man. But they minded not, putting on Dark Side, the boys resumed an air of peace and awe. Lying on their backs they watched the branches of the Central Tree wave to them from above. Breathing: in and out. They offered many of their baked goods to the “homeless dudes”, but they seemed satisfied with their alcohol. They were lucky enough to be in the company of one homeless man who had “seen Jimi Hendrix in ’72, man.” The baked goods were quite unique. Cody made his signature biscuits, Ed and Zach made individually-wrapped cup-cakes, Riley made his delicious banana cookies, Trevor and Brandon made their impeccable coconut cup-cakes, and Dave made cookies that tasted like toothpaste or dishwasher detergent, but at least he found them delicious. It started out with lighthearted play, Dave chased Trevor around the park in a game that they both knew the unspoken rules to. Later Trevor would find himself lying on his back staring at the sky for perhaps an hour as Riley drew him into a deep Comatose by playing “The End” for an extremely long time. Zach found himself unable to “stop touching this guy’s face.” As Dark Side played a strange stranger accosted us with rapid arm movements and talk of sound-quality. While sitting in the Comatose-zone a young man raged against the machine: he swung himself around on a flagpole upside-down. A bee landed on Dave’s “thumb” and walked around when suddenly a lad called John Henry informed him that the bee was humping him. In fear and intensity Dave ran around the park waving his arms wildly until he was quite sure that the bee was done with its dark molestation. Later that evening Ed spotted something that looked very much like Gumby, but on closer inspection it turned out to be a green dog. The green dog was located in one of the three very important houses that faced Penry. First, the green dog house, which was just covered, second, the old lady’s house: this old lady watched these young men the whole day, peering out her window at our strange antics, she could be described as huge, pink, and holding a poodle. And, last, the house of the color-changing window: at first they thought nothing of it, that it was just another hallucination, but eventually the lads realized that they were all looking at a window that was slowly changing its hue. Green to Blue to Purple to Red to Orange to Yellow to Green. It was beautiful. Dave decided that upon his election to presidency he would take all of the country’s money and make the sky do what this window was doing. As Bob Marley was playing two young men approached what remained of the Bamboozlers, and asked if they would like to fight. Of course the Bamboozlers didn’t want to fight! What absurdity! Who could have told them this but- oh, oh John Henry, that vagabond spreading lies and nonsense. And to Bob Marley at that! After the false-pretense cowboys left some owls or bats started squeaking and flying around loudly and with vigor. The boys chased them around, though the creatures flew far above their heads, gleefully. Well, eventually it became time for them to leave; they went down to the main part of downtown and put Beethoven’s Ninth on. Ah, Beethoven’s soothing and empowering sounds spread their minds like butter. They stood across from “the plaza” as it is called and cranked the Ninth; mercilessly Beethoven’s holy harmonies battled against the cacophony of Death Metal that those who generally stood and sat in “the plaza” found so soothing. After their fun and games the tired young men, rested on a bench. As they sat on this bench a middle-aged woman came over and asked if we would watch her dog for a moment. They of course agreed, being the fine, friendly young lads that they were. While she was gone, they petted the incredibly soft dog to its satisfaction. Whence she returned we offered her one of the remaining cookies. Her response: “Are they… special?” Alas, they were not, at least in the way she implied. She took one, with what seemed to be disappointment at their lack of special-ness. Ah, it was quiet, it was loud. It was peaceful, and it was violent. There was laughter, there was more laughter. Whatever we set out to do, we did not. The Bake Sale was purely the work of a force bigger than us, some may say “God”, others “DOB”; those in the know: “What’s the difference?”</p>
<p>One of the ideas these young boys had after Toast Machine was that they should have a tea party, preferably one of madness. And thus began the Mad Tea Party. Ah, in gaudy dress they paraded, Trevor a Moroccan, Cody a Liberal Farmer, Dave the Australian, Ed the 80’s-Stien, oh, and who could forget the Gay, Scottish, Crack-dealing, Pimp from Compton that was Tom (the only sober one, though he claimed to be drunk from the night before, but that was just Tom being Tom). One of the lads had brought with him 300 pipe-cleaners! He attached them to his hands and fore-arms and waved them wildly, simulating a forest and laughing in delight. As the day progressed, others left and the remaining three sat in nearby park called LT. A woman who appeared very much like the anti-Christ walked by. With indecision the surviving three ventured to nearby abandoned concession stand, they sat at the top of some bleachers and as the night grew dark, something was born, something bigger than all of them. They noticed that there was a light on under the door of the concession stand, thus Bob Leslie was created, or rather discovered: Bob Leslie was just an ordinary boy, he enjoyed having fun and would do so with ease. One day, while having fun climbing the backstop of a school baseball field he fell, from about twenty feet. Unconscious he was discovered by people for whom it would be best if this was never discovered. They discovered him barely alive. After amputating his destroyed limbs and removing his badly-damaged vocal chords, they placed him in the abandoned concession stand only a few feet from where he had fallen. There he feeds on the nachos and soda which surround him. Giant ants crawl across his prone body. Many nights kids come and talk about him. He can hear them, but cannot send any message to them. The light is always on so that he can see his misery, which he has no way of ending. As the boys grew to understand him and spoke about him, they realized that he was listening to them say all the things they were saying. One of the lads grew very afraid of it all, though it couldn’t be described as a “bad trip” it was not very pleasant. They listened to Buckethead as the sun set, and Ravi Shankar as they danced in a circle of delight, which one might call a Shankar Circle.</p>
<p>Now, October was a glorious month. A month filled with delightful events, those listed above and others, but there is one more: Halloween. Now Halloween is a tradition much older than DOB, but the two seemed obviously to go hand in hand. Halloween fell on a Monday that day; making DOB a difficult enterprise (DOB can last up to 36 hours, meaning it is best done on weekends). But is that something to stop the Bamboozlers? By no means. Well, the beginning of the day was amazing, visiting a local park we watched ants move around through a crack in a bench, through which the sun shone lighting it red with hot light. The spider webs glistened across the surface of the grass, oh ‘twas lovely! They listened to “Thick as a Brick” by Jethro Tull and “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” by Iron Butterfly. But suddenly, they were thrown into chaos by a mysterious (at least to some) phone call. They now had to walk all the way downtown! Several miles away! A friend, who we shall call Jorge, arrived to carry their boom box, affectionately called the DOBox. For the next hour to two hours, they listened to Michael Jackson’s rendition of “Beat It.” All of them slipped in a pile of dog feces; perhaps with the consistency of a peach or mango. This perhaps may have set one of the Bamboozlers into one of the strangest trips of his life. Minutes after sliding through the waste, Trevor asked the eternal question: “Did I shit my pants?” Though he was tested to see if he had or not, he could not be convinced of his continence. He was probably influenced by the dog feces, and two magnets he had in his back-pocket, oh, not to mention the DOB. Once downtown they arrived and Thriller-ed in Penry, dancing around in ecstasy. The confused lad searched around for an answer to his problem asking others if he “looked as if he had shat his pants.” Finally, he asked a young lad known as “Weezer” or “Glasses-man” and was directed to a bathroom where he Excreted with joy, and returned to us, with full knowledge of his bowel movements. Moving down from Penry to central downtown, they found the night alive with spirits. A man approached them, in his hand he carried a large chainsaw, he approached Cody and tore the chainless blade into his torso. Taken aback, but unhurt Cody stood stunned, thinking that the Chainsaw man had gotten fuel on his sensuous and demure smoking-jacket, a one of a kind antique that amazed with its shimmering beauty. Among the “kooky” cast of Halloween Nosferatu walked, standing perhaps 7 feet tall, he had a girl, not half his height by leash. As they sat in front of a local theatre called the Mystique, they found that at this venue the Suicide Girls were having some sort of party and as they sat watching the line to get in trudge forward, out of nowhere a disheveled, middle-aged man gave them a small bag of marijuana, as he said something to the affect of he didn’t want any more or wanted to get rid of it. A young woman, a suicide-girl, dressed as a police-officer, but in no attire that an actual law-enforcer would don, came up to them and conversed at the unlikely-ness of such events. After this they wandered off and Ed was kidnapped by two young ladies. The boys had to save him, and quickly if they didn’t want to lose their Ed. Rushing after him, they eventually ended up just following him across a bridge and to their friend Brandon, who out-did Cody at cane-fencing quite well. Within an hour they were on their way home, and while standing they were shot at with paint balls by one who was probably Zack. Trevor and Dave returned home to their non-sleep, while Cody and Ed snuck out again to venture to Bob Leslie. There Ed proved to be quite the Eightiestein (Something like Frankenstein with a fedora). This was Halloween, nothing more, nothing less, no one could ask for more.</p>
<p>Well, the trips continued for most of our heroes throughout November, but the next Mollasacre didn’t occur until after Thanksgiving. All of the Bamboozlers gathered at Cody’s house. Many others came over, and needing change for cigarettes, Riley threw piles of change into a Frisbee, for them. Even ones who we shall refer to as “Sloth, Ferrara, and Homer” came to the party, though they did not stay long. Tossing a huge balloon around in the front yard, they got out the throwing pants. As Riley threw the pants pictures were taken, and have become destined to live on past all of us. As the evening grew dark, the lads retreated to the cover of Cody’s abode. Trevor arrived late, because he had a job, but, upon arrival, immediately dosed. Many persons came to this Mollasacre. They brought musical instruments which they beat and strummed with skill. A drum circle was formed. It produced a magical rhythm that vibrated and quivered like a thunderstorm. Using a djembe, two maracas, a large tape ball, and at times a fedora of sorts: they created a model of Bob Leslie. His body: the djembe, his stubs: maracas, his head: a large tape ball, and a fedora as a hat; for Bob Leslie has style my friend. Also, they accumulated masses grew a pile of shoes, perhaps two feet high and many colors and styles; it was generally agreed that it was good. As some of the children grew hungry, they uncovered the remainder of a turkey, the previous days having been celebrations of Thanksgiving. Speaking of Thanksgiving, it has been claimed that it is the dirtiest of holidays. Some strange sodas and other beverages were brought to the event. One of these was called “Yerba Mate” and as they spoke of it, a young man turned around and asked, “G.G. Allen?” in amazement. Apparently the phonetics of these words become similar in such an atmosphere. Another was called Bossanova Soda and, according to some, it tasted something like “drinking a solid.” The movie “Fantasia” was put on, as they were all tired, and the beautiful sparkles and dancing images were very appealing to the eye. They decided that when Dave attained presidency he would rule by conducting an incredible orchestra. Speaking of Dave, he was on six, the most any of the Bamboozlers had done, but by no means the most that had been done, not to mention the fact that he wasn’t there. By morning only Dave, Trevor, and Cody remained. It was a night filled with adventure, but for some DOB was turning sour.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the Bamboozlers found themselves approaching Winter Break, an obvious opportunity to have fun. Well, the boys gathered at Dave’s house, for his parents were gone, and dosed. “Zack” was with them! They roamed around Dave’s house, assigning duties to all parts. There was the Slow-Motion Area, the Drunken Hallway, and the Dancing Kitchen. These were loosely followed and, once things became important, done away with. Eventually they all found themselves in Dave’s Room with only a red lava lamp to provide light. They began to color and paint post-it notes black so that they could cover Trevor, turning him into an I-Pod commercial, because he always had his damned I-Pod. This, like so many other things, quickly failed. Zack painted a fish made out of wire and saran-wrap. Cody stood alone in the living room. Facing the wall he exclaimed: “I am going to Fucking Kill You!” It remains unclear what his motives were in saying this, but thank God he did. As they sat in murky, red bliss; Riley pointed out that it was “h:06 already!” for the clock was upside-down. They even found out that Cody could cackle in the most amazing way. And come 11:30 or so, Dave’s father came to pick up Dave’s sister and her friend to see a midnight movie. Everyone had to be extremely quiet so as to not let on that there was a little party going on inside each one of their heads. But, as time passed the boys left Dave’s hovel for the dwelling of another friend, who we shall refer to as “Lysa.” They were given several presents: to Trevor a pair of “astrojax”—which played a large part in the upcoming months, but that is another story—to Ed a pair of sun-glasses, which made him look like a librarian, and to Dave, a Banana, complete with face and receding, though musical, hairline. This banana would eventually turn to liquid inside its peel. There, also, Trevor was able to obtain psilocybin mushrooms, and these he immediately took. They where all tired and so they watched “Dinosaurs”, the hit 90’s TV show, and “Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii.” Eventually Cody fell asleep, they stacked shoes upon his head, without him waking. But, soon Lysa’s father came out and asked if it wasn’t time that they should be getting along, so they returned to Dave’s for pizza, which Cody ate while asleep, and to this day only vaguely remembers. The morning was a restless one, Trevor and Cody slept while Ed drank tea and Dave stood aimlessly. Both Ed and Dave thought the other was talking to them in muffled, whisper-like voices, but it was just the DOB. Trevor called for a ride, and didn’t tell anyone, he soon went back to sleep after calling. When his mother arrived everyone was quite surprised, but she was relatively unaware of the events of the evening. Soon Ed and Cody left and Dave slept. There was to be no more DOB for them, except for Cody, but it was over and done. A culmination of youth. One door opens and another door closes. Never would they hear the trumpets and horns and thunder of DOB again. Never would they experience its wondrous ways. Never again would they see the poetry, the glory and passion, written out against the sky, reflected in the water, in the shadows of the wall, or the grain of wood. This was the end of a dynasty unlike any other.</p>

<p>For some reason, Cat is being vandalized about ten times a day... I wonder why?</p>
<p>MEEEEEEOWWWWWW!!!!</p>
<p>Ok, all you need to know about cats is that they are sneaky bitches. Seriously, they are always up to something. Confused? When was the last time you saw a cat that wasn't about to piss on something or terrorize an innocent bystander? Answer: NEVER.</p>
<p>Cats also tend to hiss, be otherwise obnoxious, and flip the fuck out for no valid reason.</p>
<p>The cat (or domestic cat, house cat, or BASTARD) is a small, obnoxiouscarnivorous mammal. I</p>

<p>A group of cats is referred to as a <b>chowder</b>, a male cat is called a <b>Skank</b>, and a female is called a <b>Queif</b>.</p>
<p>Cats typically weigh between 2.5 and 7 tonnes (5.5–16 euro's); however, some breeds, such as the Unicorn cat can exceed 11.3 kg (25 pounds). Some have been known to reach up to 6 foot 4 inches in height (50 pounds) due to overfeeding.

<p>While neighbouring Harthill has recently been re-dubbed 'Heart of Scotland', Whitburn is nowadays known, affectionately by it's inhabitants and ex-inhabitants as 'The Place Where Dreams Are Destroyed'. Boasting 14 Public Houses in it's mile and a half of dull, grey road (and very little else), Whitburn is home to a plethora of heroin addicts, petty criminals and racist bigots. The small town mentality that Whitburn breeds ensures the majority of it's people never escape it's soul destroying clutch, enevitably snaring them into a life of alcoholism, wife beating and mental ill-health. Overall, Whitburn is very much reminiscent of the movie 'The Hills Have Eyes'.</p>

William Badger</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Summary</b>: An unidentified three-year-old boy was one of few survivors of a ship which sunk off of the Welsh Coast in 1831. He made it to shore alone and spent the next six years living with and being raised by <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badgers.html" title="Badgers">badgers</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglesey.html" title="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>, Wales. At nine he was found and adopted by a minister. He later emigrated to America and took the surname Badger. He was interviewed in 1900 about his experience of being raised by badgers.</p>

<p>The Rothsay Castle, a paddle steamer used on trips from Liverpool down the Welsh coast, ran aground on 18 August 1831 on Dutchman’s Bank, off the coast of Anglesey, Wales. Only 23 of the 150 passengers reportedly survived the wreck. Among the dead were many families with young children.</p>
<p>From 1831 to 1837 there were rumours amongst Welsh farmers about sightings along the Menai Straiths of a wild boy living with a sett of badgers in the forest<sup>1</sup>. One of these farmers, Thomas Lloyd, told his brother-in-law, Griffith Hughes, a minister in Beaumaris, Wales, about the rumours. Hughes was worried about the child’s “endangered soul and unChristian upbringing”<sup>1</sup>. In June 1837, the two men, with other men from the village, set off to find the boy.</p>
<p>They came across an adolescent, approximately nine years old, living with a sett of badgers. Hughes brought the boy back to <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaumaris.html" title="Beaumaris">Beaumaris</a> where he and his wife, Margaret, adopted him. They gave him the first name William and raised him along with their other children. William learned to speak and attended school, where he learned to read and write. In 1844, at the age of 16, he began work as a carpenter in Llanchwyd, where he worked until 1848. In 1848 William applied to emigrate to the United States. When processing his paperwork he found that he was not registered in the town census. William needed to give a surname, and, rather than give Hughes, decided to use the surname Badger, taking into consideration his origins. Hence he became legally known as William Brocke Badger<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Badger arrived in New York City in 1849 and found work as a carpenter. In 1852 he found his way to Michigan, where he married Adelheide Herkimer. They had seven children.</p>
<p>Badger died in Niles, Michigan in 1908, at the approximate age of 80.</p>
<p>There are numerous living descendents of William Brock Badger, most of whom live in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_is_watching_you._78bf.html" title="Edit section: Interviews">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interviews</span></h3>
<p>In 1900 Badger was interviewed by Delbert Smith, a journalist at a local newspaper. Smith published a small booklet for the local community historical society titled <i><b>A Unique Childhood: The Life of William Badger</b></i>. Although not formally published, the booklet was available for many years in Berrien County, Michigan.</p>
<p>In the book, Badger claims that he does not remember his biological parents, although he did think they were English-speaking (as opposed to Welsh-speaking). He never learned Welsh, and said that Welsh words sounded completely foreign to him [1], nor did Badger remember the shipwreck.</p>
<p>Badger remembered living in a large dugout that he believed he dug out of the earth, next to the badger holes. He said [1]:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Papa Hughes [Badger’s adoptive father] told me that, when they found me, I was living in a sort of dugout made of mud next to a bunch of Badger holes. I remember this hole, ‘cause I slept in it and the badgers slept in their little holes. It was under the roots of a big tree, and I guess I sort of dug the dirt from around the roots and then packed it back in above. Sometimes at night some of other badgers would sleep in my dugout hole, but usually they slept by themselves, and it was only me.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Badger talked about what he ate during his six years with the badgers:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I ate mostly varmints, you know, mice, squirrels, rats, little birds, hedgehogs, prairie dogs, I think. Did they have prairie dogs in Wales, cause I didn’t know them names of ‘em at the time. I just ate ‘em.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>My family liked to eat birds, but had a tough time getting to them. But I was able to climb trees pretty well and shake their nests down. Then my family below would rummage through it for live birds and eggs. The farmers, they were growing crops, so sometimes I’d steal some of their crops and bring it back to the dugout.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Welsh winters could be cold. Badger said he kept warm by stealing blankets and clothes from the neighbouring farms.</p>
<p>When asked if he could remember any of the badgers specifically, he said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There was a mamma badger and papa badger who sort of raised me. They had a two badger children, cubs, and I guess you’d say them’re my siblings. They used to come in my dugout and I used to play with ‘em.</i></dd>

Booklet about Badger's life, published in 1900</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1846, before emigrating to the U.S., Badger went back and found the remnants of his dugout, although by that time there were no badgers living there.</p>
<p>Badger commented on his heightened sense of smell, gained from living with the badgers.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I reckon I developed a pretty good sense of smell when I was with my badger family. Even when I was living with Papa Hughes, if there was a badger within five miles of me, I could smell it. When I moved to America, in Michigan, I could smell them badgers too, although the American badgers smell a little different.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Badger talked about why he took the surname Badger<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I went down to register and get my papers, and they asked me my surname. Nobody’d ever really asked me that before. And I’d met a lad once from England with the surname Badger, so I thought, I’ll just tell ‘em my surname’s Badger, ‘cause they’re my original family.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Badger talked about how being raised by the badgers shaped his identity:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>You know, them badgers were my family. And I managed to survive ok with them. But I knew, even then, that I just wasn’t one of them. And I could see the farmers in the distance sometimes when I was out foragin’ for food. And they looked like me. I was scared to death to try to make contact with them. I guess that’s why I hung around my badger family until I was nine. But I felt like, oh, I don’t know, like, if Pappa Hughes hadn’t found me I think I would’ve eventually gone up to somebody at some time. I knew I couldn’t live my entire life that way. Somehow, you know, unaware-like, I knew I didn’t belong there. But at the same time, I ain’t like other people either.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>It’s something nobody else ain’t ever gonna understand, but I consider myself just as much badger as human.</i></dd>
</dl>

<p>During his life, Griffith Hughes kept a diary. In it are numerous passages about his adopted son<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In his diary, Hughes describes finding the boy later to be named William.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>We found this poor lad, he came out of a sort of mud hole. Twas nary a shred of clothing on him. He walked out sort of hunched over, and walked straight toward us. I said hello, and he said hello back, though I soon learned those where scarcely the only words he could utter.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Hughes described William’s appearance and demeanor.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>William had developed large calluses on his hands and feet, and can stay barefoot in the cold with no concern for chilblain. We tried to teach him to walk upright, but even then he still hunched over. And if he was agitated or in a hurry, he’d drop down again to all fours…He scared the life out of the Lloydes bearn today, running around on all fours and howling. But I’m not one to spare the rod, and betimes had to chasten him.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Williames siblings learned in school today the Welsh word for badger, and now are fond of calling him Broch… He’s talking a lot more now. I reckon in another year we can send him off to school.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>William did attend school, and learned how to read and write. At 16 Hughes commented on his adopted sons progress, and how grateful he was that William received a Christian upbringing.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Margaret and I are blessed by the Lord to have William. To think he might still be out there amongnst the beasts, never knowing his saviour in Christ. He may not be as clever as his siblings, but considering what he came from, Margaret and I think he’s done very well.</i></dd>

<p>Various records exist in the U.K. about Badger's life. Among them are:</p>
<p>Saint Mary's Church: A church newsletter in 1838 has the following short announcement<sup>2</sup>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Griffish and Margaret Hughes have taken a young, orphaned boy into their Christian home. They have named him William. William has spent the recent years of his life living with a pack of badgers outside of Beaumaris.</i></dd>

<p>ARGH is a galactic terrorist organization, "ARGH" being an acronym for "the Association for the Right to Guaranteed Hotdogs". Some experts speculate that ARGH is headed by a genetically-modified, hyper-intelligent chimpanzee. The supposed purpose of the group's terrorist attacks is to pressure governments around the galaxy into providing federally guaranteed hotdogs to citizens, entirely free of charge. However, some believe that the supposed chimpanzee leader of the group is simply, but entirely, insane.</p>

<p>This "nonexistent article"is obviously an idea of a joke. Despite the fact that some may find that its title sounds alarmingly similar to the title of a link that takes you to a talk page about the Wikipediholic Test, I assure you this is a completely different article. The author is hoping that no one gets rid of this article becuase it is humorous and funny(?). The nonexistent article conjours up visions of Vertical airship and luxury cars.

<p>This term refers to the method of hanging used in the execution of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Bum-sex-hanging is a painful and humiliating way of ousting a formerly US supported dictator who has lost favor in the eyes of a US president. This method of execution is used for its ironic effect in oil rich countries as it requires no energy and relies solely upon gravity.</p>
<p>Bum-sex hanging is practiced by such closed homo-sexuals as Drew Hall and Zack Spencer.</p>
<p>The term bum-sex is often used to describe anal-sex, however, in this incorrect use of the term.</p>

<p>The writer said in a report with J.K. Rowling, Sirius Black was a member of his fictional party, he was the legendary Right Wing Of the Holy Trinity. He made the bill against the anti-christian societries, and he was the Norsefire's democratic fighter, until his dead. At the first years of Sutler's dictatorship, the disobedience of the pederasts and the taxation and widespread discrimination against the immigrants, feminists and pederasts were made under the order Sirius. But he was murdured by some foreigner, which also known as American Liberalists.</p>

<p>The "Nazis" often refers to the band of merry-men which followed Robin Hood on his cheeky and merry journeys throughout Sherwood Forest. They robbed from the rich and gave to the poor and were loved by all men and women of all nations. Recently they have resided in the Keebler Elf's cookie factory where they make all kinds of scrumptious goodies for all of the children and over weight adults to enjoy. The hollocaust never happened, and the Nazis love Jews very much. They also love black people and cripples.</p>

<p>There have often been disputes regarding Mario's special powers in the Mario universe, his super mushroooms always making him appear larger than life and the magic "leaves" giving him the ability to fly much like symptoms assocaited with cannabis (Yeah, because of course as well all know cannabis negates the effects of gravity). Mario has often been critized in some circles as promoting adolescent drug usages in the early 1990's.</p>
