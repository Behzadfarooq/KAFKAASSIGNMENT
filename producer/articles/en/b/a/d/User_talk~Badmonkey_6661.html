<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We had complaints to the Foundation about including one manufacturer and not another. I suggest this paragraph is rewritten in an "encyclopedic" tone (with links to studies by professionals, experts etc.), this should deter would-be advertisers. Also, you should strive to describe general types of anchors instead of particular models. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 10:38, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please refrain from adding the biased and weighted chart to the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor.html" title="Anchor">anchor</a> article, purely independant charts and images are welcome, but a chart using data that is made with modified data by a anchor manufacturer is no longer independant. Wikipedia is not a place to advertise or tout a product, it is an enclypedia. Your edit wars with Alaid POIRAUD who is also a biased anchor manufactuer should come to a stop, I hope you agree and I will happily bring in a third party to arbitrate if nessisary. You have managed to block your competitor because you understand wiki policy and procedure better then he does, but that does not make you right in your POV. Both of you have made inappropriate and biased edits and I hope this stops. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 04:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, I wont deny that the image/chart is acceptable for uploading to wikipedia or any wikimedia project, if ronca allows that, then it is okay. What I object to is its inclusion in the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor.html" title="Anchor">anchor</a> article. As you admit the chart and data is "scaled" for anchor size. Sail and West Marine did not publish their results "scaled", thus a company whos anchor is included in that test, personally scaling the research and adding it to the article is biased. If Sail or West Marine did the scaling, it would then be a relevent third party source and acceptable encycopedic content, but the company itsself offering their own scaled data is NOT. Even more so when that scaled data puts their product on top(which I admit it was basicly on top before, but the scaled data puts it even more so on top). Please keep in mind that this is an encylopedia, not a discussion board, data presented here should come from third parties, any entry you make for your own design (assuming you are Craig Smith) is suspect. You can say what you want on the various message boards, as can Alain, but this is an encylopedia, not a discussion board and standards do exist here which will not work in your favor if you really want to push this. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 05:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. You state that the data is scaled, but this is entirely untrue. The data remains unchanged. Only its presentation as a ratio of size to holding power alters to the SAIL method. This is certainly a better solution since the anchors tested vary greatly in size. It is unfair and false to imply that Rocna is attempting to present biased, or worse, modified, data. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadmonkey_4c9c.html" title="User:Badmonkey">Badmonkey</a> 05:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Are you kidding me? Adding a note on my talk page suggesting my reverts to your spam are vandalism? Through this process I have kept civil and within wikipedia guidelines. Your addition to my talk page suggesting vandalism is abuse while I sought out third party arbitration. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 06:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unnecessary removal of valid NPOV content (which has been present and accepted for a considerable amount of time, during multiple other edits) is rightly considered vandalism. Wikipedia requires that warnings are given before any resolution action be initiated. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadmonkey_4c9c.html" title="User:Badmonkey">Badmonkey</a> 06:58, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You used the same logic and better understanding of wiki guidlines to ensure your competitor Alain POIROID who designed the Spade anchor which is a rival of your design got banned. While I disagree with much of Alains edits to this article just as much as I disagree with your edits, you cannot hide behind policy and put tags on peoples pages to suggest you are right. I have made no vandalism to this article and I am following proper guidelines to resolution to this article, I did not violate the 3 revert rule (which you have), I have vandalized nothing (and your suggestion I have is juvinile). You are actually a member of a discussion board which I administer and have not once suggested your removal for you touting your product (likewise Alains). But when it comes to wikipedia, here I have my utopian thoughts of an encylopedia and even though you spam disucssion boards all over the internet, even one I run, here you have to remain encylopedic. I could care less about your personal issues with Alain, I remain neautral here as I do elsewhere, but both of you are wrong here. Your association with the company whos product your basicly touting here violates wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 07:08, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unnecessary removal of valid NPOV content (which has been present and accepted for a considerable amount of time, during multiple other edits - I am not trying to add it, you are trying to delete it) is rightly considered vandalism. Your comments concerning copyright of the data are incorrect. Furthermore your attempts to associate my username with Rocna Anchors is contrary to Wikipedia's intrinsic right to anonymity and is an effective personal attack. Lastly, the 3 revert rule has not been broken; an edit was made in an attempt to improve the content in question by improving its references. Your continued deletion of this content can only be considered vandalism and your actions illustrate you are anything but neutral. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadmonkey_4c9c.html" title="User:Badmonkey">Badmonkey</a> 07:16, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your suggestion that I removed NPOV content is completely irrational and wrong, per things I have already stated. Thus my removal of YOUR companies biased version of chart, using data NOT released by west marine or SAIL and entirely in violation of their copyright (which you were only granted for commercial advertisment purposes) my reverts are completely legitmate and your additions are actually illegal, if nessisary I have no issues with contact sail and west marine on this matter. I do suggest you remove your edits yourself. I will say here not I am NOT affiliated with ANY anchor company, Badmonkey is affiliated with Ronca anchors and Alaid POIROID is affliated in the past with Spade Anchors, both of their contributions are BIASED. I own neither of their anchors and have no bias towards either, both should not be contributing to wikipedia with anything reguarding their products! <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 07:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You uploaded the image and gave copyright to said image for Ronca anchors. If you are not Craig Smith, or anyone else associated with the company Ronca Anchors in New Zealand, you DO have assoication with them in some way by means of being given permission to publish their copyrighted data. Which IS in turn owned by SAIL Magazine and West Marine, which is attributed in the image, but NEITHER company has given permission for this data to be shared noncommercially on wikipedia and certainly has not granted permission for said data to be MODIFIED for presentation on wikipedia for COMMERCIAL purposes. If you feel my statements are incorrect then you should suggest why they are specificly. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 07:38, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Badmonkey, Thanks for the note. I regard both you and Alain as experts in the field of anchor design, whereas my only knowledge of anchoring comes from the wiki article. So when you say the critical factor is weight or volume, and he says it's surface area, that indicates that there is no agreement on what the "best" scaling factor is for holding power. Perhaps you have a neutral source to support your stance? I think Russeasby makes a good point that if there truly was a universally accepted scaling factor the independent study would have applied it to their data. It also makes sense that scaling the data can be subjective since different customers have different needs. While you say that the first chart in the <i>Sail</i> article provides the best summary of results, I still think the subsequent scope and location charts show that there are cases where a different design produces better results. Even the article concludes <i>every boat should carry at least three different anchor designs and weights to deal with a wide variety of bottom types</i>. Similarly, the Power and Motoryacht article states <i>we never intended our test to be the definitive word but rather one more piece of data for you to consider when choosing an anchor</i>.</p>
<p>While I appreciate your expertise in the anchor article and I defend your right to make neutral contributions to it, you have to admit that you are walking a fine line of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of Interest</a> (as is Alain). I don't necessarily think I should have the final word on what is right, but it definitely shouldn't be someone with close ties to one manufacturer when there is disagreement with another. <a href="../../../h/o/o/User%7EHoof_Hearted_0f23.html" title="User:Hoof Hearted">Hoof Hearted</a> 13:23, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
