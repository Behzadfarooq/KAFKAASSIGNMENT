<p>The reference from the article about Strawberryfest from the St. Petersburg Times in 2005 suggests that Adkins coined the term badonkadonk is ridiculous considering that badonkadonk was a prominent line in a #2 hit from 2002 and very common slang just about everywhere but Strawberryfest. It's dishonest to write "Some have claimed ..." when you know (or should have known) it's not true.</p>
<p>The reference with the lyrics from "Work It" compresses three lines from one to save space. You don't have to go further than Wikipedia to find that out.</p>
<p>The Jamie Foxx reference is just meh. So he said badonkadonk - so what?</p>
<p>Honkytonk badonkadonk is a great song, but it's a long way from the source of the term. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhosts%26empties_0e07.html" title="User:Ghosts&amp;empties">Ghosts&amp;empties</a> 18:52, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I said that some have claimed that Adkins came up with the term because (as demonstrated) some have. I also showed (as you have said) that it's not true. The previous version had three lines of lyrics from each song, which is more than is needed; we only need the line that the word is in. I used the quote from the newspaper article because I could not find any online lyrics that actually included the word <i>badonkadonk</i>. Most of them had "bump bump bump" or something that vaguely sounds like <i>badonkadonk</i>. We can't cite ourselves, and so in the absence of other online sources, I went with what I could find: a newspaper. Actually, Google is unable to find any reference to the word "badonk" in reference to the Missy Elliott song that is not from Wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22missy+elliott%22+%22work+it%22+%2Bbadonk+-wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22missy+elliott%22+%22work+it%22+%2Bbadonk+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Searching for "gadonk" fares slightly better <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22missy+elliott%22+%22work+it%22+%2Bgadonk+-wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22missy+elliott%22+%22work+it%22+%2Bgadonk+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. And searching for "bum bum bum" gives the best results <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22missy+elliott%22+%22work+it%22+%22bum+bum+bum%22+-wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22missy+elliott%22+%22work+it%22+%22bum+bum+bum%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Condensing quotes is common practice, and while the original author should perhaps have added ellipses, claiming that the quote is somehow completely wrong seems like cherry picking to make a point. The point of the Jamie Foxx quote was that I came across it during my research and thought I'd include it. It's more proof that the word is actually being used and refers to what we say it refers to. I'm not claiming is the best quote in the world, but it is related to the subject.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the version of the article that I wrote, I never claimed that Adkins coined the phrase. I said that it has "recently enjoyed popularity in the press" (which it has, judging from the explosion in the number of articles in 2005 and 2006) and that some think/claim that he invented it, and give a cite to show that I'm not just blowing smoke. I then go on to show how this is false—an interesting fact, perhaps, to some of our readers, who will only have heard the term in Adkins's song. I did not remove any information about the origins of the word, I expanded a bit and gave sources for it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, Urban Dictionary is not a source, and the large paragraph at the end giving examples is a copyvio from Urban Dictionary and original research. Neither are good things for the encyclopedia. —<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 20:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's distorted for the initial emphasis of this article to be misconceptions of the origin of the term. UrbanDictionary.com is an excellent source for the meaning of urban slang as many established newspapers have acknowledged. It also dates slang word's date of widespread emergence - in this case mid-2003. I haven't compared the entry at UrbanDictionary.com to the paragraph you refer to, but it's quite possible that the same author added it to both sites. By deleting it you've deleted the essence of the article - what this word means. It's not just any woman's buttocks - it's a *bombastic* booty. The description is important. Please add description as you see fit.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I love your description of appreciating women's beauty as original research.</dd>

<dd>That sounds like a perfectly fine reason to rework the paragraph, not to revert wholesale. And Urban Dictionary is not an appropriate source for our encyclopedia; it's no better than a blog or forum posting, both of which <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> explicitly warn against using.—<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 01:01, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article failed good article nomination. This is how the article, as of August 13, 2006, compares against the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_good_article__31af.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a good article?">six good article criteria</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1. Well written?:</b> Failed (needs copyediting and possibly a rewrite - the prose is generally pretty sloppy, though it delves into the realm of confusing at times)</dd>
<dd><b>2. Factually accurate?:</b> Appears to pass</dd>
<dd><b>3. Broad in coverage?:</b> Failed (little more than the lead section to an article that should be much larger - I am curious as to why this is not tagged as a stub, in fact)</dd>
<dd><b>4. Neutral point of view?:</b> Passed</dd>
<dd><b>5. Article stability?</b> Passed</dd>

<dd>Happens to be the reason I'm here as well. The sentence "<i>Women who possess this feature usually have a small waist that violently explodes into a round and juicy posterior.</i>", among others, should be written with words that describe physical characteristics, not preferential ones. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkwhistle_5a18.html" title="User:Darkwhistle">Darkwhistle</a> 23:56, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I tagged it as inappropriate tone. I personally think the topic is not encyclopedic at all, and I may pursue deletion if anyone else feels that way. The concern is that the sources do not rise above the bar for non-triviality required for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 03:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To suggest that badonkadonk is not encyclopedic is ... unthinkable. If it merits an article in the New York Times, there's room in WP. But I agree that "juicy" is not the appropriate tone. To get adjectives that are descriptive I turned to the widely-cited work of Professor David Holmes. Unfortunately his research pertains to calipygian perfection in general, not specifically badonkadonks. Although I use Urban Dictionary as a reference very reluctantly, one consistent feature cited in most of the definitions there was slight bounciness, so included that too. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/_/b/User%7EH_Bruthzoo_d149.html" title="User:H Bruthzoo">H Bruthzoo</a> (<a href="../../../h/_/b/User_talk%7EH_Bruthzoo_2943.html" title="User talk:H Bruthzoo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_H_Bruthzoo_c566.html" title="Special:Contributions/H Bruthzoo">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>...of a workable article. The article uses sensational and slang language -- it needs to be written as someone who did not care about <i>badonkadonks</i> would write it -- someone who had never heard the term and was researching it for the first time.</p>
<p>This is not a place for extensively discussing the meaning of and examples of the term, but if its burgeoning legitimacy and the implications of its recent appearances in conservative media are focused on, the article could actually be helpful.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELeSaint_1b7d.html" title="User:LeSaint">LeSaint</a> 03:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Vida Guerra? Jennifer Lopez? Sorry to burst anyone's bubble, but they don't exemplify what this term referrs to. Actually, nobody in hollywood does.
