<p>Hey, just popped in to change the date of BR's 14th album release to the correct one. An article on Epitaph's website on January 17th(<a href="http://www.epitaph.com/news/news/2795" class="external free" title="http://www.epitaph.com/news/news/2795" rel="nofollow">http://www.epitaph.com/news/news/2795</a>) has said it was as such, and I would trust them over a 3rd party news source. Also went and edited the separate article for the album. SuperHiro 10:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bentley's interview on the BR podcast this week (#7 I think) states that the double album will likely get pushed to at least Feb 2007, because they aren't close to starting recording. 24.13.86.24 07:29, 15 May 2006 (UTC) Brooks has said on myspace that it's more likely to be late 07</p>

<p>Oy. Instead of saying "See xxxx in music", why don't we just link xxxx in music to the year? With an article like this where there are lots of years mentioned, that "see" thing is a little ridiculous. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>

<dd>I agree, it's changed now. -- <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 04:45 12 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In keeping with some other music articles, I'm changing so the year itself links to xxxx in music. Something like "Against the Grain, released in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_in_music.html" title="1990 in music">1990</a>, blah blah." -- <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you (Zoe) suggesting "XXX released XXX in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_music.html" title="1995 in music">1995</a>" with a piped link to the year in music, or to just link straight to the main year page? I would be against the piped link because readers will assume it is about the year in general, and I would be against the straight link to the main year page because... I dunno, it just seems more useful to link to the year in music. If someone is clicking on it, I'd think the main reason is to find out what else happened in music in that year, not who won Japanese Prime Minister elections or something. Anyway, I don't feel too strongly about it and will adhere to the consensus, but that's my feelings. I agree it's unattractive, but I think clarity and ease of use are more important. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 00:34 Jan 13, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, the piping is pretty clear. No one will expect Bad Religion albums to be listed on the all-things-to-all-people year page, just the year-in-music page. Different question: Should the year in music pages link to the year pages? Should the year pages link to the year in music pages? If each year page had a link to the year in music page, then readers could see that, by golly, that Bad Religion album came out the same year Noriega was arrested before going on to the year in music, where they will find that Milli Vanilli was also arrested that year. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a>
<dl>
<dd>This only confirms my suspicion that Noriega was a member of <i>both</i> Milli Vanilli and Bad Religion. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 03:52 Jan 13, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Intro is completely wrong. Into the Unknown was not their debut album, and it did not sell well. On the contrary, it was enormously unpopular and directly led to the band breaking up, as it was psychadelic rock, which alienated the punk fans. Removing for now, I'll fix when I get some time. -- <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a></p>

In 1984 Greg Hetson of Circle Jerks fame replaced Gurewitz. This sentence doesn't make any sense. I think its trying to say that Hetson replaced Brett which isn't true, he was asked to record a song with the band, and just kind of stuck around. This is explained in the new BR dvd (which is really cool). The DC</p>
<p>Actually he did replace him when Brett went into rehab for his drug problem. He is credited on Back To The Known</p>

<p>Removed text: <i>In his doctoral dissertation, "Monism, Atheism, and the Naturalist World-View: Perspectives from Evolutionary Biology," he concludes that there's "no conflict between evolutionary theory and religion on the one important condition that religion is essentially atheistic." One of his beliefs (and he is a man of deep faith), which must have helped him to arrive at his findings, is that <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_naturalism.html" title="Philosophical naturalism">naturalism</a> is set to become a new and influential religion. Naturalism "is satisfying," Graffin has said, "because it is a teacher. Naturalism teaches one of the most important things in the world: there is only this life—so live wonderfully and meaningfully." And one of the keys to a wonderful and meaningful existence is living free of delusions, which all "bad religions"—traditional churches, political dogmas, conformist social codes—trade in.

<p>BR are definatly not a hardcore punk band. Many classify them as pop-punk, although punk rock is the most common genre. However there are not a Hardcore band. Listen to any BR music, and compair to hardcore such as Black Flag or Throwdown.</p>
<p>Pop Punk? Thats a first, I completly disagree with you Bad Religion is a 'hardcore' band.</p>
<p>Bad Religion may have been "Hardcore" back in the days of "No Control" but now they're sorta poppy. Which is totally fine cuz I love 'em.</p>
<p>Bad Religion more or less invented the entire hardcore punk genre. Black Flag isn't hardcore punk to an audiophile, they're post-hardcore, but as usual society dumbs things down to just 10 or 20 genres, instead of the dozens or so that are out there. Anyway, yeah, I'll second that you're the first I've heard use the pop-punk label for Bad Religion. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> 21:15, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bad Religion a Post-Hardcore band?! I'm not a genre expert but I know that isn't right.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hardcore is the most confusing genre in terms of defining whether a band is hardcore. According to some people hardcore was more or less invented when Bad Brains' drummer would play the drums faster than usual so they could finish songs earlier. Perhaps their first album was hardcore. Bad Religion are probably more specifically melodic punk rock, but punk rock, certainly not pop-punk. Just because they may be "lighter" than some punk bands because of their melodies, doesn't mean they are pop-punk. --<a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJabso_6e51.html" title="User:Jabso">Jabso</a> 07:16, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Bad Religion is hard to classify, because some of Mr Brett's songs are borderline pop-punk, yet the material before 1986 is hardcore.
<dl>
<dd>Pre 86 stuff is not really that Hardcore, and some of Mr Bretts stuff is a lot harder than, say, The New America or I love my computer. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 14:49, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think most of them liked working with Todd very much. unfortunately my olny proof is anecdotal.

<p>The following sections all just look like pure trivia to me. Check out today's featured article for <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>. None of these sections even exist in that article.</p>
<ul>
<li>3.3 Covers</li>
<li>3.4 Musical similarities</li>
<li>3.5 Soundtracks</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the pieces of section "3.1 Influence" could be incorporated into the "2.1 Early career" section. Bits of "3.2 Collaborations and guest musicians" could also be placed individually into the history according to when each thing happened.</p>
<p>Various extraneous entries (tonguesofdestruction.com?) in External Links could go too, IMHO. Any thoughts? This is a major restructure, so it should get some review before being attempted. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfit13b_91ff.html" title="User:Misfit13b">m13b</a> 20:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the Links, that could be cut down to the official site, one fan site (probably The Bad Religion Page), maybe the lyrics site, and then reviews or articles about them, but it definetly doesnt need like 5 different fan sites.<a href="../../../u/c/s/User%7EUcscottb4u_e7d0.html" title="User:Ucscottb4u">Ucscottb4u</a> 20:50, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, I think the New Album section and Current events can be combined. <a href="../../../u/c/s/User%7EUcscottb4u_e7d0.html" title="User:Ucscottb4u">Ucscottb4u</a> 20:54, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally agree, and took the liberty of doing it, as well as chopping external links. Trivia about the Dropkick Murphys and all that other news removed. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfit13b_91ff.html" title="User:Misfit13b">m13b</a> 16:43, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I was wondering about the Lineup Section on the side. Might it be a better idea to list former members under current members in the top box and jsut make sure each album has the right line up on those pages? <a href="../../../u/c/s/User%7EUcscottb4u_e7d0.html" title="User:Ucscottb4u">Ucscottb4u</a> 18:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. As is, it's a good way to illustrate the many lineup changes (which should be stressed more in the intro). Then again, all of the collab/guest musician stuff should probably be moved to individual album pages too. Tough one. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfit13b_91ff.html" title="User:Misfit13b">m13b</a> 18:05, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Might lose some support on this move, but I think it helps a lot. As indicated previously, I wanted to chop out a bunch of sections. These bits either should be placed on individual album pages (which I will do shortly) or cut completely due to lack of relevance/references. Other than that, the influences were moved to Early Career.</p>
<p>If you want to see the page before I chopped it just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Religion&amp;oldid=83206232" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bad_Religion&amp;oldid=83206232" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Now when I re-run the <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_peerreviewer.js_782c.html" title="User:AndyZ/peerreviewer.js">peerreviewer script</a>, it tells me the intro is too <i>long</i>. (I can't win!) Here's an alternative intro if the current one is indeed deemed too long.</p>
<p><b>Bad Religion</b> is a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore punk</a>/<a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> band formed in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_California_3bf5.html" title="Southern California">Southern California</a> in 1980 by <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Bentley_1790.html" title="Jay Bentley">Jay Bentley</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Graffin_dde4.html" title="Greg Graffin">Greg Graffin</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Gurewitz_718b.html" title="Brett Gurewitz">Brett Gurewitz</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Ziskrout_0ff5.html" title="Jay Ziskrout">Jay Ziskrout</a>.

<p>They are known for their socially conscious lyrics and the ability to express their ideology with the use of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a>, an advanced vocabulary and vocal harmonies known as the "oozin aahs". Bad Religion songs deal with matters of personal as well as political responsibility, and despite the band's moniker, deal more with freedom than atheism.</p>
<p>The band has gone through a large number of personnel changes throughout its history, singer/songwriter <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Graffin_dde4.html" title="Greg Graffin">Greg Graffin</a> being the sole consistent member. The lineup departure with the largest impact occurred when <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Gurewitz_718b.html" title="Brett Gurewitz">Brett Gurewitz</a>, Bad Religion's other main songwriter, left in 1994.

<p>This article failed good article nomination. This is how the article, as of February 23, 2007, compares against the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_good_article__31af.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a good article?">six good article criteria</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1. Well written?:</b> <b>Fail.</b> The prose doesn't flow very well and it oisn't structured very well. Several paraghraphs come off as being a bunch of random points just thrown together in sentence form, ie. "The band has gone through a large number of personnel changes throughout its history, singer/songwriter Greg Graffin being the sole consistent member. The lineup departure with the largest impact occurred when Brett Gurewitz, Bad Religion's other main songwriter, left in 1994; he rejoined the band in 2001."</dd>
<dd><b>2. Factually accurate?:</b> <b>Weak Fail.</b> Makes several unsourced statements, but the history of the group seems well-sourced.</dd>
<dd><b>3. Broad in coverage?:</b> <b>Pass</b>. Seems to have good coverage of the subject</dd>
<dd><b>4. Neutral point of view?:</b> <b>Fail</b> Several unsourced statements that are taken as POV, eg. "This band is often credited for leading the revival of punk rock during the late 1980s, as well as influencing a large number of other punk and rock musicians throughout their career." That statement needs sources</dd>
<dd><b>5. Article stability?</b> As far as I can tell, yes. <b>Pass</b>.</dd>
<dd><b>6. Images?:</b> <b>Fail.</b> None of them have fair-use rationale</dd>

<p>Sorry, but I have to <b>fail</b> this article because I do not think it is well-written enough for it to be a Good Article.
