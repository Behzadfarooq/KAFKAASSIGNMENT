<p>AFD was closed as a deleted. I saw it as a repost on the CSD category, I removed the CSD because previous votes referred to the article as being a contentless substub. The repost has some meat to the article, but if its to survive an AFD it's still probably going to have to be cleaned up. Reads like a press release, and might actually be one. Note that if the heading is a redlink, it'll have been speedied. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was perhaps unfortunate that a RfC was still ongoing. I found it encouraging that you had support from JzG, which shows that people can appreciate edits from someone with a different point of view. Looking at some previous debates, if we ever have a disagreement it may take a long time to conclude as I like resolving things. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 21:36, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nah, the problems really had nothing to do with the RfC - I actually expected more opposition BECAUSE of that. I'm more disturbed by people who outright lie, and then aren't questioned on it when it comes down to the final decision, but I'm not terribly surprised. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:10, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At least all the edits are there for people to see. If it's any consolation, I think some of the opposers were genuine&#160;;-) I had a look through some of your edits and could see frustration building up in your adversaries, but in the time I had available didn't come across anything devastating, I think the bureaucrat was right to close the way he did too. Perhaps you can take his advice - it looks like you'll only need to change marginally to succeed next time. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 23:21, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, there's certainly enough opposition that didn't come out of the woodwork for me to not be too fazed by it. But it's refreshing to know that my conduct and contributions are widely respected by members of the community who are in good standing, so I'm not letting myself get down about it. Maybe i'll give it another go in a few months. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:24, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bummer. Please don't take it personally - like I said before, some people are not willing to separate philosophical disagreements from te issue of fitness to perform janitorial work. Give it time, you will be promoted. I thought many of the Oppose votes unnecessarily harsh, and many appeared to be based on a false perception (votign keep does not mean you will be any more or less likely to block a tendentious editor). I am disappointed your RFA failed, I am also disappointed that Brian Crawford saw it as symptomatic of some problem with WP. I simply don't understand how giving the mop to poeple who are inclusionist can have a downside. Maybe I'm the one with a distorted viewpoint, who knows. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:43, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Like I said, I'm not the least bit discouraged by the result - I expected different opposers who never showed up, and I'm viewed overwhelmingly positively by those in the community in good standing. I'm not too concerned, I understand completely why it worked out the way it did. Thanks for the attempt, though, maybe round 2 will go better. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I voted against you, not because I think you are a bad person, but because of the controversy surrounding you - because you are an individual. The outspoken maverick is not supposed to become the neutral admin! The quiet dull people who can see things both ways are the ones who should become admins. The people with an opinion are the ones who shake and shout and make sure that alternative views are heard. Do you really want to stiffle your opinions just to get hold of a button that you don't actually need? This admin proposal was like trying to get a <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gun_%28film%29_dee7.html" title="Top Gun (film)">Top Gun</a> into a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administration.html" title="Administration">desk job</a>. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 12:26, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why should the outspoken maverick <i>not</i> become the admin? Many admins are decidedly not clones. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:52, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I am not talking clone - I'm talking balanced. Seeing both sides of the argument. As far as I see it, and please correct me if I'm mistaken, the admin role is mainly to make balanced decisions on events in Wiki - like AfD, disputes, etc. Admins do not decide policy or the direction of Wiki - that is for the body of Wikipedians. And when policy is being created people with views need to be heard. The admin function at such a point is to count the beans, not to materially influence the decision. A person who wants their views and opinions to be heard and felt would need to stand back so much from doing admin functions that there would be no point in having the admin role. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 13:19, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Jeff. I think you're wrong on this one; Leyden is a skilled self-publicist, all the purported sources seem to track back to him (your first link, for example, was to his own site). I can't see any credible evidence that INA is anything other than a one-man propaganda mouthpiece, and I certainly see no sign it's syndicated in any "real" media (as the likes of Reuters are). Leyden is also obnoxious towards Wikipedia since his vanity article was deleted - not in itself evidence of much other than that in my experience people who are genuinely important realise that having a Wikipedia article does not validate their existence in any way and simply don't care, the ones who kick up a stink are usually the ones for whom vanity is a way of life. Most of the argumentation and much of the editing comes from known or suspected soickpuppets of a single user who may or may not be Leyden.</p>
<p>If you can find an example of, say, The Times crediting INA as a source I'd be pleased to hear of it. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:35, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could be, but absent evidence to the contrary that this guy's just a fluke or nut or whatever - and given that much of the opposition from higher-ups seems to be because of his attitude toward WP - I see no reason to rush to delete it at this point. I'd much rather have the article here and deal with those issues in article where we can monitor and control it as opposed to the constant back and forth of deleting and restoring and appeals and whatever else. A little inconsistent of me? Perhaps, but is anything as it seems with this one at this point? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:34, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, let's put it this way, I have no real complaints about where it ends up, but it'd be nice to have actual consensus as opposed to unilateral motions if we're going to delete it.

<p>Hey there. You probably don't know who I am, but I have seen you around AfD a lot and you seem to hold similar ideals to mine in that regard. Today I rewrote an article that was up for deletion, <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulp_noir.html" title="Pulp noir">Pulp noir</a>, and hence gained several keep votes. It wasn't the first time I've done this, and I realized that I enjoy it more than anything else I do on Wikipedia. I have made several "saves" of articles that needed to be kept in my opinion, but would have been deleted had someone not stepped in.</p>
<p>My idea is this - what do you think of an organized project for this activity? I'm not sure if it would be something as formal as a WikiProject, and certainly not as informal as snarking, but maybe something in the middle. An Article Saving Cabal? &#160;:) It would be important for it to be constructive, not malicious or disruptive.. but what do you think? --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 20:30, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The site is a minor one by any measure. We do and have deleted articles on wikis this size routinely. Howls of "OMG| CENSORSHIP!" from the site's fanclub (no, not you, Jeff) merely muddy the waters. Articles like that simply reinforce systemic bias and give no information which is not instantly available by visiting the site itself. It's the difference between <i>knowledge</i> and <i>information</i> in my view. This was just <i>information</i> - Wikipedia is not a weeb directory. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:02, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps so, and if it were deleted by any actual fair accounting, I'd have left it behind ages ago. But regardless of your feelings on the content or the notability or whatever it is, there were so many problems with how the entire situation was handled from the start, from MONGO's actions to the way the AfD was unfairly refactored to the way the AfD was interpreted a couple hours as completely differently than the person before it did, and how it was closed early twice anyway. Even someone who doesn't give a shit about process (Tony excluded, of course) can see that this is a clusterf*ck from start to finish, and it's completely absurd that the rhetoric when discussing it boils down to "giving into trolls" or constant bad faith arguments about those who want to see things done right.

<dd>I'm going to be very amused and/or curious as to what happens when the ED people actually get more good press and citable sources, and go to reinclude the article here on WP.

<dd>I mean, let me toss this out there: Am I wrong for having massive issues with the way it was run? This isn't me protesting a speedy keep because it didn't meet the guidelines, this isn't me complaining because a guideline was ignored, as I'm certainly prone to do. This is a textbook example of an AfD gone horribly wrong. If I'm wrong, no one's showing me why I'm wrong here, and if someone was able to, I'd be very likely to back off. Unfortunately, no one seems to care about what's actually going on. How anyone can ignore it is beyond my ability to comprehend. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And again the statement by me for the 8,000th time is ignored out of convenience.

<p>Thanks&#160;:) Based on the conversation outlined above and in other areas, I think you can understand from these fine folks why the DRV was closed early. It seemed we were only letting sockpuppets and other unwelcome visitors win, and I wasn't about to stand by and let that happen.

<dd>No, actually, I can't, especially since few, if any, were based in policy or guideline. To shut down an ongoing discussion completely reeks of something very foul, especially with so many issues.

<dl>
<dd>So now policy can be trumped by consensus? Don't get me wrong - if consensus is consensus, that's all well and good and I don't protest. However, my complaints have definite merit, and your closing of the DRV after less than 2 days fails to address it. Please don't act as if I haven't been around long enough to understand how things work here, I'm simply looking to make sure things work the way they're supposed to, and early closes of ongoing discussions where policy is outright ignored is not how things are supposed to go. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 01:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're confusing policy with process. <i>Policy</i> tells us that an article on Encyclopedia Dramatica does not belong on Wikipedia. <i>Process</i> tells us how long to let its deletion discussion last. Policy trumps process. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 02:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, policy says that an article like ED <i>could</i> possibly belong on WP. Given that the AfD was an unmitigated disaster, I have my doubts weever really tackled that issue. Thus, we have to look at the process (which, BTW, is part and parcel of the deletion <i>policy</i>). The way the AfD was run, allowed to refactor, and closed is a direct violation of both deletion <i>policy</i> and deletion <i>process</i>. I don't honestly care how the article ultimately ends up - I think it belongs here, but that's simply my opinion - but if we're going to delete it, and certainly under the circumstances that resulted in it making it to AfD, we should do it right, following <i>policy</i> and <i>process</i>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:29, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm inclined to how you think this is a gross process violation as such a thing is nonexistant. Additionally, if your opinion merits on that I did the wrong thing, then it was wrong regardless of process. I'm open to the suggestion that my actions were not appropriate to the situation, and would appreciate it if you could explain to me why you feel my move was wrong (without making any reference to process). I don't know if I can provide redress if it turns out my actions were mistaken, but I'd be grateful for the learning opportunity. --<a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#000000"><b>Pilotguy</b></font></a> <sup><b>(</b><a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy"><font color="#0000FF"><b><i>roger that</i></b></font></a><b>)</b></sup> 02:00, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So is it standard to remove an ongoing discussion? Is it standard to say that a "deletion is endorsed" when an article's AfD is demonstrated at the DRV to have been closed incorrectly, out of process, and against general consensus, and the discussion regarding said process is unfinished? At the very least, I think you acted wrong in closing out the DRV after less than two days when the discussion was ongoing - they typically go on for five days, if not more, and the DRV was already closed improperly once. You can certainly provide redress by reopening the discussion and allowing it to run its course. Things can be the <i>right</i> thing, but <i>wrong</i> via the processes in place, part of what DRV exists for. The closure was, as it stands, wrong on both counts at this point in time, and considering the way this entire thing went down, I'm not sure if a further fanning of the flames by "endorsing" anything so early is the right way to go. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

Do they have something like RfA, or was it a matter of connections, or something else? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 17:35, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They just kinda choose based on availability and capability. I was made an admin when I expressed a desire to see them move away from the drama stuff toward more meme style stuff. It never really caught on, and I moved onto other things, although I still think there's a lot of talented writers there would could make it worthwhile, I may try to push the issue more once the insanity here winds down.</dd>
<dd>It's funny, though, because most of them are all friendly from other LJ-style communities and LJ Drama stuff, and I was some interloper who found some of it funny and got promoted. It's why I'm amused that I'm tossed into some of that stuff here, even though I've never really been involved in that aspect of it. The perils of being honest, I suppose. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:40, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Jeff, I just wanted to compliment your most recent work at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staying_Fat_For_Sarah_Byrnes_1aa2.html" title="Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes">Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes</a>. In particular, your most recent edit summary was an excellent example of how wiki should work. Regarding our joint efforts on another article (which doesn't need to be named on an otherwise polite talkpage), I'm watching with amusement to see what happens. I'd like to help expand the stub, but whenever I try I just start laughing and have to cancel my own edits. I did send a request for a more accurate image but don't know what will <i>come</i> of it.

<p>I never got around to responding before the DRV closed. Yes, I guess calling a group of people "drama queens" was a bit harsh and not the most overly <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> statement I've made here on Wikipedia... but honestly I wasn't in a very <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> mood that day. It was also probably not the best choice of words because in light of what this DRV was about it probably appeared I was singling out one side of the debate, when that statement was actually an indictment of some of (what I consider to be) the silliness the debate had descended into due to statement being made by both sides (and for the record, for whatever it is worth, that was not directed at you; you were one of a few people who were still debating the merits of the article and the AfD). Was the AfD done exactly by the book? No... but there are quite a few every day that are not. I will agree with you that the refactoring that was done was wholly inappropriate and the party who did so should probably be reprimanded for doing so. At the end of the day though, I suspect that even if this was run through AfD again the outcome would be the same. Right or wrong, this whole situation has become a headache that I suspect many people just want to see go away. This AfD/DRV is exactly why I <i>don't</i> want to be an admin.

<dd>I agree with the last sentence, hah. I know what you're saying, and you honestly might be right, but I also don't see the harm in having a definitive discussion on the matter that doesn't have anything to do with people rushing to the defense of their friends or assuming bad faith about all parties involved. I didn't think that was too much to look for, but it's tough to get people to look past it, I suppose. I kind of wish the person who DRVed it was different, and that they waited a few days at least, but it's too late now. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The 1% of me that is an idealist agrees it isn't too much to ask to have a logical, impartial debate on the merits of an article and/or the process that this went through... the 99% of me that is a pragmatist though realizes that at the end of the day there are probably quite a few people who are glad this is done and don't want to see it reopened again. Not assuming any faith, good, bad, or otherwise on anyone's part... but I think there are a lot of people who remember the "Brian Peppers" thing and are not overly eager to continue content debates ad infinitum.

<p>I hope that you're going to follow through on your application of the NPOV tag to the DOPA article. Your characterization that "...the bill may be misguided, that's an opinion and we can't have that" is incorrect. The ALA, Bill Richardson, libraries using MySpace have all come out against this bill and given testimony before Congress. These are all relevant <i>facts</i> regarding the article's subject matter. They are facts that put the bill in a bad light, but that's for the reader to decide when presented these facts. The facts are all referenced well to reputable sources. Opinions are perfectly legitimate material for articles, so long as it's not the author's opinion that's being relayed via the text. Everything in the Disadvantages (I have renamed it Disputes) section is what one of the reputable sources had to say in response to this bill's introduction and subsequent passage in the House. I think you're confusing neutral POV with no POV. If the article were simply about the exact Act itself, we could just copy-n-paste the text of it and be done with the whole thing. Hey, why even do that much work, we could just redirect to the Thomas Library page (ref #1 in the article anyways) and voila. This is a description of the Act, it's author's motivations, what it entails, and major responses in opposition to the Act as it affects these groups. Again, I hope you plan to do something more than just tag and run. Some specific examples of the POV in the article or suggestions for changes to introduce better NPOV would be a good start. Otherwise, I will at the very least move the article to {POV-check} instead since that would be more appropriate given your "not sure what to do" attitude in your first article discussion comment on the issue. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 05:53, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly believe that there's a point that it's just best to step back and let a user's actions stand on their own. Thanks for the response. I'm just going to avoid all interaction, even reverting back to our version on the page. It's just too inflammatory. I have a feeling that something will come of this, not too far in the future (I'm thinking maybe an RFC or something like that). Anyway, thank you so much for your good efforts in the article. Keep me posted if you need my help, but I think the most mature and reasonable thing in this case is just for me to assume good faith and avoid any potential flame-ups.

<p>Maybe you can help me. Two of my articles, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Family_of_the_United_States_a5f1.html" title="First Family of the United States">First Family of the United States</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Feder_87a0.html" title="Judy Feder">Judy Feder</a> have been heavily vandalized by a user called Hipocrite. In the case of First Family, he labelled the article a hoax with no explanation whatsoever despite its being very well-sourced and completely uncontroversial. In the second, he blanked the entire page, citing, "copyright violations." Please look at my last contributions to both articles and give your honest opinion about them, both to me and on their talk pages.</p>

<p>Right result on the AfD, but could you please not invoke WP:SNOW in closes if you choose to do them in the future? WP:SNOW isn't a legitimate rationale to close AfDs, and it would hold more weight in the future if you used something with a more legitimate rationale (for instance, WP:POINT).

<dd>Thanks for you sharing your concerns. In hindsight WP:SNOW does reflect badly on us to outsiders so I should probably avoid using it ever again, but it is a really convenient piece of jargon for saying "there's no point discussing this further because everyone else disagrees with you" that I've seen a few other AFD regulars cite before in the past. Perhaps WP:SNOW should be rewritten so that it doesn't read as blunt as it does now. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 15:56, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello, I'm just reading the new RfArb on KM. Somehow a misconception has arisen that the RfC on KM was started as a result of a block that she made. That is actually incorrect. I filed the RFC first, and it had already been seconded and commented on before Kelly made the controversial block. Therefore, the question of whether the block was valid or not became an additional topic of conversation for the ongoing RfC, but it was not a causal event in the filing of the RfC. You may want to ammend your statement at the RfArb so as to make clear that this was NOT the "block in the case in question that spawned the RfC". Thanks for your consideration. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 15:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand you have an interest in saving articles like this. It was up for speedy deletion, I put up a hangon template, and I left a pretty reasonable note on why it should go to AfD. I'm not interested in taking it, so I'll let whoever tagged it take it there. I don't like articles like that, but I don't think it's a speedy candidate. Showing one's genitalia as an act of disrespect is found in many, many cultures. I read that pre-Muslim Middle Eastern women did it in the presence of their husbands to another man to show the other guy what he couldn't have. There's an article there, but no one to write it. What's there now is crap.

I'd rather have articles on a hundred garage bands than one article on a minor character in a cult sci-fi series. I think there's a kernel of sociological importance there, it just isn't discussed in the article. Maybe I'll check Google scholar.

<p>Jeff, Speedy closing as keep is not so out of process for it to be a major concern. If SM intends to listen to you, he will stop. If not, further comments to him will not change his mind.

<p>You may be sick of hearing it, but here's an additional two cents: Any practice that helps resolve uncontroversial cases quickly can only be good, right? 5 days on Afd is a typical case, not a requirement. Of course maybe the issue is that what seems uncontroversial to some may not look that way to others. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it is a requirement. That's what the deletion policy calls for, and we have specific requirements for early closes. Imagine if we said "Aw, hell, we don't need to follow <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> on this guy." It'd never fly. Otherwise, you're right - uncontroversial cases should be dealt with quickly and painlessly. The problem? Every time I bring it up at speedy keep, I get shot down. This tells me that people largely want the full process. So what's left? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:02, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What makes you think it's a requirement? As you going on the exact wording of some Wikipedia: page as it existed at some particular point in time? At various other times, it's been clear that 5 days is a typical case and is not set in stone. This is the conundrum of "Wikipedia policy"- it's not what's written on the pages- that changes too much. Anyway, rules aside, what would be the point of having it set in stone, anyway? There's nothing magical about 5 days that means you can get the right answer only after that much time. One thing that might be a factor here- you very frequently end up being in the minority of "keep" people on some articles. If you're trying to speedy keep THOSE, of course it'll be shot down. That's as it should be. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:09, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

What's the point? The 5 day window is there to give it an objective time length designed to give an article a fair hearing. I noted 10 of them to SM, but only one - <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Ontario_c7fa.html" title="Boston, Ontario">Boston, Ontario</a>, was brought to WP:DRV. Why? Other issues that came up.

<dd>Not all policies are created equal. The core part of the deletion policy is "Crap gets deleted, good stuff gets kept". The actions today weren't violating that policy, merely expediting it.

<dd>But you <i>are</i> wrong jeff. You fundamentally misunderstand how wikipedia works, and has always worked. It has <i>never</i> had 'rules' (except NPOV and V) and <i>never</i> obliged people to studiously follow them. IAR isn't some rogue new concept, it is an integral part of this encyclopedia. You want wikipedia to be something it isn't, hasn't been, and never will be. You are getting all this grief because you are trying to enforce 'rules' that simply don't exist - and disrupting a system that actually works. Our guiding aim is the encyclopedia, and our only solid process is common sense. If you think wikipedia should change as fundamentally as you seem to, then you really need to take it up with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> and see if you can convince him - because otherwise you are on a hiding to nothing. We can all have some impact here and there, and suggest a few improvements and changes, but if you are looking for such fundamental reform you are really dreaming up a different project altogether.

<dd>I've been looking for one for months where it is applicable, Tony. I can't think of any, and I certainly can't think of any that would be so egregious that a policy couldn't be crafted to deal with a problem policy doesn't solve. I'll say it again, Tony - why not try and craft policy to work toward how you want things to be?

<dd>Jeff, I see your efforts as being motivated by the best intent. I 100% agree that WP:SNOW is from the pit of Hell and smells like smoke—that is to say, it is a destructive rather than constructive bit of fluff that will often be seen as giving partisan bureaucrats <i>carte blanche</i> to jump the gun on straw polls, etc. To the other editors: BadlyDrawnJeff has always edited in good faith in my experience, and I would suggest seriously considering his objections. Seeing BDJ this vehement is a good indication to me that something is amiss, and I think that the root of the problem is the potential for steamrolling that WP:SNOW creates. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 21:22, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, as I've told you on a half-dozen other occasions, the problem is your worship of policy. The reality of the situation (WP:SNOW) is evident, but you seem to prefer worshipping the process than achieving the result. Respect for Policy and Process is <b>not</b> diminished by intelligent people and the community ignoring the rules when appropriate. It focuses us on the result, not the process. I don't think you accept that axiom, an axiom at the core of WP - and so at this point I think it is becoming clear that you have a fundamental misunderstanding of WP. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 14:32, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to just ramble on here for a couple of minutes, so please do bear with me. It might come to a point eventually.</p>
<p>I started editing maybe 17 months ago, something like. In late July I got <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_20_Cent_Quest_cafb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The 20 Cent Quest">very cranky</a> with the stretching of facts like silly-putty in discussions, leading to an escalating series of incivilities on both sides over many months. The arbitration commitee eventually reminded all parties to remain civil "even in stressful situations." I took several wiki-holodays, even wrote one or two "get bent Wikipedia, I'm gone" messages on my userpage.</p>
<p>But I eventually found my pace. I'm just as opposed now as I was then to the obfuscation, double-talk, and outright falsehood that takes the place of discourse. Other parties are just as rude, arrogent, and down-right nasty as they ever were. I however have taken the <i>very long</i> view. I'm going to be here as long as this project goes on, in all likelyhood. I have faith that, eventualy, sweet reason wil pour down and we'll get things straight. As long as I don't give myself an anurism first.</p>
<p><small>Here comes the point.</small><br />
You've copped a lot of flak over the last couple of days, and a metric bucket-load over the last couple of weeks. Some civil, quite a bit of it not. I sense a growing exasperation as evidenced by the fact that you're getting easier to bait, and I am concerned for your future with the project.</p>
<p>While I often disagree with you, I often agree with you too, and respect your passion and your willingness to provide a dissident voice. I'd hate to see you burn out and fade away. I've got several healthy doses of geological time-scale laying around that I'm happy to share with you. Find your pace, mate. All will be right in the end, even if we simply have to outlive everyone else. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 23:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm glad you left this. I nearly burned out a month ago, but that's finally getting resolved and I look forward to it. I'm more angry at this point that only one person has even bothered to actually back me on this. I appreciate your attempts at mediation - and I meant it when I said I trust you more than generally anyone else on the wiki - but, at some point, you just sit there and say "why the hell is everyone defending this?" I mean, I understand a couple of them (insert cabal comment here), but I think that's the most infuriating part. The guy was wrong. What's it gonna take.</dd>
<dd>Either way, I'm not going anywhere. I have a FAC review going, I have projects I'm still working on, and, yes, I'm still gonna work at AfDs. But at some point, the bullshit's gotta stop, y'know.

<dd>Wot Aaron said. Don't lose it, and as I said before I think you should save your righteous anger for something that really matters. You will <i>never</i> achieve consensus to make process immutably enforceable, and there are more compelling reasons for <i>not</i> having it enforceable than for having it so. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> goes back a long way and WP:SNOW is only shorthand for "why waste any more time when the result is clear".

<dd>I have noticed it, absolutely. It makes it doubly frustrating - it means that the position I want people to take is being forced as opposed to accepted. I don't want to force content. I don't want to force results, because it leaves openings for what are actually misguided challenges later.

<dl>
<dd>Hmm, I admire anyone's effort to fix the culture here, but to me it looks like there are way more important fish to fry. I wouldn't <i>want</i> to see a culture of "always follow an exact procedure without trying to introduce individual judgment"- that might not be what you'd say you're aiming for, but trying to make sure procedures are always followed to the letter is pretty close to that. There <i>is</i> a real problem with the culture of certain admins thinking it's always acceptable to steamroll over those who disagree, but trying to enforce process for process's sake when the answer is already clear is just, well, a time-waster. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, here's the situation, I'll use a personal example. I went to great lengths to try to codify in speedy keep what we already do in terms of articles such as <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, or articles like <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">Girlfriend</a> - they're consistently closed early because we know that there won't be any consensus to delete them given the amount of discussion in the past. It makes sense, but there's absolutely nothing to actually allow for it. So I went to speedy keep, I went to every policy board I could think of, the AfD talk pages, AfDs themselves, and advertised the change I wanted to make. It was uncontroversial, I made the change, I invoked the change, a shitstorm develops, and the consensus at speedy keep was to NOT allow for the closing of repeat offenders that had consensus keeps like this. So what does this tell me? The community does <i>not</i> approve of this sort of thing. They want the AfDs to go 5 days, they want the full hearings. There's a tendency for those of us knee-deep in project spaces and in/close to administrative roles to not realize what's going on with the articles and with how people rely on these processes, and they don't challenge them because of the fear of stadning up to administrative power or simply not knowing about the appeals processes available.</dd>
<dd>What I <i>want</i> is the same thing that so many people here want - to be able to skip the long stuff when things are blatantly obvious. The problem is that the way to go about it is not to declare it and throw your weight around, and that's what's being done here. I'm simply pushing back on those until we're able to craft our operations with our day to day "what we're already kinda doing." --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've given up on written policy, some time back. The stuff that's written on the pages marked "policy" isn't really the REAL policy. Actual policy is whatever you can do without stirring up a ruckus. I notice this all the time with the criteria for speedy deletion- many of them are fairly ridiculous and wrong. All we really need are admins with decent judgment (and a willingness to seek second opinions when there's disagreement) who delete on the basis of "are we better off with or without this content?" Anyway I dunno if I have much of a point, other than, don't confuse Wikipedia policy with the <i>pages</i> maked "Wikipedia policy"- they're not, and may never be, the same thing. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:57, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's that "not causing a ruckus" part that worries me. I'd love to give up on it, but once you do that, you leave the door open for a <i>lot</i> of poor decisions, and since we can no longer trust DRV to overturn improper deletion decisions, as an example, it leaves folks like me at a loss. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:05, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe it's a philosophical difference of opinion, but I don't see that good decisions particularly come from following a rigid process- I think they come from collaboration and transparency. When you've got a sufficient number of reasonable editors looking at a particular siutuation, it will tend toward improvement over time. I've sometimes seen astoundingly bad results on Afd and on Drv, sure- but leaving things there for longer doesn't really help prevent this. I think we should just do what seems sensible, quickly and easily- but then, if there's disagreement, it's probably time for a more thorough discussion. I frequently undelete things without waiting 5 days (or whatever) at DRV for example- do you see that sort of thing as somehow harmful? To me it just seems sensible- the amount of effort required to UNDO something should not be disproportionate to the amount of effort it took to DO the thing in the first place. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:20, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think what Jeff is trying to do would fix anything, actually. Tony looks first at the content and its encyclopaedic value, and only second at guidelines. Making guidelines more enforceable is going to make it harder to apply common sense in the face of mindless opposition. If Jeff wants to fix the culture then he has my support, but the place where culture is broken is places like AfD where the sheer volume of junk articles submitted makes people terse and dismissive. <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> was looking to fix that but has not, in that the fans of garage bands are always going to challenge deletion. Fundamentally in my view there is no way to convert more than a small minority of garage band fans into good Wikipedians committed to making an encyclopaedia (as opposed to promoting their garage band). Their hobby is the band, not Wikipedia. I have an idea, which I can't really commit to right now (I'm moving house on Friday and will lose connectivity for a while) to gather a small group of committed individuals like Tony, Jeff, some of the other familiar faces, and really focus on AfD for a couple of days. Fix uncivil nominations, refactor excessively brusque comments, leave talk messages for those who make such comments. And yes I freely admit that I am among the worst offenders at times, so that means me as well. It would require that we do not take a part in those debates (advocating neither keep nor delete) but simply that we rigorously police <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> for a couple of days and see if it makes any difference.

<p>Jeff, I just want you to know that I don't agree with some of the rather nasty things that are being said on this talk page. We have a disagreement about an issue but I don't think you're trolling on this.</p>
<p>I think that the problem that most editors who complain here have with your behavior on the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Ontario_c7fa.html" title="Boston, Ontario">Boston, Ontario</a> issue is that you are doing something that could almost be the typical example for our essay on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">wikilawyering</a>, particularly "Asserting that technical interpretation of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> should override the principles they express."</p>
<p>Certainly if you genuinely think that there is a chance that the closing of a deletion process will be reversed on discussion, you should always feel free to revert an invocation of the Wikipedia:snowball clause. Nobody disputes that. It's when you say things like "my hand has been tipped, the camel's back has been broken" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_20&amp;diff=70967665&amp;oldid=70966928" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_20&amp;diff=70967665&amp;oldid=70966928" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and "If I have to do a one-man crusade to protect it, so be it" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_20&amp;diff=70972388&amp;oldid=70971729" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_August_20&amp;diff=70972388&amp;oldid=70971729" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and use that to justify repeated legalistic challenges to quite reasonable actions with which you disagree, it's then that you appear to be telling us that you're beyond the reach of reason and are determined to follow a policy of obstructionism. It's then that you appear to be announcing your wish to cause disruption in order to change the way things are done on Wikipedia. This is, I think, why so many people have complained. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 12:40, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can understand people's frustration with my tactics at this point. I'm totally understanding of it, and I mean it. The problems aren't simple anymore, that's all. It's a culture thing, and edit warring over snowball closes, to use your example, is going to do a lot more damage short and long term than the original action does, and pointing out the issues in a reasonable manner on the talk page as opposed to challenging every single close at DRV (which I would be well within my rights to do) makes more sense. What do I get from it? Hostility, and the same old characters ganging up on me because I dare challenge the incorrect conventional wisdom. Imagine how mcuh of this could have been avoided if, for instance, SM said "yeah, you know what, I did close these wrong, I see what you're saying." Or, instead of people accusing me of trolling, correcting the root cause. I'm glad you're being reasonable about this with me right now, but if you don't mind my using you as an example, why don't you simply try to make what you're doing legitimate and head off the issues? I'm not sure what else I can do, but giving up on it isn't an option for me.</dd>
<dd>I'm open to reason - anyone who's not just aware of my conflicts regarding this specific issue knows this. But reason is a two way street, is it not? What else am I supposed to do when people go out of their way to not support what's an entirely logical and substantive issue here? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:35, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Part of the problem is that I tend to take on issues that have wide support amongst a small, but vocally significant, group of editors, many of which tend to be admins. People don't like to be challenged as a human, instinctual thing. It's why it's more of a change of culture than a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearts_and_minds.html" title="Hearts and minds">hearts and minds</a> issue - the problem isn't so much what I'm advocating much of the time, but rather who is advocating against it. You're certainly right on the surface, I've abandoned more than a few different policy and guideline changes based on that. But true, reasoned consensus and vocal shout-downs aren't always similar. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:22, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Jeff, I just wanted to let you know that I've been following this discussion and I feel you are being unfairly ganged up on. Your comment on Maggot's talk page that he not speedily close the Boston, Ontario AfD was a civil and reasonable request, as <a href="../../../s/y/n/User_talk%7ESynergeticMaggot_Archive_3_b1d9.html#Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion.2FBoston.2C_Ontario_redux" title="User talk:SynergeticMaggot/Archive 3">another admin has noted</a>. FOR SM to reply that you "Try rereading Speedy Keep" must have been very irritating. For him to then quote the <s>policy</s> guideline to you, proving he was incorrect, was inexplicable. Also, I automatically have no love for people who say things like "I'm very capable of closing by myself, without any comments as to how it can or cannot be closed." Finally, I see nothing you have done being anywhere close to "harrassment". Discussion is paramount, and to try to close honest discussions with "Stop harassing SynergeticMaggot" is deplorable.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to get into the debate over how, whether, and when AfD's should be speedily closed (not in this post anyway). I'm just saying that the way you have been treated is completely anti-thetical to all of the civility policies of Wikipedia. Editors, and especially admins, do need to explain their actions, and they are required to respond civilly to people who take issue with them. I feel that Samir acted in the exactly correct way an admin should, while Synergetic Maggot acted in the worst possible way. --<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey"><font color="#000080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>N</strong></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>scheffey</strong></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/s/c/User_talk%7ENscheffey_d4cb.html" title="User talk:Nscheffey">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nscheffey_b4d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nscheffey">C</a>)</sup> 20:55, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Jeff. Sorry, you were wrong about their site being a reliable source for information about tours etc. Subjects' own sites are generally considered reliable for information about the source, but this applies mainly to trivial biographical data and corporate data. Claims to fame on websites should not be taken at face value. Examples were cited in the AfD where spurious claims have been made, but actually it's more obvious than that: the reliability will vary according to how much incentive there is to make inflated claims, and how likely it is that such claims will be challenged. So although we can say form their website that the band claims to have done X, we cannot say without corroboration that the band <i>has</i> done X. I thikn that really you know this. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:36, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still disagree, especially when it comes to band websites. I quoted the applicable policy/guideline on it, and I still think I was right. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:05, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A band website is no more reliable than a blog. It's OK as it goes, but before we can rely on the information for anything substantive it needs to be corroborated. It's a primary source. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:43, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No one's looking for it to be substantive, but it's perfectly okay when you're talking about notability, which is expressly allowed. Along the same vein I'm also disappointed in your comments at the Axe Murder Boyz DRV for similar reasons, even though there's room for an AfD there, too. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:11, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree: in respect of whether the article should be kept or not, the band's own website is not reliable. Who's going to provide evidence of their own anonymity on their website? Resume padding is far too easy. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:16, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As someone who's worked with a couple bands regarding website stuff, lying about their press or their appearances are not somehting they do for various reasons that I hadn't even thought of until it was explained. Let's just say I've heard stories of bands that can't play in some towns now because they lied about prior bookings and got blacklisted. It doesn't happen to a degree that we should worry about. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:20, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have blocked you for three hours. Close the computer. Go outside. Play frisbee. Eat an ice cream cone. When you return, I hope your mood is better, and I hope you are better able to avoid personal attacks, insults, insinuations, and incivility.</p>

<dd>Toning it down is a good idea, but I'm not sure blocking was helpful. Sure, it's only 3 hours, but still.

<p>What I saw was a pattern of increasingly more frantic responses to every comment on that page, by Jeff, increasingly strident and directed <i>at editors</i> (Cyde, obviously, but more disturbingly SCZenz and Drini), capped off with "I question your ability to administer with this in mind." Civil arguments are addressed to <i>topics</i>, not ad hominem. I see no reason to believe that pattern wouldn't continue and worsen. Hence, he gets a refreshing break. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 16:58, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not to belabor the point, but there's a big difference between a personal attack ("You're a poopie head!") and criticism of behavior. Comments about the competance of an admin are relevant to the project. We should always take care to distinguish between criticism and an attack. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:08, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not to belabor the point right back, but Jeff wasn't criticizing Drini and SCZEnz for their <i>behavior</i>, but for their <i>beliefs</i>. In my opinion, in context, that was incivil. I accept that others disagree. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 17:11, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Frantic, I'll accept - I was trying to avoid constant edit conflicts. But then again, if saying I'm losing faith in an administrator's ability to do their job properly is blockable, then there's a lot of ArbComm situations that'll have some major implications if that's the standard. Regardless, I'm unblocked, so it's a done deal. I'm approachable, if you have a problem with me in the future, come to me first, seriously. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:31, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
