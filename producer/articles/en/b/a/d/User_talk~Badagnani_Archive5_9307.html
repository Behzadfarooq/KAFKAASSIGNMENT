<p>Hey, Bad. Would you be willing to assist me on the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Omaha%2C_Nebraska_5389.html" title="North Omaha, Nebraska">North Omaha, Nebraska</a> article? There's a newbie there that created the article &amp; an anon edit (they may be both the same person) whom are putting a lot of flat out inaccurate and NPOV information on about North Omaha in the article. I think they have a <b>huge</b> misunderstanding of a lot of Wikipedia policies. Any help you might be would be appriciated. Thanks. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquinox137_84c2.html" title="User:Equinox137">Equinox137</a> 03:44, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for your note--but I'm afraid I don't know anything about North Omaha. If the "progressive" adjective seems out of place, I'd say it sounds somewhat POV unless it's generally agreed that this is the case (progressive usually meaning "liberal," "open-minded," politically pluralistic/inclusive) and this aspect is noted in published articles about the neighborhood, etc. I'd say, for example, that Madison, Wisconsin or maybe Shaker Heights, Ohio might be considered "progressive" according to such reasoning. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 04:15, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough. Here's the situation I face: North Omaha is probably Omaha's equivalent to East St. Louis, Watts, etc...it's a very rough area of the city and there is a lot of gang violence, drug activity, etc...Due to events in Omaha's history, namely the <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omaha_Race_Riot_of_1919_970e.html" title="Omaha Race Riot of 1919">Omaha Race Riot of 1919</a>, the city has been racially segregated with the north being majority African-American in population.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The creator of the article wants to describe North Omaha as "considered the urban center and one of Omaha's most progressive communities" (which doesn't seem to be in a political context) and having a "a rich diversity of cultures" (which is flat out inaccurate.) Furthermore, he has deleted legimatate sources I have provided that allude not only to the crime problem that area of the city faces, but attempts by the community to obtain a solution - calling adding that information "vandalism." It would be really helpful if a third party could explain to this individual exactly how wikipedia views vandalism, factual accuracy (citing sources), and NPOV policy. If you don't want to get involved in this one, I'll understand... Thanks <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquinox137_84c2.html" title="User:Equinox137">Equinox137</a> 06:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, from what you say about it, what's written about this place sounds inaccurate. Why not get some of the regular contributors to the Omaha or Nebraska articles to comment? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 06:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll go ahead &amp; do that, however I don't know too much Omaha editors that well. Mainly the assistance I need is a more experienced (and neutral) editor than I to explain basicly how Wikipedia works. The creator (again, a newbie) is under the impression that because he created the article, that's it "belongs" to him and he is the sole authority on what stays and goes. Again, if you don't want to get involved in this one, I'll understand... <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquinox137_84c2.html" title="User:Equinox137">Equinox137</a> 06:12, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for you help, Bad. By the way, if you're interested in the Law Enforcement points of view as it relates to Kent State and incidents like it (although I don't think Kent State has been directly mentioned yet), (<a href="http://www.officer.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.officer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.officer.com/</a>) might be a good source of a law enforcement officer's perspective. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquinox137_84c2.html" title="User:Equinox137">Equinox137</a> 06:30, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added the redirects for these words to <a href="../../../p/u/-/Pu-erh_tea.html" title="Pu-erh tea">pu-erh tea</a>. What I meant was that I thought someone moved the original redirects from **** to ****_tea. Can't say I've seen the words on tea boxes, but then again the teas I buy usually do not come with English labels. I'll ask my Cantonese friends about the bo"yi" v.s. bo"lay" question. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 22:59, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll put that into the page when I have access to a computer where I can set chinese typing. I've had the foojoy stuff before. It's not bad, but to me it's always a bit too "composty" for enjoyment.

<p>Copy and pasted the characters in. My opinion (and solely mine) on Pu-erh's popularity in Hongkong is that they have some of the easiest access to much of the teas from Yunnan and due to demand has become popularized and even,"hyped" up worldwide. I would not say it's not popular in Yunnan, if that were the case the tradition for tea production would not have been passed on in the "low" periods. Still, currently much of the good stuff produced is shipped out of Yunnan, so I don't know how much access the population there has to good pu-erh tea. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 23:37, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh, it's no problem for me, either way.

<p>I really don't know if they're planning to go that route or not, but, as I said on the FUC talk page today, this "totally free" thing is a pipe dream they're going to still be chasing ten or more years from now. Ironically, "fair use" images are probably the safest stuff they have, because it's pretty easy to source them. The images under the various licenses will be the first to get attacked in any sort of legal argument because there's some ambiguity. This group of admins (and it appears to be a pretty small but vocal group) haven't quite figured out that idealistically wanting something and reality rarely align. -- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadScott_1fe6.html" title="User:ChadScott">ChadScott</a> 03:32, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've put back the sentence (rephrased). It's just I prefer a more absolute interpretation of music, I don't know if that's the right word, you know the idea of music of being music itself, not that music can't evoke certain feelings or imagery. Also expressing waterfalls etc is open to POV, and I though it might be better to be as objective as possible. <a href="../../../l/d/h/User%7ELDHan_af5b.html" title="User:LDHan">LDHan</a> 18:48, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok first time putting something in discussion but here I go. Thanks for the quick edit on the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andres_Quintana_Roo_711a.html" title="Andres Quintana Roo">Andres Quintana Roo</a> article. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlixb_5dc1.html" title="User:Alixb">Alixb</a> 14 November 2006</p>
<p>Your question left me thinking... "Quinto" means fifth it could be derived from there, but I have no idea if that would apply for "Quintana". As for the Roo it sounds more like a Nahuatl word but your guess is as good as mine. Quick question (probably in edit guide or something but can't find it) how is it you redirect if someone searches ie: "andres quintana roo" it shows you that there is no such article, because the proper name for it is "Andrés Quintana Roo", so how would you make it so if they type that it goes to the "Andrés Quintana Roo" article? thanks&#160;:) And nice to meet you too.</p>

<p>You're probably right about the idea that cooking wolfberries (wb) and doing so with oil probably allows one to get more of the nutrients in the wb. But this is sorta the same idea between eating tomatoes raw versus cooking it into marinara sauce. Cooking opens up the tomato cells so ones body can adsorb the nutrients. The oil used in making marinara sauce dissolves the lycopenes and other fun hydrophobic compounds, which also aid their absorption during digestion. By eating dried wb straight, you might absorb less nutrients from it, maybe. But that does not make doing so a dangerous act or even something "bad", it really becomes a personal preference. I mean, I'm certainly not going to give up eating tomatoes straight, whether in its dry or fresh forms. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 06:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's better and more managable if the main erhu article include only historically important and major players, that's why I move the list of players to its own article.

Essentially, as it says on <a href="../../../m/f/_/WP%7EMF_d9d8.html" title="WP:MF">WP:MF</a>, someone should follow up on the copyright violations in the koopal.com sites, preferably one of the contributors (i.e. copyright holders) of each affected wikipedia page. I was suggesting you might be an appropriate person for the Electric Violin, given you contributed to the page around the time it was copied, and you expressed displeasure at the same mob ripping off the Double Bass site. My message was terse, as I had just spent an awful lot of time learning about this (e.g. what I did in response to the DB page was not quite the recommended approach, but not incompatible with it) and was out of time. Let me know if you would prefer someone else follow it up, and I will put a note on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Talk%7EElectric_violin_0ca3.html" title="Talk:Electric violin">Talk:Electric violin</a>.

<p>The ultimate goal is to have no fair use images on Wikipedia, or at any rate to have only fair use images for which free images cannot <i>possibly</i> be made - a person who is dead, for instance. The goal is that <i>all</i> images on Wikipedia be able to re-used by anyone for any reason whatsoever, including in material that disparages the subject, alteration of the image to make the subject appear ridiculous, inclusion of the image in pornography, or whatever. This is the overarching goal. I personally think that its a <i>silly</i> goal, but that doesn't matter. It is what the Foundation wants, and the Foundation hosts the Wikipedia servers and thus its desires get a lot of consideration. Wikipedia may be freely forked (copied) by anyone, and perhaps someday someone will make a version where fair use images are more welcome, but this encyclopedia is not it. The images which you are contesting could at least theoretically be replaced with free images, therefore I am deleting them. You may take these to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> if you like. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 18:24, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have restored the images for the time being. I'm putting together an RfC to get wider input on the matter. I'm pretty new to image work and I don't want to do the wrong thing - although I'm pretty sure I'm in the right. But I don't know for sure, so I think wider input would be useful for both of us and for the issue as a whole. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:00, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Aulochrome.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">Replaceable fair use disputed</a>}}, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>

<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>

<p>1. This is a promotional image and such a tag is clearly allowed on Wikipedia; 2. This form of repeated delete trolling is extremely damaging and harmful to Wikipedia and its educational purpose; 3. The company from whose website the image comes has not complained and most likely will not complain about this use of this photo; 4. There are other, more pressing issues facing Wikipedia at this moment; 5. Not every editor can afford a digital camera; 6. This editor needs to cease what appears to be a vendetta against another editor strictly for the purpose of trying to teach another editor "a lesson" that is not improving Wikipedia one iota, and create his/her own content, enriching, rather than depleting Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 19:13, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. This is not a promotional image in any sense I understand. It is taken from a catalog web site, and there is no indication that the copyright holder has released the image under any license, or distributed as a promotional image eligible for re-use.</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks, but I'm afraid I was actually the one who started the CfD. &#160;:-(</p>
<p>I noticed the cats after a bunch of Korean Lees and Yis on my watchlist were tagged with Category:Lĭ, which seemed a trifle inappropriate, and not entirely unlike filing a "Schmidt" under "Smith." Then I figured that *if* we were going to permit categories like this -- and these are the only such categories I'm aware of -- we need to have a central discussion about it. So I started the CfD, which I'm beginning to regret, as -- at least before your contributions -- the discussion has been less than elevated. I share your distress at the tendency of CfD (and all XfD) voters to pile on "delete" votes without a great deal of thought, so I thank you very much for helping to bring some thought to the discussion.</p>
<p>I've added some more comments to explain my reasoning, which is somewhat different than that of most of the delete voters; I would be grateful for feedback. Perhaps there's something which distinguishes the Chinese situation from the Korean? For example, were genealogical ties lost during the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_Revolution_5b68.html" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, leading to solidarity by surname rather than lineage? I'm afraid I'm rather ignorant on these matters... Cheers, -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 07:11, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My mom makes <i>cơm rượu</i> all the time. If I remember correctly, she would just get some cooked rice, then put some yeast on it (something in a ball that she gets from the store, I'm not sure if it's yeast). After leaving it to ferment for a week, we'd have <i>cơm rượu</i>, which is kind of sweet and a little bit sour...I don't think it contains much alcohol though, although that's probably the closest thing to alcohol I've ever consumed. I live in OC, but I can also ask the people in the Vietnamese Wikipedia for help. For Tết last year, a member at vi.wiki had some pictures you can look at: <a href="../../../../vi/r/%C6%B0/%E1%BB%A3/H%C3%ACnh%7ER%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3u_n%E1%BA%BFp_c%E1%BA%A9m1.JPG_74f8.html" class="extiw" title="vi:Hình:Rượu_nếp_cẩm1.JPG">vi:Hình:Rượu nếp cẩm1.JPG</a> and <a href="../../../../vi/r/%C6%B0/%E1%BB%A3/H%C3%ACnh%7ER%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3u_n%E1%BA%BFp_c%E1%BA%A9m2.JPG_2787.html" class="extiw" title="vi:Hình:Rượu_nếp_cẩm2.JPG">vi:Hình:Rượu nếp cẩm2.JPG</a>, it's close to <i>cơm rượu</i> but it's not made from <i>cơm</i> but <i>nếp</i> (sweet rice) and food coloring.

<dd>One problem with naming the Minnan article is that the language has three names in the three major areas it is spoken. It is "Taiwanese" in Taiwan (which is considered a dialect of Minnan by Wikipedia listed under <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwanese_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Taiwanese (linguistics)">Taiwanese (linguistics)</a>), "Hokkien" in Southeast Asia (a good generic "English" name and probably the most widely used but it is ambiguous since Hokkien is Minnan for "Fujian" and could imply inclusion of Minbei, -dong, etc., or that all speakers are from orginally from Fujian), and "Minnan." Another issue complicating things is that, to linguists, <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hainanese_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Hainanese (linguistics)">Hainanese</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/o/Teochew_%28dialect%29.html" title="Teochew (dialect)">Teochew</a> are considered Minnan but are speakers do not self-identify themselves as such. I guess Minnan was chosen because the bureaucrats in China and Taiwan both like it and it is relatively inoffensive across the political spectrum. — <span style="border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../a/j/a/User_talk%7EAjaxSmack_dbd7.html" title="User talk:AjaxSmack"><font style="color:#fef;background:navy;"><b>&#160;AjaxSmack&#160;</b></font></a></span> 08:21, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Badagnani, I just wanted to thank you for inspiring me to improve more of the Hawaiian history articles. The issue regarding what terminology to use for the people who overthrew Liliuokalani has been particularly in want of improvement, and I think with some time I'll be able to build fairly decent stubs of the political parties of the Hawaiian Kingdom at the time, and use the proper "Reform Party" terminology. Most of my references come from Ernest Andrade, but I should be able to find other references in both the Blount Report, Morgan Report, Liliuokalani's book, and other online sources. I'll try to make a dent in the creation of the new articles soon, and your attention to them, and the other Hawaii articles is greatly appreciated. Thanks! --13:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it yang shen1 (nurse body), yang shen4 (nurse kidneys), yang sheng (nurse health), yang shang (nurse wounds)?

<p>I thought that yangsheng tang would be a specific type of med. soup but looking around, it really is more a class of "Med. <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_soup.html" title="Asian soup">Asian soups</a>" that are taken for health. I think you would be hard to find one kind of finished soup or one type of herbal mix. If I remember correctly, substitutions and additions are quite common, especially for "less important" ingredients.

<p>I looked around the net and asked a few herbalists. The herbalist either don't know it or those who know eithr give different recipes or ask "what type?" I'm not sure if a list those ingredients will help unless it is complete. This mainly because the first three items that you listed there are often considered "tonifiers" or you-won't-get-hurt-if-you-eat-it-but-its-good-for-you things. In fact a friend of mine uses these ingredients quite commonly in day to day cooking.

<p>The teas at the site are rather pricy, however, the site is pretty reputable and the service is pretty fast. The vendor also knows his stuff and very knowledgable. Since fakes and low quality pu-erh teas, and teas in general, abound, it is not a bad thing to pay a slightly higher premium for decent quality stuff. I think I'll begin assembling a section in pu-erh about its collection and prospecting, both of it are highly interesting, if not fanatical.</p>
<p>You might also want to try <a href="http://www.houdeasianart.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=561" class="external text" title="http://www.houdeasianart.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=561" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://www.houdeasianart.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1_13_45&amp;products_id=407" class="external text" title="http://www.houdeasianart.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1_13_45&amp;products_id=407" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which are both pretty good, if not somewhat pricy. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:08, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Note of caution. Getting into "good" teas is like getting into "good" audio equipment, you can lose you head in the process and yes, it is very very expensive&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is currently a big craze over pu-erh tea that has been building up over the past decade and does not seem to be over yet. China has found a luxery item in one of it's lesser developed provinces that it can sell and export for a good deal of dough. It's not surprising that they are promoting it to everybody and ramping it up in their own population regarding it's reportedly good attributes. The tea has pretty much dominated the scene in the maliendao, the world's largest public tea market, with it holding a high place in the tea world when just a few years back it was considered a "low class" tea. It's funny how such things go. Prospectors and collectors are popping up everwhere wishing to "get into" the tea and perhaps make some money off its rocketing costs. Rediculous prices are being listed for teas, whether it is worth it's price or not, and quality is dropping for some manufacturers. "Fakes" for highly valued teas and brands are appearing everywhere, and since many are new to the tea, not many people can tell the real from the fakes, and as such the situation becomes even more mixed up. In short, it's a mess.</p>
<p>This tea tool is bascially something like an oyster knife, which is a dull, short, double edged dagger for prying open a brick or cake of tea. Will add it later <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 14:00, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gunpowder "shap"ed green tea is made in Taiwan too but I don't think anyone calls it gunpowder tea or zhucha. I guess the issue is whether gunpowder tea can be limited to being:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rolled pellet form green tea from Zhejiang</li>
<li>Rolled pellet form green tea from anywhere</li>
<li>Rolled pellet form teas from anywhere</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I should put down that gunpowder tea is sometimes just used to describe the shape/form but the above issue needs to first be resolved. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 21:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no idea who would know more about this. I'm also not sure Zhejiang zhucha is uppity enough to have experts, perhaps someone from CNNP (中茶) in charge of Zhejiang stuff? I walked around Chinatown and found that all the Gunpowder teas have very similar packaging and all state that they are from Zhejiang. Other than ToH, there is also Camel brand (or Camel breath brand) and this other one that trys to copy ToH's layout whose brand I can't quite remember. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 22:20, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah I saw the first 3 sites, but I thought they were a bit shaky. I think the first one is what was used to "write" the varieties section. The second confirms that it's a rolled green tea, this can be used to substantiate the name gunpowder as being from the explosive stuff, it is still a bit shaky. The third one tells of the definition. that it's a green tea grown in various places. Together it seems to say that it's a rolled green tea from various places. But <a href="http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=ZK31" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=ZK31" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> it's a black tea.

<dd>Hi, I had gone through the discussion very well and there are strong arguments given to delete this. I had also gone through the comments given by you. But the categories are not suitable as English Wikipedia standards. The list would be more suitable for these case. These categories seem to be more trivial which does not fit to encyclopedia.

<p>Fanciful folk etymology? Oh yes, very very likely. But possible still though...perhaps editing it for emphasis will be a better? Or maybe just deleting?</p>
<p>The bags are filled up and tightly packaged. They are then rolled around in a circle in cycles of 5, 10, and 20 minutes. After a while, the bags are opened, repackaged and rerolled, up to three times. They are then roasted a bit more and rerolled 3 times. No idea about the shiny.

<p>Since the talk page is blocked for no reasons, I'll write here. The message you left is just POV. I agree with you that some people in the West don't consider Uighur as ethnic Chinese. But others do, because Uighur people live in China for centuries and most of them live within China. Even those who don't consider Uighurs as ethnic Chinese, they generally consider other Chinese ethnic groups that ain't that different from Han Chinese as ethnic Chinese. My wording "People of Chinese descent" doesn't say Uighur is ethnic Chinese either. <a href="../../../a/t/e/User%7EAted_7d41.html" title="User:Ated">Ated</a> 21:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Luke is right. The vehemence in the defense of the deletion, and the utter failure to even consider valid fair use claims by the half-dozen most active deleters, to me indicates that there is a plan to eventually convert our content to a commercial venture of some sort, with only a few "in the know" about this. There seems to be no other explanation for this ironclad and somewhat hysterical enforcement of these editors' interpretation of policy. I've been following the discussions and while the justification for some of the very rare images has often been very good, I've again and again seen arguments dismissed (or not responded to at all) and images summarily deleted</p>
<p>The commercial venture seems plausible to me.You downgrade the free one,as a downgraded free trial,and then you sell the real thing with images.And that's why jimmy is a so good suporter,how much did he spend from his pocket for the all project so far,is it realy a donation?What do you think?Don't you think you should do something about your conserns?--Bootstrapping 16:34, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ahh, I just barely remember that one (you don't even want to know how many reverts I make daily, really). Since the only edits from IPs, in the past week or more, seem to be this single persistent individual/bunch of POV-pushers, I've gone ahead and sprotected the page, for the time being.

<dd>I'm sorry if that re-write was misinterpreted! It was in NO WAY meant to indicate any change in my beliefs or philosophy concerning fair use on Wikipedia. I was simply trying slim down and clarify the existing policy, which was so over-written and confusing (and, frankly, more threatening and intimidating) than it needed to be. I think my edits reflect the removal of unneeded words, and the re-phrasing of sentences that were poorly constructed, at best. It was NOT meant to endorse the policy as it stands -- but if we're going to change this policy, it's going to be easier to remove all the caveats, "could be's" and "what ifs" that have sprung up along the way. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenolen_a9f9.html" title="User:Jenolen"><font color="blue">Jenolen</font></a> <a href="../../../j/e/n/User_talk%7EJenolen_d50e.html" title="User talk:Jenolen"><font color="red"><b><sup>speak it!</sup></b></font></a> 18:23, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First off, I have no issue with your "reasonable" request. &#160;:) But other changes keep getting reverted... for example, we're now back a "general blanket" in the second sentence; these are the little things I keep trying to improve. "General" and "blanket" mean the same thing -- one of them has to go! So if you want put back in a "reasonable" - I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU!

<p>I am a very strong beleiver that fair use images of living people should be permitted but the rationale altered to encourage a replaceable image to be restored immeditely if found. I have added fair use images of many living people where it is not always likely a free image will become available and it really is a very important part of the article to physically identify the subject particularly when it is an image for such media coverage anyway- but certain wikilawyers delete them even though a fair use rationale is give. Taking away the photo seriuosly affects the qulaity of the article and takes away a valuable info resource. While I do also agree with the concept of freeness, I do also take the quality of wikipedia as an encyclopedia very seriously and anything whiches compromises the qulaity of knowledge I disagree with. I suggest that the tagging is changed to this image must be deleted immeditely when a free image becomes available. THis way the article will always have the resource but will encourage a replaceable image to be found.

<p>I'm afraid that I've taken our discussion on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Wikipedia_talk:Fair_use</a> about as far as it can productively go. I know that you are insisting that the content be undeleted, but because of the legal threats which Tony1 already received, I doubt any admin is going to put themselves in the line of fire by undeleting the works at this time. If you'd really like to try to argue why these works should be permitted under Wikipedia's polices and goals, then you should respond on one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_talk:Prelude%2C_3rd_English_Suite.ogg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_talk:Prelude%2C_3rd_English_Suite.ogg" rel="nofollow">image pages</a> or on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohann_Sebastian_Bach_bee8.html" title="Talk:Johann Sebastian Bach">Talk:Johann Sebastian Bach</a>. Your argument should be based on Wikipedia's policies and the fundamental goals of Wikipedia as a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_content.html" title="Free content">Free content</a> encyclopedia since these are generally somewhat harder to satisfy than copyright law. Beyond that all I can tell you to do is pound sand.

<dd>No attacks on you intended (of course!), but many editors, myself included, have had about as much of this "tag without discussion, admin deletes, then sorry that happened, you can discuss some more now but the files are not being restored" as we can take. You said so yourself (your comment "...the question is moot"). Many of us have been endlessly patient and polite but if no responsibility is taken for these actions (tagging without discussion, then often deletion within the mandated 7 days), we appear to be a lawless place, and one dismissive and discourteous to long-time, knowledgeable and productive contributors that in many cases spent a great deal of time selecting and uploading those files. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 04:38, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, there was discussion prior to deletion. You speak of a lawless place, but it is true lawlessness when we ignore our fundamental mission of free content and our obligations under copyright law. I've invited you over and over again to explain why these works are permissible, but you seem far more interested in calling for my head. On the J. S. Bach talk page there are messages from multiple users who explain why we can not use these samples. Why don't you go read them and respond. As far as time goes, I invite you to look at my numerous free contributions <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user=Gmaxwell&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user=Gmaxwell&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, which include a number of audio recordings (including a little Bach snippet someplace). I understand the investment of time that goes into the work we present to the world, but thats why I care about the freeness of that work. The world already has several good non-free encyclopedias, and they are already available to most at no cost.</dd>
<dd>When you have found the time to respond to Makemi and Mindspillage, as well as the points I made on the image_talk pages for the audio, we can discuss things further.

<dd>Hi, I did read all relevant and linking commentary to that quote and find that the quote speaks for itself. It was not taken out of context and says what it says: the media is gone so the question is moot; that makes Wikipedia better. Of course, you're free to comment on or present your own interpretation of your quote, but to me the meaning is very clear. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 05:22, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is not what I said. I was pestering Tony1 to make it clear to me that he was actually claiming that no free replacement could exist for those files, as he wrote on the media pages. I asked him twice without answer, and after the files were deleted I came back to tell him not to bother answering. This is clear in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATony1&amp;diff=96332132&amp;oldid=96319225" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATony1&amp;diff=96332132&amp;oldid=96319225" rel="nofollow">the difflink</a> that I was replying to my own comment, which was even indicated in my edit summary. If indeed my comment speaks for itself, why do then insist on your preferred out-of-context rendition of it rather than the link I provided? I think you are being horribly mean about this and I really wish you would stop. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 05:26, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadagnani_Archive5_9307.html" title="Edit section: Free content">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Free content</span></h2>
<p>Greetings. I've noticed you talking about Wikimedia's motives for minimizing use of non-free content. Have you seen the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/2/28/Wikimedia_2006_fs.pdf" class="external text" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/2/28/Wikimedia_2006_fs.pdf" rel="nofollow">financial statement</a>? No one here is getting wealthy from this. I don't know what your motivation is to continue airing those theories, but I would like at least to know you've seen all the information available to you before airing them.</p>
<p>We all want to create the best resource possible within the restrictions of our mission. However, the mission is defined as being to promote the development of free content. Putting up a reference work available free of charge is no big deal. Plenty of reference works are available that way; even Britannica has up an abridged version free of charge for anyone to view. For Wikipedia to be simply another, more inconsistently-edited version of that is no great innovation. What is an innovation is the idea that people will wish to makes this free as in speech— and "free" means any purpose, not just noncommercial use.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that it would be great to have the highest-quality media possible. But if the sort of media available commercially were easily available for any use, we wouldn't need to exist. You can't take an unfree photograph and use it for whatever you want, say, to put on your CD cover, or to crop and filter and use in a collage. You can't take unfree media and use it on your website without permission, or make more than a trivial sample part of your own musical work. There's a reason it's not done more often: licensing fees are prohibitively expensive, and rights are difficult to get. We want to provide content that is easy to reuse... which, as it happens, means there will be none of the exorbitant licensing fees that make the record companies so wealthy.</p>
<p>Some of us believe that ensuring that there is new content being created and distributed, that isn't locked up by corporate interests, is an important goal. Allowing uses that are very dubiously legal for us, if at all, and not legal for downstream users, discourages people from creating new free content to replace it. (The uses that are clearly fair, where no substitute is even possible, aren't in dispute.) And that's harmful to us, in the long term. The project is barely six years old, and there are over a million files of free media uploaded to Commons already; this for a project that was barely known for the first few years. You may not find media you want for an article in the next few months. But what about over the next several years, now that Wikipedia is a household name? This is very much a project for the long term.</p>
<p>From the FAQ on the Foundation website: "The mission of the Wikimedia Foundation is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally." That's our motivation, the one we are bound to abide by, and the one our media policies are meant to further. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Kat Walsh</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill your mind?)</a> 21:21, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your comments on the straw poll page under Jimbo Wales after he blanked were reverted by Abu etc. You may, or may not, wish to revert. I know you're a member of this page as well, but I found the Resources section to be very interesting in terms of defining history <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_Use_Publicity_Photo_Advocacy_799d.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair Use/Publicity Photo Advocacy">Wikipedia:Fair_Use/Publicity_Photo_Advocacy</a>.

The idea is to try to get more high quality free music content on Wikipedia.

Though they do smell bad when fresh, when de-headed, washed, and dried, <i>D. indusiatus</i> stalks and "baskets" should not have any taste or smell.

<dd>You are right, Jajang or its Chinese equivalent ("Zhajiang" in Chinese, sounds the same) is usually made from Tianmianjiang. "Zhajiang" in Chinese means fried sauce, the sauce bit usually referring to Tianmianjiang and the "fried" refers to stir-frying.</dd>
<dd>I'm pretty sure Hoisin Sauce and Tianmianjiang are different things, becuase <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Kum_Kee_f091.html" title="Lee Kum Kee">Lee Kum Kee</a> makes both. According to <a href="../../../h/o/i/Hoisin_Sauce_44f2.html" title="Hoisin Sauce">Hoisin Sauce</a> it is made from soybeans. The bottle in my fridge lists soy beans first, but also wheat flour.</dd>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't really have any "expertise" with Chinese cuisine, I just happen to know the names of the things I have eaten. But I'll try to help out anyway I can.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay. I've been a bit inactive lately -- and probably will be for at least another week.</p>
<p>I see you figured out the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danmuji.html" title="Danmuji">danmuji</a> situation. Interestingly, that seems to be generally regarded as a Japanese, rather than a Korean, form of pickled radish -- which seems about right, it's never really <i>tasted</i> like kimchi to me. Guess we should have an article on jjanji (summer radish kimchi), someday.</p>
<p>귤나무 is the correct name for the tree <a href="http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=116666" class="external autonumber" title="http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=116666" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> ... the fruits are commonly called 귤 <a href="http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=255471&amp;v=44" class="external autonumber" title="http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=255471&amp;v=44" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> , or 감귤, or 제주감귤, though these names can sometimes refer to <i>all</i> sweet citrus fruits <a href="http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=4063" class="external autonumber" title="http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=4063" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> <a href="http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=275739&amp;v=45" class="external autonumber" title="http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=275739&amp;v=45" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. In practice, I think, <i>gamgyul</i> is fairly unambiguous.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure about jajang (sauce). I had always thought it was the same sauce as is used in standard bokkeumbap, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Shows what I know. :-) If the sauce is only used in jajangmyeon, it can probably be covered adequately in the <a href="../../../j/a/j/Jajangmyeon.html" title="Jajangmyeon">jajangmyeon</a> article.</p>
<p>I'm really not sure about the hanja in <i>seolleongtang</i>. They seem to be used almost exclusively in Japanese and Chinese websites, and to turn up in Korean sources only when the etymology is being discussed. Given that, and given that they don't actually pertain to the modern spelling of the word, perhaps they should be restricted to the Etymology section?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if that article is talking about hasma, to me it seemed a bit vague.</p>
<p>As for porkfu or roufu I think it so similar to <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rousong.html" title="Rousong">rousong</a> that perhaps it should begin as a section there? <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suppose there can be an article for pork fu, but it's so similar pork sung, unless it can be expanded I'm not sure it's the best thing to do right now.</p>
<p>And yes, the jianshui does mean lye-water. The treatment of the precooked rice causes it to turn into a bright yellow. The same technique is applied to some noodles to give them a yellow colour. The process also gives the products a distictive "jian" flavour (no not a caustic taste). <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 23:57, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, yes I am, but I don't know if there is a standard romanisation form anywhere... if there is, I don't know it. So I try my best... this one is quite easy because it is close to the Mandarin pronunciation. In other cases it would be much harder.

<li>Jian flavour is this slight "stinky" off flavour that reminds me of century eggs. Jian zong are usually eaten dipped in granulated sugar.</li>
<li>The wide sheets are a kind of cellophane noodles. They emphasize the "boucy" texture of these noodles by allowing more chewing.</li>
<li>zong粽 is to zongzi粽子 as li梨(pear) is to lizi梨子. The first is a general class, the second is a "culturally assumed" type or sub-class/item from the general class. At least this is my understanding. As such zongzi粽子 must be bamboo-leaf wrapped and made of glutinous rice, while zong粽 can be anything from perenakan zong to tamales(mexican zong) <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 00:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>No, it's right, but I think it does not really work in the intro since they're just zongzi with different fillings. I think they probably belong in one of the sections <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 01:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that they're called "bún tàu" more often than "bún tào".

<p>The links you added are inappropriate as they are commercial websites selling the product. As such they cannot be trusted to provide factual or reliable information about it. Surely there must be non-commercial sources of information about this subject?</p>
<p>Edited to add: I can identify two major problems with using commercial websites as links and/or sources of information. The first is that they simply cannot be considered reliable sources of factual information; their purpose is to sell a product. Second, once one commercial source is linked, why stop there?

<p>I see you are a very busy Wikipedian indeed, but I'd like to question your format revisions to three of Caudill's books I listed. You asked the question, why do certain books have two publication dates? The reason is that the first date is the original publication, usually in hardback, and the second, after the publsher, is for the new edition, revised edition, paperback, etc. I am not familiar with any bibliographic citation format that includes the country as in your addition of "United States" when that is obvious from the city and state. And why just three of the books, not all? And New York is repeated in one --why? City and state? Unnecessary. I seems to me you have introduced an inconsistent format without reason. Why not use a simple, standard format like I was doing? Isn't that the Wiki objective? <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwalls_b94b.html" title="User:Dwalls">Dwalls</a> 22:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
