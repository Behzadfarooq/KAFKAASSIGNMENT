	    <p>Badang was a legend: But what kind of legend? His legend does not have a meaning unlike Sang Nila Utama, who founded Singapore. So thus the legeng might be untrue. Anyway, the legend is this: There was once a strong young man called Badang. He had had strength since as a young boy, but when a new ruler came to the throne in the country where Badang lived, he wanted a new palace built and thus ordered all boys which were to be his slaves to be brought to him and be given a test. The boys were required to lift a whole tree, which was impossible for any ordinary man, let alone a boy. So of course, Badang and the boys of the country had to become his slaves. Now, Badang was to reach his 18th birthday soon, and anyone who reached the age of 18 and still could not lift the enormous tree were to be his slaves for life. And if the king died before those slaves, they were to be buried with him. So Badang was very worried indeed. He had tried many times but had always failed. Was he to meet his doom? He did not know, and the week after next was his birthday, which he now dreaded. He somehow had to get more strength. One day, he went for a walk to think about his future. He went to sit a little farther away from the slaves' fishing nets, where the slaves caught food to eat. Now, just as he sat down under the tree that would be his doom test, he spotted a slight movement near HIS fishing net. He quickly walked over, and saw a terribly huge beast, but yet it looked gentle. So he called out,"Who dares to eat from MY fishing net?". The beast immediately cried out,"Oh!I am so sorry. I was just too hungry to go without food. Please forgive me; I will grant you a wish." Badang cried with glee;" I want super inhuman strength that shall free me!" There fore he was given a pill to eat and true enough, he now had super strength. Without further ado, he went to find the king. When he grabbed the tree up, however, the king did not believe him and brought him elsewhere just in case the tree had been chopped. But when Badang still could lift the tree, the king was so amazed that Badang was instantly set free. Badang was soon famous all over the country. He was asked by the king to become an army commander, the youngest ever age to be. His mother was overjoyed and as being an army commander, he was given a small but yet grand house to live in, together with lots of riches. He then celebrated his birthday with a bash and lived happily ever after.</p>
