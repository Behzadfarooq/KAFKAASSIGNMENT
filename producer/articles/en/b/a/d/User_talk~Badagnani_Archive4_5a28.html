<dd>It is addictive, yes. By the way, I added a category back; if you believe it doesn't fit in this one either, perhaps a "University shootings" rather than a "School shootings" category would be more appropriate? Other longtime editors at the Kent State shootings article seem to be staying out of the discussion. It's hard (though not impossible) to develop a consensus with just two editors discussing things. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 06:04, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I agree. I generally try to avoid editing politics or hot issues such as this because it's an exercise in futility in the long run, but some of what's in the KS article stuck out at me. It's kind of tough to categorize this when it boils down to it, because KS was a rare event in history. The school shootings category doesn't seem to fit, because what they have there is generally columbine/jonesboro/etc type of incidents and this is more politically related. However it <i>was</i> a school shooting obviously because it happened at a school, so if you believe it belongs there, I'll leave it alone. This happened 36 years ago and it's not going to make a bit of difference on how it's looked at either way. However I strongly disagree with it being "state terrorism". I'm looking at it from an officer's perspective - if I think I see a weapon <i>and</i> aggressive behavior on the suspect, I'm drawing my weapon and he's going down - that simple. I'd rather be tried by 12 than carried by 6. Given that, you'd have to categorize every questionable shoot in American history as "state terrorism" - and the soldiers in this incident weren't even convicted by a compentent court. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquinox137_84c2.html" title="User:Equinox137">Equinox137</a> 06:17, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No sir, you have not. It was NOT an incident of state terrorism, it was a RIOT where the National Guard was called to restore order and opened fire because they claimed they were in fear for their lives.</dd>
<dd>Give YOU a reason? Sorry if I don't bow down before you, but maybe a good reason is that you violated it easily yourself, on top of the personal insults. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquinox137_84c2.html" title="User:Equinox137">Equinox137</a> 09:42, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The President's Commission on Campus Unrest avoided the question of why the shootings happened, but harshly criticized both the protesters and the Guardsmen, concluding that "the indiscriminate firing of rifles into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were unnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable."</dd>
<dd>On June 13, 1970, President Nixon established the President's Commission on Campus Unrest which he charged to study the dissent, disorder, and violence breaking out on college and university campuses across the nation.[10] The Commission's establishment was a consequence of the fatal violence at Kent State and Jackson State. The Commission issued its findings in a September 1970 report that concluded that the Ohio National Guard shootings on May 4, 1970 were unjustified. The report said:</dd>
<dd>"Even if the guardsmen faced danger, it was not a danger that called for lethal force. The 61 shots by 28 guardsmen certainly cannot be justified. Apparently, no order to fire was given, and there was inadequate fire control discipline on Blanket Hill. The Kent State tragedy must mark the last time that, as a matter of course, loaded rifles are issued to guardsmen confronting student demonstrators."</dd>
<dd>No matter how you may wish things to have transpired that day, the fact is that many of the Guard members, whether or not they claimed self-defense, were aiming at particular students and firing repeatedly at them, with two of the students not even having participated in the protests. Even Nixon's commission found the self-defense claim to have been spurious. Badagnani 09:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You presume a lot, I did read it. The fact that a presidential commission that was 1,000 miles away from the scene at the time of the incident says it's so, doens't make it so. Everybody's good at armchair quarterbacking and 20/20 hindsight. Furthermore, where's the backing for your statement that the soldiers "were aiming at particular students and firing repeatedly at them"? Even the all-mighty commission never said that. Do you have a problem with soldiers and cops, Badagnani? Or maybe the Ohio National Guard? Does the fact that you're from Kent cloud your judgement on this issue? Either way, the fact remains about the commission that THEY WEREN'T THERE.</dd>
<dd>I'm still waiting to hear why this belongs in either the school shooting or state terrorism categories. All the incidents in the school shooting category have to do with a mentally instable shooter attacking students.</dd>
<dd>State terrorism is defined by wikipedia itself as controversial term, which means violence against civilians perpetrated by a national government or proxy state. Whether a particular act is described as "terrorism" may depend on whether the International community considers the action justified or necessary, or whether the described act is carried out as part of an armed conflict." Even the Wikipedia article admits that it's dependent on point of view.</dd>
<dd>Since the National Guard was called in response to the riots and not deliberately or proactively terrorizing any protestor or studend by any account, how does this qualify as "state terrorism?" <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquinox137_84c2.html" title="User:Equinox137">Equinox137</a> 10:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The chart from Levinskii, Y.V.

If he would look closer! There ae several other G in the chart and all of them are seperated from the formula by a comma (,) meaning that at this line the solide of the mention composition turns into a not defined gasphase. For example UO<sub>2</sub>;L<sub>2</sub>,G or any other number on the chart. LIMN will not get it.

<dl>
<dd>I disagree. There is plenty of reason to believe that the gas is pure as UO<sub>3</sub>(g) at and above the temperatures and pressures above the curve indicated, and a ("not defined") mixture of UO<sub>2</sub>(g) and UO<sub>3</sub>(g) at any of the ",G" lines below it. Even if this is not the case, the fact remains that the comma is missing, and the interpretation is verifiable even if it is not the truth. The standard for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELossIsNotMore_d6f5.html" title="User:LossIsNotMore">LossIsNotMore</a> 01:35, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is not a conspiracy theory film in the sense that Loose Change is: what the film shows is a willful stonewalling of investigating what exactly Washington knew about the 9/11 attacks, and when they knew it.

<p>Hi, I notice you've several times corrected "none are" to "none is", recently with the comment 'Grammar: "none has" is correct because the word "none" is a contraction of "not one," and thus always singular. Please feel free to look this up.' I'm not sure where to look this up. I did do a bit of googling and found <a href="http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxnoneis.html" class="external text" title="http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxnoneis.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>'With mass nouns, you have to use the singular. ("None of the wheat is...") With count nouns, you can use either the singular or the plural. ("None of the books is..." or "None of the books are...") Usually, the plural sounds more natural, unless you're trying to emphasize the idea of "not one", or if the words that follow work better in the singular.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>'The fullest (prescriptive) treatment is in Eric Partridge's book Usage and Abusage (Penguin, 1970, 0-14-051024-9). In the original edition Partridge had prescribed the singular in certain cases, but a rather long-winded letter from a correspondent persuaded him to retract.'</dd>
</dl>
<p>So according to this, "none is" is always correct, but "none are" is not always wrong. Comments? Citations? -- <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERsholmes_de0b.html" title="User:Rsholmes">Rsholmes</a> 13:40, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Haha, I'm no expert on Chinese sauces or soups. The page gives a good summary about are flavourings for soy braising (鹵) which is often applied to everything from meat to tofu, and is reused, sometimes for years or decades. While there are some informative gems in the article, there are a few gaping inaccuracies in it. First, I would not say that there is a Chinese "master sauce" (lu shui). To me, saying "a Chinese 'master sauce'" would indicate that most other Chinese sauces are derived from it. However, while one can use lu shui as a dipping sauce, it is certainly not case that it is a requirement for any Chinese sauces, or even Chinese cooking. I would go as far to say that lu shui is in fact more a concentrated flavoured broth than anything else.</p>
<p>Second, although alcohol (jiu) is often used in making lu shui broth, no attempt is made to keep the alcohol content in the liquid. The reason why the technique works well is because of (1) the slow wet heat in cooking, which tenderizes and flavours the meat/main ingredient while dissolving proteins into the broth, (2) the flavour concentrated sauce, which is fortified by the continued addition of the main ingredients, the flavourings, and various spices, finally (3) the "age" of the sauce, with it various degraded or partially degraded chemical components likely contribute to the richness and complexity of the old lu shui, more than a new lu shui that was just created.</p>
<p>Perhaps instead of writing a master sauce article, we should create/modify a lu shui or lu article instead? <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 21:34, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, it doesn't matter whether the Soviet post office has a problem with the use of their stamp images, it's against WP's fair use policy, which is more restrictive. You would have to make a case for the significance of this image being on a stamp, which is unlikely because this issue was purely decorative and to some extent aimed at collectors rather than postal users (so in fact they would care about our using this image, because it could cut into their stamp sales if people can get the image for free). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 00:20, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, I did discuss in the discussion section. But you didn't response. Could you tell me how to fix {{Template:CEG}} with your disambig page? The title of this template is Chinese ethnic groups. It should lead to a unambiguous page.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Added variables {{{img}}}, {{{width}}}, and {{{caption}}} to {{<a href="../../../k/o/r/Template%7EKoreanname_f889.html" title="Template:Koreanname">Koreanname</a>}}:</p>
<ul>
<li>{{{width}}} defaults to 250 (you can set to "n" for default image size)...</li>
<li>{{{caption}}} is used as the alt text for the image, as well as the actual caption.</li>
<li>{{{img}}} is the ABC in Image:ABC</li>
</ul>
<p>The old {{{image}}} variable is just a text field, so you can add a caption that way too; i.e. [[Image:Imagename.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Caption caption caption.&lt;/small&gt;. However, this more systematic approach seems better.</p>

<p>If your playing produces a <i>metallic</i> klick, you are using the wrong kind of strings&#160;;) This kind of playing craves gut-strings, see the section on strings in the article, which also covers this. Gut strings were, for instance, used by most big band players in the twenties and early thirties. Later, after the introduction of metal strings, this technique became near obsolete in main stream music.</p>
<p>Best regard</p>
<p>/<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenkeB_032b.html" title="User:HenkeB">HenkeB</a> 00:06, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would probably describe the sound produced by slapping gut strings as similar to a somewhat low pitched snare drum, while slapped metal strings (as heard from rockabilly band and such) sounds somewhat similar to a rimshot, in my ears. The jazz bands I've heard employing this technique "live" (as opposed to on records) have used gut strings (have you read the section "strings" yet btw?). Regarding our little dispute, I would suggest the article clearly separates between the two kinds of strings - and sounds&#160;:)</p>
<p>Here in sweden, there is a twelve man band (called kustbandet) which mixes New Orleans jazz with early swing music, such as Duke Ellington (they also play the occasional modern jazz composition, but then in a swing-fashion). They made great recordings in the early seventies, hade a little quality dip in the eigthies, but have recovered well and are still very active. They have toured in many countries, even in countries like India (somewhat amasing for a trad-band!) and was once elected to play at the Nobel price ceremony "ballroom dance" (after the dinner - don't know the correct term) around ten years ago.</p>

<p>"...with either kind of string there's a sharpness (maybe somewhat like a "crack" of a snare drum rather than a "click") to the attack which is contrasting to the mellow, round depth of the bass string's plucking -- though the metal strings create a sharper attack."</p>
<p>Ok, that's fair enough!</p>
<p>As you wrote you enjoy (swedish) folk music and are also into <i>minimalism</i>, I can't resist recommending <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Johansson_55bc.html" title="Jan Johansson">Jan Johansson</a>, which made a few records in the sixties (before being killed in a car crash) where he played traditional folk songs on the piano with a light jazz touch, often accompanied by acoustic bass only (played by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Riedel_9c51.html" title="Georg Riedel">Georg Riedel</a>). The most beautiful, in most peoples opinion, are <i>Jazz på Svenska</i> and <i>Jazz på Ryska</i>. I still listen to those records.</p>

<p>I didn't know that one, but as the convolute says "featuring Jim Hall" it sounds promising. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to play the samples right now (unrealplayer hangs for some reason). Looking at the list however, I discovered one traditional composition also played by Jan Johansson on <i>Jazz på Svenska</i>, called <i>De sålde sina hemman</i>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip, I appreciate it!</p>

<p>I'm certainly no expert, but I think Grieg, like Bartok for instance, was inspired also by folk music. I don't know about you, but I personally prefer Jan Johanssons way of playing <u>folk</u> music, but Art Farmer's beautiful lyrical tone and Jim Hall's great rythmic soloing makes me want this record for those reasons.</p>
<p>Good night, and again, thanks for the tip.</p>

<p>紅糟 is in fact red yeast rice and probably mis-translated as red jujubes, thought it may be the case that both ingredients are possible.

<p>Okay...I admit that I don't know. It can be a purple hulled rice (紅糟米, not glutinous), but some people also use it for referring to red yeast rice (just 紅糟). This is confusing <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 22:19, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, we had a little dust-up over that around 10 months ago, with some averring that hanja, and particularly the absence of hanja, was largely irrelevant for many topics. That led to the creation of a farcical number of alternative name-table templates, revert wars over the removal or inclusion of hanja, and ultimately (the consensus solution) making the "hanja" field optional. (This was before ParserFunctions.)</p>
<p>With Appleby banned, these problems may not recur, and I guess personally I have no problem with "hanja=none." However, I think it's probably best to put such details of etymology/onomastics on Wiktionary and link the wikt: entry through the name table; that's what I've done for <a href="../../../j/j/i/Jjigae.html" title="Jjigae">jjigae</a>.

<dd>Not for the modern form of the word; there are no hanja that correspond to 찌 (jji). There is probably a hanja representation of the archaic spelling 치개, but that is more likely to be a <a href="../../../i/d/u/Idu.html" title="Idu">hanjaization</a> of the original native Korean word, which would appear to come from 찌다. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 03:49, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many Chinese characters have more than one pronounciation. 阿 is one of that. The word "Ejiao" came from the "jiao" (glue) from "Dong-e" 东阿 county in <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liaocheng.html" title="Liaocheng">Liaocheng</a> city. (pls check the content in that article). To pronounce it "a" or "ar" is simply wrong. To say "the first syllable is 'a'" is not correct. Well, why is the county called Dong-e, not Dong-a? That's the decision of people there. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF</a> is wrong (I am not planning to contribute there currently though). Another proof is that the product, "ejiao", use this name. You can check that picture.</p>
<p>Another example of pronounciation change in the name of place is <a href="../../../l/u/27/Lu%27an.html" title="Lu'an">Lu'an</a> 六安. I believe that if you know Chinese, you should know that 六 (liu) usually means 6. But it's called "lu" here.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a freelance writer working on an article about the wide array of people who make Wikipedia their life, their passion, their pastime. Wikipedia “addicts” if you will. I’m looking for people just willing to tell their story of how they got sucked into the intellectual whirlwind that is Wikipedia, how you got started editing, how the obsession grew, and what you spend your time focusing on these days? Do you write articles from scratch? Is your main push toward one particular type of article? Do you patrol for typos and errors, or spend your time diligently fixing vandalism? Do you take part in the “social aspects” of Wikipedia; engaging in animated discussions or decorating your user page with all sorts of internet memes? Have you forced yourself to take a “Wikipedia break”? If so, what’s your 20/20 hindsight on the obsession? Basically I’m just trying to get an idea of what it’s like for various Wikipedia “addicts.” If you are interested in participating, please email me at brianrhodges@gmail.com</p>
<p>If anybody else, other than this user is interested in participating, feel free to email me as well. This article is intended to be a light informational piece, nothing too heavy or controversial, just merely introducing readers to a subculture that they likely had no idea existed. So please don’t email me with your conspiracy theories, or your grudge against the Wikipedia hierarchy… unless it directly applies to your overall experience with the site. This article is about the USERS, not about the pros and cons of the site itself.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<dd>It wouldn't really involve much. Think of it as sort of like a mini-WikiProject. No obligation, just a place to talk about strategy, general problems (for example, the hanja thing), useful tools, priorities, etc. Cf. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Korea_DPRK_a7e0.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Korea/DPRK">Wikipedia:WikiProject Korea/DPRK</a>...

I'd do it now, but the dog is going to gnaw my leg off if I don't take him for a run. Feel free to start it yourself if you'd like.

<p>Hi. It is interesting to see an Amercian want to know the difference between 荪 and 笙. Actually, 笙 is a musical instrument in ancient China while 荪 is the name of a fragrance fungus as you can find it in 说文解字 and 楚辞.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can see that 竹荪 is the correct selling.</p>
<p>BTW, as you can understand some Chinese, why don't you come to the Chinese Wiki? 222.71.223.137 04:54, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
