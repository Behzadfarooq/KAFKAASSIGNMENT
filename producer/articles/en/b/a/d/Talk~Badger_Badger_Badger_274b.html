<dd>That flash toon has several brief parodies and tributes, referencing many many fandoms and memes, and it appears that most of them were created for that particular toon. In other words, the badger-like guitar-playing ninjas were more than likely created for that scene only, rather than lifted from a longer video. Even if there was a "ninja ninja ninja" parody, they probably wouldn't be playing guitars (the guitars were part of the motif for this specific toon).</dd>
<dd>However, the reference/tribute is noteworthy, in my opinion, and should be mentioned in the article (but should <i>not</i> be included in the list of tributes under External Links). - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 18:53, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Zombie cartoon was not done by the same guys who made the original Badger cartoon. Actually, I find it's a really awful tribute/parody, but I won't bother slathering opinions all over the article. However, if someone could find out who actually did the Zombie toon, it should be mentioned in that paragraph of the article, so people don't think that Weebl and Bob had anything to do with that piece of crap. - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 04:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The audio doesn't match up exactly with the visuals. This becomes plainly discernible after 30 minutes of continuous playing. At this point, the audio is at the twelfth "badger" in the first line while the visuals show the mushroom. Over the next few hours, the visuals continue to play faster than the audio, achieving maximum separation at 4 hours 12 minutes. Thereafter the gap begins to close, and becomes synchronized again at about 8 hours 30 minutes. This process continues cyclically."</p>

<p>So a racist parody was added awhile back, and removed. I don't object to the removal, I think it was a good decision. It does, however, make me wonder if it's time to start trimming off the really bad parodies. The racist one was deemed unfit because it was offensive (and really not that funny unless you find racism funny in and of itself), but I think that the "zombie" and "roger" parodies are just very poorly made. The fact that they're voices with no music almost misses the entire point of the original, and they're just not all that funny.. It's started to become another version of "all your <i>x</i> are belong to us", where people feel that inserting anything in place of "<i>x</i>" is sufficient parody. My opinion is that, now that there are a fair share of parodies to choose from, there is no longer an obligation to report and list all of them, if there ever was one.</p>
<p>I'm removing them for now, and if anyone wishes to object and put them back on, I feel you should at least comment here.</p>

<p>I simply do not see any logic behind the removal of rogerrogerroger. Keep your opinions to yourself, you do NOT represent the total population who will view this article.

<dd>You seem to have a persecution complex, buddy. There's no mass conspiracy to keep the little guy down, and we're not against development or evolution. It's simply a matter of quality over quantity. Face it, the "parody" sucks, and doesn't deserve to be included here. <i>If</i> at some point in the future a new, seperate article is created with a list of parodies and tributes, then I will fully support it being added to that list, along with the zombie and racist ones as well. However, when the list is part of a small External Links section of the main article, there needs to be a bit of quality control. The list, when included as a sub-section to the main article, can <i>not</i> be "here's every parody and tribute that we know about", it needs to be "here's a few noteworthy parodies and tributes", and whether you like it or not, that stupid roger thing is not noteworthy when compared to the others on the list. - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 06:51, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>brenneman, you can point to the guideline page a dozen different ways, it doesn't explain what part of the page you think is being violated by linking to the different variations. The article is about the badgers toon, the links in question are variations on the badgers toon. Why would parodies and tributes be acceptable but variations not acceptable. And if you have an actual answer to this question, please give an answer, instead of simply adjusting your method of linking to the guideline.

<li>The first words on that page are <i>"Wikipedia is not a web directory."</i> There is clearly a need to link to the original, but what's actually added to the article by linking to the variations? Only slightly further on it says <i>"a certain number"</i> of links is valuable, and follows that closely with <i>"small section containing a few external links."</i> Clearly, limiting the number of external links is considered a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_thing.html" title="Good thing">good thing</a>.</li>
<li>Further, What should be linked to says that <i>"meaningful, relevant content"</i> is to be linked to. It's a tenuous argument that these variations are relevent. They may be described in the article as it stands, but if pressure was applied to follow the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> guidelines, that could change.

<dd>It was inspired *directly* by Football Badgers, which I am quite fond of. I gave the developer specific direction on making equivalents to every FB element, without actually duplicating anything. Tribute, parody, and copyright violation are separated by a thin and subjective line, and I wanted to stay well clear of it. I can say that nearly everyone who watches PR makes the connection to the FBs. It is obviously and unashamedly an attempt to promote a group (which is emphatically not political, though its community members share a general moral philosophy), but then the original FBs had a promotional purpose as well. As to whether this animation was <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a>, well, go ahead and hurt my feelings and those of the young developers here in Moscow, but throw us a bone. This animation is no worse than Potter Potter Potter, and its connection to the original no more tenuous. I suggest that your decision to retain PR or not should depend on whether or not PR hurts or enhances this article. In my opinion it does no harm, and it at least expands the BBB sphere a little more. Has there been any other recent action or innovation here? â€”<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimplulo_f634.html" title="User:Simplulo">Simplulo</a>

<dd>If you were personally involved in some way with the creation of PR, then it's not really going to go over well for you to be the one promoting it (see <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five pillars</a>, and more specifically <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a>). In cases where I've found myself in this situation, I usually just post on the Talk page and leave it up to the community to decide whether to add it to the article itself. --<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterZ_0b53.html" title="User:HunterZ">HunterZ</a> 16:49, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I personally conceived of this project, posted it on elance.com, selected a developer here in Moscow, and paid them out of my own pocket. If this constitutes "vanity", then so be it, but my motivation (and political views) *should* be as irrelevant to you as whether or not you support England's football team. The essential question is whether or not this is useful, relevant content, and I believe that it is by any objective assessment of the rest of the article (again, I refer you to Potterx3). The bias should be towards inclusion until clutter becomes an issue. I'm frankly rather surprised that people are willing to spend their time kicking over other people's sand-castles. â€”<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimplulo_f634.html" title="User:Simplulo">Simplulo</a>
<dl>
<dd>For starters, you should stop referring to Potterx3. Your comparison is insulting and rather forced. The connection between Potterx3 and Badgerx3 is not tenuous at all, but the connection between FB and PR is a vague "inspiration". Aside from the sortakinda techno music, and multiple copies of a single animal appearing (almost) in time with the music, there is no other connection.</dd>
<dd>First, the song in PR has no vocals. One of the most predominant features in Badgerx3 (and its variations and tributes) is the repetition of the name of whatever is appearing in time to the music. Second, the lack of vocals prevents another predominant theme, the appearance (and possible relationship) of three different things. Badger, Mushroom, Snake. Potter, Weasley, Snape. Footy, England, Goal. PR only has porcupines running, and a bunch of scattered messages. Third, the porcupines are running. In all Badger variations and tributes, the main object is standing in one place, bouncing.</dd>
<dd>Besides all this, the animation is subpar (I'm sorry to hear you actually paid for it), and you can play semantics all you want with the terms "moral", "philosophical" and "political", but PR is clearly a politically motivated, and comes rather close to propaganda. Further, the mention of it in the actual article is more than a mention or a summary, it's a promotion. The final statement is a political concept stated as fact, and just screams of bias. Altogether, PR might be noteworthy in related political articles, but doesn't deserve to be mentioned in this article any more than the Zombie and N--ger cartoons which have also been removed. - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 18:18, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>update:</b> In spite of my general distaste for the piece of crap, I realize that it may deserve at least <i>some</i> mention. In an attempt to be fair (and omit bias), I restored a mention of it in the "Other references" section, but removed it from the external links. This is probably better than it deserves, but I'll leave that up to admins if it comes to such a thing. - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 18:25, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nice...you must do quite well on the Analogies questions of IQ tests. I'm sorry to have caused such a fuss. Go ahead and remove it if it really bothers you that much. I didn't want to put down Potterx3, as it is fine for what it is. I take no pleasure in criticizing others. But you are clearly biased in your low assessment of PR, and your high assessment of the other "tributes". â€”<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimplulo_f634.html" title="User:Simplulo">Simplulo</a>

<dd>That seems like a feeble attempt to accuse me of being "the man" and trying to "keep you down" as a matter of perspective, or some other such nonsense. I mentioned my bias and put it out in the open, but in the end I gave concrete and specific points, none of which you have dealt with. I don't know whether you're delusional or just a troll, but you're not going to win this one. - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 21:24, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Before the personal attributions thicken into personal attacks and incivility, let's restrain ourselves and keep the discussion only to those concrete points. â€” <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">âœŽ</a> 21:51, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You asserted "there is no other connection," but you did not mention one of the primary analogues: the maps and the promotion of places on them. FB promotes England on a map of the British Isles, while PR promotes New Hampshire on a map of New England. There was to have been an element equivalent to the snake, but the developer had trouble with it and ran out of time and resources. You said that the creatures should be bouncing, not running, but do you notice the porcupines actually *moving* on your screen? Again, I ask you all to reconsider the fine lines between tribute, parody, plagiarism, and copyright violation. Yes, bouncing creatures is one parallel to draw, but there are others. Personally, I was not impressed by the other badgerx3 variations, and thought that I chose more essential elements to parallel: furry animals (same in number and sequential appearance), a sport, and promotion of a place over its neighbors. â€”<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimplulo_f634.html" title="User:Simplulo">Simplulo</a></dd>

<dd>I can see on the history page that at least three separate editors disagree with your assessment of its relevance. Also, your motivation for adding it to the article <i>is</i> quite relevant, as taking advantage of Wikipedia for vanity/self-promotion purposes cheapens the site. Thanks for your honesty though. --<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterZ_0b53.html" title="User:HunterZ">HunterZ</a> 18:57, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not my motivation that cheapens the site, but the quality and relevance of the content, which could be poor even if submitted by someone with the purest of intentions. My motivation is relevant because it biases my opinion of the quality and relevance of my submitted content, as does the fact that I invested considerable time and resources. I freely admit that. But my bias also acts to make my opinion more valid: because of my interest, I am willing to invest more time in the subject. Lacking this interest, your editors were not willing to invest the time to grok the animation, and thus missed key elements. But I suspect that your editors have biases of their own, to which they are not admitting freely. Their responses have been needlessly aggressive and erroneous, as I have demonstrated. Errors in facts and logic I can deal with, but outright hostility is something else. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimplulo_f634.html" title="User:Simplulo">Simplulo</a> 06:49, 21 June 2006 (UTC)simplulo

<p>A recent edit switched the order of the opening sentence to read, in part, "Badger Badger Badger (aka Badgers)". I understand why this was done, after all, the title of the article is indeed <b>Badger Badger Badger</b>, mostly because that is how people often refer to the cartoon and the resulting "pop culture" phenomena. However, the actual official title of the cartoon itself is simply <b>Badgers</b>. So whether or not this article should perhaps be moved to "Badgers (flash cartoon)" or something like that (with "<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Badger_Badger_29ac.html" title="Badger Badger Badger">Badger Badger Badger</a>" redirecting to that) is not within my realm of expertise, but I do know that the article should reflect the fact that the cartoon is in fact called <b>Badgers</b>, and <b>Badger Badger Badger</b> is actually the "aka". - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 12:24, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very good point! I was under the impression that the title was <i>Badger Badger Badger</i> so I didn't even consider that the article title might be the part needing correction. I think you're right that it ought to be moved, though I'd go with Badgers (animation) as a more general description. â€” <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">âœŽ</a> 18:29, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
