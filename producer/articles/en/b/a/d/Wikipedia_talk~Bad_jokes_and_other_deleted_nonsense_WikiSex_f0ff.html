<li>Delete if Wikichess games are also deleted. Otherwise, keep. My preference would be deletion of both. The reason is that wikichess, while essentially harmless, can be used - and was used in this case - to justify similar recreational activity, and there is no good reason to give preferential treatment to one while disallowing the other. I don't want to pat myself on the back too much, but that's why I opposed wikichess when it started many months ago. Before you argue that this page is offensive, we have no strict policy against offensive user pages (cf. <a href="../../../p/a/e/User%7EPaektu_c57c.html" title="User:Paektu">User:Paektu</a>). --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:43, Apr 6, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the greatest insight a Wikipedian could have is the understanding that the wiki isn't really something serious. We create articles but we also have fun, and this is what makes Wikipedia so different. We aren't paid employees of some big company who must work hard 8 hours a day without joking or socializing. We are amateur writers who came here to make friends, have fun, socialize and feel the warm feeling one has after publishing a new article. Sadly some people have lost their sense of humor. Haven't you thought that a WikiSex page would attract more contributors, too?&#160;:-) <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_sexy_d41c.html" title="User:I am sexy">I am sexy</a> 23:12, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<li>Del, (&amp; chess too if that's what it takes to make the quota). There are two diffences between Ias &amp; chess: (1) Ias is not a colleague and is a vandal, but the only name recognize as a chess player is a colleague and i assume not a vandal. (2) While there is no <i>theoretical</i> difference relevant to us between sex and chess, it is irresponsible to suggest we should ignore the practical difference, which is that people nearly everywhere but here <i>treat</i> them entirely differently, and the fact that Ias's survival here would likely swamp us with other vandals and spammers is absolutely relevant. Bottom line, the chess is harmless, but if we have to dump it to dump Ias, it's worth doing so. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 00:33, 2004 Apr 7 (UTC)

<li>delete. To keep Wikipedia educational, we should keep the site suitable for general audience, not just adults. I hate to see all public libraries banning this site because of these postings.

<li>Delete. The presence or lack thereof of Wikichess is immaterial here. Perhaps WikiChess should also be classified as abuse, but you can't answer a question with another question. I don't think you *need* to have virtual sex with somebody to be able to make friends with somebody, and virtual sex is on the other side of the taste line from the very well-thought-out-and-NPOV sex topics covered in the Wikipedia proper. (which, to <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_sexy_d41c.html" title="User:I am sexy">User:I am sexy</a>'s defense, she has actually made some appropriate contributions to) The problem is that the user pages were traditionally assumed to be a free-for-all to help coordinate and communicate stuff. Now that people are starting to push the limits of what's appropriate in them, I fear that we'll need particularly onerous requirements that will mean more innocuous things like WikiChess will be gone as well. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirehead_2881.html" title="User:Wirehead">Wirehead</a> 19:30, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<li>Yes, "she has actually made some appropriate contributions" , but in a sham, not "to <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_sexy_d41c.html" title="User:I am sexy">User:I am sexy</a>'s defense". After pointed sarcasm abt skull-f'g her into doing so, she made 4 article edits so that no one can say she's done nothing: 7 virtually redundant words added to KISS; 10 links in two articles, and a one 'graph stub (with a stub-notice that i can only regard as cryptic: how can you know stubs-msgs exist, but be at a loss as to how to create one?). Has she apologized in any sense for her initial 5 edits, in which she replaced the entire content with her come-on? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 23:35, 2004 Apr 7 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah, but we delete pages with intentionally POV and/or inflamitory titles even though the content hasn't been placed there.

As you seem to be somebody who likes to push boundries (if there was a virtual sex record book, it's possible that WikiSex might make it in there&#160;;) ) you must understand that sometimes you create a rule by breaking it. I'm not going to say that <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a> was right in deleting it out of process, but what's preventing from you establishing that you are, in fact, the kinky sort of person and setting up for yourself a forum (your own wiki, LiveJournal, etc.) more appropriate for that sort of thing and linking to that from your user page? --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirehead_2881.html" title="User:Wirehead">Wirehead</a> 23:38, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. This is ridiculous. I think that those users who believe this is appropriate for Wikipedia are in a bit too deep. Wikipedia is an open encyclopedia. This is not encyclopedic. This is treating the Wiki as a forum, with attendant self-indulgence.

<li>Storage or bandwith, as if those were our core resources!

<li>I am not a sockpuppet of "I am sexy". I do care about wikipedia, very much. I fully expect the page to be deleted, and even support the idea. BUT! "I am sexy" doesn't appear to have drawn any soulmates in so far as i can tell. Most of the people who have posted anything on the page have been wikipedians. "I am sexy" did not post anything obscene. We don't have any policy about user subpages. Perhaps we should. Many people have pictures -is that an abuse of out attention? <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_Hot%21_edb2.html" title="User:I am Hot!">I am Hot!</a> 17:35, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

What seems likely to happen to WikiChess as that the proponents will find a more appropriate Wiki (there are <b>many</b> other public Wikis available, I ran one myself once).

<li>Keep. I'm trusting that all participants in this discussion have read the page in question. Frankly, there's nothing there that couldn't be purchased in any number of books or magazines at Cole's, and the worst that can be said about the "play" on this page is that is is silly and funny. While I appreciate that to some Wikipedians, funny = pornographic, I would also note that this is a user page, and <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_sexy_d41c.html" title="User:I am sexy">I am sexy</a> has actually contributed some material to articlespace. Looking at the length of this discussion also prompts me to wonder how much is about a serious issue and how much is about being shocked and outraged. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a> 05:28, 2004 Apr 9 (UTC)

<li>I'm just going to add one last argument in favour of keeping the page.I have been on Wikipedia for a long time now, during that time I have been involved in a number of conflicts, some minor, some that really get my goat. Now I'm sure that many of you have on occasion allowed your tempers to rise, especially the admins who have to cope with a daily barrage of trouble makers, trolls, people trying to insert links to their own webpages,people from nigeria begging for cash to "get an education", POV vandals, the list goes on and on, and the problems are likely to get worse in the future. Now it may very well be that <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_sexy_d41c.html" title="User:I am sexy">User:I am sexy</a> came here as one of those trouble makers, I don't know. I do think she expected <i>every</i> admin here to come down on her like a freight train. Well that didn't happen, and perhaps that is why she hasn't returned after her ban. I don't know. What I do know though is that I have had such a laugh editing the page. Trying to think of titillating, funny, clever things to say has taken my mind off things. I find myself totally relaxed and happy and able to deal with the likes of insert your most hated problem user here calmly and with a renewed sense of vigor. Now any page that helps prevent admin burnout has got to be a good thing hasn't it?

<li>Let me clarify - those warning were by <i>individuals</i>, none of whom individually has the authority to speak for the community. I'm talking about an official, rubber-stamped, one-time-only warning that says "Do x, y, and z, and stop doing a, b, and c, or we'll have tell you to leave."

<li>Yes Brian, I'm well aware of how to get a list of her contributions. Allow me to clarify - from spot checking Sexy's contributions, and I haven't really seen anything worthy of banning.

<li>This whole issue has me laughing my ass off. Wikipedians are such stereotypical geeks: <i>one</i> chick walks in the door and starts making eyes, and everyone goes nuts—half wanting to nail her right then and there on the floor, the other half wanting to push her back out the door.

<li>I resent that blunt characterization. Like I've said before, if you were in a library and somebody loudly exclaimed that they wanted to have sex, I think you'd annoy/offend a lot of people. Some of us have no problem with "making eyes" but consider anybody who claims to require virtual sex to make friends with people to either be a troll or have some real problems with their sexuality.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirehead_2881.html" title="User:Wirehead">Wirehead</a> 14:19, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<li>To carry your analogy a bit further...if you had someone arrested for talking loudly about sex in a library and took them to court over it, I'd say you were overreacting. There was no malicious intent, nor any real harm done, after all. <a href="../../../m/k/w/User%7EMkweise_6787.html" title="User:Mkweise">Mkweise</a> 15:30, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Everything <i>can</i> be heard yes. But does it have to be? Martin changed the page name to stop it appearing as something rude on recent changes. She shouldn't have annouced it on the pump, that is true. But apart from that, nobody <i>has</i> to look at the page. What if she never goes "public" with it like that again? What if she, I, and anyone else in the know, just posted to the page every now and then to relieve stress after a hard days editting. We could agree to not put anything in the edit summaries if you like. Should she still be banned? Should I? <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_Hot%21_edb2.html" title="User:I am Hot!">I am Hot!</a> 17:46, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<dd>In non-sex-oriented internet communities that have experienced similar issues, I'd say history is against you here. Every time this has come up elsewhere, users have gotten banned, and not necessarily just the instigator. There is a difference between an "Academic" and NPOV discussion of sex and a public sexual chat, especially given that the former demonstrates that the Wikipedia is a well-functioning and non-judgemental scholarly resource whereas the later merely hurts our reputation as a site. I'd even go so far as saying that it would be OK to advertise on one's user page that one is kinky and likes to have virtual sex and suggests a <i>more appropriate forum</i> for such activities. I don't think Martin's renaming is going to help much. On one hand, if you don't advertise you won't be found as easily. On the other hand, if you don't advertise, you increase the likelyhood that you will be stumbled upon and misinterpreted. I am not against sex here, but there are some places that are simply not appropriate for it. If these things really mean a lot to you folks, there's absolutely nothing stopping you from creating the WikipediaBar to allow you to, as you say, relieve stress. The thing is, <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_sexy_d41c.html" title="User:I am sexy">User:I am sexy</a> is not helping her case. When one frames a german phrase in an english site like she did when she said what she thought of admins, it's pretty reasonable to assume that it was not something she'd want to say to said person's face and, thusly, probably offensive. When one is told that their WikiSex page isn't necessarily appropriate and a debate is started, one shouldn't create a sex journal straight off. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirehead_2881.html" title="User:Wirehead">Wirehead</a> 18:29, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ed acts unilaterally all the time, assuming (correctly, it seems) that as a developer he is completely immune to any sanctions. If he is to be de-sysopped, he will also have to be de-developered.

<li>I think that while he does not need de-sysopping or de-developering, this does warant some time away from Wikipedia, say 24 hours, after which he should definitely be allowed back with his original privellages intact.--<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 19:05, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Ed, you're an asset to this community, but recently you've taken to using admin powers to perform what I think we can agree are vigilante actions -- mob justice. I'll grant that the mob is with you, and that I am even frequently part of that mob (at least, I do frequently agree that the users you discipline are in need of it). But I think it's time to set aside these tactics -- Wikipedia can survive a little WikiSex in the corner (particularly if it's just Martin's bemused comments and one new user frantically trying to arouse the attentions of the community....and succeeding, it seems), certainly for the span of a day or two while we sort things out. I have great respect for you: that's why I say, I think it's time to stop doing things just because you know three people will instantly tell you "That may have been against policy, but THANK YOU!!!!" -- we can protect Wikipedia in other ways, and I know you believe that. If you want to talk about my comments, drop a note on my talk page (and leave a haiku, if you've time). I sense frustration in your recent actions, and I want to find a way of letting you vent without getting you in troubling situations. Sorry if this seems at all out of line -- I just think someone needs to say something other than "Way to go!" or "Ed should be de-sysopped!", and I figured if I wanted it said, I should say it. Peace to you.

<li>Erik, was right, this user is pointing out glitches in our policy. So making one or two useful edits, gives you enough ammo to make 7 or 8 vandalisms. I can see where this will go (read: open troll season). <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/r/User_talk%7EDori_37a5.html" title="User talk:Dori">Talk</a> 22:18, Apr 7, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whether the user was a vandal is not the question here. Ed didn't block her for vandalism, but, according to the reason in the block log, for "Running virtual-sex website at Wikipedia", i.e. for her WikiSex user subpage. And I don't see how that's any worse than chess games or lotteries etc. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 22:26, Apr 7, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see how that sub-page was in any way appropriate here. What is this a teen-chat or an encyclopedia? No I don't think the chess pages are appropriate either, but the users who created them are not vandals as far as I can tell, so I'd be willing to be more tolerable toward them. As I see it, the chess relaxes them, and helps keep <b>useful</b> editors happy. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDori_d946.html" title="User:Dori">Dori</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/r/User_talk%7EDori_37a5.html" title="User talk:Dori">Talk</a> 22:34, Apr 7, 2004 (UTC)

<li>Also note that having such subpages will probably increase the likelyhood that portions of or the entire wikipedia will end up in porn filters, which kinda ruins it as a resource for some people.

<li>Nope, this is not a free wiki. But hey, you can make a wiki yourself.

<ul>
<li>But your sysops seem to ignore the policy too often. You have succeedd in creating a free encyclopedia, but your community isn't yet. A free community has policies which guarantee the freedoms of each member. But in Wikipedia I have experiences discrimination, name calling (troll), censorship (deletion of user pages) and such things. If this is your ideal of a wiki community, then very soon you should start to experience the pain of drop outs and forks. How will you feel after a fork will become more succesful than Wikipedia because of its free community and good policies? <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_sexy_d41c.html" title="User:I am sexy">I am sexy</a> 23:27, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<li>In fact, the ability to fork is a powerful part of the "open" development process that the Wikipedia has been using. There is no fear of fork, in fact, the GFDL intentionally reserves you that right. The problem is, saying that you want to form a Wikipedia fork that reserves your right to have WikiSex whenever you want is not really much of a reason for all of the other users of the Wikipedia to want to join your fork. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirehead_2881.html" title="User:Wirehead">Wirehead</a> 23:48, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<li>Unfriendly is a funny word.

<li>Oh, Arno... I was just wondering... do you know what BJAODN is for? Yes. It's for crap that has been deleted but which was thought by some to be at least mildly funny or nonsensical.<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If the page is to be deleted, and in this instance by popular consent, it should stay deleted, and not be left intact anyway.</p>
<p>This kind of thing has happened before. At one stage, someone wrote up a pageful of rubbish on 'wops'. It got deleted and then was resurrected as a deleted nonsense page. Having it there, wasting wikipedia resources, defeated the whole purpose of having it deleted. It was deleted accordingly.</p>
<p>A similar situation exists here. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, NOT an adult contact page/bulletin board etc. This kind of thing should not be around, at all. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArno_4ba5.html" title="User:Arno">Arno</a> 12:22, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete - I never voted on the original deletion, partly because I thought deletion was going to happen, and partly because I didn't want to get involved in the discussion about it. That this page is still being used after archiving shows bad faith on the part of the participants. Wikisex either needs to be rolled back to the archived version and protected or deleted outright.

<li>I'm sorry, I thought the page had been sent to BJAODN sooner than it had, so I was using real edits made before the move in my "still being used" statement.

<li>What message is we are supposed to have "failed to get"? The page was never deleted in the first place because there was no consensus to delete. Look I can't speak for Martin here although I expect his reasoning for editing the page are very similar to mine. When I first put something on the page, it had already appeared on VfD. I fully expected it to be deleted, and was just having a little fun in the meantime.It was a talkpage, i was careless with my spelling, grammar etc. After the five days or what ever, there was a bit of discussion as to what to do, because loads of people had voted to keep. (it's all in the talk page if you want to check). It was decided that BJOADN was the best home. Once it was moved myself and martin made loads of edits. If it's going to stay forever, it should be free of typos, spelling mistakes and the like. The point is though, no new material has been added. To say that the page is "being used", to imply that doing the housework, is somehow sordid, offensive or bad form is IMO completely silly. Please please please check the actual edits that have been made. Also Please "get the message" yourselves. You failed to get it deleted before. Leave it to rest in peace now.

<li>Angela; you are a sysop yes? OK look at the original votes. Let's ignore new user votes, and ignore conditional votes {i.e. keep unless). That leaves 11 keep votes out of 39. I make that 28% keep and 72% delete. Now would you as a sysop, take 72% as a <i>consensus</i> to delete. If you would, then why didn't you? But if you wouldn't can you see why the move to BJAODN was suggested by Phil? Can you also see that based on our policies of a rough consensus for deletion and the figure of 80% being the usual guide that moving to BJAODN was not to evade deletion, but was to evade keeping the article at the talk page?<br />
I really don't mind if you feel the page should be deleted because of its contents, That's fair enough.

<p>Obviously, opinions may well have changed in some cases, due to the different location, the different name, the copyediting, and whatnot. Also, some of the earlier votes were made before the "action" finished. As with the prior vote, I'm undecided. I had hoped that the move to BJAODN, together with no new material being added, would be a satisfactory compromise between the two sides - evidently that's not the case. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 22:02, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think I am sexy and I am hot get a vote do they? Or is it just quickpolls that need voters to be three months old or more (I can't keep up with all the rules we have nowadays)<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a> 19:57, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<dd>It's a question of rough consensus - a deleting sysop gets to use their judgement in deciding if rough consensus has been achieved. Opinions of newcomers are certainly welcome, though they may not always be weighed as heavily as others. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 16:44, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Comment from <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_Hot%21_edb2.html" title="User:I am Hot!">User:I am Hot!</a></i> The other day I was somewhat annoyed by the tone of Arno's remarks. I tried not to let it show but if my own tone was harsh, I apologise. The bottom line is, I don't really mind all that much if the page gets deleted. It was only a bit of fun after all. I do want to say a couple of things about "my behaviour" though.</p>
<p>All I did, was type a few saucy words on a talk page. I have never knowingly insulted anyone, I have never vandalised a talk page or an article. I never wrote anything too near the mark, or indecent. I never resurrected a deleted page. I never added new material to an archived page. I tried to be funny (I accept that not everyone has the same sense of humour as me, plus a lot if not most of the jokes are for an English readership so most of you won't get the humour, but I can't help that). I think that Arno's comparing this page with what I assume to be a highly insulting page on "wops" is right out hof horder (as they say in Eastenders). I think that Maximus's comment about my behaviour being "not appropriate" is - well it's hurtful. &lt;Miss hot looks dejected, she needs a hug&gt; I'm tempted to dream up a suitable punishment for you two, but it probably won't be appreciated &lt;sigh&gt;.</p>
<p>Oh one last comment- Jwrosenzweig said "embarassing private joke" embarrassing for who? This has been bugging me all day, so I'm just going to ask it. Are you user:I am Sexy? Because if you are you did a grand job of disguising yourself. (and if not, well never mind, I'm sure you are sexy as well)<a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_am_Hot%21_edb2.html" title="User:I am Hot!">I am Hot!</a> 21:40, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
