<p>Mutino has been involved in the study of the phallus since a very young age. On his fifth birthday, he received a frozen elephant phallus from his grandmother. Unable to lift it up, he thawed it, and used it as a make-shift mattress. As he grew older, however, he became more interested in the specimen, and began to study it intently. He began to notice similarities between it and his own organ, but was puzzled as to why the elephant phallus was longer than his, but was almost identical in width. Soon, the phalluses of other creatures began to catch his attention. At the age of eleven, he made a declaration that he would devote the rest of his life to unlocking the secrets of this most mysterious of body parts.</p>
<p>As Mutino progressed through school, he soon became dissatisfied with his science curriculum. The Lakeland Central School District did not believe that phallology held a place in the biology classroom. Mutino would routinely speak in front of the school board, arguing that it was imperative for male students to be able to fully understand their genitals before they entered manhood, and for female students to appreciate the beauty and magic of the "stake on which they would soon be expected to routinely impale themselves." He also pointed out that incidents of phallophobia were drastically increasing, and that the only way to solve the problem would be a proactive campaign of phallus education.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_jokes_and_other_deleted_nonsense_Matt_Mutino_c5c5.html" title="Edit section: Political Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political Controversy</span></h3>
<p>The Board rejected Mutino's pleas and, in unexpected public fashion, denied the existence of phallophobia. This development prompted subtle, yet wide-scale, criticism from the global scientific community as many members felt the need to speak out on behalf of phallophobic patients. Criticism of the Board's statements came from unlikely sources, an example of which was the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change_c386.html" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>'s (IPCC) surprising decision to publish the lesser-known <i>What's the Matter with Upstate New York?</i> as a corollary to their 1992 supplementary report to the <i>IPCC First Assessment Report: 1990</i>. Another unexpected, yet outspoken, critic of the Board was the conservative-minded <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Robertson_25ef.html" title="Pat Robertson">Pat Robertson</a> stating, "Everyday many people are forced to deal with the adverse effects that phallophobia inflicts upon their lives. I however, am living testament that phallophobia can be treated and that it's symptoms can be suppressed ... this Board should be ashamed of their actions, the sufferers of phallophobia need awareness and prayer, not zealous deniers."</p>

<p>Mutino was accepted to the University of Chicago where he was permitted to study phallology in the Biological Sciences Division. During his tenure at UChicago, he completed two independent research projects. One documented the hairiness of the phallus of the North American Coyote, and the other dealt with the prevalence of chodes among adolescent males (a subject very dear to Mutino, who is a proud owner of a chode himself). Both papers recieved wide circulation and critical acclaim in both North American and European biology journals. Mutino graduated at the top of his class and had generally become considered a prodigy in his small field.</p>
<p>Finding the general attitude towards phallology in the United States to be negative, Mutino took his studies to Europe where he began attending graduate school at the Danish School of Phallological Research and Studies (DSPRS) in early 1995. At DSPRS Mutino continued his studies on the choad. He finished graduate work within two years and was quickly tenured as a part-time professor by the institution. After three years of full-time field research on the median length and girth of Northeast African choads before and after the federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, Mutino returned to the United States where he was invited to guest lecture at the University of Chicago for three semesters. In November of 2001 Mutino took on his current position at the Icelandic Phallological Museum.</p>

<p>Recently, Mutino has undertaken an extensive and prolonged (no pun intended) assignment in the marshlands surrounding Mohegan Lake, NY, to investigate rumours of the reappearance of the <i>Bencolius erectus</i>. This quasi-humanoid species was generally believed by the anthropological community to have gone extinct during the <a href="../../../m/i/o/Miocene_epoch.html" title="Miocene epoch">Miocene epoch</a> due to its overly large and burdensome penis.</p>
