<ol>
<li>Bishops. Can't find any mention of this on google other than on Wiki mirrors or obviously quoted direct from Wikipedia, and certainly no derivation. Can't find it in <i>Brewer's</i>, <i>Shorter OED</i> and a couple of other reference books.</li>
<li>The verb (one sense of it, at least). In Wiktionary anyway and not needed here (and hardly an aphorism)</li>
<li>Fifties bluegrass. Can't find mention of band, can't find mention of colloquial usage claimed, can't find any non-Wikipedia mirror result on Google.

<dd>For the little available proofs on Google (searching "badger a bishop" with quotes), I've removed the paragraph concerning the phrase "Don't call the badger a bishop" again, despite it appearing on the list of idioms in the English Language here on Wikipedia - that one used the same wording as the old Aphorisms section back in February. —<a href="../../../l/a/o/User%7ELaogeodritt_edfa.html" title="User:Laogeodritt">Laogeodritt</a> <sup><small>[ <a href="../../../l/a/o/User_talk%7ELaogeodritt_324a.html" title="User talk:Laogeodritt">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Laogeodritt_acc7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Laogeodritt">Contribs</a> ]</small></sup> 04:41, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is this trivia about badgers killing people? This seems to me like vandalism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's obviously vandalism. I personally dislike trivia sections. They become repositories for collections of facts which should be incorporated into the article proper. (And vandalism, seemingly.) Also, we don't really need to give every paragraph its own subheading. I have removed the claims about sharks and the "folklore" section: no-one ever produces a cite for any of it. I will look for the "symbol of fidelity" one because it's one I know myself, although I thought it was more about tenacity than milk and kindness.

<p>We are amassing a long list of "books with a badger in them". Is this a good thing? Half of them are childrens' books, and talking animals are a fairly standard ingredient in children's books. And the badgers are far from the main characters in several of them. The other thing is that these are all English-language books: apparently there is no M. Blaireau or Herr Dachs worth including? So does this reflect a specific genre in Britain (most of them are UK books) that doesn't exist in Europe, Russia, the rest of the badger's range; or does it simply reflect who edits the article most? <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 08:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the facts about the american badger's diet are from The Simpsons, and aren't real. Or mabye somebody didn't understand that the site www.whatbadgerseat.com is a joke website. Either way, it should be cited.</p>

<p>We seem to be going back and forth between the largest indigenous carnivore in the UK and the second largest.

<li><a href="http://www.badger.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.badger.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">The Badger Trust (formerly the National Federation of Badger Groups)</a> includes the line: 'Did you know that the badger is the largest land carnivore left in the British Isles following the extinction of the bear and the wolf!' on the 'What is a badger?' page. There have been proposals to reintroduce wolves in scotland although I do not know whether this has been done yet. If that is the case it would be correct (and more enlightening) to say "...are now the second largest native carnivores in the British Isles since wolves were reintroduced in Scotland in (date)" Petecarney 19:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The term "United Kingdom" refers to all territories of the crown, including islands far removed from Great Britain, which is the correct term for the island containing England, Scotland and Wales. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.164.122.5_5c4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.164.122.5">128.164.122.5</a> (talk) 18:56, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
