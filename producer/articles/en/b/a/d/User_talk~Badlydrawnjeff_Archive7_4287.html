<p>Okay, I see what you're getting at, I think. Suppose we just want to copy information out of a page, move it to other articles/Wikiquote , and then redirect the page-- is that considered not a "delete" that requires an AFD, but rather just an editing decision that doesn't require an AFD? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 18:34, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On RfC</span></h2>
<p>I actually was thinking about writing you regarding the issues, but they've been happening over a long period of time. Perhaps I have shown cowardice or lack of drive in not addressing them with you directly before mentioning them as asides, and in doing so have not been as fair and open to you as I should have. I regret not simply spilling my mind, and apologise for not doing so. Overall, while I respect your articlespace edits, and don't think you have ill will towards the project nor are you intending to hurt it, your actual stances are almost uniquely harmful to Wikipedia. You've often pushed against CSD and IAR, both of which are crucial to the operation of the project, and much of what you do resembles a crusade for radical democracy and hard process. Your arguments on the mailing list (I have to read the mailing lists for my <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/LSS" class="extiw" title="m:LSS">LSS</a> project) about loosening up requirements for sourcing and similar threaten both encyclopedic focus and undermine the trust readers can place in our project. I would never consider you a troll - your edits and passion show dedication, and that's ordinarily a wonderful thing. Without that kind of passion in at least a good set of Wikipedians, the project would be much worse off. I believe though that your understanding and vision for the project are faulty and both inspire others towards such positions and more directly, hurt it. In sum, I admire your passion, but your positions seem very ill-chosen and harmful to me. I reiterate my apology for not coming to you before about this. Over the many years I've been on Wikipedia, I've seen many people who have had similar ideas - oftentimes they eventually go away, sometimes they don't. I try, when I can, to talk to people early and consistently about problems I see, but it's exhausting to do so, and I never know who's going to either be active enough for a conversation to be a good use of my time/energy and who's going to stick around long enough. Wikipedia, especially to the extent that I'm involved, is very tiring, and I hope you'll forgive my lack of forthrightness in this regard, even if you don't end up agreeing with me on what the project needs and my analysis of the effects of your activities. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 03:45, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I definitely accept and respect your apology - that's really big of you, and shifts my opinion of you tremendously. I will say one thing, however - we may not agree on where we should be heading in regard to sourcing (it's interesting that you categorize them as loosening restrictions when I'm trying to introduce more sourcing, I guess that's perception for you), but we're in the same place on a lot of things. I'm not looking for "radical democracy," that wouldn't work here. I do think we need hard process, but only because I think the lack of it is actively harming the process at this point. Again, these are disagreements, and the two extremes we sit on end up working out relatively well, I'd think. Finally, the CSD? i'm really only vehemently against two criteria that I think are unnecessary, the rest fall into that area I think makes logical sense. We're closer on some of these issues than you may think, and I'm hoping this small exchange might help both of us make a better effort in noticing that in the future. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 03:51, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Badlydrawnjeff. Thanks for reviewing the Turtles film for GA status. I know what you mean in reference to the prose being a problem, as it is very stop-and-start. The main reason for this is probably because some of the article was kind of put together from a range of sources/facts/websites/etc, so it kind of seems like a bunch of things thrown together. I'll go through it and try and tidy it up though. Thanks.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavey4_ec8f.html" title="User:Davey4">Davey4</a></p>

<p>Hi badlydrawnjeff,</p>
<p>I was wondering if you have a moment to look at <a href="../../../g/i/n/Ginger_Snaps_8d89.html" title="Ginger Snaps">Ginger Snaps</a>. This article seems to have a bare minimum of cites (could use more, and some of the sources are kinda marginal-quality IMO, but...)</p>

<dd>haha! Well, which way were you leaning? The sourcing worries me a little more than it worries you, but it seems like the prose worries you more than it worries me.

<li>An RfC on Jeff would be a waste of time - absurd and frivolous. ED is a sore point for a lot of reasons, but I see no compelling evidence that Jeff is part of the problem. They pressed the nuclear button and it blew up in their faces but I see no evidence that Jeff would encourage or condone that kind of crap. I disagree with Jeff on pretty much everything, but malicious he ain't, not in my experience anyway. The assertion that he's an EDer first and a Wikipedian second is absurd and again without any compelling evidence. Jeff is Jeff, he likes what he likes, he tries to document it in the projects where he finds a place to hang his hat, and in my experience he tries to do so within the bounds of what the community accepts, albeit working to influence community mores towards accepting what he likes. As a Wikiphilosophy it is entirely legitimate, even if what he likes is not necessarily what many of us have in mind when we think "encyclopaedia". I can't see him as the problem here. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Zoe, Jeff questions nearly <i>every</i> deletion, he's the most inclusionist inclusionist I know, but his aims and yours are precisely the same: to build a great encyclopaedia. You (and I) and he have legitimate Wikiphilosophical differences about what that means, exactly, but you can't accuse Jeff of not being committed to the project.

<p>I would like to propose <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline</a> as a guideline to detail the necessary components of a "non-free image use", or "fair use", rationale. At present, it's kindof a moving target. Some image description pages have a detailed, bulleted rationale, while others have a one sentence "this picture identifies the subject". Patroling <a href="../../../a/l/l/Category%7EAll_images_with_no_fair_use_rationale_7ce8.html" title="Category:All images with no fair use rationale">Category:All images with no fair use rationale</a>, I've seen image pages that explicitly have something of a rationale that have been nominated for a speedy.</p>
<p>This is not an attempt to change or influence the image use policy in any way - and I would like to steer it away from becoming a rehash of the arguments over recent changes to the fair use policy. The only purpose of this guideline is to assist users who upload fair use images in correctly and adequately documenting what they feel to be the rationale for using the images.</p>
<p>So I would like for us to formalize what is required. I have also created <a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_rationale_05b3.html" title="Template:Fair use rationale">Template:Fair use rationale</a> and I would like to propose that we use it or something similar as a template to assist users in creating an acceptable rationale. I have no particular attachment to the proposal as it stands now - I have created it only as a starting point. Please see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline</a> and the associated talk page to give your thoughts and ideas. Thank you. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Curiosity about the Jeff Pulver entry</span></h2>
<p>I'm just curious as to why you took out the content from the Jeff Pulver page, in spite of what is said on the discussion page and in Jeff's blog. Please restore this vandalism unless you have a good (and stated) reason. Your brief "copyvio" note in the save message has already been countered (before your edit), so a source for your claim would be interesting. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Hans Persson (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hans_Persson_9e20.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hans Persson">contribs</a>) 07:43, 20 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>It was a straight copy-paste, and read like a press release anyway. We can discuss further at that talk page if you're interested. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 11:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then the obvious solution would be to rewrite it to NPOV, not delete information claiming copyvio which isn't there. I'm getting more and more loath to write stuff in Wikipedia, since it seems more and more common that people take stuff away for no good reason (the ridiculous "notoriety guidelines" being the most common cause). 193.180.23.45 14:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're talking to one of the most notorious users who want to keep things <i>in</i> the encyclopedia. Ask anyone about it. With that said, even if we had permission from Pulver's blog, unless he's going to release it in a usable license here, it won't fly, and someone else would find an excuse to speedy delete it as a copyright violation anyway, and even if he did release it in a worthwhile license, the way it was written wasn't all that encyclopedic. I've probably rescued the article by stubbing it and sticking to what he's notable about. Please expand it, I don't know the guy, but we can't have a cut and paste job for any number of reasons. If you want the article to stay, you have a friend in me, but we do have basic standards outside of our very ridiculous notoriety guidelines (I agree with you on that). --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Julie Kenner</span></h2>
<p>Hi I noticed that you reinstated the redlinks for the <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Kenner_bddc.html" title="Julie Kenner">Julie Kenner</a> article. Anyway I'm just here to start a discussion on that. I personally don't like all of those redlinks on an article and I know wikipedia generally discourages making a redlink that will never be created into an article. Although if you get around to it that's awesome, I just can't see <i>all</i> of the books being made into articles sometime within the immediate future. A worry is that even if the articles are made some might not actually meet the current proposed guidelines of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">book notability</a>. Anyway I just came by to see if there's a compromise that could be reached on the links? Perhaps put a list of linked books on the talk page and unlink the ones on the main article until the book articles are created? Anyway I just thought I'd bring it up for discussion. --<a href="../../../i/m/m/User%7EImmortalGoddezz_7596.html" title="User:ImmortalGoddezz">ImmortalGoddezz</a> 16:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I don't see the book notability guideline getting anywhere currently (and I've had some strong input over there), so I hadn't been thinking with that in mind. Here's my issue - I don't want to see a chance at the articles being made diminished by hiding them off on the talk page or aynthing. I'm not entirely sure what they're harming. If you feel <i>really</i> strongly, I'll work with you on something, but I'm not really seeing the problem currently. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's more aesthetic than anything else for me, I'm not a fan of huge lists with nothing but redlinks. I really only see maybe one or two of these books being made into articles that are more than stubs. Plus I'm not a fan of having an article on a book created and it only being a sentence or two, it seems like the majority of books by romance authors that I've come across on here are nothing more than that, and even though I'm more of an inclusionist I'd much rather see those go than have them stay. I guess that's more of an all or nothing mentality. And you're right they're not hurting anything anyway I guess I'd like to see where these redlinks go, in a few months if nothing has been done with them perhaps discussion on the redlinks could be brought up again? --<a href="../../../i/m/m/User%7EImmortalGoddezz_7596.html" title="User:ImmortalGoddezz">ImmortalGoddezz</a> 17:09, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that's fair.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">E-gamers - what category is being used?</span></h2>
<p>I'm not trying to PO people here, and this is a serious question from a non-sports person (the only sports I do are downhill skiing and figure skating (and a bit of college hockey years ago))... What criteria is being used for these people? My reading of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is along these lines...</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> Where do e-gamers fall into the standard categories? They are not:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Political figures</dd>
<dd>local political figures</dd>
<dd>entertainment or opinion makers</dd>
<dd>actors or TV Personalities</dd>
<dd>Published authors, editors and photographers</dd>
<dd>Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals</dd>
<dd>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events, such as by being assassinated</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can they be considered under the following:?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States.</dd>
</dl>
<p>They aren't sportspeople or athletes - but they may be <i>competitors</i>; is this the category where their notability is being justified? I didn't think that this was the intent of this category; I read this as those that are actually physically competing. If e-athletes are to be judged under this criteria, I would urge a notation being made as such to prevent further confusion on the issue.</p>
<p>As I couldn't put them in any of the above categories, I fell back to the basic:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field. - All of these criteria are in fact simply special cases of the general primary criterion of multiple non-trivial published works from independent sources. A person who is "part of the enduring historical record" will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There may be articles written about these people, to whom I have no animosity, but can it be said that they are making a <i>widely recognized contribution that is part of the <b>enduring historical record</b> in their specific field</i>?</p>
<p>I do agree that several of the persons on the AFD list do have independent notability, and have noted so on their pages. However when looking at the field, I still say that these don't qualify as I don't see how they are part of the enduring historical record... (article - began playing):</p>

<dd>I think WP:BIO works for these. I've made my opinions known at the ones who clearly meet it, although I think anyone considered a "professional gamer" should be included - WP:BIO needs to be amended to better reflect that. My suggestion to you, if you're going to pursue it, is see if you can't work with the gamers in the various wikiprojects first before doing more AfDs, to see if we can't improve the sourcing and make it explicitly clear. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:08, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, thanks for your response. I think I understand your position much better having read your comments, but I may still misunderstand, so please correct me if I am wrong.</dd>

<dd>Regarding snowball, I think there is no doubt that snowball has been used as a bulldozer to avoid useful and productive discussions. I don't know if you are aware of the MfD against Esperanza that was closed early as no-consensus. That particular case seemed to me to be a wise use of closing an debate which was (imho) clearly not going to arrive at consensus and was (again imho) not serving the community. I am curious if you are aware of it, and if you are opposed to that early closing. I think we probably agree with respect to the majority of instances where the snowball clause has been invoked, but possibly disagree there are some cases where closing a discussion might be appropriate. If we do disagree on that point, then I can respect your position. And further, since I would not be representing your position as an admin, I can respect your oppose vote. (I am assuming that you would equally oppose anyone else who left room for early closings of discussion). I very much wish that we could arrive at some common ground. However, I am not sure how, or whether, this could be achieved. If you have any thoughts, I would welcome hearing them.</dd>

<dd>With regard <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G11" title="WP:CSD">CSD:G11</a>, I think the situation is somewhat similar to the above. Let me first say that you are correct that CSD:G11 applies to "Blatant advertising. Pages which exclusively promote a company, product, group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic." My paraphrase was not meant to belittle the standard requiring "the need to be fundamentally rewritten". Rather, I was intending to emphasize another point, which was that an admin <i>may</i> delete articles which meet CSD:G11, <b>but is not required to</b>, and that I do not intend to do so. I think the difference between us on this may be that I have stated my willingness to accept admins who delete G11 articles within policy, but that you may wish me to be an admin that represents inclusionism against such admins. If that is your position, again, I can respect it, and I can respect an oppose vote on that basis. However, if that <i>is</i> your position, then I do have a request to make. You commented in the RfA that you could not trust me with the deletion tools. If my understanding of our differences is accurate, I would very much appreciate it if you would consider rewording you oppose vote in line with this. However, if you believe that I would be deleting articles, despite my explanations, then please keep your words as they are. Thank you again for your time.

<dd>We can always agree to disagree.</dd>
<dd>Basically, I believe it's clear there is no consensus to eliminate the guideline right now, regardless of whether consensus/unanimity/supermajority was present when {{<a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">guideline</a>}} was proposed. A grand total of 2 users that I've seen have expressed some levels of opposition to it since you started raising concern, including you. So I'm saying We can just stop harping on the talk page for the time and see how it evolve. After all, plenty of people do not agree with some of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> subsets' criteria, but agree that there is not consensus enough to remove them.</dd>
<dd>There <i>is</i> a chance that some of these types of categories will prove to be too difficult to decide to be reasonably held within the guideline, but we won't know until the guideline has had some time to be actually applied, will we? There will be plenty of occasions for us to butt head at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a>, if you care to come there, and when (if?) consensus that the guideline is problematic arises.</dd>
<dd>How does that sound?<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 17:25, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that there was never a consensus to begin with, a common issue with certain premature taggings. Instead of allowing consensus to exist, we're starting from the point that one person believes there's consensus, and we're forced to work in that frame. That's not how it goes. You don't say "it's a guideline" and let people disagree, you say "should this be a guideline" and let people agree/disagree. The evolution has been retarded by the way one person chose to go about this, and a good point was made on the talk page - we already <i>have</i> a guideline policy that works fine, this only muddies the waters. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm no dismissing your belief (I firmly believe consensus was present when the guideline was tagged as such), I'm just making abstraction of it since it appears clearly to me that <i>right now</i> there is no consensus whatsoever to either call the guideline "disputed," much less demote it. And it appears enough people believe that these examples are necessary to create the guideline in the first place.

<dd>My point is that you build consensus first, and then tag. You don't tag, state that there's consensus, and then force people to attempt to prove a negative. The latter is what occurred - in this case, he <i>may</i> be right, but you don't act until one knows for certain. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That maybe (repeat:I believe there was consensus from the start) there was not "wide enough consensus" (because NOBODY disagreed, so you can hardly say there was no consensus at all) is STILL not relevant to demoting a proposal that CURRENTLY has clear consens-...</dd>
<dd>Wait a minute, scratch that. You clearly don't want to agree to disagree. I'll be opening a Mediation request soon.<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 20:18, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nice article. A few issues: 1) The lead looks good - not great, but good. I'm <i>horrible</i> at leads, it's easily my weakest area in writing articles. I know a few people who helped me watch this talk page, so I'll see if I can't pester some folks for you. 2) The knowledge is very specialized. Reading it, I felt rather lost, to be honest, stumbling over a lot of the words. Science isn't my strong point, do you know if it's possible to simplify the language without sacrificing the accuracy, which is more important to retain? 3) Referencing. The number is excellent, but why did you choose to go with everything at the end of the paragraphs? Furthermore, while that seems to be the style of choice, it's not entirely consistent from section to section, which will at least require an explanation. It's not <i>wrong</i> as much as a little jarring if you don't know why, y'know?
<dl>
<dd>Otherwise, I can't say it's bad. If it were up for GA, I'd pass it, but it might not hurt to take a look at those things and see if the prose can't get a third opinion on it.

<li>Ah, thanks.</li>
<li>I've tried to provide wikilinks for as much of the technical terms as possible (e.g. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernalization.html" title="Vernalization">vernalization</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil_seed_bank.html" title="Soil seed bank">soil seed bank</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calyx_tube.html" title="Calyx tube">calyx tube</a>). I don't think it is anymore jargonistic than, say, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banksia_integrifolia.html" title="Banksia integrifolia">Banksia integrifolia</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procellariidae.html" title="Procellariidae">procellariidae</a>, so any specific suggestions about specific passages that need fiddling would be especially helpful. (I always make sure to list them when I answer at FAC)</li>
<li>Actually, the only place (as you point out) where a and-of-graph convention is used is in the description section, and is <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">User:MPF</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Verbascum_thapsus&amp;diff=93360329&amp;oldid=92713201" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Verbascum_thapsus&amp;diff=93360329&amp;oldid=92713201" rel="nofollow">doing</a>.

<dd>Per #2, "V. thapsus is a dicotyledonous biennial plant that produces only a rosette of leaves in the first year" is the one I tripped up over first. With a couple reads, it becomes clear, but I also only have a <i>very</i> passing familiarity with botany. There are a few passages like that, and beefing it up with a short explanation ("V. thapsus is a dicotyledonous biennial plant that produces only a rosette of leaves in the first year, which means blah") may help.</dd>
<dd>For #3, interesting. I dunno, then, but you'll likely get more pushback if you ask other people about it, it's very unconventional.

I'm recently re-interested in doing it, and I was waiting until December finished up for good before tackling it so we'd have a full month and the "new" closings had been fully accepted, but my perception right now is that DRV is getting worse instead of better in terms of its calling.

<dd>There was a need for them, to note <i>his</i> disruption and to make the reviewing admin aware of the situation. This reeks of a punitive block, seeing how there were no edits on the issue for nearly an hour. And let's not forget that he'll be gone for at least the next 8 hours anyway given his time zone. This makes absolutely no sense, there's no way those speedies should have been allowed to stand without response. What would you have expected? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:55, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, no, you should probably have listed them for an AfD, or added the hang on tag straight away, paticularly after you saw this was a problem with more than a couple of articles. And as for 'one reason slein' - I still regard your editing pattern over the related articles as disruptive wiht so many reverts.</dd>
<dd>As for the time zone arguments - I am not in the habit of noting what time certain users chose to be awake. Indeed I couldn't tell you what time it is Japan right now. And I don't know what time it is Masachusettes either. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:00, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The hangon tag is for the authors, not people looking at the category. If anything, the AfD tag should have been added by Calton since he wanted them deleted, I went straight for the hangon tag once I noticed he was going to force his will. There's nothing disruptive about removing bad speedy tags, I still have no idea how you're coming to that conclusion. Whether you pay attention to time zones or not, this reeks of punitive action, which is a problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:02, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see how you can distinguish? I saw it and said - they shouldn't be doing that - will block them both to remind them. To me, that's not meant to be punitive. That's why its a short block - its a reminder. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:09, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; OK, I've looked over the editing pattern and decided I was hasty. Calton certianly broke the three revert rule and I'll retain his ban. I sitll don't endorse your actions but I agree a ban was strict. In a future situation, I would avoid the 'edit war' comment in the hang on tag and if a removal of a speedy is reverted, leave the article with a hangon tag. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:28, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Embarrasing for me. Not having a userpage as such, I often forget to look at them. I can only say that one of the real and continuing tragedies of Wikipedia is that people fail to respect people with whom they disagree. Despite its outcome looking at the AfD I am pleased to see that some "agree to disagree" wikilove was taking place. If you ever change your mind, do let me know.

<p><small>So whenever I see a sentence that quotes someone and does not have a comma before the quote I pute one in.

<dd>Interesting thought, I've replied to some of the inline stuff on the talk page, needs some help on one. With the comma, I <i>believe</i> I've been taught that in the way I'm using it (a non-dialogue quote), the comma breaks the statement apart improperly. Thus "Jeff said, 'I like to use commas'" is as correct as "Jeff said that he "like[s] to use commas." I will look into this further, because I very well could be wrong here and didn't realize it. Thanks for the help, as usual. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for the invitation to this excellent and fascinating article. As you've probably noticed, I've already made a lot of little changes. I went through the article once, when I really should have already gone to bed; it's therefore particularly likely that I made some mistakes. If I did, my apologies.</p>
<p>Although the article is about as interesting as any that I've read, I don't think it's yet ready for FAC. Perhaps this is partly because I have a jaded notion of the FAC process. I see a lot of people who clearly are being sincere in making this or that objection, but I also see a number who seem to insist on enforcement of their own rather arbitrary stylistic and other preferences. I think it's better to work on taking a prospective FAC to perfection (in the eyes of at least three scrupulous editors) before nominating it: its perfection will then (I hope) be so dazzling as to bring people to vote for it before anyone thinks of making some goofy objection. So let's be patient.</p>
<p>Immediately below, stripped of markup, is an example of something I don't like.</p>

</dl>
<p>The "and Company" can go, but that's trivial. <i>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag</i> is ugly, but that's trivial too. What matters is that here we have thirty-three citations of an entire book of which none tells us a page number or even page range. I shan't go through the article right now and I'll concede that for some of these thirty-three citation of the entire book may be entirely appropriate (imaginary example: "One historian has argued that the Turk epitomizes an earlier fascination with artificial life"). For most, however, the note would be more helpful as well as more informative if in the form "Levitt, 237". (<a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Adolfo_Farsari_ec35.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Adolfo Farsari">I'm not entirely happy</a> with the system of notes in <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolfo_Farsari_3729.html" title="Adolfo Farsari">Adolfo Farsari</a>, but I think it's better than that for the Turk.)</p>
<p>I realize that you're following WP style here, but I think this style is only appropriate for short papers, web pages, etc. Anyway, I thought I might bring up the matter here, rather tentatively and inconspicuously, rather than on the article's talk page. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:50, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, that's fine. I find the use of page numbers on Wikipedia to be useless due to the fluid nature of the articles - I write "Jeff enjoys cheeseburgers<sup>[1]</sup>" and then, two weeks later, someone adds "Jeff enjoys cheeseburgers <i>and milkshakes</i><sup>[1]</sup>" and the reference becomes incorrect with the page number, but not the book itself. If it were a paper or something similar that would remain static, page numbers would be a must, but that's my reasoning for keeping it as is. I'm not rushing this to FAC, in any regard - I'd like to kill a lot of the issues I had with Kroger before putting it through the wringer - and your comments look good so far, I'll try to get to them tonight or so. The work you've done so far looks good, though. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:48, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I know, it's horrible to think that a precise note can later be screwed up by some <s>dumbass</s>, er, pardon me, well-intentioned person who edits the page in such a way that the note now appears to provide the source for something other than intended. The only workaround I've thought of for this is what I've halfheartedly done in <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroh_Kikai_f5a5.html" title="Hiroh Kikai">Kikai Hiroh</a>: the note reminds the reader what it is that it is (or should be) referring to (thus "1.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mangojuice's A7 analysis</span></h2>
<p>Jeff, my reading of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_0059.html#A_one_week_long_trial_run" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion">recent arguments</a> at WT:CSD about A7 was that it may have been applied overbroadly, but that the deleted articles nonetheless weren't on notable subjects and that you weren't satisfied that process wasn't properly followed, but that argument wasn't getting many other supporters. The other day it occurred to me that one didn't need sysop access to determine whether we're actually deleting notable content. One could simply search for sources for the more notable articles and then we could discuss whether they were actually notable enough at the CSD talk page (or AFD, or DRV, or wherever). I'm not inclined to search for those sources, as I suspect I'd agree with Mangojuice's analysis (and therefore his conclusions), but I thought I might tell you about my idea in case you wanted to follow up on it.

<dd>Well, I think the evidence is persuasive, and I'm waiting for GBerry's review to go through. Mangojuice kind of dug his own hole here with his ratings - when he can say that 42% of A7s aren't unambiguous, that's a major problem.

<p>Hi <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badly_Drawn_Boy_78c6.html" title="Badly Drawn Boy">BDJ</a> --</p>
<p>I'm tracking down users who have expressed disagreement with the current "consensus" version of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">the conflict of interest</a> guidelines (the consensus currently appears to have been defined very recently by Radiant.) In particular, the guidelines as they currently stand are ambiguous and have been misinterpreted to mean that any kind of COI must automatically disqualify an editor from working on a page. I want to encourage you to join the discussion if you have the time and patience.</p>

<dd>It's part of it, certainly. More of it has to do with a small, vocal minority saying this has to happen, and one tendentious editor in particular forcing it regardless of the lack of consensus. If consensus exists for the change, there's nothing more I can say - I can accept being in the minority. But until that's demonstrated, we can't turn our entire "notability" structure upside-down. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)--<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:33, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
