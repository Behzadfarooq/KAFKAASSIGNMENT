<p>Unfortunately, our name itself is already meaningless. We cover Cryptozoology, which isn't strictly paranormal, and ghosts, which some consider supernatural. There's occasionally talk of renaming it WikiProject Weird, but the general consensus is that that would simply offend everyone involved. "Paranormal Investigation" would be asking for trouble, as well, since we already have some problems with people wanting to discuss their own paranormal experiences on the Project talk page. I do see what you're saying, but I still think the fact that they're essentially a subset of our project needs to be addressed (they exist to NPOV paranormal pages...which is obviously something we do, as well). Thanks, though. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 14:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - I've got the bot running an update now (I was having some errors last time - interent connection problems I think). The only problem is that this page will be <b>huge</b> - with 7908 entries (all subpages included, and those with minor edits included too (that was a bug in the last one - didn't recognise pages which had a minor edit on top)). I'm happy to keep it running now, but if you;d prefer a different approach, feel free to say&#160;:-) (a seperate list fo "new pages" will be generated by the bot, for ease of access&#160;:)) <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 21:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh - it's no problem&#160;:) I was more worried about a web-browser's ability to load the page than the bot's time! I had a "coding urge" just after I started the bot, so I had to stop it an write another task. So your bit gets done, I'm going to put it on my server overnight (and pray for no errors).

<p>Admin Coaching, now being coordinated by <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">HighwayCello</a>, is a program for people who want help learning some of the more subtle aspects of Wikipedia policy and culture. People are matched with experienced users who are willing to offer coaching. The program is designed for people who have figured out the basics of editing articles; they're not newcomers any more, but they might want some help in learning new roles. In this way, Esperanza would help keep hope alive for Wikipedia because we would always be grooming the next generation of admins.</p>

<dd>Yes. Actually, I can't get the my preferences page to respond to anything I want it to do, so I can't actually say which skin I am currently using, just one I've never seen before. It seems to have a first sidebar containing "user page", "discussion", "edit this page", "+", "history", "move", and "unwatch". But, like I said, I can't get the "my preferences" link to respond at all, so I can't be sure which skin this is. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 21:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thank you for all the work you've been putting in on the South Dakota WikiProject. I've been really busy with SD election stuff and haven't been online much. And thanks for moving the project out from my userspace. I had started adding banners because I read it was a good way to advertise, but I didn't think that it would be bad while the project was still a proposal. So thanks for all you've done.

<p>Hi, thanks for adding the WikiProject Aircraft template. I take no offence from you adding a "B-Class" rating - It's neither a FA or GA. However I'm working toward a FA for the article and would welcome any pointers you have; important missing topics, factual errors, etc. Many thanks, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 00:17, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All excellent suggestions, thanks very much. Regarding BAE/BAe: perhaps the best solution would be to use the abbreviation BAE, but extend the few "BAe" abbreviations to British Aerospace. Regarding the board: I'll do a quick review of their bio's and write at least a stub on any notable ones and remove any non-notable links. Thanks again. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 14:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For what little it might be worth, having looked over another talk page, I believe that statement may only apply when the comments being deleted are clearly out of bounds in terms of civility or something else. In general, unless the comments on the talk page are in some way semi-official or related to some sort of official action, any and all comments can be removed. Several editors have a habit of removing any and all comments requesting action (fix spelling, whatever), as soon as action is taken. Those rules do not necessarily apply in instances where there is no form of official or semi-official action implied or expected. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 00:46, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see. Well my preferred method is to leave all text and entries in the discussion page because its the real history of what happened. I have nothing to hide and I find the open ability to see and view the discussion allows for honest opinion and potential growth. But to each his own. As I said, I didn't mean to cause you trouble. I reposted our conversation on my talk page for simplicity to make it easy to know what we discussed. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 02:04, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no problem having my WikiProject userfied... my problem is that other Universities much smaller (see Ohio Wesleyen University) and the same amount of members was around much longer than the one I created and is still active. It's not even a public institution! Who decides which universties are scoped well enough to continue and those that aren't... if you don't think a University is a large enough scope that is fine by me... but be equitable and userfy them all as opposed to picking and choosing the flavor of the week. <a href="../../../j/a/z/User%7EJazznutuva_0eb0.html" title="User:Jazznutuva">Jazznutuva</a> 13:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you... and I was unfortunately shooting the messenger because I could not find the discussion chain for the deletion... it's just annoying when you make the effort to do something and they don'y give it more than 3 days to mature without checking out other projects under the same scope and leave them sit there without any activity. I speant a lot of time researching to make sure that other projects had the same scope as mine before investing hours to create it... and I had found ones smaller which were not as active.

<p>Believe me, I don't want any contact with you more than is the mininum required, but I refuse to stand by and be slandered. I became ill because I nominated two articles at FAC and another for peer review at the same time. I have had positive interactions with editors the entire time I have edited Wikipedia, and any acrimony has been rapidly sorted out via talkpages. So I would suggest that it is in fact <i>your</i> attitude, and <i>your</i> failure to assume good faith(and assuming reasons for my illness because you have already passed judgement on me), and <i>your</i> attempts to have the last word that are continuing this issue. I have never questioned anyone's judgement (except yours now, because I'm fed up with the circular discussion), as I have mentioned in the many of my responses which you have apparently not read, I am not questioning Evrik's motives or saying he is anything any than a perfectly honest Wikipedian with good intentions. In fact, it is you who have accused me of overreacting, of being irrational, and of apparently interrogating people who do not agree with me. I haven't interrogated anyone. I have repeatedly asked Evrik to refrain from insisting he has consensus on his side when he does, and to clarify what he did not like about the barnstar's image. This does not, I believe, constitute attacking someone. I have been perfectly civil, and it is you who have been hurling judgements and assuming bad faith and other things about me that you are thoroughly wrong about. Unsurprisingly, I have defended myself, and so you then accused me of "inserting" myself into every discussion, though that discussion was, in fact, a slander of me. I am sick of this. So what to do next? Well, I will remove our entire discussion from the barnstar page, as it has nothing to with the proposal itself. If you will refrain from attacking me, I will refrain from defending myself. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 21:11, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have removed them from a few animal rights pages (the ones I have found). Yes, dogs and cats are a part of animal rights but so are dozens of other animal species and adding them to every project that is created for a species would be a little OTT. I think these articles would only just be related to those projects and shouldn't be included in their scope.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 20:10, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry but I am slightly confused. You unilaterally added the banners without prior discussion on the pages then say I am breaching <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> by removing them? I have explained why they should not be included - as the link is tenuous at best. Also, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> applies to all of wikipedia, not just articles. Finally, my experience of the articles is that they do not really touch on the subject matter of cats or dogs in any more than a brief mention - this does not require any input from projects that focus on those species - and their time would be much better spent on pages such as West Highland White Terrior and similar. Good look with your projects also.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 21:40, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate your welcoming me into the Religion Project. I was a little reluctant to join, because of the obvious potential for conflicts of interest. However, I have some journalistic experience, and have been involved in community, political and ecumenical projects which required objectivity despite strong personal opinions.</p>

<p>Hey. Am I doing this right? I am relatively new here, and only just new how to sign the religion page. I hope I can help, and I am reltively knowledgeable at Buddhism and Catholicism (with me having gone to a Catholic Primary school and attending a Catholic Secondary school, but with me being into Buddhism, and knowing much about that). I am not too sure about what to do, and if I am not posting this right, any hints?</p>

<p><br />
I think <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Ignore all rules</a> policy is the policy that should be inforced here since the current stub rules prevent WikiProject Munich from improving or maintaining Wikipedia's Munich-related articles. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 17:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We might as well just have <a href="../../../s/t/u/Category%7EStub-class_Munich_articles_5b30.html" title="Category:Stub-class Munich articles">Category:Stub-class Munich articles</a>. WikiProject Toronto's scope is different then WikiProject Munich's. In fact, I think we'll do moore justice to the Munich-related articles then they will to the Toronto-related articles. I'm willing to compromise on the stubs but they aren't. They want everything their way which I think is quite unacceptable for a WikiProject. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 19:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You'll perhaps recall that a talk-page solution is what I suggested some time ago. Your definition of "compromise" seems to be to slightly reduce the number of stub types that ignore the guidelines (or to have created fewer of them in the first place than you could have?); and "everything their way" seems to mean, actually following the guidelines in any way. (For the record, I've suggested a Munich-stub and upmerged templates; it's not clear to me why that doesn't rise to the level of "compromise".) If want to manage these in a way that has nothing to do with the stub guidelines (or the stub-sorting project), then why use the name and idiom of "stubs" at all? Put them into some sort of bespoke wikiproject-specific maintenance category, and there will be no confusion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 21:00, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can see why you have followed the red links and added the WP dogs tag to the "hemolytic anemia" page, but the page is all about the disease in humans and so might mislead readers of dog diseases. It seems to me that some of the links on the "disease in dogs" page were specific for animals (ie the epilepsy link) and some dog disease listed to not have a human equivalent disease with the same name, but I guess that many of the links on the "diseases in dogs" page are pointing to human pages when they should be a red link to a dog disease page that has not been made yet (ie "hemolytic anemia" link should be "hemolytic anemia in dogs"). I guess that it might be worth you checking and reviewing what you have done, with a view to removing tags that have been added to a page that is entirely about human diseases. It seems ironic to me that a human disease should have a dog disease disease tag even before it has a human disease tag and many readers may be puzzled by this. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanradio_64ad.html" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> 21:36, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Will do. I generally tried to ensure that there was at least some content specifically relating to dogs, but, as I'm still going through the list, it won't be hard to just back up a little and ensure that canines are at least mentioned in more than weak passing in all the articles I tagged. Since the first one, I've also made sure not to tag any that don't explicitly mention canines, to prevent the same thing happening again.

<dd>I have made it no longer fail when not substituted, although it leaves an ugly {{BASEPAGENAME}} now. I removed the frame, because having a frame either means I can't sign in the template (and can't add personal notes) or I need to manually add a &lt;/div&gt; after my signature. You forgot to close the div, so I fixed it by changing to a no-boxes version. There are tricks to include an auto-signature, of course, but they fail if the template is not substituted.

<dd>You are quite welcome. Thank you for all the work you've done with that project, and good luck with it and your studies. Yes, I do remember how hard university classes can be, and I hope that you make sure that you spend as much time there as you have to. Wikipedia is important, but getting through school is more important. If you want, I could prepare the template for assessment, and make the various categories and so on that go with it. I probably wouldn't be able to get around to it till Saturday at the earliest, though. Again, good luck with your studies, and thanks for your work on the Peru project. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 00:57, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As this is the first WikiProject I'm working on, I didn't know multiple importance switches were unusual. I mainly implemented them to allow merging the Munich banner into the Germany banner (the Mainz project is just my personal little pet side project and basically an extension of my sandbox). I haven't done anything with the 1.0 project before, so I have no idea where to register our categories (other than bugging Oleg directly).

<p>A fair point. However, you may note from the general discussion that I had announced my intention to close it around the end of November, and evrik (who is a major contributor to barnstar discussions, as I'm sure we are both aware) said that two weeks were needed. When I said "Yeah, so around December then" he didn't question it. I took my cue from that, and after exactly two weeks calculated the consensus. If someone won't to list it for removal, that's OK, as long as it isn't you, me, or evrik.&#160;:) Also, it would be good to wait a few months and see how the barnstar does. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 02:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"The others are very broad and some only seem to cover article mainsapce, as before, and the latter is specialised to humourous comments. I was proposing an award to cover suggestions and ideas and to show the editor is contributing to discussions in a helpful way, perhaps. This will also be based, but not only, on the number edits they make to discussions of articles and maybe users. I hope this does not encourage vandalism but is a form of encouragement to new and existing editors. However i am not trying to replace other awards. Simply south 16:44, 27 November 2006 (UTC)"</i></p>
<p>I have put this in speech marks as i have posted this on the awards propsals page in response the evrik and hopefully to more define the question proposal generally. Is it clearer or a wordy way of saying the same thing? <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 16:51, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's clear enough. I think the question being raised is more about whether the award is required by circumstances. I don't think anyone is saying that awards for such conduct are a bad idea, simply questioning whether this particular award proposal is likely to be used and whether existing awards would be sufficient in instances where this particular award could be used. Proliferation of barnstars is something generally everyone is trying to avoid, and there would be an infinite number if action to prevent it were not taken. I hope you realize that even those who oppose the proposal do not oppose giving out barnstars in those situations where such an award is deserved, but simply oppose the creation of an additional award. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:58, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to say i do know that people are not opposing giving out barnstars and i am sorry if it read like that. There is the discussion about whether Working Man, Dilligent and Tireless Contributor are duplicates and changing Working Man to Working Person. I am hoping this award is not a duplicate and covrs an area that hasn't really been covered much; more as a general award though. I understand about producing too many awards but I am not meaning this as clutter. Btw, do you think this 2nd (3rd) image is okay? A simplistic approach.</dd>

<dd>I actually like the image above quite a bit, partially because I am more than a bit fond of the old comic word balloon and I think it conveys the point well. I can also agree that it might help to promote more talk page discussion, but can also understand the reservation some might have that creating a barnstar for something one hopes will become more of a common practice could be eventually unproductive if the practice never develops. I can see the perceived need for the award, but am still dubious as to whether the creation of the award will assist in having that need met. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:41, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello there&#160;; thanks for letting me know about the proposed radio programmes project.

<dd>It might be an idea to acquire the interest of the old-time radio community, since they would probably be the largest contributors to the wikiproject.

<p>I'm not sure I'd agree it was "unfortunate" that guideline-ignoring stub types can be nominated for deletion, but note that SFD isn't part of <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_7aa0.html" title="WP:WSS">WP:WSS</a>, it's just yet another deletion process page (no membership or jacket required). (The rather massive overlap in personnel is probably somewhat inevitable.) We'd be having much the same whether or not stub types were still handled at TFD, CFD, or a muddled combination of the two, as previously. All quibbling aside, though, I'd like to thank you for your helpful interventions in this matter: patience has been known to wear a bit thin at WSS in cases like this, where an over-keen or just plain dogged newcomer insists that we ignore all stub-sorting practice for their (alleged) benefit, or rationalise it from the ground up. Having a less "involved" party can be very beneficial. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 17:52, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's quite all right, that was pretty much my impression of the situation. It's regretable if the complexities of SFD or WSS/P present a 'barrier to entry' to more people participating, both because of, as you say, "democratic" considerations (I put that in quotes as we in Wikipedia seem to have a constitutional monarch, and no constution (like the UK, though the similarities in governance end there)), and because of course the project needs all the "fresh meat" it can get, to deal with our numerous backlogs. If you have any suggestions as to what are the main areas of cognitive overload, I'd be keen to try and address them, either by simplifying if possible, and trying to explain them better if not. (We're probably in need of something of a "jargon file" someplace, and I've noticed that 'upmerged templates' for one thing are a mantra of several regulars, and often entirely bemuse passers-by.) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 15:18, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you think this should be also be for discussions on user talk pages as well, pref about articles? or not? Or should that even be a seperate award? Also, should i raise this on the proposal page?</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 15:51, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not really sure. That seems a completely different idea altogether. Why not propose that seperately as it seems to be a reasonable award? Hopefully not clutter.</p>
<p>One other thing. Should the award focus mainly on controversial articles or articles in general (Original proposal)? <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 16:26, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And then back to the Working Man controversy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Jeffpw's statement on the award, as you can see is</p>
<p><i>"The Discussion Barnstar is awarded to editors who make significant use of an article's Talk Page in order to discuss changes to the article and achieve consensus, rather than simply making wholesale changes, especially to controversial articles. The award was created in order to encourage editors to discuss, rather than engage in edit wars."</i></p>
<p>Does this focus on controversial articles or is it also general? However, i do appreciate what he\she has put. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 16:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a reach, and I can full well understand if you want to remove the banner. Basically, (1) I'm adding the banner to all articles that fall in the scope of the project, to ensure as many articles as possible get assessed (Dogs does assessment), and (2) Sirius is called the "dog star", and linked to some older legends relating to dogs, which legends do fall within the project's scope. The article is also specifically mentioned on one of the lists from, although I can't remember specifically which one right now. I was considering adding the similar banner to Canis Major, Canis Minor, and Canes Venatici as well, but thought I might well get a response from just the one. I can understand if you would want to remove it, particularly here, but would be interested in knowing in any event regarding whether you would have similar objections to inclusion on the two Canis constellations.

<p>Just a quick note to say thanks for your support on my recent RfA. It became clear very quickly that my editing background was going to detrimental to my nomination. Having seen other recent RfA's fail once one or two admins opposed and others just piled on the vote, I decided it would save the ignominy if I withdrew my nomination. I don't intend to change the work I do as it's what I enjoy, so it'll be unlikely I'll apply again. Anyway thanks again for taking the time to review my nomination and giving your support.

<p>If you are going to mediate this, I suggest you educate yourself, as some of your assumptions are missing key information. Like the fact that the Turkish Van is the name used by every major cat registry in the world, not just one. There are links to all of these in the infobox in the article. <a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/turkish-van.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/turkish-van.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a page you should read that will give some background. Note it also mentions the cats' ancient Turkish origins. I am neither making this information up, nor am I including it without references. Last, please understand that the phrase "Turkish Van" (or its direct translation in Turkish) does not even exist in Turkish making the title of the article a non issue. They only use "Van Kedisi" (Van cat) which is in reference to their idea of what a Van Cat is (all white). This is fine and an article about their point of view should exist at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Kedisi_7644.html" title="Van Kedisi">Van Kedisi</a> (which it does), but that is a separate entity from the breed named Turkish Van (different breeds now, but they share common street cat in Van origins). <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 02:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thats okay. I'm sorry i keep asking so many question about this. Not many people have bitten. I'm sure i've dropped them a note.

<p>BadBill, I am wondering if you could give me your opinion on two links that keep getting inserted into the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Crested_Dog_aadd.html" title="Chinese Crested Dog">Chinese Crested Dog</a> article. I tend to remove breeder database and other commercial listings when I see them in an article and prefer to err on the side of caution, but we have a couple of editors that seem to think the breeder database should be included even though it's a commercial link and that if it is removed, that the rescue link should be removed as well. I've removed both for now (unless I've been reverted) but wanted feedback. My inclination would be to keep the link to the rescue and remove the breeder d-base. Am not invested in the outcome either way, but just want to be sure my position on article links is correct per policy. --<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 18:37, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for that info and I will look into other resources like the old project for more info. One of the site is a for-profit breeder database that makes money by advertising Chinese Crested breeders <a href="http://www.chinesecrested.no/advertising.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chinesecrested.no/advertising.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. If I read you correctly, the rescue site should be included, but the other site may be too commercial for inclusion. --<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 19:20, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added a bit to your proposed project page. I also added my name to the list of interested parties. My primary interest in wikipedia is in making sure that projects which I feel to be important to the development of wikipedia be given as much help by me as I am able to offer. This includes all the national projects. As a result, my to-do backlog is, shall we say, frightening. I will offer what assistance I can to the project, but that will most likely be in terms of template construction and assessment. But, if there is anything I can do, please feel free to let me know. Good luck. Badbilltucker 19:42, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for you input in creating the first Novels "task force" as you might see I have link this in with the "project banner", joined it myself and altered the {{<a href="../../../n/o/v/Template%7ENovelsWikiProject_a82d.html" title="Template:NovelsWikiProject">NovelsWikiProject</a>}} article talk banner to take account of it. You will also notice I changed it back to the term "Task force" as I think consistency with other projects is worth having, particularly one that is so well administered as MilHist. Anyway thanks again - the main page is most impressive but I suspect may need trimming a bit soon, but we can discuss that more later.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 10:13, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No problem. The only section I really disagreed about was that WikiProjects tend to focus on collaborations, then split off. I usually find that collaborations are the most difficult things to start, since they require that most of a small project works on the same thing for an extended period of time; usually, members of WikiProjects have similar preferences, but not similar enough to make such a protracted committment work. So, I usually think it is better for a WikiProject to create a framework for individual collaboration first, and then, when articles of high priority and significant difficulty are identified, for multi-editor efforts to be undertaken.</p>
<p>As for the sentences, it wasn't bad at all; sometimes, I have the same problem. I find that it is easier to hard-limit myself to one clause in a sentence, and then, if I am really sure that the sentence can handle more than one, add at most two. But I usually try to never have more than one subject in a sentence, and to keep them fairly short. If I need to repeat antecedents of adjacent complex sentences, it's no biggie; it's better than to have a huge run-on that leaves everyone who reads it out of breath. Just a tip... <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 21:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The council expired one month ago, but due to the current position of the group the current council will remain until the position of the group can be assessed, and whether it would be sensible to keep Concordia going. For most decisions, however, it will be decided by all who choose to partake in discussions. I am trying to relaunch because of the vast amounts of new members we have received, demonstrating that the aims are supported.</p>

<p>recently while working on a school process, the hard work of myself and my classmates has been completely deleted, as far as i am aware, without any justification. I feel that other than my fellow classmates, Badbilltucker is the only person here who supports this project and is working towards bettering it. It is because the actions of certain members that I am likely to discontinue my assosciation with Wikipedia. At the start of this project, i was genuinely interested in wikipedia. I would just like you to know how certain members of this project have in my mind come to reflect the entire organization in an unpleasant manner. I assure you once again that the information this class has put into this is accurate and beneficial to the project as a whole, but it was deleted unjustly. You have my sincerest apologies for my attitude towards wikipedia, but this project seems to have brought the worst in me. Thank you very much, and goodbye. I only wish that i could say that it was a pleasant experience. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo2_Gamer_ce03.html" title="User:Halo2 Gamer">Halo2 Gamer</a> 08:30, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
