<p>Hey, thanks for your help expanding the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrod_Blank_4d00.html" title="Harrod Blank">Harrod Blank</a> article. I just have one question - you listed him in the category "people from orange county, ca". Berkeley, CA is part of Alameda county last I checked. Is that an error or did he used to live in Orange County and I'm just unaware of it? <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 16:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no idea where it comes from either! One version means "Old/ancient (time period wise) meat". The other is purely onomatopoeic. (and sounds like <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gollum.html" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>!)</p>
<p>Personally, my theory is that the dish comes from non-Chinese sources (Mongol, Manchu, etc?), hence the funny name. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 05:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting theories! I'm not too sure about the "complaining meat" theory though - <i>gulu</i> "咕嚕" is usually onomatopeia for the sound of something rolling. It can also mean "muttering (in a complaining sort of way)", but that is more commonly written as <i>gunong</i> 咕哝. Still, an interesting theory...</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, the article draws a connection between sweet and sour pork and <i>tangcu liji</i>, sugar and vinegar fillets. While sugar + vinegar does taste sweet and sour, I think that sweet-and-sour sauce is quite different from what is referred to as sugar+vinegar sauce. The latter is made from <a href="../../../z/h/e/Zhenjiang.html" title="Zhenjiang">Zhenjiang</a> vinegar and is dark in colour. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 05:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I also congratulate you for the fact that you knew of a topic that I didn't know. I don't know much about modern Korea, anyway.

<p>It is possible to be wrong, yes. If we get new information that supercedes older data we usually replace it; the authority record for Anahid Ajemian cites the 1950 ed. of the <i>International Who's Who in Music</i>; so it's entirely possible that new info from a family member or census data would change the date. I can try to do more research if you want and find a more recent source. --<a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFeanorStar7_4f75.html" title="User:FeanorStar7">FeanorStar7</a> 17:49, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, in similar cases, the real dictionary I have, iirc, lists the whole compound word under "表外音訓" (something like "exceptions"). I don't know if there is a standard way Wiktionary does it, though.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 18:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, I see that you (or someone who saw our discussion) went ahead and added the pronunciation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I randomly tried a couple of words from a couple of random pages in my dictionary that have the exceptons (魚 and 恭). Wiktionary does not know about these exceptions, and since 魚 is such a common word, I suppose it means that Wiktonary does not have any existing policy about these and the exceptions aren't generally listed. So I guess whatever we do is ok (at this time at least, I guess).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, thanks for the Wiktionary link. Knowing that the Japanese "on" is "saku" and the Korean pronunciation is "jak" is very important to me: it means that the colloquial Cantonese word /dzak3/ (to press) is not really colloquial after all, but an existing word, with the standard meaning, but with an ancient pronunciation.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 08:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am pretty sure we don't consider it a dumpling. As for whether it is dim sum or not, dim sums are basically snacks/desserts and ci fan tuan (usually just called ci fan here in Toronto) is not really a snack, so I would tend to not see it as dim sum. I'll ask other people &amp; see what they think.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 18:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, I guess I really am not too familiar with the English notion of a "dumpling"; if the zongzi is considered a dumpling, then I guess you are right that ci fan tuan probably is one too. I am not really sure myself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the "dim sum" classification, it turns out that the answer is "yes" (it is dim sum). This hinges on whether "北方小吃" (of which ci fan tuan is) is considered dim sum, and the answer seems to be yes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the referencing, <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Instantnood</a> is the one who did it first. I saw him did it and followed suit.</dd>

<dd>BTW, only one day after I started dabbling in Wikipedia again, I already felt the anger and stress (not to mention the addiction) that made me quit last time (no, it's nothing to do with you). After sorting out your questions, hopefully within the next couple of days, I will try harder to quit again.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 20:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Can you please explain your reason for reverting the recent set of edits I made (75.---) to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_noodles.html" title="Chinese noodles">Chinese noodles</a> article? I mainly corrected and added some Cantonese and Taiwanese pronunciations. Thanks. Cgkm 23:50, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(you said:) Hi, if your edit was done in that way I apologize. But when I see simplified characters deleted and substituted with traditional ones (instead of giving both to supplement one another), it makes me doubt the veracity of the rest of the edits.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this offended you, I apologize. 面 is one of those characters that was the result of an ambiguous simplfication, since 面 is also a traditional character in its own right and does not mean "noodle". I would have put both, but I wanted to conserve space; perhaps including both simplified and traditional would be better.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(you said:) Further, it's my understanding that Taiwanese and Hokkien are the same language; why the necessity to delete the name "Hokkien" and substitute "Taiwanese" when this language, or very similar versions of it, are spoken also in Fujian, Singapore, etc.?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree that Taiwanese and Hokkien are closely related (i.e. dialects of the same language). However, the term "Hokkien" often carries a Southeast Asian flavor to it, and that is how it is used in this article. The Hokkien romanizations provided are how they are spelled in Southeast Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, etc.), and as thus they have Southeast Asian influences (like "mee", "mee pok", "mee kiah", "hor fun", and "laksa") that do not appear in Taiwanese or other dialects of Minnan. In fact, "hor fun" and "laksa" are borrowed terms, not native terms, and hence are even more foreign to Taiwanese speakers.</p>
<p>I did not delete any "Hokkien" references in the article; I merely added "Taiwanese" ones. The Taiwanese romanizations I have added are more accurate in some sense since they come from a romanization system. Cgkm 00:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, the thing is, the best you're going to see are probably ad-hoc translations. The translations you have there at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_cookie.html" title="Fortune cookie">fortune cookie</a> are just a few combinations using synonyms of "fortune", "paper slip", "foretell", and "cookie"; using the same pattern, and using more synonyms that I can think of right now, we can come up with probably another 1000 names, and they would all be "correct". So I think it's inherently pointless to try and come up with a Chinese name for "fortune cookie", because as far as I can tell, "the" Chinese name simply doesn't exist. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 04:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for the compliment. Yes, the info already there is accurate. I did take the photo at one of the shops on the shore of Inya lake near the boatclub on Inya Road, Yangon. It's Burmese <i>to hpu</i>, so most likely made from chickpea flour; lucky they had the fresh tohpu set in trays being cut up for frying, with the fritters on the same table in front of the shop. If you look up Burmese tofu in <a href="../../../t/o/f/Talk%7ETofu_dbec.html" title="Talk:Tofu">Talk:Tofu</a> you'll relise we've had this discussion before (May 2006).</p>
<p>The name is probably a misnomer as the beancurd tofu made from soybean is called <i>pè bya</i> (lit. pressed peas) and not tofu in Burma. <i>To hpu</i> - there is no f in the Burmese alphabet only 'hp' - and <i>tohu</i> are synonymous; yellow tohu made from chickpea or yellow split pea is also called <i>won ta hpo</i>, and rice tohu <i>hsan ta hpo</i> in the Shan regions as well as <i>hsan to hpu</i> as it's made from rice (<i>hsan</i>) flour, so it's white. I would upload a picture of rice tohu but there's hardly any room. I have no idea how the to hpu - pè bya difference came about, but Shan to hpu presumably already existed when the Chinese beancurd made its debut in Burma. <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWagaung_91bf.html" title="User:Wagaung">Wagaung</a> 21:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Hnapyan gyaw</i> means twice fried in Burmese (<a href="../../../t/o/f/Talk%7ETofu_dbec.html" title="Talk:Tofu">Talk:Tofu</a>). Rice flour is <i>hsan hmont</i> or <i>mont hmont</i> (mont = cake, hmont = powder); wheat or <i>gyoun</i> is not staple as far as the Burmese are concerned. I'm not sure if Burmese tofu shouldn't remain in the main article. If it merits a seperate article should it still be called tofu with an explanation of the 'mixup'? <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWagaung_91bf.html" title="User:Wagaung">Wagaung</a> 22:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If it gets a separate article, it will still be mentioned briefly in the tofu article, with a link to the full article. Of course, we now know that Burmese tofu can be made with three types of powder (four if one counts Burmese soybean tofu as a fourth type). The Burmese tofu article could discuss them all, with photos. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 23:35, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea. I'll do it thanks to your support. I'll take some pictures of Burmese Chinese tofu (<i>pè bya</i>) and also the <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stinky_tofu.html" title="Stinky tofu">stinky tofu</a> version (<i>si to hpu</i>) from a market stall the next time in Burma. <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWagaung_91bf.html" title="User:Wagaung">Wagaung</a> 00:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't write the line about Karnow, I wrote the line about Nixon's staff member who counters Karnow's presentation that Nixon was acting in bad faith.

<p>He did use fix in this context, found at <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/28/politics/main502490.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/28/politics/main502490.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/28/politics/main502490.shtml</a> “This time the focus was on a photo of children running from napalm - which was to become one of the most famous and haunting images of the 20th century. [He wondered if it was posed] ‘I'm wondering if that was fixed,’ Nixon mused after seeing the photograph. Haldeman replies, ‘Could have been.’”</p>
<p>There is also this speech from the Oliver Stone movie <i>Nixon</i> which could be from a tape or could be the work of Stone’s screenwriters (he likes to splice in archival stuff into his movies). <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/nixon.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/nixon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/nixon.htm</a> “. . .

They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon. They've always hated Nixon.”</p>
<p>There is also a lot of stories about Nixon’s view of John Kerry but the word “fixed” is not in there. None of the hard core conspiracy sites that claim Nixon wanted Kent State students to suffer for shouting him down at previous appearances makes any mention of him saying anything incriminating on tape. It would seem that if he had said anything remotely like what you suggest that the people accusing him of directing murder in Kent State would be the first to quote it.

<p>One of the references is there - as a reference, and linked as such, since you pointed out to me that this one was an authority for the use of more than one variety of agave.</p>
<p>The Volcanic link you had was to a page with no factual merit, and there was no way of knowing which assertions in your additions you considered to be justified by the pages elsewhere in that site.

<p>Hi there, thanks for getting in touch. I noticed your other edits regarding <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Monadnock_0ac0.html" title="Mount Monadnock">Monadnock</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Chocorua_1986.html" title="Mount Chocorua">Chocorua</a>, and <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Washington_%28New_Hampshire%29_eb0d.html" title="Mount Washington (New Hampshire)">Washington</a>. Very cool project; I'd had no idea that Hovhaness had such a fondness for the wild places of New Hampshire. You're right that both Doubleheads are in Carroll County; I hadn't noticed that before. The one in Jackson is about 30 miles northeast of the one in Sandwich (Carroll County's a big county).</p>
<p>I have no sources to say which mountain he intended to pay tribute to, but my bets are on the one in Jackson: it's a much more significant summit (pair of summits) than the one in Carroll, which is more just a slight high point on the ridge of the Squam Mountains, which are a sort of foothill range south of the White Mountains. Also, Doublehead in Jackson is surrounded by ski resorts, lodges, and numerous other White Mountain destinations. While the Squam Lake area is a resort destination itself, I don't think that the Doublehead in that area stands out the way the one in Jackson does. --<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Gallager_605e.html" title="User:Ken Gallager">Ken Gallager</a> 20:25, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted the section as I am new to wikipedia and still learning, so I apologize. I still propose the whole section to be removed because it doesn't belong in "korean food" or "korean cuisine" section. The topic of dog meat itself is controversial in Korea. I just came back from Korea and there were ads all over subway to fight eating of dog meat. You say that it is "widely available" and "some people eat dog meat", but what is the definition of "widely available" or "some people"... To me, widely available is McDonalds in US. So, unless you can prove that dog meat restaurants are as prevalent in Korea as McDonalds in US, "widely available" is your opinion and "some people" is meaningless. You may live in Korea and there maybe two dog meat restaurants in your block, who knows. But that doesn't justify the wording of "widely available" of dog meat in whole Korea. When discussing "Korean Food", you are discussing the culture and life of Koreans and putting dog eating as a section of "Korean Food" gives wrong notion that it is "widely available" and "widely accepted". I am Korean and huge huge dog lover and I'm ashamed that there are Koreans out there that eat dogs, just as I'm sure there are Chinese that are ashamed some of their own eat cats, and Canadiens that are ashamed that there are Canadiens that do barbaric act of killing baby seals for living. The proposal is because dog meat is controversial and is not a representation of Korean culture like the other foods listed. It's only purpose is to draw more controversy and if cat and dog eating isn't in Chinese food section, or other nation's controversial practices aren't listed as "widely available", why is dog consumption listed in Korean food which represents the pride of Korean culture. If i can't just remove it, let me know what i'm suppose to do. If you want to talk about the controversy of dog meat, there's section on wikipedia dedictated to dog meat. -Brandon --<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Santaria360 (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESantaria360_e5b5.html" title="User talk:Santaria360">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Santaria360_95cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Santaria360">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Badagnani, I didn't say that jajangmyeon with seafood doesn't exist in Korea.

<dd><i>Samsun jajangmyeon</i> or <i>ganjajangmyeon</i> would be the correct form to refer to either dishes, but Koreans usually omit <i>myeon</i> (meaning noodle) in typical usage.

<dd>To be precise, the unheated black bean paste is called <i>chunjang</i>, and the heated sauce with other ingredient is called <i>jajang</i>. Note that the chinese word for <i>jajang</i>, 炸醬 is composed of 炸(to roast) and 醬(sauce). You're right that even unheated <i>chunjang</i> is generally marketed as <i>jajang</i>, because <i>chunjang</i> is mostly used for making <i>jajang</i> anyway.</dd>

<dd>I agree with you on the other points. The PoV writing is common in musician articles (regardless of genre, national origin etc.) as the fans tend to write about the musicians (and I suppose detractors might be equally motivated). There's also the issue, in this case, of editors writing their own autobiographies. That said, I am unlikely (or less likely) to complain about lack of notability, if I feel a particular genre/culture is underrepresented on WP (though I admit this doesn't seem fair, upon re-reading). Think I'll go calm down for a while. -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 01:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been thinking about this for a while.

Perhaps what we should do is take the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_bean_paste.html" title="Red bean paste">red bean paste</a> article and generalize to something like <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_bean_paste.html" title="Sweet bean paste">sweet bean paste</a>? <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see that you have created the soybean paste page, do you think it's okay that we move it to <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermented_bean_paste.html" title="Fermented bean paste">Fermented bean paste</a>? I think the latter is a bit more descriptive, though I'm not sure if there are other non-soy feremented bean pastes or sweet unfermented soy bean pastes.<a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:26, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mung, black, navy, and azuki beans are the main kinds of beans made into sweet bean pastes. Lotus is not tech. a bean, but the method for lotus paste is relatively similar. Sesame is not really the same since it's just grinding sesame seeds. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:28, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suggest "fermented bean paste" since I'm sure there will be some culture out there that ferments some other kind of bean other than soy and makes it into a paste. Bean paste by itself seems a bit less descriptive since it can allude to both sweet and fermented bean pastes. I agree that the pastes be it from legumes, lotus, or sesame tastes very similar in baozi or tangyuan. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Both black turtle beans and navy beans are used for bean pastes. The former is very popular in South china cultures. The other are commonly seen in Japanese sweets and used as a filler for various kinds of non-orthodox mooncakes. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:42, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem with "black beans" is that it's a very non-descriptive term, and it solely alludes to the colour of the bean skin. In chinese markets, I've see black beans sold as, " big black beans", "small black beans", "american black beans", and "green heart black beans". Tell the truth, I'm not sure which one is used for either the tofu or the sweet paste.<a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 02:49, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>not sure what's going on, <a href="../../../m/i/j/Mijiu.html" title="Mijiu">mijiu</a> blanked by the creator after its creation. As for <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choujiu.html" title="Choujiu">choujiu</a> there does not seem to be much information about it. It seems to be a type of liquor popular in Xi'an and having a long history in China. Some sources say it's the "original" Chinese liquor. It definitly falls under "fermented wine" and does not appear to warrent a separate classification than baijiu and huangjiu. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 01:11, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Choujiu is a fermented wine and should be grouped with other fermented wines, which are all under "huangjiu". Maybe <i>Huangjiu</i> is not the best way to indicate all chinese fermented wines, perhaps a move is in order or, I dunno... Chinese fermented wines? As for rice frangrant, it definitely IS a distilled with and should be placed under baijiu. I'll join the conversation you had with <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsyrie_4e02.html" title="User:Ksyrie">User:Ksyrie</a> tomorrow. It seem kinda vague, but I'm not sure why he's arguing that choujiu and rice frangrant wines has enough differences in ingredients and processing techniques to be a different class altogether from fermented wines and distilled wines. Sub-classes maybe, but completely different classes?...no <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 06:02, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have no doubt that many kinds of chinese liquors that we mentioned in articles deserve their own article. But in this case I'm more concerned with where they go on the classification "tree".

<dd>I'd call that "cơm rượu" too. My mom makes them all the time, from yeast and either rice or sweet rice (I don't remember). In Vietnamese, normal uncooked (but processed) rice is "gạo" and uncooked sweet rice is "nếp". Cooked rice is "cơm" and cooked sweet rice is "xôi". I'd have to ask her next time I get the chance. Just remember that in Vietnamese the three dialects sometimes have the same name for different things and different names for the same things, so sometimes it's confusing to talk to people from a different region. <a href="../../../d/h/n/User%7EDHN_4cb4.html" title="User:DHN">DHN</a> 04:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Cơm rượu" is wine <b>rice</b> (cơm = rice, rượu = wine, the modifier follows the noun), "rượu nếp" is "sticky rice <b>wine</b>".

<dd>That page does provide some insight. It's a question-and-answer column about cooking. The first question indicates that "rượu nếp" is a Northern specialty and "cơm rượu" is a Southern specialty. The article mentions effort to make "cơm rượu" in the US, but using rice from other countries (Thailand, Malaysia, China). According to the article, all are made with sticky rice. If the grain used is sticky rice with a milky color and is rolled into balls, it's Southern-style "cơm rượu". If the grain is earthly brown and dried after boiling and not rolled into balls, then it's Norther-style "cơm rượu". The final type is a red-violet sticky rice. It is made into "rượu nếp". This type is usually used for the liquid (hence the name) instead of the solid. The rest of the article describes the different types of yeast used. <a href="../../../d/h/n/User%7EDHN_4cb4.html" title="User:DHN">DHN</a> 05:11, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
