<p>This is intended as a page to discuss how, if at all, we might be able to go ahead with at least some form of Appreciation Week in January. I have been informed that the note I sent out may have implied to some of you that I was in some way criticizing the deletion of Esperanza. I want to make it clear and unequivocal that such was not the case. I was simplying trying to imply that the existing method of achieving the proposal was very unlikely to work if it relied on the involvement of an entity currently being very likely for deletion. This page is being created as a hopefully more realistic way of trying to achieve the goal of somehow communicating to our some of our more valuble editors our appreciation for them. For any of you who may have had substantial contact with any agencies employing a lot of volunteers (like all of us here) it is standard procedure to use awards as a symbol of appreciation and as a relatively effective way of ensuring that people remain volunteers.<br />
Specifically, the original proposal was rather ill-defined, as this one still is, but was one in which we would basically have all the entities of wikipedia, including WikiProjects and other departments, recognize those editors who have contributed most to wikipedia, in whatever way. That is still, basically, what this proposal is. I had first contacted the various WikiProjects directly, as any such effort would almost by definition require their active support. If it is to be enacted, I would think that almost all the "work" involved would be by the projects themselves, with only a minor amount of MC duties being performed by anyone else, like on most of the televised awards shows. The basic existing proposal is to perhaps gets some of the WikiProjects and other groups of wikipedia to use either the day of January 15, 2007, or the week beginning on that day to specifically remember those contributors which those groups individually deem to be deserving. If there is sufficient interest, which I hope there is, then we may even be able to get some sort of official awards ceremony off the ground, probably either on the 15th or sometime during the following week. Exactly what might happen is pretty much dependent upon the amount and nature of the response to the proposal, and, potentially, what might be permitted by wikipedia as a whole. I'm really sorry that I can't be much more specific, but the details are going to be more than a little contingent upon the amount and type of response to the basic idea itself. Also, as indicated below, if they were to choose to do so, the projects which involve themselves could use the significance of the day to wikipedia as a springboard to try to cause an increase in the amount of project-related activity by their members, possibly even completely clearing their old to-do list.<br />
Lastly, as in most of the televised awards, I think that it might be appropriate to choose some sort of "Person of the Year" award. This award would be given to that individual (or individuals, that can be determined later), who have most significantly contributed to wikipedia and who can thus be seen, as it were, as some sort of "role models". If anyone is interested in such a separate proposal, I have listed a few candidates (though far from all potential candidates) at <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_Appreciation_Week_WikiHalo_c4dc.html" title="User:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week/WikiHalo">User:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week/WikiHalo</a>. Yes, this is more than a little manipulative, in a way, but it is also almost standard procedure in cases like these, generally well received by those individuals involved, and tends to work fairly well despite the transparent manipulation involved. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 20:52, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand the objection above, as a citizen of St. Louis, Missouri. However, please note that as indicated on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_Day_df16.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Day">Wikipedia:Wikipedia Day</a>, that is also the date that Wikipedia started "flying solo" and it is on that basis also within wikipedia commemorated as Wikipedia Day, which is wikipedia's pretty much only so-called "holiday". Also, unfortunately, I think we would probably find pretty much the same objections from either the US or some other country for pretty much any day chosen which might have less importance to wikipedia. Also, <b>if</b> (so I'm not real sure about this myself) there is enough interest to actually pull this off with any degree of support, it might only be the "signal" date to start the occasion, with most of the real activity happening later. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:47, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, it's Maximilli from the Paintball WikiProject. Just wanted to let you know that I think it's a fantastic idea.

<dd>I'm happy to give it a go - I would guess it would consist of acknowledging the editors that aren't often acknowledged, i.e. people doing small but vital copyediting/typo fixing/image uploading/formatting, and those that do help out but just arent noticed.

<p>Random thought as to method; if we want to focus on individuals, wikiprojects are a good place to start... how about we try and figure out a nomination system where wikiprojects can vote on who they think was their MVE, and sort of pool them? <font color="#FF9900"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>David Fuchs</b></a></font> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>) 22:14, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't really understand what all this is about - and I'm even more puzzled after seeing the entire Esperanza project up for deletion (is the purpose of the project up for deletion too?) - but I'm game.

<dd>Perhaps I was wrong to assume this was part of all the rest.

<dd>Generally, receiving an award tends to reinforce activity, particularly for people who are basically volunteers at a non-profit organization. By definition, <b>all</b> of our editors are volunteers at a non-profit organization. I've got to leave for the day now, but I'm going to send the rest of the notices to the projects and other entities out tomorrow. Maybe, if we're lucky, this thing will help to revive some activity in lots of projects. Actually, that's basically one of it's primary goals. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 23:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that I think most of the members of my project aren't even checking into Wikipedia any more, so they might not even find out about Appreciation Week. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 00:59, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sounds like a great idea. Please let me know how I can help. Is there a way to determine a WikiProject's effectiveness or activity? Maybe the award could go to the WikiProject participants as a group instead of an individual editor. I think that this would help unify the project participants and build the team. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostoak_b214.html" title="User:Postoak">Postoak</a> 23:48, 29 December 2006 (UTC), <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Houston_5f1a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Houston">WikiProject Houston</a></p>

<dd>I like that idea. Energizing an entire team is what we want. With WPLou, there have just been a few major contributors, but recognizing one of them won't do much to pull others in. And we need many more major contributors with us pushing near 1,000 articles in our project. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 23:55, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for letting us know. This is an interesting concept, I'd like to see how this ends up. I assume that awards are necessarily limited to members of WikiProjects, but especially non-members as well. There are many non-members that I see that contribute significantly to articles within our scope, and I would like to thank them.

<p>Sounds wonderful! This year, the two projects I'm in and speaking for have had events that either have never happened before in the Project's history or only happen every three to five years, and we've been working under much different circumstances in both projects. I think the editors that put their time and effort into making Wikipedia as good as it is need to be recognized. «<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETrackerTV_a31e.html" title="User:TrackerTV">TTV</a>»<small>(<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETrackerTV_093b.html" title="User talk:TrackerTV">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TrackerTV_72aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/TrackerTV">contribs</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_TrackerTV_1509.html" title="Special:Emailuser/TrackerTV">email</a>)</small> 00:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)/<a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">WP:PCP</a> and <a href="../../../t/v/s/WP%7ETVS_4679.html" title="WP:TVS">WP:TVS</a></p>

<li>Each Wikiproject member will attempt to make as much edits as possible to articles within the Project's scope</li>
<li>Each Wikiproject will try to clear its to-do list</li>
<li>Each Wikiproject will pick an article within its scope and form a collaboration to improve it to GA/FA status--<i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup><small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Ed_8b99.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Ed">Reviews?</a></small> 00:23, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok, I'm making a header (gasp) because following the thread of conversation was getting confusing. One thing several people have said is that their Wikiprojs. are too small, too new, unmotivated, et al... if we were to do something, it would have to address those issues. That said, this could be a good way of getting exposure to wikiprojects.

<dd>Thanks for the help with creating the new section. Also, I want everyone to know that honestly even if it is just a new WikiProject, if you believe that there has been a person who has made significant contributions anyway, they should be more than eligible for recognition. If this does work this year, we might even be able to set it up annually. Certainly, I hope so. And, in direct response to David Fuchs' good point above, I really don't see that there would be a need for a council or anything like that for this to work. This is I hope going to be basically a place where all the individual projects can get together to maybe give out some recognition in the eyes of the larger wikipedia community. The one possible proviso would be for the Person of the Year, on the accompanying page, which could, if all else fails, be done like the recent ArbCom elections, with regular voting and maybe a final selection from among the top candidates given by our founder if required. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Will the header appear at the top of the Wikipedia site for a period of time, like the week of January 15? If so, that sounds good.

<dd>Also, an alternate possibility. Maybe we could arrange something like a huge [:[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Core topics/Core topics COTF|Core topics collaboration]] effort in which we try to get the editors collectively working on some of the core topics and trying to bring them up to some higher standard? Many/most of the projects deal to some degree with at least one or more core topics, and they could probably all use at least some degree of work. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 13:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recommend against anything having to do with magic.

<dd>Actually, that might work, with one possible problem. I think that for some projects, like maybe <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMICS_dd76.html" title="WP:COMICS">WikiProject Comics</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html" title="WP:MILHIST">WikiProject Military history</a> the "most active" person would possibly be the person already most recognized by the project, maybe in these cases <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">User:Steve block</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">User:Kirill Lokshin</a>. Maybe if we added qualifiers for those who aren't project coordinators/directors/whatever. Not that I don't think either of the gentlemen above don't deserve recognition, but I don't think we necessarily want to see them win their projects' awards each and every year. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I just want to advise caution. Someone tried an elected award a long time ago, but that created a stir, see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EWikihalo_3a67.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Wikihalo">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Wikihalo</a>.

This could be viewed badly. Let's remember that we shouldn't really be here for the awards, and maybe a better way of celebrating Wikipedia Day would be for each project to get one of their articles up to featured status. Anyway, just my quick thoughts. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:38, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Certainly, the idea of an individual "person of the year" award is the less important aspect of the proposal.

<dd>I'm still not entirely sure of your meaning. I guess my response would be that right now, I think the "Person of the Year" award is probably, at least this year, a dead issue. What I'm hoping will happen is that the various WikiProjects will themselves try to ensure that all the individuals that they think deserve such recognition receive it. As the awards are, as I see it developing, based more on the WikiProject-level than the wikipedia-level, mentioning specific individuals you think worthy of recognition to the various relevant WikiProjects would probably be the best way to go. But I don't think that there will be any sort of formal or even informal nomination process. I hope that answers your question. If it doesn't, please feel free to contact me directly. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 18:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Here's a new idea I just dreamed up today: How about we take out a day or more for everyone in the Wikipedia to concentrate on assessing the unassessed articles? Check out <a href="../../../u/n/a/Category%7EUnassessed-Class_articles_dfb8.html" title="Category:Unassessed-Class articles">Category:Unassessed-Class articles</a> to see the list of lists of the unassessed. If we want to achieve the "encyclopedia on a CD", this push would move us quite a bit closer to that goal. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 19:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The village pump or community portal might be the best place to propose that idea right now, as comparatively few projects have responded to date.

<p>A simple way to put this into action is if everyone who thinks this is a good idea identify one other Wikipedian who (a) you believe has been doing good work &amp; (b) you have not had significant previous interaction with, &amp; send them a note of appreciation. Either on their Talk page or in email. It would not only build some positive feelings here, but also prevent some important contributors from slipping into burn-out. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 20:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to comment on the proposals here. Myself and two others probably do most of the day to day admin on the wikiproject and portal. However, by far the best contributors to quality architecture articles aren't even members of the project, <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">User:Ghirlandajo</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">User:Wetman</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">User:Giano</a> to name but 3. Other that I'm aware of are chipping away at some mind blowing tasks like categorising all the buildings on wikipedia by year of construction. I can't speak for others but it seems unseemly to me to have members of the project recognised, but significant contributors in the field omitted, everyone plays their parts and I'm not sure I like the beauty pageantry.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one necessarily disagrees with you, unnamed one. There are certain awards, like the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Wikipedia%7EService_awards_d36e.html" title="Wikipedia:Service awards">Wikipedia:Service awards</a>, which can be given out to all editors. Actually, personally, I would even encourage projects to ensure that all their members at least be aware of such awards, probably by giving them out and letting them know that they are free to remove them at their own discretion. Again, if you read the most recent revision of the opening comments, the primary purpose of this proposal is to ensure that our volunteer editors receive some sort of recognition or award from their peers, to encourage them to remain editors. However such could be accomplished is basically at the discretion of the individual projects, however. Some may choose to give higher honors to certain editors, on the hope that they remain active at something near their current level. Others may choose to act differently. That is, of course, entirely their own decision. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:24, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The best current proposal I can think of would be as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Leaders of the various interested projects (however they are determined; if you responded to this page and there are no formally recognized leaders of your project, you may count yourself one; I dunno) might give out some recognition to the various members of their projects. These might include the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Wikipedia%7EService_awards_d36e.html" title="Wikipedia:Service awards">Wikipedia:Service awards</a>, with maybe a bit more individualized comment with the awards, and, maybe, some other barnstars or other awards for specific members or others who have contributed greatly to that project's articles. Even the newest projects could distribute the Service awards, as those awards are given for contributions to wikipedia, not necessarily the projects themselves.<br />
(2) The various interested projects might also spend the week in some sort of unified activity which would hopefully involve all the project's members in some way. This may be such a thing as a project collaboration on one or more chosen articles (depending on the size and scope of the project or subproject), or perhaps in some as yet unfinished directly-project related activity (finding and adding banners to articles which haven't yet received them, for example). Again, exactly what would be done would be at the discretion of the various projects. Certainly, if the service awards are distributed early during the week, the members could also be advised of the project's self-designated task for the week as well.<br />
(3) Given the alliteration, existence of the new radio show, and anticipated time of activity, I would think "Wikipedia Week" might be the best name.<br />
Any responses would be more than welcome. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great idea! Although I think this also might be a good week to revive <i>near-inactive</i> WikiProjects. An example is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_Nations_53a5.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United Nations">Wikipedia:WikiProject United Nations</a>, a Project in which not much discussion/collaboration has taken place.--<i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup><small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Ed_8b99.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Ed">Reviews?</a></small> 15:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Any person could join any nearly inactive project (if they aren't already members) and distribute the service awards to the former members on the basis of their membership. The one caveat I would add is that it is possible that some nearly inactive projects may not have been such a wonderful idea in the first place (although not the one you mentioned above) and might function better as work groups/task forces of a larger project. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I also had another idea regarding recognizing former members. Lots of Wikipedians have gone in the past, so I suggest that all users go through all of their talk page archives and contact every user that made contact with them. That way, inactive users will know that we still remember them no matter what. =) --<i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup><small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Ed_8b99.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Ed">Reviews?</a></small> 16:24, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a member of 7 WikiProjects, so it's hard to deal with that many members. The WikiProjects that I'm involved in are limited topics that don't work well with collaborations. Nearly all articles are too small in scope to be possible featured article material (except for some of the NASCAR articles). I've created my own personal award that I will give out to the contributors that stand out as having best furthered the cause from my point of view. They are the biggest and/or best contributors over the past year in those areas, and they deserve a pat on the back for it. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 17:36, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This plan seems pretty good to me too. The one issue that I fear <i>might</i> be an issue of contention is, what if some people start arguing about the leadership over a project? I'm not speaking about my own situation; WikiProject Paintball has an undisputed leadership of lead coordinator and assistant coordinator, so it's pretty obvious.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For illustration, imagine a project that's been completely inactive for a while and suddenly gets a bunch of members, several of whom maintaining the opinion that <i>they</i> should be the 'leader'. I dunno, maybe this isn't such a big issue as I thought at first, but I'm just trying to help.&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximilli_cbe5.html" title="User:Maximilli"><font color="#669900">Ma</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/x/User_talk%7EMaximilli_3a3b.html" title="User talk:Maximilli"><font color="#CC9900"><b>x</b></font></a><a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximilli_cbe5.html" title="User:Maximilli"><font color="#669900">i</font></a><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Paintball_190f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Paintball"><font color="#CC9900">m</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximilli_cbe5.html" title="User:Maximilli"><font color="#669900">illi</font></a>, 06:12, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just looking at the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Wikipedia%7EService_awards_d36e.html" title="Wikipedia:Service awards">Wikipedia:Service awards</a> it occurred to me that perhaps the best way to go about this is to create project related awards what aren't centralized and can be given out my the projects them self .These would cover thinks like</p>

Given the timeframe we're talking about, that might be more feasible next year. And, any project could focus their attention however they wanted. Maybe just trying to create and bring the Carmogie Association of Ireland article up to B or GA standard for your group might be enough of a focus for a week. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:29, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's one week to go, and it looks like the drive to implement this idea has slowed to a snail's pace. There does not (yet) seem to even be clear ideas on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of the project/movement/whatever the thing should be called - there should be banners to use on WikiProject pages (and maybe on the Portals, too).</li>
<li>Publicity - What happened to the suggestion of marketing this in the Signpost? It should have been placed there early to attract people and again next week for the announcements.</li>
<li>Announcements - Speaking of announcements, how will it be announced? On a talk-page by talk-page basis, with people randomly running around handing out thank yous to people they know, or is there going to be a larger, more publicized presentation or something?</li>
<li>Small WikiProjects - I've seen several questions, and have one myself, about WikiProjects where there are only one or two people driving the Project. In <a href="../../../m/i/x/WP%7EMIX_415d.html" title="WP:MIX">WikiProject Cocktails</a>, I am pretty much the only participant openly working on articles under the auspices of the Project. There are some wonderful people who help with watching and cleaning articles, but they choose not to associate with the Project. I'm not sure how they would take to receiving a award from a project they choose not to join (not that it will stop me from giving them one). Maybe it will encourage them to join (hopefully), but it might also upset them. Also, anything I do to promote this could be viewed as me begging to receive an award myself. I'm definitely too modest to do something like that, which also makes me uncomfortable to promote this project. I bet others in similar situations feel the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, I think it's the start of a great idea, but I do not think it is ready for show time yet. Take the initiative that you have developed, formally organize as a WikiProject or other appropriate structure, avoid becoming too bureaucratic -- keep it simple and fun -- and develop some clear goals for next year at this time. Build support within Wikipedia. Even better, build inter-Wiki support, and expand this thing to be a Wiki-wide collaboration and promotion. It could bring some good publicity to the Foundation and help raise some money, too. Focus on the suggestions that improve Wikis as a whole. Highlighting a person is fine, but only if the recognition is for the person's improvement of Wikipedia or its sister projects. Avoid giving it to Foundation members, and probably even Trustees (that could be seen by the media as self-serving). Set clear criteria for what makes a good nominee, focusing it on service to the Wikis, and how that benefits the entire humankind collective knowledge. Think of things that will create a stir and a buzz in the mass media so that we can focus positive media attention on the Wikis and their efforts. Bring in collaboration with other projects. If there is a WikiHalo award, maybe they would be interested in presenting that at our event, or we might consider joining them in theirs. Don't reinvent things that are already in place, and don't assume that the ideas presented here are better than ones that other people have. (I'm not saying anyone is currently doing this, but as people organize, they tend to become territorial and reject input from outsiders. Avoid that temptation.)</p>

<dd>It is in the Signpost now, actually. It looks the like the proposal for honoring a "Person of the Year" is probably at least off for this year, as there isn't enough lead time to do such a proposal justice. As for organizing it as a WikiProject, I think that might not be the best idea, as it is intended only as an annual event. If there were some appropriate group to add it to, that would be fine.
