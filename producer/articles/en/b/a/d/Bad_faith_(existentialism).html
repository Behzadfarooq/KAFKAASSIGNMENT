<p><b>Bad faith</b> (from French, <i>mauvaise foi</i>) is a <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophical</a> concept first coined by <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existentialist.html" title="Existentialist">existentialist</a> philosopher <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Sartre_c20d.html" title="Jean-Paul Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> to describe the phenomenon wherein one denies one's total freedom, instead choosing to behave as an inert object. It is closely related to the concept of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-deception.html" title="Self-deception">self-deception</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Nietzsche_159c.html" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>'s concept of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Ressentiment.html" title="Ressentiment">ressentiment</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_faith_%28existentialism%29.html" title="Edit section: Bad faith">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bad faith</span></h2>
<p>A critical claim in <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existentialism.html" title="Existentialism">existentialist</a> thought is that we are always radically free to make choices and guide our lives towards our own chosen goal (or 'project'). We cannot escape this freedom, even in overwhelming circumstances. For instance, even an armed mugger's victim possesses choices: to hand over his wallet; to negotiate; to beg; to run; to counter-attack; or to die.</p>
<p>Although we are limited by our circumstances (our <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facticity.html" title="Facticity">facticity</a>), these cannot force us, as radically free beings, to follow one course over another. For this reason, we choose in <i>anguish</i>: we know that we must make a choice, that it will have consequences, and that some choices are better than others. But for Sartre, to claim that one amongst our many conscious possibilities takes undeniable precedence (for instance, 'I cannot risk my life, because I must support my family') is to assume the role of an object in the world, merely at the mercy of circumstance - a <i><a href="../../../b/e/i/Being.html" title="Being">being-in-itself</a></i> that is only its own facticity.</p>
<p><a name="Intentional_Consciousness_and_Freedom" id="Intentional_Consciousness_and_Freedom"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_faith_%28existentialism%29.html" title="Edit section: Intentional Consciousness and Freedom">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Intentional Consciousness and Freedom</span></h2>
<p>For Sartre this attitude is manifestly self-deceiving. As human consciousness, we are always aware that we are not whatever we are aware of - we cannot, in this sense, be defined as our 'intentional objects' of consciousness, including our facticity of personal history, character, bodies, or objective responsibility. Thus, as Sartre often repeated, 'human reality is what it is not, and it is not what it is': it can only define itself negatively, as 'what it is not'; but this negation is simultaneously the only positive definition it can make of 'what it is'.</p>
<p>From this we are aware of a host of alternative reactions to our objective situation - i.e., of freedom - since no situation can dictate a single response. Only in assuming social roles and value systems external to this nature as conscious beings can we pretend that these possibilities are denied to us; but this is itself a decision made possible by our freedom and our separation from these things. It is this paradoxical free decision to deny to ourselves this inescapable freedom which is 'bad faith'.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_faith_%28existentialism%29.html" title="Edit section: Sartre's Examples">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sartre's Examples</span></h2>
<p>Sartre cites a café waiter, whose movements and conversation are a little too "waiter-esque". His voice oozes with an eagerness to please; he carries food rigidly and ostentatiously. His exaggerated behaviour illustrates that he is play acting as a waiter, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence is to be a waiter. But that he is obviously acting belies that he is aware that he is not (merely) a waiter, but is rather consciously deceiving himself. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another of Sartre’s examples involves a young woman on a first date. She ignores the obvious sexual implications of her date's compliments to her physical appearance, but accepts them instead as words directed at her as a human consciousness. As he takes her hand, she lets it rest lifelessly in his, refusing either to return the gesture or to revoke it. Thus she delays the moment when she must choose to either acknowledge and reject his advances, or submit to them. She conveniently considers her hand only a thing in the world, but his compliments as unrelated to her body; thus playing on her dual human reality as a physical beings, and as consciousness separate and free from this physicality. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sartre tells us that by acting in bad faith, the waiter and the woman are denying their own freedom; but by actively using this freedom itself. Thus they manifestly know they are free, but do not acknowledge it. Bad faith is paradoxical in this regard: when acting in bad faith, a person is both aware, and, in a sense, unaware, that they are free.</p>
<p><a name="Two_Modes_of_Consciousness" id="Two_Modes_of_Consciousness"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_faith_%28existentialism%29.html" title="Edit section: Two Modes of Consciousness">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Two Modes of Consciousness</span></h2>
<p>Sartre tells us that the consciousness with which we generally consider our objective surroundings is different from the consciousness of ourselves being conscious of these surroundings (<i>pre-reflective</i> and <i>reflective</i> consciousness respectively); though neither can properly be called unconsciousness. An example he gives is of running after a bus; one is certainly not unaware of running after it, but only after stopping would one reflect and think '<i>sacre bleu</i>, I was really running there'.</p>
<p>In this sense consciousness always entails being self-aware (<i><a href="../../../b/e/i/Being.html" title="Being">being-for-itself</a></i>). Since for Sartre consciousness also entails a consciousness of our separation from the world, and hence freedom, we are also always aware of this. But we can manipulate these two levels of consciousness, so that our reflective consciousness interprets the factual limits of our objective situation as insurmountable, whilst our pre-reflective consciousness remains aware of alternatives.</p>
<p><a name="Freedom_and_Morality" id="Freedom_and_Morality"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_faith_%28existentialism%29.html" title="Edit section: Freedom and Morality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Freedom and Morality</span></h2>
<p>One convinces oneself, in some senses, that one is bound to act by external circumstance, in order to escape the anguish of our freedom. Sartre says man is condemned to be free: whether he adopts an 'objective' moral system to do this choosing for him, or follows only his pragmatic concerns, he cannot help but be aware that they are not - fundamentally - part of him. Moreover, as possible intentional objects of one's consciousness, one is fundamentally <b>not</b> part of oneself, but rather exactly what one, as consciousness, defines oneself in opposition to; along with everything else one could be conscious of.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Sartre believes one cannot escape responsibility by adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of a moral system is in itself a choice that we endorse, implicitly or explicitly, and which one must take full responsibility for. Sartre argues that, one cannot escape responsibility, as each time one attempts to part oneself from one's freedom of choice, the very act in itself is a choice exercised freely.</p>
<p>As a human, one cannot claim our actions are determined by forces exterior to the self; this is the core statement of <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existentialism.html" title="Existentialism">existentialism</a>. One is 'doomed' to this eternal freedom; human beings exist before the definition of human identity exists. One can not define oneself as a thing in the world, as one has the freedom to be otherwise. One is not “a philosopher”, as at some point one must/will cease the activities that define the self as "a philosopher". Any role that one might adopt does not define one as there is an eventual end to one's adoption of the role; i.e. other roles will be assigned to us, "a chef", "a mother". The self is not constant, it cannot be a thing in the world. Though one cannot assign a positive value to definitions that may apply to oneself, one remains able to say what one is not. For example, an adult human male may not be a man, but he is certainly not a woman. Therefore, one is defined by what one is not.</p>
<p>This inner anguish over moral uncertainty is a central underlying theme in existentialism, as the anguish demonstrates a personal feeling of responsibility over the choices one makes throughout life. Without an emphasis on personal choice, one may make use of an external moral system as a tool to moralize otherwise immoral acts, leading to negation of the self. According to existentialism, dedicated professionals of their respective moral codes - priests interpreting sacred scriptures, lawyers interpreting the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">Constitution</a>, doctors interpreting the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippocratic_oath.html" title="Hippocratic oath">Hippocratic oath</a> - should, instead of divesting the self of responsibility in the discharge of ones duties, be aware of ones own significance in the process. This recognition involves the questioning of the morality of all choices, taking responsibility for the consequences of one's own choice and therefore; a constant reappraisal of one's own and other's ever-changing humanity. One must not exercise bad faith by denying the self's freedom of choice and accountability. Taking on the burden of personal accountability in all situations is an intimidating proposition - by pointing out the freedom of the individual Sartre seeks to demonstrate the social roles and moral systems we adopt to protect us from being morally accountable for our actions.</p>
<p><a name="A_Freudian_framework" id="A_Freudian_framework"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_faith_%28existentialism%29.html" title="Edit section: A Freudian framework">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A Freudian framework</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freud.html" title="Freud">Freudian psychoanalysis</a> poses a potential solution to the paradoxical self deception that occurs in bad faith. In a Freudian framework, the brain is split into three parts: the <a href="../../../i/d/_/Id.html" title="Id">Id</a> (the <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconscious_mind.html" title="Unconscious mind">unconscious</a>), the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superego.html" title="Superego">Superego</a> (polices the Id), and the <a href="../../../e/g/o/Ego.html" title="Ego">Ego</a> (reflective upper level consciousness). The split between conscious and subconscious allows for a person to consciously believe one thing, and unconsciously believe another. Thus, according to Freud, self deception is possible.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the case of the waiter, it is possible that his unconscious recognizes his freedom and expresses desires to engage it. Perhaps he unconsciously wishes to spit in his patron’s food. Under this framework, his unconscious desires are repressed by the Superego. He then consciously rejects his freedom and assumes the role of "a waiter".</p>
<p>The Superego acts as a policeman and facilitator between both the Id and the Ego. A self-deception occurs when the Superego knowingly transmits false information to the Ego. The ego, our conscious faculties, fully believes what is transmitted to it by the Superego. The self deception is possible because there exist two separate "belief systems" which are divided. It is with the Superego that Sartre lodges his chief complaint. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> He tells us that if the Superego is to perform its duties, it must possess knowledge about the information it is restraining from the Ego. Without knowing what it is restraining, the Superego would not be a policeman, but rather a sieve, arbitrarily restricting the Id’s drives. Sartre also tells us that the Superego must know that it is making choices concerning what information to facilitate. It must be aware of itself and what it is doing. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sartre then makes two important moves that deserve fleshing out with some precision: (1) He believes that by "knowing" and "choosing", an entity must also possess the capability to "know itself" and know that it is facilitating false information. He tells us that in order to make the jump from sieve to facilitator, such upper level knowledge is necessary.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> (2) Sartre rejects the Freudian framework as a response to the paradox of self deception, because the upper level consciousness that knows it is facilitating false information is the same upper level consciousness present in the Ego, which accepts that information as true.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Therefore, both the acceptance and the rejection that occurs during bad faith are in the same mental scope, and it is still paradoxical.</p>
