<h2><span class="mw-headline">DRV on Axe Murder Boyz</span></h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That's an interesting reading. I took King of Hearts' comment to mean that something new had to come forward in order for his opinion to change. I'm aware that you believe notability was unconditionally asserted in the first place; however, KoH (the deleter) clearly disagreed. Although you did comment beneath him reiterating your view, he did not concede the point. Thus, I read his comment as "keep deleted" (in favor of a rewrite, maybe?) If I have misread, simply have KoH contact me, and I will reverse the closure. Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think you've misread it as much as I don't think he's reading what constitutes nobility for an A7 properly. I'm more surprised that you took it that way than him, honestly. If someone says "assert nobility," and nobility is asserted, how is it supposed to be taken? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:12, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I understand my role as a closer, I have a duty to abide by the intent of the commenter; it is not my job to super-impose my judgment (or yours) over someone else's words. I care about what KoH's meant, not about whether or not he's "right." I believe in consensus, so, by default, the consensus is always right.
<dl>
<dd>So in events that there isn't a consensus? In events that KoH only wants the article restored if notability is asserted, then there shouldn't be much interpretation here - notability is asserted, thus the article would be restored in his mind. Perhaps he doesn't agree with the assertion, but that's not for him to decide by rule.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, I've heard your view that DRV is broken somehow. Obviously, I disagree. DRV is, remember, only a forum for deciding if discussion should begin again. Parliamentarily, DRV functions as forum only for deciding cloture. This is why majoritarianism is a fine form of consensus in DRV only. If a majority wants to discuss, then discussion opens; if the majority is finished speaking, the matter is closed. The alternative, to require a 70% consensus to reopen discussion, is more draconian. Note that matters <i>always</i> come to Deletion Review only after discussion has closed (unless somebody makes a huge mistake in procedure.) Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:22, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think, and with all due respect to you, as you're only doing your job, this is an <i>excellent</i> example of how broken DRV truly is. The fact that we can overturn based CSD policy on a majority vote for one article based on the actions of one administrator is really rather shocking to me. The alternative on DRV is not 70% on anything, but rather a simple view of the arguments as to whether the deletion processes were followed properly. In an actual discussion on this DRV, as an example, we have at least two editors showing that the process was not followed, and no one having any good argument about it. That's how it was broken here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The thing is, we trust admins. The alternative to majoritarianism at DRV is requiring a 70% consensus to overturn admin discretion. There is no other reasonable way -- requiring 70% consensus to ratify each speedy is truly "process-hell" as newbies and garage band members would flood things endlessly.</dd>
<dd>I understand that you're frustrated that your view (seen by you as objectively correct) is often outnumbered, but appeal to a larger group is the mechanism available for a check on admin power - if "bad" admins are routinely ratified in making "bad" decisions (hypothetically... I don't think that has happened here, but you do), then the problem -- it seems to me -- is RfA, where we make admins, and the lack of De-RfA, where we could fire them. My thoughts on this matter are not surprising, as I have long felt RfA standards are generally a tad low. Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:40, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, my frustration stems only from the point that we have a venue that's specifically for process-related decisions, and even when the process is so obviously ignored, we still let it slide. There's nothing correct about that, and it shows that our appeals process in these matters, the things designed to protect from admins overstepping their bounds (which, whether we trust them or not, happens) simply don't work. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:46, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There will never be an appeals process which divorces the human element from its choices. It is true that, by the strictest possible reading of CSD A7, one could see an assertion of notability; however, there is no requirement that A7 be read this strictly. It is, in my view, impossible to write anything which by its nature is limited only to one interpretation. Any forum applies the given text to a given instance by interpreting, and that application will not always be the strictest. I cannot imagine any way to change that. Short of repealling A7 (a practical impossibility, I think), I still think your best shot is get more thoughtful admins, who don't delete so quickly.</dd>
<dd>As an aside, so there is no confusion, I admire what you (and other committed "inclusionists") do. I believe in balance, and I know this place would be very paltry if some editors weren't dedicated to defending articles that most feel are unimportant or marginal. I'm only making my suggestion because, objectively from my POV, it seems a good way for you to focus your efforts.

<p>You, like so many other Wikipedians, seem to have felt that Drini's actions in the CVU deletion proccess were wholly inappropriate and did not follow policy.

<p>I was wondering if you've had a chance to take a gander at the above essay. You have reversed a few actions claiming it didn't fit a speedy criteria. When the vast majority of editors vote to keep or speedy keep, the discussion may get closed early to let the article get back to its normal evolutionary process. Is there any particular reason you felt <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_A_Poet%27s_Life_780e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/A Poet's Life">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/A Poet's Life</a> might end up in a delete consensus?

<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure if it will or not. I can't predict the future, and since an early close was already contested once, it seems completely inappropriate to do it again. As for the essay, it's one of the worst parts of Wikipedia, and I discourage its use and citation whenever possible. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:33, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's also quite obviously wrong to invoke SNOW in the face of diverging opinions on an issue. <i>"In dubious or contentious cases it is best to settle it through the full process."</i> SNOW is not a tool to suppress the minority's right to voice their opinion on an issue within the allotted time frame, not to mention that early keeps can still turn into no consensus, which create quite a different precedent for later nominations. On the other hand Jeff should've sent this to DRV rather than just revert the closure. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:18, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In this specific case, an early closure had already been to DRV once. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:31, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know, it's one of those cases that cause eye socket inflammation from too much eyerolling, but reverting an AFD closure will never stick. There's enough people around to protect the process itself, no matter how flawed the decision itself.

<dd>I'm saying that we have processes in place to change inappropriate rules. I can't think of any that are grossly inappropirate to the point of significant opposition, of course, but we have ways of working with our established way of doing things whereas we don't need to ignore rules.

<dd>Yes. Exactly. IAR is in place so that editors can do what they want because they think it's right.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"keep for the hell of it"??</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed that you spend a lot of commenting on Articles for Deletion, and that you invariably vote "keep" on every single one of them. Is there anything you've ever voted "delete" on? Your edit summary on your keep vote for How to Write Haiku was especially disturbing: "k for the hell of it". It's one thing to be an inclusionist, but that doesn't mean you're supposed to ignore policies and guidelines and say "let's keep it for the hell of it", especially <i>after</i> many other editors have already pointed out it's a direct violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and a copyvio, to boot. Furthermore, the speed at which you are voting (you voted "keep" on <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katatonia_Primordial_Split_10__e311.html" title="Katatonia/Primordial Split 10&quot;">Katatonia/Primordial Split 10"</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/y/Waynehead.html" title="Waynehead">Waynehead</a> <b>within seconds of each other</b>, for example), indicates that you don't even seem to be actually looking at the articles you're voting keep on. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:21, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Did you notice what the keep vote on Haiku was for? I wrote a keep Haiku for the hell of it because there wasn't one and there's no chance it's going to be kept. It was a joke, sheesh. As for the "speed" of the Katatonia and Waynehead ones, dunno. They were quick? I know both articles deserve to be kept - one's a record by two notable bands (and I did look it up first), one's a notable TV show. Not too much question there. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:25, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment on the above exchange</b> I know this dialogue is a couple of weeks old but the topic is not stale. I got here because the block on badlydrawnjeff was used on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EBlocking_policy_db44.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Blocking policy">Wikipedia talk:Blocking policy</a> as an example of a "cool down block" that the contributor was expressing concern about.</p>
<p>I have been tracking at least one or two discussions that badlydrawnjeff has expressed opinions on (this whole Carnildo/Giano/ArbCom/b'crats thing). While I do agree with some of the things that badlydrawnjeff has said, I also think that the rhetoric has gotten a bit too sharp at times. Unfortunately, the use of a "cool down" block can be problematic if a single editor is blocked from making any edits in Wikipedia for a period of time. It would be nice if blocks could be applied to a specific article or, at least, a namespace.</p>
<p>Moreover, it takes "two to tango". I would think that there are many times when more than one editor in the discussion should be blocked. Also, there is a difference between "cool down" and "shut up". "Cool down" should mean just that, as in "tone down the rhetoric". It shouldn't mean "shut up", as in "stop posting on this topic". This could be done by notes on the Talk Page rather than via blocks.</p>
<p>Now, as for the above exchange, I'm sorry that that the dialogue turned out the way it did. I think RyanFreisling had a valid point that badlydrawnjeff didn't want to hear and RyanFreisling kept pushing the point so badlydrawnjeff got a bit truculent about being pushed.</p>
<p>In summary, to badlydrawnjeff, tone down the rhetoric but please do not "shut up". The points you have made are worthwhile and I'm glad that you are making them.</p>

<p>Looking at how Wikipedia evolved, it seems pretty clear to me why the culture is the way it is. A huge part of that culture is "Wikipedia does not have firm rules". We don't need to interpret the exact wording of some policy page to know what to do- we do what we think is best for the project. I really, really think you'd do more good for the project if you raised objections only in cases where you think we arrived at the wrong outcome, and worried less about whether we followed the exact process- the essential conundrum of policy is that what's written down isn't the <i>real</i> policy. Sometimes it's close, sometimes not. Policy, in many cases, is whatever you can do without causing a ruckus. Remember that all of Wikipedia, <i>including all policy and guideline pages</i>, is a work in progress. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:58, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interestingly enough, I was blocked today for doing exactly what you suggest I do. Regardless, I'm aware of how we evolved, and I'm no spring chicken here, either - most major "policy-by-fiat" has caused a <i>lot</i> more grief than the times where people have actually gone and tried to reach a consensus. I have no qualms with my contributions, both in article space and in terms of policy. It's just going to take a lot more people who stop being afraid to reverse wrong decisions, whether it's for the sake of process or for the sake of the encyclopedia (which are ultimately one and the same). --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I hear ya. For what it's worth, I didn't think the block today was justified. Of course, one man's "beating a dead horse" is another man's "arguing for what he thinks is best". I don't know if you've already done something like this, but you may find it useful to make a user subpage outlining your wiki philosophy. For those who care to take the time to read it, it may make your position more clear. To me, common sense and consensus build an encyclopedia more effectively than trying to exactly follow a rigid process. Maybe what I really meant above was, when you disagree, always focus your comments on why you think the outcome was bad for the project, rather than why you think it was against policy. The real policies exist in the minds of editors, not on some wiki page somewhere. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:16, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, the Guardian one has been dismissed as not actually about ED, or something. No, it doesn't make sense to me either. As for Kotaku, I don't know if it was brought up, but Wikipedia currently has an aversion to blogs. The best course of action is to wait until people cool off and try again, unless ED does something blatantly newsworthy in the meantime. It's a shame, but what can you do? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 03:34, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>Can you help me with my English assignment? Man, I feel stupid writing that. I've been on Wikipedia for a while, and am an admin, and have so far resisted the temptation to use it for stuff like this.</p>
<p>But we have been assigned to show the evolution of a text. Most people went with things like corporate reports, but I thought Wikipedia, and especially the history, would be an excellent medium to work from. So I looked through <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> for a relatively new and relatively short article with a single primary author, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reputation_f398.html" title="The Reputation">The Reputation</a> best met those criteria.</p>
<p>So, if you're willing, can you answer all or any of the following questions? Don't overexert yourself; getting answers soon is vastly preferable to getting big answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you pick that article?</li>
<li>Do you do any drafting outside the wiki?</li>
<li>What people provided feedback before the final version? (i.e. anyone outside FAC or the talk page?)</li>
<li>What were the most important issues addressed in the composition process?</li>
<li>Do most of the articles you write follow a similar process? Why/why not?</li>
</ul>

<p>Except no, because if anybody actually started an article about you it would be deleted in nanoseconds. Even as a joke that statement is evident of some terrible personality defect.

<p>Thanks for the support there, and being brave enough to stick your head above the parapet.

<p>Thanks for your persistent follow up on this Deletion Review.

As I have stated, and as you clearly emphasized, there seems to be no minimum size designated to justify an article, nor did anyone appeal to an existing standard to justify the delete.

<p>Regarding Wikipedia talk:Snowball clause... SK#7 does apply, the page has over 650 backlinks, many of them are used in official contexts. I agree that there's a dispute over whether it <i>should</i> be active, but based on the existing backlinks, it was historically active at the very least, and I don't think it's prudent to make so many close reasons have redlinks in them. At this point, at most {{<a href="../../../r/e/j/Template%7ERejected_0a64.html" title="Template:Rejected">rejected</a>}} should be used. This is discussed on the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7ESnowball_clause_%283rd_nomination%29_c50e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Snowball clause (3rd nomination)">3rd nomination's talk page</a>. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 15:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're close to "rejected" at this point anyway, but I won't get in a silly edit war over it. We disagree, but it's not that big a deal, it's a simple difference of interpretation. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:29, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Close to being rejected?? How so? The straw poll can be interpretted so many different ways that it's almost irrelevant (eg. it's hard to tell whether the votes meant 1) No = {{<a href="../../../r/e/j/Template%7ERejected_0a64.html" title="Template:Rejected">rejected</a>}}, 2) No = stop edit warring over it, leave it as {{<a href="../../../e/s/s/Template%7EEssay_6343.html" title="Template:Essay">essay</a>}}. 3) No = stop edit warring over it, leave it as a corollary, 4) Mu = stop edit warring over it, leave it as a corollary, 5) Mu = Tag it with {{<a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">guideline</a>}}). In May, when it had {{<a href="../../../e/s/s/Template%7EEssay_6343.html" title="Template:Essay">essay</a>}} on it, 1 voted delete, and 16 people voted keep without mentioning putting a {{<a href="../../../r/e/j/Template%7ERejected_0a64.html" title="Template:Rejected">rejected</a>}} tag on it. What's changed so much since then to make it any less of a landslide? --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 15:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm looking at the overall discussion, and it's never going to get approval as a guideline. As it's plainly clear that it's not going to get there, and people think the essay tag is inapppropriate, the rejected tag seems like the logical conclusion. I'm not ready to propose that yet, but it appears to me that it's heading that way. And what happened in May has no bearing on now - people weren't asininely treating it as "de facto" policy or ramming it down our throats the way they have been since then. The pushing back we've been seeing on the talk page is a direct result of the actions of many of its proponents. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The current tagless state is only because it's the one solution that hasn't had edit warring over it. That doesn't mean there's small support for either {{<a href="../../../e/s/s/Template%7EEssay_6343.html" title="Template:Essay">essay</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">guideline</a>}}, it's just that people don't see the point in edit warring when SNOW is backed by IAR policy. There hasn't been much support for the ideas that either 1) SNOW doesn't follow from IAR, or 2) that IAR will be overturned soon, so there is little need for SNOW's supporters to bother with the discussion. Maybe it would have been good to let the deletion discussion go just to make this clear. And people do continue to use it in official contexts, so I don't quite understand the de facto bit.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I just think your efforts would be more productive if they were focused on formalizing when and how uses of IAR and its corollaries could be overturned. I think almost everyone could support that, since it's inarguable that IAR/etc are somewhat subjective and can be misused at times. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 16:50, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, given that Sidaway, either accidentally or purposely, tipped his hand as to his motives in using it, I think we're seeing a rather interesting evolution. SNOW should be completely separate (if it's going to exist at all) from IAR, as the corrollary argument makes less and less sense as time rolls on. Anyhow, whatever, we're just going in about 30 directions currently. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussion from the SNOW talk page</span></h2>
<p>Hi Badlydrawnjeff.</p>
<p>I'm bringing a discussion here from <a href="../../../s/n/o/Wikipedia_talk%7ESnowball_clause_801f.html#How_are_.22rules.22_actually_made.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Snowball clause">Wikipedia talk:Snowball clause#How are "rules" actually made?</a> because I think we were drifting rather off-topic, but into some rather interesting waters. In particular, I'm thinking of this exchange:</p>
<dl>
<dd>GTB: <i>I take it your position is that no matter what the source of the opposition to speedy deletion, and no matter what form that opposition takes, whether or not it's constructive or reason-based, that we should be required to do a full 5 days on AfD.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BDJ: <i>I'll take that challenge: Yes, we are required. We're compelled by the policy, which refers to the process...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, please understand that I don't think your position, as stated, is stupid or unreasonable or inconsistent. I think that's important to get on the table, and I think I may have not been clear about that to Gene, because he got pissed off by the question and stopped talking to me. I happen to disagree with your position, but I can understand why one might hold it.</p>
<p>Now... I'm not sure exactly where to start. Let me ask you this: why do you say "we're compelled by the policy"? When did you decide that Wikipedia policy is "compelling"? I ask, because I don't think of it that way, and I think it surprised me when I first learned to think of it in a different way. I suspect that most people, by default, assume that written rules are meant to be followed in all cases, but is there anything else that told you that Wikipedia does, in fact, work that way, or that it has worked that way historically? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 20:37, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure. My entire experience here, really. It sounds like a simple answer, but the times things work the best is when they're done the way the community has requested, and the only time there's really any major problem is when people think they're above them, and it's typically the same small group who thinks that way. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:52, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm... I wonder whether your problem is with that small group of people, more than with the flexible and fluid nature of policy. Do you think that's possible? I ask because I've had lots of experiences with cutting corners working out really well, and not causing any problems, the difference being that it was done with respect and acknowledgement of the dignity of everyone involved. I tend to think that arrogance and contempt will cause problems in any kind of system, and that courtesy and respect can make all kinds of weird systems work out just fine. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 23:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, actually. The "flexible and fluid nature of policy," to me, refers to the ease of being able to propose and change policy when it makes sense to do so. I can think of few times that ditching such things ended up well as a net gain. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:47, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok. Like I said, you're presenting a coherent and sensible picture of how a project like Wikipedia <i>might</i> work. You seem to be taking it upon yourself to lobby for Wikipedia to work the way you're envisioning, which puts you against a lot of people who've participated in the site since its early days, and who see it differently. Still, I understand where you're coming from. I wonder if you believe that the opposing position is coherent and understandable, or do you think that those of us who advocate a looser interpretation of "rules" are actually suggesting something unworkable and insane? Or something else entirely - please don't think I'm trying to put words in your mouth. I'm not even trying to argue with you right now, just to increase mutual understanding. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 00:44, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not like I'm all that "new," this is how it <i>has</i> worked. We have a small, but vocal, number of people who believe it's always worked a certain way when it really hasn't. I don't find the "opposing" position understandible, because it's not working, and it is somewhat insane, to be blunt. The best way to see how something proposed can work is how it's used in the past, and I've never seen a useful instance of SNOW in this case, and no one's been able to present one. I'm merely told "yeah, it's worked plenty of times," and I'm dismissed when I point out why it didn't or why it shouldn't have. It's tiring and no longer amusing, and it hurts the project. Those advocating it poisoned the well by misusing it, and there's absolutely no reason why these ideas couldn't be incorporated into existing policy by consensus. Why isn't it? Because they know it lacks actual support. It's an end-around. I'm rambling now, so I'll stop before I get completely incoherent. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:48, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Badlydrawnjeff, please don't think that I'm trying to dismiss you. Also, I don't mind you being blunt; I was the one who suggested the word "insane", without sarcasm. I agree with you about the well-poisoning; I think you know that. The only thing I would take issue with is your claim that "those advocating it poisoned the well by misusing it", because I think you're tarring more people with that brush than is strictly accurate. In particular, I'm advocating SNOW, but I don't think I've been engaged in any well-poisoning. If I have, I hope you'll point out where, so I can apologize.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry you don't understand my position, and I'm not sure how to communicate it to you. Our impressions of Wikipedia's past seem to be different, although we've both been around, and it's my impression that those advocating for strict process-following are the small, vocal minority. How can we say which of us is correct?</dd>
<dd>I guess the best SNOW example I could think of right now is the Speedy Keep criteria, before they were written down. Then, they were examples of SNOW, and despite being contrary to existing process, they had enough support that someone finally wrote them down, creating the conditions for someone to later come along and accuse any speedy keep <i>not</i> meeting those particular criteria of being a policy violation. It's almost an argument against writing stuff down - it gives people the impression of being received wisdom, set in stone, once it's written down. Maybe you can tell me why that's not a good example. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:03, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Fixing indent) I know you aren't trying to dismiss me, but others have and will continue to. I don't believe I'm tarring more people than I need to be, as I don't think there's yet been a proper, uncontroversial use of it. It's funny you bring up speedy keep, as well. I made an attempt earlier this year to incorporate some of what SNOW would do into the speedy keep criteria. What happened? People spoke up, and said they didn't want to incorporate it into the guideline. So if people have spoken and said "We don't want things closed early if, for instance, they've been nominated numerous times for deletion" (which is a time SNOW has come into play), why would we possibly allow it for WP:SNOW? If it's something the community wants, we write it down and codify it. There's no reason not to, because we work within consensus here. WP:SNOW is anti-consensus building, and is against our basic tenets. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 01:07, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What about before any Speedy Keep criteria were written down? That was actually my example, and not some putative additional speedy keep criterion. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:35, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, what about it? If things were kept like that beforehand, they simply shouldn't have been. And even now, it's not properly followed, but that's a different discussion. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 10:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But the point is - that's how we got the Speedy Keep criteria. "What about it?" is that it's an example of SNOW working so well that it got written into the guideline after being applied enough times. Those criteria weren't determined by someone thinking of them out of the blue - they were hammered out based on what had worked many times previously, despite it's being SNOW. Without that experience, people would have been guessing; with that experience, they knew what to write down. It's an example of how some of us are saying policy really is formed here. It happens in practice, <i>then</i> it's written down. You don't seem to be disagreeing that that's what happened, just that it shouldn't have happened that way, right? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 18:37, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But see, WP:SNOW is different in that case. WP:SNOW is being forced down people's throats, while people saw a legitimate need for certain keep processes to be sped up. There's no legitimate reason to push SNOW that way, and they're not in the same boat, either. In fact, Speedy Keep was more than likely a response to Speedy Delete than it was any sort of "this is what's done" thing. The fact that the same folks who hold Speedy Keep in high regard can't be brought to incorporate WP:SNOW-style things into its fold speaks volumes to me. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It turns out I'm not arguing for forcing anything down anyone's throat; at least I'm trying not to. Regarding Speedy Keep, it doesn't really have much to do with Speedy Delete - it has to do with clearing out some AfD discussions that are obvious keepers before the 5 days run out. Ever since AfD has existed (and VfD before it) there have been some discussions that don't need to keep running once everyone realizes there really was a president named Rutherford B. Hayes, or whatever, so it's not a hoax. It's worth mentioning that an early closure resulting in a Keep is much less controversial than an early closure resulting in a Delete. Now, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand your last sentence. Are you referring to your attempt to add an additional Speedy Keep criterion? Have you got a link to that discussion? I'd be curious to see it. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 19:13, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, in response to "WP:SNOW is anti-consensus building," I refer you to Centrix' last comments at the SNOW talk page, where he points out that it's not anti-consensus at all, but about recognizing that sometimes, consensus has already been established, and there's no need to spend another five days hashing out the same arguments again. WP:SNOW is a way of recognizing consensus, not ignoring it. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 10:29, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. See <a href="../../../j/a/m/WP%7EJAMAICA_d73c.html" title="WP:JAMAICA">WP:JAMAICA</a> for an explanation. There's also an essay called "consensus can change" out there, but I don't know the exact link. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 10:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok... that's an interesting essay. "Consensus can change" is the renamed version of "No binding decisions", so it can probably be found via <a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">WP:NBD</a>... ah there it is: <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a>. The example at the bottom of the Jamaica page is an article (Captain underpants, etc.) that seems to be utterly unreferenced and talking about the future, and thus shouldn't exist unless or until there's something verifiable to say about the putative book. I don't think it's a very good example, but I have seen other examples of things that were thought to be hoaxes and turned out to be real, and even verifiable, so point taken.</dd>
<dd>However, that's not really related to what I was trying to say, because that particular book had never been discussed before. I'm talking about cases where consensus has actually been established through previous repeated discussion of exactly the same thing, over and over again. Why continue to have precisely the conversation we've already had? That seems to be what Radiant! and Centrix are saying WP:SNOW is for - it's for short circuiting what would otherwise be an endlessly repeating loop. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 18:37, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, because consensus can change and we can't predict the future, we have no way of knowing if it's an endlessly repeating loop. My other issue. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Without an example to talk about, I just don't see this conversation getting anywhere. I don't want to waste your time, so I'll come back when I've got a good one.

<p>I've looked into your history, and it looks like you've been treated unfairly by the Powers That Be. If I were you, I'd stay away from policy matters for a while, and draft things in secret for a few weeks. Then come back with cogent arguments and good text. Meanwhile, just edit articles and go to AfD and DRV and save things that need to be saved. I support you, man. You're being bullied, intimidated, and abused. If you want to open an RfC, I'll second it. I'm kind of a newbie, but I've read extensively the policies, so I know what I'm doing. Also, I've worked in Wikipedia namespace. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Blythe_7728.html" title="User:Billy Blythe">Billy Blythe</a> 10:21, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>At first, I thought you had written it, but it's 100% true, and an admin, brenneman, said so on the talk page. I think it needs to be an official essay, not a parody. Can we change it? I support that.

<dd>No, it's meant to be a parody, and I have no problem with that. To turn it into anything else would make it no better than what it's parodying. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 10:45, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
