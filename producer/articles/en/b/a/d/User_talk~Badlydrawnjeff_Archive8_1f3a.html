<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dispute tag discussion</span></h2>
<p>Hi. Appreciate your reply. I hate conflict so bad, that it makes me shake, but I love calming things down. Can I humbly make a suggestion? As a sign of good faith revert the tag yourself and then start a new discussion of the contentious edit, adopting a really neutral position? If your concern was that the change was made without consensus, people might actually chime in if they a) can clearly see the problem without needing to check loads of diffs and b) don't feel like they're stepping into a fist fight. I know this won't seem a very attractive option, but I think it'll work. And leave you looking like the good guy... which is nice. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 13:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I've tried that tack in the past with him, it doesn't work. Simply emboldens him into believing he's actually right, which is counterproductive. I think my new theory is simply going to be a version of <a href="../../../r/b/i/WP%7ERBI_37b3.html" title="WP:RBI">WP:RBI</a>, without the blocking part. The best thing you can do to help is actually chime in with your feelings on the matter. I don't care if you support me or not, honestly - a resolution to this is my utmost concern - but the only way this will be resolved is with discussion. See some related discussion at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and where this started, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

<p>You appear to be forum shopping; my previous comment stands. For the last week or so, you have been persistently making false accusations and personal attacks about me all over the wiki, and that includes both so-called mediation requests. Basically, any recent discussion with you boils down to you namecalling rather than making actual arguments. Several people have pointed that out to you already, but you apparently feels justified in attacking people you consider disruptive. If you are willing to retract those accusations and attacks, and to stop making them in the future, I'd be happy do discuss our disagreements. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 17:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yo Jeff. Sorry I bawled you out over measurements, but while I take such things as stylistic infelicity and even so-called "bad grammar" in my stride (except when they're perpetrated by people who obnoxiously criticize it in others), spurious precision in measurement &lt;span class="ghastly_cliche"&gt;is one of my pet peeves&lt;/span&gt;. If I continue adding my little changes to or comments on the Turk, you will of course develop a mighty strong hatred of my guts. (Or rather, you'll redevelop it: you must have experienced it over old Kroger.)

<dd>Well, if you feel it can stand on its own, there's nothing binding to anywhere that says you can't replace it with well-sourced text.

<p>I'm as surprised as you probably are that this song doesn't seem to have generated any particularly good sources.

<p>I don't intend to rehash the entire dispute for you. I've found you, to be honest, impossible to deal with in a logical manner in that dispute (although you at least were always mindful to remain civil and mostly good-faithed in the discussion, something I've come to greatly appreciate from my encounters with <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">user:Ghirlandajo</a>).</p>
<p>To summarize, my feeling is that you uselessly levelled up a massive amount of ruckus. Despite your claims to it in the arbitration request, it was not your "pushing [of] the issue" that "eventually gained tangible consensus" for it. The consensus <i>was there to begin with</i>. You at best tightly focused that consensus on defending the page as a guideline (admittedly, making it clearer and completing it with examples in the process, but I expect it would have come around of itself) and polarized the whole issue.</p>
<p>If the case is accepted, I will present what I believe to be evidence, but I really don't want to start the whole thing over with you. I might not have appreciated your attitude then, but right now I've put it behind me since the matter itself is pretty much settled in a way I believe to be in accordance with the wiki spirit and our policies. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 01:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It has been proposed that the following criteria be removed from this guideline: 1. The commercial organization is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications.3 2. The commercial organization's share price is used to calculate one or more of the major managed stock market indices.4 Note this is not the same as simply being listed on a stock market. Nor is it the same as being included in an index that comprises the entire market. The broader or the more specialized the index, the less notability it establishes for the company.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Admin backlogs</span></h2>
<p>Could you explain your opinion on the current admin backlogs a bit more? On the adminship survey, I try to say why I feel the backlogs are bad: they actually encourage admins to make quick decisions instead of slowly thinking about the merits of each speedy deletion case. To give an example, this morning I started my computer and for the first time in weeks, <a href="../../../c/s/d/C%7ECSD_87ad.html" title="C:CSD">C:CSD</a> was at below 50, giving me time to actually research and fix two of the items in the category instead of just deleting them to get rid of the backlog. If an admin has to delete one band vanity article per day, he'll have time to think, research, and nominate at AFD. If there are 50, chances are that the admin won't think, won't research, and won't want to cause another backlog at AFD and just delete a borderline article. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 16:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's hard for me to imagine I could make any argument you've not heard before, but to me this makes sense: Verifiability is about the information that's in articles- it must be verifiable from a proper source, right? Well, think of "notability" as just meaning "this subject has enough verifiable information about it that a non-permastub encyclopedia article is a possibility." My birth certificate and various other public records make my existence as a person verifiable- but there's no way a sourced <i>encyclopedia article</i> could be written about me. Any "article" about me would just be directory information, therefore I'm not notable. Sure, you could hunt me down and talk to my friends and neighbors, but if you have to do that sort of first-hand detective work to hunt down useful information, the subject isn't notable. If other people have already done this first-hand detective work and written about the subject in a proper source, the subject probably IS notable. Does this make any sense at all? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, we're in agreement. The problem is that "multiple, non-trivial works" where the subject is primary doesn't do that - it creates an artificial roadblock to otherwise "notable" topics. When I can provide seven subjects without thinking that are "notable" without meeting the standard set, there's a problem. We agree that <i>some</i> standard needs to be set - I just don't understand why you're so set on <i>this</i> standard when it's obviously poor. If it's designed to relate to WP:V - it doesn't. If it's designed to set a bar, the bar is obviously set too high, judging by what "notable" subjects it fails to account for. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We just have to use common sense. If a single chapter in a book is about a given subject, who on earth is going to object that the book also had other chapters that weren't focused on that subject? Yes, there's a grey area where judgment is needed, but there's no making that grey area disappear. Whatever guideline we have on notability must be interpreted by reasonable editors in order to work usefully. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other." Where is the problem? I don't have to ignore this to make it work. Guidelines are just words on a page, they have no sense. The sense comes in when reasonable editors read and interpret the guidelines. If you're looking for a notability test whose results could be determined by a machine rather than by reasonable editors, well, good luck. I don't see that we need such a thing- all of Wikipedia depends on having reasonable editors. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My apologies if that came off as rude. I <i>hope</i> the point of guidelines is that they can be reasonably interpreted by reasonable editors. Doesn't mean there'll never be judgment calls, of course. Maybe we're just misunderstanding each other, as does happen, but to me it sounds like you're objecting to the fact that the guidelines are open to interpretation. What other choice do we have? We're bound by the limits of language, here. I'm struggling to understand what you'd prefer over "has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works"- would you rather see something like "has been mentioned anywhere that we can find"? My objection to that would be that trivial mentions of a thing don't let us write encyclopedia articles. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My hope is the same as yours, but you seem to think we can expect people to be reasonable with unreasonable benchmarks. I'm <i>all for</i> interpretation of guidelines, but we <i>cannot</i> assume, expect, or accept that something that says "the subject of multiple, non-trivial works" be interpreted as "mentioned in a number of related works that aren't about the subject." That's simply stupid. You know what I prefer: "A topic is notable if it has sufficient, independent works that are reliable and can act as the basis for an article." It's clear enough where it harkens back to our core policies and guidelines, and open-ended enough where an actual discussion on the merits of sources and encyclopedic value can occur. It keeps the bullshit out and the good shit in. You appear to oppose this, and I don't know why. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(tired of indents) Maybe we're just quibbling over wording then, instead of actually disagreeing on what this means.

<dd>I don't really see any problem with wording along those lines. To me, saying it's the "subject of" sources, versus "has" sources, makes little difference at all. I don't object to having "non-trivial" in there either, but maybe this is redundant with "sufficient". Let's be clear tho- consider a concert review for example, that goes on at length about the headliner band and also has a sentence at the end that says "Opening acts included bands X and Y". Are we in agreement that such a review is useless as a source for bands X and Y, and would only work as a source for the headliner? To me, this is a classic example of a "trivial" mention of bands X and Y that does us little good. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right. <i>On its own</i>, a one sentence review is trivial and useless. But let's say that we have two more reviews that have a similar sentence at the end, sometimes mentioning a song they played. And then we have a short magazine blurb - a couple paragraphs? - noting the members and that the album is coming out. And then we see one more short review of the album, comparing them to another band. We now have five trivial mentions, but all containing enough information to form a decent stub and demonstrating that they're being not<i>ed</i> - best of all, it forces users to actually use the sources to establish the article as well as "notability," and gives us the ability to banish the unverified because it's...just...not. A reasonable discussion can be made as not to whether the mentions are enough, but only whether it's enough to start an article, which is all that matters - our core policies and guidelines take care of the rest. No more "is this trivial," "are they the subject" navel-gazing. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hrm. To me, a record review isn't automatically "trivial" by being short, because they're reviewing that record. The band (well, one of their records) is the <i>subject</i> of the review. However, any local music rag runs articles or reviews of local bands all the time- this is pretty trivial in my opinion because it's just local in scope. School lunch schedules are in local papers too. To me, the question of "is it trivial?" is always going to be considered, whether the guideline uses the word "trivial" or not. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 21:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but are those local reviews sufficient to establish true notability? That's the discussion we <i>should</i> be having, and your quibbling over "trivial" is ironically the same type of ruleslaywering you seem to want us to avoid, IMO. It's much more productive to take a look at a group of sources and say "yes, this establishes notability" rather than trying to shoot down sources for triviality. Also, this is <i>exactly</i> why subject-specific guidelines are so helpful - as you said, most any local music rag runs these articles or reviews, so why should that necessarily be enough. Techically speaking, it wasn't until we started pushing a more primary criteria that those started becoming an issue. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure I follow you. In my view, the strictly local coverage is covered in a general way by saying we want nontrivial coverage. So how do the subject-specific guidelines help? I don't like at all the idea of us making up rules like "a blurble is notable if it's more than 10 feet wide". Isn't this essentially OR? That's why I object to subject-specific guidelines generally - it's <i>not up to us</i> to decide what's notable. We're an encyclopedia, we don't do original research, we rely on sources instead. Whoops, I should clarify- when I say it's not up to us, I mean we don't do OR.

<dd>(Back to margin). "sufficient" as the key word will not help in general. There will be every bit as much arguing about what is sufficient in a particular case as there is with the present wording. Where it might help is in establishing the idea that for the web as it is now the web sources rule is too restrictive, and adding flexibility otherwise. But I can see people arguing whether, say, 2 novels by major publishers are sufficient, or 3, or 4 or 5 or ... and all the existing disputes will continue.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A long time ago, on the article <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_car.html" title="Sports car">sports car</a>, someone was trying to come up with a consensus definition among editors on what exactly counts as a sports car. This is inappropriate because it's OR. If the term does not have an exact definition out there in the world, it's <i>not up to us</i> to invent one. We should just say what the experts have verifiably said and not take it further than that. To me, this is very nearly the same issue as us deciding amongst ourselves that a blurble is notable if it's more than 10 feet wide. We shouldn't be making up that sort of criteria, we should rely on what the sources say. This is why IMO many of the subject-specific guidelines skirt OR and should be avoided. As for why strictly local sources may be considered trivial, I see this as a matter of choosing our battles. We have enough trouble maintaining good content as it is. If we open the door to articles on every grade school spelling bee winner, our job will become way more difficult, by sheer volume. Also, remember that the goal of the project is, broadly speaking, educational. It's hard to imagine the educational value of an article on how many speeding tickets the Podunk Police Department gave out last month. So to me, generally excluding purely local-interest content is mainly a cost/benefit concern. We're already way broader in our coverage than any other encyclopedia has been, and while this is a good thing, <i>there is a difference</i> between an encyclopedia (even a very broad one) and an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:11, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By that logic, you're already in "original research" territory by arbitrarily deciding that "multiple" works constitute "notability" over anything else. Better, then, to use "sufficient" - at least that way, we're requesting people <i>start</i> with sources and not asking for more than WP:V asks for. Meanwhile, we disagree on the scope of "trivial," but that at least appears logical - again, "sufficient" would solve a lot of those problems, regardless, I think. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there are some grey areas here. We couldn't avoid having to find and evaluate sources even if we wanted to- we're an encyclopedia, that's what we do. We <i>can</i> avoid inventing our own criteria based on various aspects of the subject matter, so we should avoid it. It will always be a judgment call about what level of sources are enough, no matter how we word the guideline. We can perhaps chose between people arguing over what's "trivial" or over what's "sufficient", but I don't see how there's an important difference between the two. As for local matters, do you really think that grade school spelling bee results belong in an encyclopedia? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:34, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We'll always have the debate, yes. but what's a better debate - deciding if the sources provided are enough to establish a basic article, or deciding whether the sources are "trivial" or not, irregardless of whether an article can be sustained? By moving "notability" away from this "multiple, non-trivial," and toward "do we have enough information to establish notability," it makes our standards ultimately clearer and makes everything easier. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I doubt we could come to an agreement on that- to me, multiple nontrivial sources <i>are</i> generally what's required to have sufficient information that an encyclopedia article could be written. So I don't see that "enough information to establish notability" is clearer- it's more vague. "Multiple, non-trivial sources" is an attempt to clarify what constitutes "enough". <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:46, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, what do we use as a basis for what's required? WP:V? WP:V simply requires third party sources, no more, no less. Why are we forcing a higher standard for "notability" when we can use third party sources to figure it out - perhaps one is enough, perhaps five are. Why not use WP:V as a directive for content, and make sure that we have sufficient third party coverage for "notability?" --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's hard for me to imagine I could make any argument you've not heard before, but to me this makes sense: Verifiability is about the information that's in articles- it must be verifiable from a proper source, right? Well, think of "notability" as just meaning "this subject has enough verifiable information about it that a non-permastub encyclopedia article is a possibility." My birth certificate and various other public records make my existence as a person verifiable- but there's no way a sourced encyclopedia article could be written about me. Any "article" about me would just be directory information, therefore I'm not notable. Sure, you could hunt me down and talk to my friends and neighbors, but if you have to do that sort of first-hand detective work to hunt down useful information, the subject isn't notable. If other people have already done this first-hand detective work and written about the subject in a proper source, the subject probably IS notable. Does this make any sense at all?

<p>IMHO, Friday, this is the problem with confusing the common definition of "notability" with "verifiability." If the local music rags are reliable sources, then several reviews in local rags may be enough to write a non-stub article. That doesn't answer the question of whether the band is sufficiently important to merit inclusion in the encyclopedia (the colloquial definition of "notable"), but it may satisfy the condition you originally set - that "this subject has enough verifiable information about it that a non-permastub encyclopedia article is a possibility." I don't mean to pick on you, and appreciate your comments, but think that this lack of concensus on whether notability means "notability" or "sufficient verified independent sources" is confusing the debate.

<dd>Yeah, that's the one - I guess I read what it's about differently, but I've also seen so many books and articles about him at this point I see articles about his films and his production/presentation process as separate things. My issue, as stated above, is simply that "multiple, non-trivial" is an absurd standard to use, especially since it's being unfairly forced on the lower guidelines that exist for a reason. A better alternative would be "sufficient reliable," which can establish "notability" without running afoul of the core policies OR expecting more than the core policies call for.

<dd>Maybe I'm missing something. Do you think a single source, a trival source, or even a single trivial source would be "sufficient"?

<dd>A single source <i>could</i> be "sufficient" for "notability." A "trivial source" on its own probably can't, but four of five could. Right now, one book or massive article on a subject doesn't meet the criteria if that's all there is, but it would certainly be "notable" and the source would be "sufficient" for "notability."

<dd>I guess the way I've looked it is that since claims of notability are almost by definition controversial claims, they need to be well sourced -- "one source thinks it's notable" doesn't seem very notable. I guess I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a topic being noteworthy, yet only being noted by one source. Do you have particular topics in mind that are only noted in one source? I do think the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> guideline could make more clear where along the range between 1 sentence and 360 pages "non-trivial" falls. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:11, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wish I did, because it would certainly strengthen my argument, wouldn't it? "Notability" shouldn't be that controversial in my mind, <i>because</i> it's so genre-specific, and something is "notable" before the mainstream catches up with it - using the fickle "old media" as the bar is rather silly in the information age. There's a lot of nuance to it that we're simply abandoning for a one-size-fits-all mentality designed to keep information out rather than bring more information in, and that's problematic to me. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:43, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Badlydrawnjeff.</p>
<p>I've been loosely following the dispute resolution process between yourself and Radiant!. There's an idea I thought of a little while ago, that you and/or Radiant might be interested in, and I thought now's as good a time as any to mention it.</p>
<p>The background is that, in the interactions I've seen between the two of you on guideline talk pages, I've noticed that you'll both claim that your understanding of policy formation is firmly grounded in experience with guideline development. That strikes me as an empirical question, and one that I think it would be quite interesting to investigate.</p>
<p>What do you think of working up a page where we summarize the histories of several policy pages, guideline pages and essays, and take note of the various roles played by description of existing practice, straw polls, tags, etc. It would probably be of interest to many to see how some of our most broadly agreed upon principles acquired the consensus support they enjoy, and by what path some of our more controversial pages have navigated their turbulent waters.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dear Vile Dark Lord</span></h2>
<p>Are you trying to get <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and related pages to express thoughts about notability that <i>you</i> agree with? This may not be a very good goal to have- aren't your notions of notability pretty far off from mainstream thinking on this topic? I'm not suggesting at all that your input is unwanted - in fact, if there was something you AND the rest of the project could agree on, this would be outstanding, but this seems unlikely to me. But, do you think it'd be good to maybe slow down a little? Also, (and again I'm sure you've heard this all before) remember that the question of what <i>content</i> belongs in an encyclopedia is different from the question of which <i>articles</i> belong. Merging (which, for reasons I admit I don't understand, you seem to be generally against) is a good way to deal with non-notable subjects without deleting content. Instead of having exhaust manifold of a 74 Pinto, significant details about that exhaust manifold can go in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Pinto_13a6.html" title="Ford Pinto">Ford Pinto</a> as appropriate. Anyway, just food for thought. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Huh? What makes you mention good faith? Obviously you're doing what you think is best, I just frequently disagree because to me, what you think is best appears to be having no requirements for sourcing. <i>Using</i> sources instead of <i>being</i> the source is what makes this an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I would urge you to forgive and forget unless you can identify a pattern of disruption or willful abuse. (If you can, your consideration of recall would make more sense, but please don't go into it here.) Single actions, made in good faith, should practically never be cause to desysop a user. Just my two cents, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 03:10, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps not. In any case I am not aware that Zocky is a part of it, or that this is more than an isolated incident. I don't know that he is being too reasonable about it, and he definitely misused the tools, but mistakes are a par for the course with human beings at the helm. A single incident of bad judgment, even very bad judgment, can usually be forgotten, especially when no lasting harm is done. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 06:39, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>while doing something to do with <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeanuts5402_e236.html" title="User:Peanuts5402">User:Peanuts5402</a> and it seemed to me that you were making sense, so I stopped in at your User Page and actually took the time to read it. I didn't understand everything because I have been one of those editors who has chosen NOT to look at what is going on behind the curtain. But more and more the curtain has seemed to move and I've been trying to decide whether or not to just slip out the back door. When I had a section in the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phallus.html" title="Phallus">phallus</a> article on "Phallic architecture" removed as being the dreaded <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> because I needed an expert to say that a particular building, or group of them, looked like penises, I though "this is about it." So I sort of took heart from your pages and thought, "Is there a group of like minded wikipedians that I can get in with about some of this stuff?" Okay, I am not a conservative. Not even close, but when i find myself making common cause with one, well than I know that the problem is for real. If I can help you out, if you are looking for votes or backing or whatever, consider giving me a call.. Wikipedia is (<a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a>) supposed to be fun.

<p>Hi Jeff. I know you and Friday have history and I can see you're upset. I think your last post on his page was somewhat unfair, given that he was trying to apologise. I can understand what it was that irritated you in the tail of the apology, but I think that a cooler Jeff would have been absolutely fine about it. Anyway, please take this comment in the way it's intended - respectful and sad to see two fine contributors in conflict. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 23:48, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Good articles</span></h2>
<p>Congrats on your second featured article. Since you've pushed 3+ into good article territory, judging by your brag board, could you tell me, like, how to do it? I listed <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> on <a href="../../../g/a/c/WP%7EGAC_00ed.html" title="WP:GAC">WP:GAC</a> like a week ago and nothing has happened, which leads me to believe I did something wrong or forgot a step.

<dd>haha! Honestly? Pick a subject no one gives a shit about, find a book or three that has information on everything regarding that subject, and go to town. As long as the language is coherent and it's well-referenced, GA usually isn't a problem to achieve, FA is a nightmare, though. The easiest way to do it is to find a way to be left alone while doing it. Cooperation is only helpful when people are on the same page, something you'll never get with stuff like Uncyclopedia. I'll help wherever I can though, let me know. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 03:20, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Do I detect a hint of Wikicynicism? Anyway, I'm more wondering about the process than the quality aspect, I've done all I have the talent to do on the article for now (which was just deleting crap until it was well-sourced). Do I just list it and wait til someone with the interest votes for it, or do I have to do something else as well? <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Milto LOL pia</a> 03:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I applaud your efforts, and wish that I could be as persistent at it. Something will have to be done, for the various pages seem in conflict--eg N(general) is stricter than N(people), but most of the people subclassifications are stricter than the main rules. What particularly bothers me is the 2 sources, and nothing more. Everything in the world has two non-trivial sources. I'm generally a so-called inclusionist--up to a point, and my feeling is that you are as well, though not necessarily over the same things. Since the real problem is the same old in/ex debate, and the views are both principled, and will never agree, we cannot get a consensus, but at best a compromise which will still allow everyone to interpret it their own way in argument. Any ideas on how to do it? I now just watch for your comments and try to support them. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 17:06, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nope, they are a band. If you oppose CsD, then you need to use the hang-on tag which you just placed on it. Notability is not asserted in my mind. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 18:03, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, that's not how it works. First, A7 is avoided by an assertion of notability, which this article provides. Second, any editor - except the person who created the article - can remove a speedy deletion tag.

When you say "sources are not what makes a subject encyclopedic/appropriate for inclusion" what DOES make it appropriate then? If it's not what the sources are saying, what's left?

<dd>I have no clue as to why I'm continuing to feed this today, especially since we've been through this and the answer is written right below your response: An article may have to be removed because of a lack of sources, but that doesn't mean the subject of the article is inappropriate. Should we keep unsourced articles? No. Does an article about an encyclopedic subject that lacks sources be removed? Yes. Do the lack of said sources make the subject unencyclopedic? Of course not, because the appropriateness of the subject has zero to do with the sources and everything to do with, well, a variety of things, depending on the subject. A top 10 song, regardless of how much or little is written about it, is always appropriate/encyclopedic for our purposes. A film starring a major actor, regardless of the amount of attention it gets, is always appropriate/encyclopedic for our purposes. The sources are what simply allows these encyclopedic/appropriate articles to meet our standard policies.

<dd>I did AfD it, months ago, and I explained why I think deletion and/or a merge is necessary but you continue to delete any nomination for deletion I post. It is hardly a noteworthy book. Rather it is a book that is part of a noteworthy series. This page provides nothing except blatant plot summary and does not benefit Wikipedia at all. Clearly nobody has bothered to improve on it. Instead they create new pages for other books in the series with only one sentence descriptions.

<dd>The only list item that this book qualifies for is: "# The book has been made or adapted with attribution into a motion picture that was released into multiple commercial theaters, or was aired on a nationally televised network or cable station in any country." and the movie that it was made into was not even based on its plot. This isn't Harry Potter. If you want this page so badly, maybe you should try revising it and making it better. 137.238.121.34 03:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The Princess Diaries deletions</span></h3>
<p>The plot summary and infobox for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Princess_Diaries_6fe5.html" title="The Princess Diaries">The Princess Diaries</a> were deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Princess_Diaries&amp;oldid=116764959" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Princess_Diaries&amp;oldid=116764959" rel="nofollow">here</a> - I figured out eventually that you're going for a main article/subarticle structure. Good. Since the article was granted an article grade of B _with these items_ something like them should remain - a different Infobox, and a Series Description(in place of Plot Summary). I'd like to discuss improvements with you on the article's talk page. I support a page per book in the series (as you seem to do), at least until I figure out how to create subpages or tabs. It's up to more editors to add plots for the remaining novels. --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexein_4b6d.html" title="User:Lexein">Lexein</a> 13:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I can't give you much to work with <i>right now</i>, but I can tell you that we're on the same page (one page to cover the series, page for each of the books, no page for the characters at this point) in terms of what we're aiming for. When I get back from my honeymoon, I'll definitely chime in more (BTW, the plot summary/infobox for that page got moved to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Princess_Diaries_%28novel%29_c631.html" title="The Princess Diaries (novel)">The Princess Diaries (novel)</a>), but a better overview is in my longer-term plan, especially since I'm caught up reading the books now. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question for an inclusionist</span></h2>
<p>As you are one of Wikipedia's most prolific inclusionists (I see you on policy page discussions everywhere), I have chosen you to ask a question to that I've been wondering about. There's a common attitude I've noticed among inclusionists of doom and gloom and horror, as if a terrible disaster is going on which must be stopped immediately before all of Wikipedia collapses into dust, or some such thing. What seems odd about this to me is that... you're winning! Not only are inclusionists winning, they're winning big, their victories greatly outnumbering their defeats day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. If Wikipedia were shrinking in size, I could see the inclusionists being unhappy, but Wikipedia is increasing in size exponentially, by 700,000 articles a year. Every article of interest to more than one person which ever gets deleted will eventually be recreated, and categories of articles which were once considered unencylopedic become acceptable simply by sheer force of numbers. If one or ten articles of a certain type considered unacceptable get written, they are all deleted. If 100 get written, they might get deleted. If 1000 get written, everyone throws up their hands and says, "We can't possibly delete this many, what to do, what to do?", and a new category of articles is now acceptable. The sheer volume of articles pouring in every day is outpacing anything the deletionists can do. Given all of this, the expected emotional state of inclusionists should be one of triumphant joyfullness, as the success of their view of of what Wikipedia should be is inevitable. We have 1.7 million articles today, in a few years we'll be up to 3 million, barring a collapse of western civilization or the internet. So why are inclusionists so unhappy? If we had 1.8 million today, instead of having to wait 45 days to reach this number, would things be all that much better? --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 22:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why are we so unhappy? Well, I can only speak for myself - we can do better. Yes, our growth is going great, and that's a positive thing, but when you know that the project can do better, you can't help but continue to feel negative. Take a look at the redlink farm on my userpage, for instance. A lot of those probably would never meet the standard for films or relative notability that people who don't generally fall into an exlusionist/inclusionist divide advocate. Yet they're all verifiable, they're all noteworthy <i>for their genre</i>, and should generally have a place here. Why be pleased at being able to include all Hollywood movies, and most b-movies, when you should be able to include all Hollywood movies and all b-movies without sacrificing quality, y'know? I think we'll be happy once we know that the deletion processes aren't going to continue to tilt toward removing good content (which it still does) and when the general standards for inclusion are reasonable (which we're coming much closer to than I ever thought we would). --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Both about well meaning editors who decided that reading policy is enough, talking with people was unnecessary, and if you make a few mistakes when overenthusiastically deleting other people's work, that's no big deal. They have good intentions, but don't communicate with others well, and end up causing havoc in their wake. I'm kind of hoping I don't end up having to indefinitely block one or both. One is actually an admin, but did proportionally more damage. It's a mess. The week before I advised a number of FACs and Peer Reviews, that was fun.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Atlanta Braves 2007 Season</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I put up a request for this page to be deleted but now think that may have been an error. My first couple of searches did not bring up similar articles for other teams and their 2007 season, but they do actually exist, see <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Kansas_City_Royals_season_5bc0.html" title="2007 Kansas City Royals season">2007 Kansas City Royals season</a> or <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_season_7719.html" title="2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season">2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season</a> for example--there's a whole category actually. In other words I think the article probably should be reinstated instead of directing to <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_4729.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>. Thoughts?--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigtimepeace_1113.html" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> 19:24, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, such articles seem a bit frivolous, but apparently they're all under the auspices of WikiProject Baseball which is "trying to create season articles for every MLB team for the upcoming 2007 season." There actually is already an article for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Atlanta_Braves_season_604e.html" title="2007 Atlanta Braves season">2007 Atlanta Braves season</a>, which the editor who created the now defunct <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_2007_Season_59f5.html" title="Atlanta Braves 2007 Season">Atlanta Braves 2007 Season</a> apparently did not notice. So though the article fits into a larger project it was right to delete it since it already existed under a slightly different name (if anything Atlanta Braves 2007 Season should be redirected into 2007 Atlanta Braves season rather than simply <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_4729.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> as it is now but I don't know how to do that). Thanks for your help (I'll leave a note about this on the other user's talk page) and I'm going to swear off baseball related articles for awhile.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigtimepeace_1113.html" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> 19:40, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if the Wikiproject thinks it's a good idea, I'm not going to stand in the way, but I wonder if they plan on doing them for the other seasons (2006, 1983, 1942 etc), too. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:41, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I doubt they will go backwards in time to 1983 etc., but rather simply do such articles from 2007 onward. It seems unnecessary but there's an increasing trend for articles of that kind (e.g. "Season Three of some obscure TV show!") on wikipedia so it's not really surprising.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigtimepeace_1113.html" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> 19:48, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Articles about words</span></h2>
<p>I'm asking various people about this, maybe you can give me your opinion as well. We on Wikipedia handle articles about words differently than we handle probably every other type of article. In general, we keep or delete articles based not on their current quality, but on whether the subject is notable/has reliable sources available. However, when it comes to articles about words (<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thou.html" title="Thou">Thou</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/u/You.html" title="You">You</a>), we keep or delete them based on what they look like at the moment. A low quality stub about a scientific topic or historical person will be kept in the hopes that one day someone comes along and cleans it up and writes a good article on it, whereas a low quality stub about a word, or even often an average article on a word, is transwikied to wiktionary and deleted. However, a high quality article on a word is kept.</p>
<p>Does this make sense? I'm not even sure what our policy on word articles should be, but this practice to me seems inappropriate, given that it's exactly the opposite of how we operate in every other way. And, I've written an essay about this, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_about_words_5534.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles about words">Wikipedia:Articles about words</a>, if you feel like it, read it and see if I've accurately described our current practice. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 22:53, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going to keep this on my talk page - I may not be able to get to it in a reasonable way until after Easter.

<dd>I'll chime in, why not? IMO articles about words are pretty much awesome, but there isn't much of a point in stubbing every word in existence, that's crazy. To me, they should be added as users are willing to create them and expand them beyond a simple dictionary def (etymology etc, usage etc.), that way they avoid the deletionists.<a href="../../../i/v/o/User%7EIvoShandor_4733.html" title="User:IvoShandor">IvoShandor</a> 06:09, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
