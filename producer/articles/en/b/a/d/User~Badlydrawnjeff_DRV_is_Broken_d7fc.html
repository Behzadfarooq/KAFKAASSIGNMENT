	    <p>Deletion Review allegedly relies on <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">consensus</a> and strength of argument, eschewing vote counts. Even though this is said to be true, the incorrect result often occurs, whereas the <i>process</i> may have been faulty and an improper hearing occurred, or other guidelines regarding notability were ignored incorrectly. Knowing that all processes will have some rate of failure in result, regardless of how it's done, DRV gets it wrong more often than it should because of its historical use as opposed to judging the merits of an appeal.</p>
<p>Below are the <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion reviews</a> from 1 December 2006 to 15 January 2007. I have pruned out issues of "clear error," speedy restores based on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion policy</a>, and other closures based around them not being DRV issues. Some speedy closures were kept if they were closures based on a process violation.</p>
<p>Reviewed reviews are in bold below the numbered item.</p>

<p>Article was speedy deleted under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">CSD A7</a>. The criteria used to justify deletion was inappropriate for the article in question - also the article documented the forthcoming release of what is in my opinion a notable single (first in three years) by a notable artist. I asked the deleting admin for his reasoning behind the deletion but have received no reply as of yet. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Shaped_Box_3207.html" title="User:Kurt Shaped Box">Kurt Shaped Box</a> 22:14, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<div style="background:#EEFFFF; border:1px solid; padding:1em">:<i><b>G.ho.st</b></i>, prounounced <i>ghost</i>, is an online operating system that provides users with a Virtual Computer space. Ghost is an acronym for Global Hosted Operating SysTem which captures the key idea that the operating system is hosted in a data center and available globaly through any browser, in contrast with traditional operating systems which are installed locally on a specific computer.
<dl>
<dd>The main benefit is complete portability of the operating system - a user can access their desktop, applications and date from any computer with a browser and Internet connection. Another benefit is collaboration - given that everything is online there are increased opportunities for synchronous communication, streaming information, sharing data, applications or even entire desktops.</dd>

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> for now, as a "mention" in The Guardian isn't the sort of susbtantial coverage that passes WP:WEB (and consequently presents verifiable information on which to base an article). We're looking for primary-subject articles here, folks, not mentions. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:19, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> - a passing mention in the Technology section of <i>The Grauniad</i> of a Wiki containing 750 articles is not major press coverage in a Journal of Record; the article also has no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to demonstrate notability. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User_talk%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User talk:(aeropagitica)">(aeropagitica)</a> 23:36, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>GamerWiki does not have "750 articles", as you would see if you were to <a href="http://www.gamerwiki.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gamerwiki.com" rel="nofollow">visit it</a>. I also should clarify what I mean by a "mention" - it was part of a review of videogaming information sites, and as well as the URL had a small writeup on the purpose of the site. You have also ignored the other sources I stated above, being two videogaming magazines in the UK. If deletion stands, then I propose that the vast majority of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Wikis_cf06.html" title="List of Wikis">List of Wikis</a> are also deleted. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim</a> 08:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aye, that's the crux of this: Is Phil's interpretation "solid" enough to overturn the more general consensus on the issue of syndication? I have <i>personally</i> tried on more occasions than I care to count to get the issue made clear, but never with any success. Part of the reason I choose to close this is my involvment, as I can say with some authority that there is no consensus that syndication is sufficient. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 03:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, if 10 people say "not notable," and then one comes along and says "actually, yes it is, based on the widely accepted guidelines," it should be pretty apparent which side is in the right.

My personal feeling is that there does exist space for a definition of "notable" that included <u>something like</u> syndication, but at present it's very poorly defined and we end up falling back on "because I say so" style arguments. These are by definition <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> and prone to creep. If a well-supported consensus can be built that clearly supports the inclusion of syndicates, I'll restore this page in a heartbeat.

<li>Overturn. Aaron should not have closed this, having been heavily involved with the third AfD. However, even without his involvement, serious problems exist with this AfD. First, no new evidence was presented in this AfD that was not considered by previous AfDs. Second, the opinions of the previous AfD were discounted - very few of the 20+ keep votes from the previous AfD participated this time, and their previous opinions and arguments were thus wholly discounted. Beyond that, this AfD is a prime example of the treatment of AfD as a court of infinite appeals where articles can be put up again and again until enough people aren't looking that the desired result is achieved. Meanwhile, great pains have been taken to make it as difficult as possible to undelete articles, including the declaration that DRV is not the exact sort of court of infinite appeals that AfD demonstrably is. Complicating this is an abuse of the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guideline to demand that articles written from primary sources be deleted – something that is not supported by any policy, and has nothing whatsoever to do with reliability. Among the arguments made in the AfD are that the webcomic cannot serve as a source for describing characters and events in the webcomic – a claim that is obviously and transparently not supported by either policy or standard practice in fictional topics. Similar arguments with little relationship to Wikipedia's standard and best practices included the claim that the publisher of Able and Baker, <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>, may be notable, but not everything they publish is (a claim likened to the claim that not every game published by Nintendo is notable, which is flatly untrue). Finally, the AfD was plagued by people with very little understanding of the subject making judgments they were unqualified to make. Despite the claim that AfD is not a vote, these claims were seemingly given equal weight by a clearly biased administrator to the claims of verifiable experts on the subject. Although Wikipedia does not favor experts, that does not and has never meant that their views are put on an equal level with people who neither understand the subject they are making editorial judgments about nor the basic Wikipedia policies surrounding the debate. A final note of grave concern to me - Aaron has used his deletion closure as a declaration that this forms an answer to a long-standing question regarding webcomics and notability - an argument he has long been involved in. It is an egregious abuse of his power to close AfDs to step into an AfD on a topic he has been personally involved in in the past and use the AfD as an occasion to declare his views policy. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 04:53, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'll wear the "heavily involved in third afd" comment, and accept a trout-slapping if the peanut gallery thinks it warranted. I choose to close this afd despite that because I have been actively involved in attempting to <i><b>create</b></i> a consensus on the guideline, and in fact am the person who last raised syndication on talk:web.

<li>Honestly, I don't think the "court of infinite appeals" rant is all that justified in regards to this case. After AfD #3, over a year passed before we saw #4 and #5, and we have seen that <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus can change</a> over such a period of time. (In particular, the much higher demand for reliable third-party sources in recent months) It's not like we've been seeing this pop up at AfD every month or so, like certain other issues. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 05:53, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>. Consensus was pretty clear. The only argument which would actually make sense for overturning seems to be "you aren't qualified to express your opinion", which is absurd. For the rest, you're simply arguing against what people said, which is inappropriate. This isn't an extension of the AfD. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 04:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No - everyone is, of course, welcome to express their opinions on an AfD. And it is the job of the closing admin to disregard opinions that are ill-informed, inconsistent with existing practice, or just plain moronic. This has nothing to do with some notion of free speech, but on the other hand nothing does and nothing should oblige us to count transparently wrong opinions (like that not every game by Nintendo is notable) as equivalent to those of qualified experts. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 05:05, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Part of the idea of Wikipedia is that experts don't get to overrule everyone else by saying they are experts.

<ul>
<li>Yes, but that's not what I'm saying. What I am saying is that experts ought be taken seriously, and their views should not be treated as equivalent to the views of people who show a clear failure to grasp Wikipedia policy or the subject matter. That doesn't mean "expert vote = 10 non-expert votes" or "expert automatically wins all debates." It means a careful and prudent closure of an AfD would give some greater weight to the opinions of an expert and some lesser weight to opinions that do not mesh with existing policy and practice. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 13:52, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Even if you ignore the experts, if we're going to baseit off of consensus, consensus is that WP:WEB is widely accepted as the prevaling guideline for webcomics. Thus, if most of the delete voters are citing non-notability, usually based around WP:WEB, and someone comes around and notes how completely incorrect that argument is, how much weight should each side be given? If 10 people say a squirrel isn't fuzzy, but I point out all the hair on a squirrel, do we say that "even though it's obvious the squirrel has hair, it's not fuzzy?" --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:56, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>GNAA comparisons belie the fact that this AfD contained some of the worst arguments for keeping I've seen in a long time, including GNAA. I might accept "you don't know what you're talking about" (Phil Sandifer's argument, abridged) if the AfD was on some obscure theory of quantum nuclear physics, but this is a webcomic. That is, a story publicly available on the Internet, told in pictures, a format originally designed for people who hadn't yet mastered reading, before it gained mainstream popularity (or possibly before the education system became so dumbed down people started leaving at 18 unable to read, write and add up, but that's a theory for another time). And this is supposed to be a subject that requires some sort of expert knowledge in order to judge an article's worthiness? Where can I get a PhD in Webcomic Appreciation so I can take part in high-powered discussions over whether an article with no reliable sources can be deleted? Does Jason Gastrich's university do one? Can I get life credit for the number of times I've reread Scary Go Round? Ridiculous. AfD properly closed and no new information presented. <b>Endorse deletion</b>. I read a total of 17-20 webcomics, incidentally, depending on whether newspaper-syndicated comics on the Internet count, so I'm not snobbish about them. It just makes me more appreciative of the fact that there is nothing to write about most of them except that they exist, plus the requisite fancruft. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:06, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse</b>. This is difficult because I respect Phil's expertise in this subject area, but the AfD was pretty much unequivocal in deciding that no reliable independent sources have been provided on which to base an article. Of course we can use the originators as a source for minor details, but without a decent body of independent critical review how can we have an article without violating core policy? It is telling that even after five AfDs, a couple of deletions and two deletion reviews, <i>not one single independent source</i> was cited in the article. 100% of the references were back to the originator's website. Ultimately, if this has not been the primary subject of non-trivial coverage in reliable sources independent of its creators, it fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which is mainly an expression of the likelihood of being able to satisfy and verify the core policies of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<li><b>Overturn</b> and do not relist, just <b>keep</b>. The current state of affairs with webcomics throws out too many comics that are significant. (at 600+ episodes that's significant right there) The guidelines need to be broadened and the requirement for secondary sources outside of the syndicator dumped or softened. Over in the music arena, a band gets transferrable notability if its work is on a major label. Not as much notability as the label itself, but if the label is major enough, every band is notable enough to warrant an article. The same principle should apply here, Dayfree Press is major enough (we have an academic telling us so) to warrant retention of every comic it hosts. Why? Dayfree Press editors are well respected enough in the webcomics world to make notable judgements about what is and isn't notable. IF WP had only room for 10,000 articles, that might be different, but the notabily standards in this area need to be relaxed enough to allow this comic to pass, since WP has room for many more than that, and since it has room for many more articles in other areas (that's not a "they need to go" nor is it a "but they get to stay, no fair" it's an example of where notability standards are at, and rightly so, for other topic areas) <i>Nota bene, I think Aaron closed this and then DRV'ed it right away for a good reason, to help drive critical thought here, his DRV's have the virtue of being thorough presentations of the relevant material and (dare I say it) of attracting wider audiences.</i> ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, that's not what NOR is, and it never has been what NOR is.

<dd>600 episodes isn't significant, it's merely long. Achieving notability in the arts generally requires talent and/or luck (usually a combination of the two), which eventually is rewarded by the attention of reliable sources. Making 600 webcomics just requires persistence. You might even go so far as to say that a comic that's been around for 600 episodes and hasn't attracted any attention that we can cite as a source is probably less likely to be notable than one that's been around for less time. You can't exactly say that it's too new and fresh to have gotten the attention it deserves.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> What we are looking for is published, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> independent of the forum/organization/its owners/its publishers that are <i>primarily about</i> this forum. (Mentioning in passing or using as a source themselves is not enough.) Wikipedia is an an encyclopedia, so it is a tertiary source covering topics of significance, not a publisher of original research. As such, we can't rely solely on primary sources, we need secondary sources. They need to be published so that our readers can verify what we say. Some of them need to be independent so that we can adhere to the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">policy requiring a neutral point of view</a>. I see from your contribution history that you are a long standing contributor that wasn't active much in the second half of 2006. Following the Wikimania conference this summer, there has been a major culture shift on the importance of sourcing. Levels of sourcing previously thought to be good enough to keep and expect the article to get better some day are now insufficient to prevent the deletion of articles.</dd>
<dd>Arguments based on the presence of another article carry no weight; see <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EInclusion_is_not_an_indicator_of_notability_abaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability">Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a> for the long explanation of why. Similarly, arguments based on the absence of another article carry little weight - unless it can also be shown when and why that article was deleted, we may just never have had that article or the topic may be covered at a different title.</dd>

<p>The article was resubmitted with different content to satisfy the established requirements for notability. The original article was created by someone else as a stub, apparently based on the subject being a candidate for public office in the upcoming 2006 election. Although one can understand that after the subject has been a candidate and not won his level of notability might cease to qualify him for inclusion, there are many other notability criteria the subject does satisfy, which can be easily verified by a web search. For example, he has been the subject of a chapter of a book written by a prominent journalist, Jonathan Karl, then a reporter for the <i>New York Post</i>, later a correspondent for CNN, and currently a frequent on-air reporter for ABC News.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the subject has a prominence based on his work as editor of the digital editions of most of the more important works of constitutional history, law, and government, including most of the works of the Founders, the works they read and cited, and commentaries by their contemporaries. These online editions are not mere copies of work done by others. They are authoritative scholarly edits (some in progress) that have caused others to cite those versions as authoritative, and in some cases, unique. Most of the other copies online of these works began as copies of his work, often without attribution. That work has led to the site being linked to by many other sites, which has put the site at or near the top of search engines, and led to recognition as a leading constitutional scholar, evidence by being invited to write articles for encyclopedias, speak to conferences, and submit articles to various journals.</p>
<p>It is suggested that on future deletion reviews, the subject be contacted and afforded an opportunity to respond to arguments for deletion. That was easily done for the subject here discussed, and was not done. The reviewers should also take the time to do a search on the name, which would have yielded abundant material to support notability, or to follow the links provided by the contributors, which often provide justification by reference that are not repeated in the body of the article, in an effort to keep the article concise.

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> per above; even nomination for review sounds like a vanity page. Furthermore, I find the suggestion that living persons are somehow inherently more notable than deceased persons laughable. Mr. Roland had ample opportunity to provide multiple reliable sources for his claimed notability, which he failed to do, choosing instead to make circular arguments on AfD and here.--<b><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClawson_a883.html" title="User:Clawson">chris.</a><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClawson_988f.html" title="User talk:Clawson">lawson</a></b> 00:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I protest the statement that I have had ample opportunity to provide multiple reliable sources for "notability". I don't keep scapbooks of such things. I selected one that came to mind, and was by someone the administrators are likely to have seen on television. I don't have long periods of time to add content in response to such demands, but must find time between other projects. Yet you consider a few hours since I added that content as "ample opportunity"? I can and will add additional sources when I find them, but that could take several days or weeks. Further, nowhere did I suggest that living persons are more notable than dead ones. I never discussed anything like that anywhere. My scholarly work is all about bringing to the public the works of notable persons, most of whom have been dead for centuries. I am loathe to assert my own "notability", preferring to let my work speak for itself, but when someone creates the article as a stub, and many people discover it and ask for content, then they tell me it has been deleted, I feel a need to set the historical record straight. It is not about "Jon Roland" but his work and the work of others in the Constitution Society. Unfortunately, the tendency of too many people to argue from authority rather than considering work on its own merits is difficult to escape. Dismissing the worker disrespects the work, in this environment. I also object to the summary deletion of the article on the Constitution Society, which it appears is somehow related to this action by the administators. The Constitution Society is a real organization with real members and real activities, the evidence of which is online for anyone to examine. More people read its materials than read all the textbooks in all the lawschools, and its influence is real. That has to count for something unless there is an ideological agenda at work here. Jon Roland 01:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "ideological agenda" is that articles must be about subjects which are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, and all content in them should be verified by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. If you can bring quite a few sources to bear in several weeks, then recreate the article, with those sources cited, in several weeks, and it will likely do just fine! You may want to note, however, that we do offer some <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">cautions</a> for those writing articles about oneself or a subject very close to oneself-it's very difficult to remain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> in such a situation. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 01:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Okay. With some interaction of this kind I may get a sense of the standards you are applying as you understand them, something that does not really come across by merely reading your guidance documents. For example, you now seem to say that "all" content must be verified by those "reliable sources". That goes well beyond your guide documents, which only seem to require validation of notability by a third party, not all content in the article. That is a very severe requirement. I don't know many scholars who could get affidavits that they did all the work of editing a historical writing, much less of all the other things they do of importance. They don't always have witnesses. They just do the work, publish it, and readers review their work and decide for themselves how well it was done. It is not as though there is anyone else who is suspected of doing the work. And what is the validation that the work was done according to scholarly standards? Cites in other works, or by other sites, with favorable comments, of course, but much work of that kind can be available for years before anyone comments on it, other than to make use of it for his own work. There are fashions in history that lead its practitioners to exhibit herd behavior and focus on hot topics to the neglect of those that others might consider more important in the longer term. But being out of fashion does not invalidate the merit of the work. That should always be evaluated on its own merits, not on who does it, or or what others say about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for verification, what is so difficult about just going online and reading it? It might be more fun to try to find it on a library shelf, but in the age of the Internet online publication is displacing paper publication, which is no longer the sole standard for credibility. Yes, I still write articles for print publications, mainly because I get paid for it, but frankly I almost never read the printed editions. I read the copies online. And I suspect, so do increasing numbers of others.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One more point: If it is your intent to allow deficiencies to be corrected (even if you don't take the time to notify the submitter of such deficiencies to give him a chance to do so), then how is he supposed to correct deficiencies if there is no article he can edit or his submissions are blocked by a protected status? I can understand if the hassles of administering a site like Wikipedia make you somewhat impatient and disposes you to make summary decisions, but there comes a point beyond which impatience becomes abusive. I have been intervening in several cases against judges who, perhaps in a mood of impatience, have been riding roughshod over due process protections and the rules of judicial procedure and conduct. Become too arbitrary and the public is going to start rejecting Wikipedia the way they are beginning to reject the justice system. Jon Roland 02:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which is why we have review processes, as you are currently using.&#160;:) However, a judge is hardly "arbitrary" to say "Hey, in order to work with your claim, I need to see some evidence." It's the same when we request sources-we want our readers to be able to see that what they're reading in our articles is, in fact, true. We also want to see that there's enough source material out there on a subject that we can have a good, comprehensive article on it, from verifiable information. If it'll take you a few weeks to find those sources, come back in a few weeks with them! No one's out to get anyone, but just like anything, we do have some rules, and we try to follow them. One of those involves recreating articles after they've been deleted-it's possible, no decision here is forever, but there's got to be some evidence that it'll be <i>better</i> then it was when the community decided it should be deleted. That's not arbitrary-indeed, what would be arbitrary is to allow someone to recreate the same article over and over <i>against</i> the community's expressed wish, with no way of allowing the community to have input on whether the old decision should be reconsidered. Surely, as an attorney, you do realize that such review processes are quite important, and not always instantaneous? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 02:20, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A judge, however, if he follows established due process, rules of judicial procedure, and precedent, will set a date and time for an evidentiary hearing. He doesn't just render judgment <i>sua sponte</i> and without due notice. It is now clear that I am going to have to maintain copies of the edit windows for things I submit so I have something to work from in making revisions and resubmitting. But I can imagine most people don't come to this realization until they have been burned in this way. If, as you say, I can resubmit when corrections are made, how am I supposed to make them if the article is blocked? Or if the revised version is summarily deleted again, within seconds, apparently without the revisions having gotten due consideration? And do you ever allow for some reasonable grace period on the creation of new articles, to allow time for them to be composed carefully, and the content you demand be added at a leisurely pace that most of the world operates by when they have other demands on their time? Why not allow the author to finish his edits before deleting the article? If he has the article open for editing (and you have the ability to detect that condition, which a good revision control system has), that should be a clue he is still working on it.</dd>

<p>One of you has already aknowledged I have one, the book by Jonathan Karl, who devotes a chapter to me, and who, besides being a correspondent for ABC News, has credentials as a historian in his own right. He is notable enough to have an article of his own, although I don't know him well enough to write it. He has interviewed me by phone and on television, but I didn't have much time to ask about him.Jon Roland 03:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't really matter to me what "one of us" has done; we are not a homogenous entity. Regardless, even if you had such a chapter, I would still endorse deletion, because that's not enough to establish notability, nor to verify article content. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 03:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, but it does indicate you are making hasty decisions and not even reading either the submissions or the comments carefully. Those of you who have volunteered to be administrators are to be commended for your willingness to do so, but whether you buy into the fact or not, you are actually operating in a judicial role in a private law arena, and as such, the rest of the community has a right to expect proper judicial conduct from you. I would hate to see the Wikipedia experiment dissolve into contention in real courts over property rights in the articles about living people or organizations, defamation, neglect, or historical inaccuracy. None of us want that. But if you neglect to practice your judgment like good judges, that could happen. If you were editors of a private publication, only the publisher would have to be concerned about that, but when you create a kind of public utility or commons that has a real impact of the lives and fortunes of people, that situation changes. No academic department or law review journal could be as arbitrary as some of you have been today. A little collegiality would go a long way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is also a problem with verifying "all content". Not all important subjects are investigated by large numbers of people. Some, especially in the early stages, are known only to a single investigator. For example, I have done significant research on letters of marque and reprisal. You have a somewhat deficient article on "Letter of Marque" that I contemplate correcting. However, there is almost no publshed scholarly literature on the subject, and I suspect at this point I may be the world's leading expert. Am I barred from adding my findings because there is no one else to verify them? Yet it is the one measure which might have made the incursion into Afghanistan constitutional, which I at least consider important. Yet when I asked a deputy to the U.S. Attorney General, charged with managing the legal issues involved in that engagement, to explain the topic, he admitted he didn't know anything about it. This was a nominee to the the federal bench parked in the AG's office pending Senate hearings, and he not only knew nothing about a critical subject in his area of responsbility, he disdained learning anything about it. That is the way we get the public officials whose decisions affect our lives! But the topic is also not fashionable in academia, so getting an article published in a professional journal is unlikely. Self-publication is the only option. That doesn't mean it lacks validity. It just puts the burden of verifying on the reader. Jon Roland 03:57, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As to letters of marque-how, exactly, did you do research <i>without</i> looking at reliable sources? If you did primary research, that's great! <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> the place to first publish your research, but once it's published in peer-reviewed historical journals, it is absolutely reliable and suitable to cite as a source. Your contention of "property rights" is fallacious-<i>all</i> contributors agree to contribute under the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GFDL</a> whenever they make a submission, and that's clearly stated on the edit page. This means they <i>specifically</i> grant to everyone permission to edit their work. As to defamation, we have <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">clear guidelines</a> in place about that-and avoiding defamation is the <i>exact reason</i> we require sources, and are especially strict on requiring sources when a living person is involved! As to "neglect"-a private website is not <i>required</i> to list information on anyone or anything, and may delete information hosted on its servers entirely at will (unless paying customers are promised other terms, which is not the case here). Surely you're aware of this, as you do claim to be an attorney? As to self-publication, you're welcome to do that. On a privately-hosted website. On Myspace. On any website which will allow you to do so. In a self-published book. However else you can find. But <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">this is not</a> such a website, and confirmation in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, when publishing on Wikipedia, is <i>not negotiable</i>. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 04:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>To respond to your first point above, I mainly work with primary sources. In many cases they are single copies of old documents that will never be seen by any but a few scholars until I scan, OCR, correct, and publish them on the constitution.org website. My reputation as a legal historian is largely based on that kind of work. Like any historian I will then typically analyze the content of that and other works and draw conclusions. That is what you would call original research that you maintain Wikipedia is not the place to publish, but there is an important difference: Whereas most other analyses discuss primary evidence, they typically do not <i>present</i> the evidence for immediate examination. I do. The reader can examine the same evidence I did and come to his own conclusions from it. However, I do bring one more thing to the table: I did that kind of analysis for literally thousands of other works, probably more than any scholar will ever be able to read, unless he starts early and doesn't waste much time over decades. That can produce insights that don't come out by reading a few passages lifted out of a text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Consider the subject of Letters of Marque and Reprisal (it is important not to omit reprisal). Then I find a statement that letters of marque and reprisal may only be issued to private parties. Even my colleague, Doug Kmiec, testified to that effect before Congress. The problem is, that's wrong! As it happened, almost all the letters of marque and reprisal were issued to privateers, because in a world of monarchs who may declare war on their own authority, there is no need to issue them to officers of the Royal Navy. But there is nothing in the theory of the letter of marque and reprisal, a kind of warrant, that restricts the issuance of them to private parties, just as there is nothing in the theory of search and arrest warrants that restricts the issuance of them to law enforcement agents. (I once almost had a search warrant issued to me as a private citizen because the local sheriff didn't want to serve it on a prominent citizen.) But you won't find a pithy citation on that point. You get it from gaining a deep insight into law as the Founders understood it, but because they took the fundamentals for granted, never really explained in concise ways that we could cite today.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So my problem is, I've found an error, and a serious one, and I am the only expert available to refute it, based on my primary source research. It's not that my research is inaccessible to others. I have tried to make it all available online, but the insights are not expressed in quotable quips. It takes total immersion in the subject. I've done that, and so can anyone else, but I have done it and they are unlikely to. I can cite the authority for my position, but that is a huge body of material that cannot be reduced to a single, short passage, except by my finding about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why is it a serious error? Because the issuance by Congress of letters of marque and reprisal was the one way Congress had to comply with the Constitution concerning the incursion into Afghanistan. Now, I grant that not many people today care about strict constitutional compliance, until it is violated against them, but it is my general conclusion from the study of history that strict constitutional compliance is one of the most important things in human affairs. That itself is not a position I can support with "reliable" sources, because anyone may cite other "reliable sources" that take the opposite position. Ultimately, it comes down to personal choice. But if someone who made one choice grabs the podium, and no one challenges him, his position can come to be seen, mistakenly, as some kind of irrefutable truth rather than as disputable and disputed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the legal points you make, I am familiar with them, but I also know that what is provided for in GFDL licenses and other accession contracts is for a civilized world that bears little resemblance to what actually happens in courts, where, as the old saying goes, "A good lawyer knows the law; a great lawyer knows the judge." There is a reason why Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones, in a talk to the Harvard Federalist Society in 2003, said that the "American legal system is corrupt beyond recognition". If some lawyer smells money you may find your GFDL resembling Madison's "parchment barrier". I fight that corruption every day. It is the reason I don't seek a bar card, because honest lawyers are not allowed to challenge corrupt judges and prosecutors.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not just contributors who may have a justiable interest in what is published on the site. Consider the revelation of sensitive information about someone else than the contributor. Information needed to steal his identity, for example. Or revelation of the location of a protected witness, or of a whistleblower for whom it is the government that is the threat. The possibilities for "when did he stop beating his wife" aspersions are endless. In the words of Cardinal Richelieu, "Give me six lines written by the most honourable of men, and I will find an excuse in them to hang him."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now I'm not saying one has to make business or editorial decisions on the basis of that corruption, but don't be surprised if it rears up and bites you. "Know everything, believe nothing, and be ready for anything." (And hide your assets.) Jon Roland 07:09, 17 January 2007</dd>

<dd>What I got out of all that:
<ol>
<li>I shouldn't have to verify everything because it might be new stuff that only I know.</li>
<li>I shouldn't have to provide secondary sources because I'm gonna give you the primary sources for analysis.</li>
</ol>

<dd>No, I am not arguing for special treatment of myself. In all of the above I have been arguing for equal treatment of everyone. I am not important. If I could have my work attributed to "anonymous" that would be fine with me. I once considered doing that, but it doesn't work. People demand to know who did the work, if only to tie the work together to a single author or editor. It is the work, not the worker, that matters. But I am also saying that you are not applying your own standards consistently or even-handedly, or in a way that gives the submitter a reasonable opportunity to respond to demands from editors. I have spent many hours responding to the demands of print editors for more cites, especially of law review articles, where editors seem to feel that one key cite is not enough, but want everything found in "shepardizing" the case, which can result in more footnotes than anyone who reads the article really wants, and cuts into the word limits for the article as a whole. We usually negotiate a compromise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have been taking a tour of many articles of interest to me, and I have not found a single article of any length in which <i>everything</i> is verified. Each of them, like the articles in any print encyclopedia, are a mixture of fact and opinion, some of that of professional grade and some of it not, with perhaps some cites that support some or many points, but not all of them. When I turn to the talk sessions involving changes to the articles, I do not find the discussants applying those standards consistently to themselves or one another, or exhibiting a level of subject-matter expertise that makes their comments a "peer review". I am familiar with the peer review standards of professional journals, and the lesser review standards of law review journals (3rd-year law students who have a lot to learn). My print editors don't even aspire to the standards you claim to uphold. They are content to look at the body of work of those they ask to submit articles, spot check their work, find what they examine to be reliable, and form the general opinion that the rest of the author's work is probably also reliable. That is a leap, given that print encyclopedias and journals can't be corrected as online publications can, but they do so in the recognition that corrections can be made in subsequent editions, or in the case of professional journals, that others will submit articles that challenge the findings of earlier ones. Many of my print article commissions are to correct articles written by others that have come under criticism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have also not responded to my questions. How do we resubmit articles to satisfy your demands when the article is blocked, as someone has done for the Constitution Society article? I see many other articles for other organizations in the field that are very similar to the version I last tried to submit. Indeed, mine was modeled on some of the others. None of the organizations I looked at had any third-party verifications of their notability. I do not see the same standards being applied to articles on organizations that you are applying to articles on individuals. Nor do I think that would be appropriate. It can't be numbers of voting members. That would probably exclude the Republican and Democratic National Committees, the only formal organizations for their parties with voting powers, organized as nonincorporated associations. Many important organizations are "private foundations" under IRS definitions, others are "public foundations" with self-appointing boards who have the only voting powers. A more reasonable way to assess notability, for individuals or organizations, would be to put up an article and count the numbers of page visits over some period of time, then give extra weight to some deemed notable by peers in their field. After all, 18th century legal philosophers are not going to get as many hits as rock stars, but those of us in that field can better assess their importance to the development of legal thought.Jon Roland 16:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jon, the solution here is pretty simple. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">Cite</a> third-party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (scholarly legal journals, major media outlets) that have covered you and your work and no one here will contest their validity or notability. If you can do that, which ought to be a fairly simple task, it will be quite easy to get the articles in question restored. If you <i>cannot</i> cite such third-party sources, you have no argument, period.--<b><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClawson_a883.html" title="User:Clawson">chris.</a><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClawson_988f.html" title="User talk:Clawson">lawson</a></b> 18:04, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The previous AfD contained no arguments for inclusion, and any admin who understands policy (hopefully all of them) would have closed it as 'delete' nowadays, or have their close overturned here. We're talking about shoving an article onto AfD whose entire prose content was <i>"A Doemain of Our Own is a webcomic by Susan Rankin, regarding the lives of an anthropomorphic deer and her friends"</i>.

<li>I disagree, and <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">nothing can be "established in previous deletion discussions."</a>. WP:WEB certainly doesn't reflect that, nor did a discussion on the talk page gain consensus for such an extension. As Keenspot is "a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators" of the comic, assertions that a comic is hosted there should preclude any speedies. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>This redirect pointed at <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidiary_Alliance_c45a.html" title="Subsidiary Alliance">Subsidiary Alliance</a> and was deleted at <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a>. See the RfD log from <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_Log_2007_January_6_ee92.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2007 January 6">6 January 2007</a> for the discussion. Now, looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Subsidiary_Alliance&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Subsidiary_Alliance&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> of the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidiary_Alliance_c45a.html" title="Subsidiary Alliance">Subsidiary Alliance</a> article, someone obviously made the typo confirming that it is a plausible typo—in fact, someone also had made the typo <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidairy_allaince.html" title="Subsidairy allaince">Subsidairy allaince</a> which still exists. So that refutes the delete suggestions of the nominator and two of the five editors in favour of deletion who based their opinion on the fact that it's an unlikely typo. The other three who moved to delete this article relied on the comment "<i>Seeing as how the main article isn't goin got be hanging around, no need for the redirect.</i>" This is not only poor practise, but the target will likely be merged into <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidiary_alliance.html" title="Subsidiary alliance">subsidiary alliance</a> which is a more developed article and is not nominated for deletion. In my eyes the delete arguements are not sufficient and I suggest recreation of this redirect with <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidiary_alliance.html" title="Subsidiary alliance">subsidiary alliance</a> as its target. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 03:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Consensus on the deletion of this article only applies to a former article under the name of "<i>Carrion Fields</i>". "<i>The Carrion Fields (MUD)</i>" article was re-written specifically to address the problems that led to the deletion of the "<i>Carrion Fields</i>" article in 2005. Yet "<i>The Carrion Fields (MUD)</i>" was deleted for the same reasons as the "<i>Carrion Fields</i>" article was. The consensus reached in 2005 only applies to the "<i>Carrion Fields</i>" article, not to the "<i>The Carrion Fields (MUD)</i>" article. A request for prompt reinstatement is subsequently being made. 84.192.125.204 18:29, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I am rather new to Wikipedia, am not very familiar with its guidelines, and have been welcomed by having hours of work arbitrarily deleted in my face without prior notice or explanation from anyone. But this is completely besides the point of course. Are you basically saying I first need to link to for example references from websites such a TopMudSites which discuss this particular mud and the impact it has made on the mudding community at large over the (many) years? 84.192.125.204 18:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is quite amazing to see how a new user is virtually treated as a type of criminal for merely trying to save hours worth of editing to an article he wrote in good faith for this website. I am definitely drawing a number of conclusions from this, and the majority of them are not positive. As it is, could the article at least be reinstated for a brief period to 'see if G4 is valid', so I can at least make a notepad copy of the content should I ever be able to meet these guidelines at some point in the future? Or, could you please copy the full content of The Carrion Fields (MUD) article's edit page in a notepad, and send this to arvidii@hotmail.com through attachment? I would hope that there actually exists at least one administrator on this entire website who is capable of showing a hint of a benign and helpful attitude towards a newcommer. 84.192.125.204 19:10, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Endorse Deletion</b> a MUD would have to be something pretty special to get an article, and while longevity <i>is</i> worth something, it's not enough by itself. If everything 13 years old got an article, we'd have one for any number of hot-dog stands, diners, and truck stops, not to mention one for every high-school student! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:03, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I personally don't see how <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaea%2C_Dreams_of_Divine_Lands_034d.html" title="Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands">Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands</a> is in any way more notable than one of the oldest still running muds on the internet such as The Carrion Fields, yet its article not only continues to exist but is in fact being protected by an administrator.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Just to get this clear, I'm not 84.192.125.204(mind getting a nick?), however I totally agree with his point. Being the editor of the <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaea_%28MUD%29_ed8d.html" title="Achaea (MUD)">Achaea (MUD)</a> for over a year now(feel free to check) and being generally aware of the situation, I cannot see any other reason for the deletion of the Carrion Fields article other than lack of understanding of the matter amoung the admins or somebody being crooked in here. Facts are: 1.) Achaea and Carrion are both MUDS. 2.) They are of the same age. 3.) They are both always in the top five of the TopMudSites(the only possible resource for a MUDs notability). 4.) The number of players online is in the same range for both MUDs. These four points are virtually what those MUDs can be described by. The big difference is that CarrionF is a MUD with is run for free, while Achaea is a commercial organisation which has the funds to pay for the advertisements. For an encyclopedia this should not make a difference.</li>
<li>Now sunshines, if you want notability in shiny neon-lights go to a Robbie Williams concert. If you're speaking about a subset of a smaller unit, adjust your proportions. Example: Music - everybody listen to it, subset(Bob Marley or whoever) - a very large number of people need to listen to it. If you take a village of 50000 men with one band, it'll be notable there, however 50000 compared to 6 billion is a very small number. Now to MUDs. If you only have say 2 million people having a solid idea of what MUDs are, having 80 000 people knowing what Achaea or CF is, is more than enough to make it notable.</li>
<li>CF is notable and personally I don't see how the article for the general idea of MUDs, which is by the way 100% useless to 99,9998% of this planet, is more significant than that of CF, which is also quite useless to the general population. People who play MUDs, a "significant" group, know CF as they know Achaea or any other "notable" MUD. People who don't play them are simply clueless on this matter. Now the guys deleting it were both clueless and ignorant of the regulations. Just as easily as that I can start deleting articles about the species of pinguins in the rainforest, cause they have no notability to me or any of my fellows. The individuals responsible for the deletion should have their admin status overlooked at once AND revert the removal process. Now, either you delete ALL articles about MUDs or you do us all a favour and place one of the most played text based games on net back into your article directory. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxgrin_481e.html" title="User:Maxgrin">~~MaxGrin</a> 23:23, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak endorse deletion</b> While the content of the articles is different, the relevant issues are not. The additional content in the new article does not include references to published sources that are independent and reliable. It consisted of detailed information about game features.

I wouldn't object to overturning and listing at AFD, but I expect that at AFD it would be deleted. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:55, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is a free encyclopedia which has the slogan “be useful” in its first lines. What do you need (technically, e.g. 5 admins voting or whatsoever?) for it to get re-posted?

<li>You're misunderstanding how the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion</a> system works; if an A7 was declined, it only means that the article includes a claim of notability, not that it was "approved as notable". Determining whether or not the claim of notability is valid under policy is what <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a> is for. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 08:17, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all, my apologies, seems like I was wrong on certain matters. The article is quite different from an encyclopaedia entry and probably deserved its end. Thanks everybody for your help and please excuse the trouble caused (deletions are not exactly my strongpoint). However, it seems that the reason for the deletion was the respectable article being an advert rather than lack of notability. It’s notable, but the commercial structure had to be removed. May I suggest undeletion and trimming down to major facts with citations? I believe this would be a reasonable solution to the problem. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxgrin_481e.html" title="User:Maxgrin">~~MaxGrin</a> 11:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Once again, the source is the international high circulation periodical "Stuff Magazine" April 2003 issue, page 38 where he is reviewed and acknowledged. Also, music is avaliable on itunes. Also, the artist is referenced on wikiquote. Also, internet phenomenon is evidenced by nearly 2 million web hits and google rankings. What more notability do you want me to provide to convince you that this should not have been deleted without fair discussion and valid reason?

<li>Are you seriously suggesting that Stuff Magazine is not a mainstream magazine. It is on every newstand and at every bookstore with high circulation in the U.S. and U.K. It is a sister magazine to Maxim Magazine. As for a newspaper, I also have also already given one of those, the Colorado Daily, from Thursday, June 12, 2003. I just don't understand what you are getting at, you are asking me for things I have already provided, and then calling them unreliable. I get the feeling that I am being held to an impossible standard to prove notability here. How can a newspaper and Stuff Magazine not be considered reliable independant sources?

<li>I apologise, but I am indeed a newbie and I am trying to learn as I go, so please forgive my ignorance. It would be a little more encouraging for new users if they were assisted in a polite way instead of having there work deleted with no discussion, and then having to defend themselves to seemingly inpatient and sometimes sarcastic experienced users. I did reading before I contributied, butyou can't expect a new user to know everything. I'm just trying to contribute a page for an internet phenomenon and I do not understand why it is deleted? Perhaps you could be so kind as to explain to me which of the criteria the article violated that caused it to be immediatley deleted, with no nomination or discussion because I read the page and I don't understand?<a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJellonuts_42f3.html" title="User:Jellonuts">Jellonuts</a> 01:08, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>We get thousands of new articles a day, most of them not keepable. Realistically, it would be impossible to hold drawn-out discussions on all of them.

<li>To quote G4 "Before deleting again, the admin should ensure that the material is substantially identical and not merely a new article on the same subject" It was not substantially identical at all and it was a new article on the same subject that, unlike the original deleted article judging from the original AfD discussion, conforms to wiki standards, so again, I ask, which policy did the article violate?<a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJellonuts_42f3.html" title="User:Jellonuts">Jellonuts</a> 01:55, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have updated the page and supplied all of the references and image tags. I am requesting one more time, after all this work, that the block be lifted so that I can replace the page with the new one. Then, if you don't like it you can nominate it for AfD and go through the discussion process rather than tyrannically deleting it without a discussion. I have satisfied the notability requirements, even if newspapers and national magazines are not good enough for YOU, they are good enough for wikipedia requirements and notability is specifically supposed to NOT be a subjective criteria.

I tried to make a contribution in good faith, I have no alterior motives. I was just making an article about this internet celebrity rapper guy that I came across. I am apparently either very ignorant, or I am being held to an impossible standard. You people are very discouraging to a new contributor acting in good faith, it's a wonder anyone bothers using their time to contribute. I work on this page, then it gets deleted without ANY discussion. I talk to that ADM, who tells me to provide a source and s/he will replace it. I do this, and s/he ignores me. I come here to deletion review, and a few people agree. Those who do not request things like "mention in a magazine and a newspaper." I provide you with EXACTLY that, and then you tell me the very thing you requested in not good enough. I am told by one ADM to recreate the page in my user space, so I spend the time doing that, and then a different admin deletes things there because I am apparently not supposed to have images and whatnot in my user space. Why don't you assist people like me to improve their contributions rather than taking on an offensive to delete the contribution, and worse yet, drive the contributor away by fighting against them instead of helping them?</li>

How do you "self-publish" in Stuff Magazine, or the Colorado Daily Newspaper? You know what, I've spent too much of my time on this. I tried to contribute, and it is obvious neither I nor my contributions are wanted here. I am tired of being judged and wasting my time on an article that obviously nobody wants on their wikipedia. Judge me because I have spent all my time on THIS article lately? Well, my time is important and if I did not have to spend all my time fighting against people who would rather throw any technicallity they can at me rather than help me learn, then maybe I would have time to contribute to other articles. Do whatever you want! I'm frustrated and I'm done. I truly hope you treat future new users with fair intentions better than I've been treated. If you make us all feel unwelcome and drivien away, wikipedia will not work as it was intended. You lost an educated and well-intentioned contributor today, and for what? Is wikipedia better off now without this article? How? You may think so, but I think not. There was an entry here about a silly rapper guy who has a weird cult fan following, odd but noteable. Granted, not on MTV or Time Magazine, but among many people and among several independant, reliable, highly circulated sources. (I can't believe you don't consider Stuff Magazine a mainstream publication? You better delete Stuff's wiki article too becasue it is not notable, right?) Now, it is deleted and anyone who ever wanted to seek information about it on wikipedia is SOL, and I am discouraged and disappointed. Congratulations, you win, but the wikipedia project loses. <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJellonuts_42f3.html" title="User:Jellonuts">Jellonuts</a> 00:01, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>As pointed out earlier, Chris Sullo is not the <i>primary subject</i> of these multiple non-trivial published works. <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikto_Web_Scanner_9996.html" title="Nikto Web Scanner">Nikto Web Scanner</a> has already got an article of its own, and it mentions that Chris Sullo is the author. That's fair enough, in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJyothisingh_3ee3.html" title="User:Jyothisingh">Jyothisingh</a> 14:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Relist</b> As a matter of rhetoric, the <i>fairness</i> argument is woefully weak. It has already been conceded that Chris Sullo was not the <i>primary</i> subject of the above referenced works, however that is not the sole guideline wikipedia has established for deletion and the entry did meet other criteria. While deletion may be fair in the opinion of many, the argument lacks adherence to the deletion guidelines. For one, fairness, is not a guideline. If it were, then there would be several other biographies that are ripe for deletion --- you know, in the interest of fairness ---- for the subjects of those biographies do not have non-trivial works solely written about them. I don't even disagree that it is a fair consequence, I just don't see where fairness is of relevance. Alternatively, one could modify the guidelines to include <i>because it seems fair</i> as a valid reason for deletion... or perhaps, modify the guidelines to state that should there be no evidence of non-trivial published works written solely in reference to the subject of the biography, the biography should be deleted in favor of the page referencing the contribution itself (in this case the Nikto web scanner). At this time, that is not a guideline, so this biography does not meet the criteria for deletion. Another reasonable course of action would be to reach out to other leaders and innovators in the security industry whose biographies are noted in wikipedia and consider their opinion as to whether or not the subject of this article is indeed notable and worthy of his own biography. Their opinions should be considered a stronger litmus test than those l who have little if any knowledge in the field. (JaneEleanor 02:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC))</li>

<li>In the midst of this discussion, someone presumably involved in this discussion has gone into the article for Garmin G1000 and tried to edit it to assert that Mindstar is the publisher of THE Garmin G1000, when in fact, Mindstar is the publisher of a SIMULATION of the Garmin G1000 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. If my postings here about the stated products are not worthy of Wikipedia in some way, that's fine, but now it appears someone had, on my behalf, edited the wiki for Garmin and asserts information about Mindstar that isn't accurate. The problem is becoming compounded. I have corrected the Garmin wiki to remove the incorrect information, and I will refrain from any further postings until we hear a final resolution to the discussion about my deleted postings.

<p>INAPPROPRIATELY_DELETED <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaybregman_dbf7.html" title="User:Jaybregman">Jaybregman</a> 01:46, 14 January 2007 (UTC) I believe the administrator <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">steel359</a> acted innapropriately in using a speedy delete on this article on the basis of "blatant advertising". This page provides factual information on our company, and although the company is the subject of the article I do not believe it could by any stretch be categorised as "blatant advertising" (and would challenge anyone who believes this to indicate the specific reasons with reference to the text of the article--available here <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060321051648/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECourier" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060321051648/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECourier" rel="nofollow">Internet Archive Link</a>. I was shocked to see that the article was summarily deleted some months ago without our knowledge. The article had been reviewed by other admins (I even requested page protection at one point), which begs the question why if there was consensus the article was innapropriate this was not raised earlier. The admin in question could and should--if he actually believed the article was "blatant advertising" have posted on the discussion page and informed us. This would have led to the discussion being held in the open, for all to see. It took me quite a while to see why the page had been deleted--it was just gone. This behaviour betrays the key principles of openess and the freedom of information exchange on which Wikipedia was founded and which continues to make it special. I have posted on <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">steel359</a>'s talk page to this effect, also requesting an apology for his conduct. I believe it would be wise to review the criteria for speedy deletion and that <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">steel359</a>'s judgement and conduct ought to be carefully reviewed in light of the above. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaybregman_dbf7.html" title="User:Jaybregman">Jaybregman</a> 01:46, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes it is a contested speedy--if it should not be here where should it go? The article says to leave a message on your talk page which was done and to appeal here if refused, which is how I take your response. Do you really think "I am not going to entertain this any further" is appropriate when the topic of discussion is summarily deleting information without discussion?</p>

<li><b>Endorse speedy deletion</b> The article was written as an advertisement. It was therefore completely appropriate to delete it under <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#G11" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11</a>. Given the references found in the most recent post, it probably is possible to write an article with a chance of surviving AFD. Best bet is for someone who knows nothing about the company to do so, in accordance with the guidance at <a href="../../../a/m/n/Wikipedia%7EAmnesia_test_8aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Amnesia test">Wikipedia:Amnesia test</a>. The nominator here used the phrase "our company", so they need to read and take to heart <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>. It is almost never a good idea for someone to write about their own company; Wikipedia is normally better off without any article on a company than with an article written by someone who has a conflict of interest. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 04:42, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> and throw in my hat to say that the behavior of Jaybregman here is completely inappropriate. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 07:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have read the Conflict of Interest guidelines thoroughly and I think we all need to step back and remember a few points here. First, I don't believe I did write the original article, I just edited it (please could an admin check this and post). Second, the COI guidelines make very clear that although editing an article in which you have an interest should be avoided, it is not forbidden and if your interest is declared and the SUBSTANCE of your edits are fair, there is no problem. "All text created in the Wikipedia main namespace is subject to rules covering criteria for articles (what Wikipedia is not); encyclopedic quality (verifiability and original research); editorial approach (neutral point of view); as well as the Wikipedia copyright policy. All editors are expected to stick closely to these policies when creating and evaluating material. WHO has written the material should be irrelevant so long as these policies are closely adhered to." Note my emphasis on the last sentence, these are from the guidelines themselves. What I don't think is right about this discussion is that people are inferring something about the content of an article (that it's not just advertisement, but blatant advertisement) SIMPLY from my declared status as an editor with some COI. That is not right and contrary to the COI policy. The two users who posted above have not indicated any specific content from the article which would characertise it as "blatant advertisement". If it is so blatant, could someone please indicate this with reference to the CONTENT of the article? I also note that the criteria for speedy deletion is not just advertisement (ANY article written on a company by anyone will by its very nature contain what can be seen as advertisements assuming it describes its products and services) but that it be "blatant". It's quite frustrating that no one will engage me in a substantive discussion here. Anyway, following on from <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a>'s comments, I suggest that the article be restored so references can be added carefully to each assertion. This is good practice anyway particularly in situations where COI is a declared issue. Comments on this can be recorded on the discussion page of the article and editors can modify as needed. Surely this is a better option than removing all discussion on this subject? I will post a version of this article Here <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaybregman_dbf7.html" title="User:Jaybregman">Jaybregman</a> 12:22, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Overturn</b> The article has been reconstructed, edited, and detailed references have been added which include highly reputable sources such as <i>The Economist</i>, <i>The Times</i>, The <i>Financial Times</i>, Published Academic works (e.g. <i>Proceedings of the ITS World Congress 2006</i>) as well as comments from Academics. I considered adding a disclaimer but I was not sure if this was appropriate. I would ask that the article be restored, and that if any admins still believe the article to qualify as "blatant advertising" that they respond here with reference to the content of the article as to why they believe to be so (hopefully if this does happen the article can be further edited to ensure it meets quality standards).<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaybregman_dbf7.html" title="User:Jaybregman">Jaybregman</a> 14:20, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article has been deleted by someone (which I think was inappropriate as it is under discussion here) so I have reposted so that everyone has a chance to see the updated article.

<li>Every word! Guy, the essence of the guideline is that editing articles in which you have a COI should be avoided. It does NOT say it is expressly forbidden. Nor does it say that articles can be deleted *simply* because an editor declares COI. That's because the guideline is very well thought out, and state that although editors with a COI will be inclined to write biased or otherwise inappropriate content (which is why COI needs to be watched closely) the only way to judge whether content is appropriate or not is by looking at the CONTENT, not the CREATOR or EDITOR behind the content. I have posted the following salient quote direct from the policy above: ""All text created in the Wikipedia main namespace is subject to rules covering criteria for articles (what Wikipedia is not); encyclopedic quality (verifiability and original research); editorial approach (neutral point of view); as well as the Wikipedia copyright policy. All editors are expected to stick closely to these policies when creating and evaluating material. WHO has written the material should be irrelevant so long as these policies are closely adhered to." (my emphasis). So, the real question here is can anyone involved in this discussion point to content in the revised article which suggests it is "blatant advertising"? If so, they should post it here. That's the purpose of a deletion review--to review the *content* to be deleted--not simply to review the editors. The arguments of everyone who has endorsed deletion can be summed up simply: "Editor has declared COI, therefore article *must* be advertising / spam / bias, therefore should be deleted". That's logically corrupt. In order to make this argument work one would have to (and one should EASILY be able to if it is indeed the case) list one or more quotations from the article which put it into any of those categories. No one has done so--so the real question is--why not? Guy, please you have labelled it "spam"--can you justify this comment with reference to the content, which is the *only* reason a piece of text could be called "spam"? It's terrifying to think that under the standards which are implicit in the arguments of those who endorse deletion, any article in which an editor has a COI which is declared or discovered can be deleted without review, or the edits can be deleted without review, and this deletion can be justified. That seems highly contrary to the principles of truth through open discussion which pervade the site (indeed, it's contrary to the very guidelines you cite and ask if I have read).<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaybregman_dbf7.html" title="User:Jaybregman">Jaybregman</a> 14:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ah, I'll fill this one. I'm looking at the deleted revision of Ecourier from 17:50, 14 January 2007 (that's the one you started writing in the middle of the DRV):

<p>However, I think we can modify the sentence to be more neutral: eCourier has taken a different approach to logistics than previous companies such as FedEx (cite to first sentence of this quote and include quote in reference), rather than attempting to "simplify operations to make exceptions rare", the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_to_Peer_917f.html" title="Peer to Peer">Peer to Peer</a> model practiced by eCourier "de facto make[s] every transaction an exception...Each courier pickup is a dynamic, real-time, semi-optimized event" (add other cite and link to full article).<br />

<p>I personally think the citations to this are sufficient. But again, it's more powerful to use the text of the citations in the decription, it has the added benefit of making the article more encyclopedic and eliminating the appearance of pushing unverified information. So, we can do this: eCourier developed and uses in its operations an intelligent despatch and fleet management system it calls A.I.B.A. The system "uses a detailed geographical model of its London operations, including predicted and actual traffic patterns, weather, package demand, real-time courier availability, and other data" (Release 1.0 article, p11) to "[match] jobs and couriers in real time, using its knowledge of where they are" (ibid). How does it work? "AIBA knows where all th eCouriers are, and it knows what they are carrying and how fast they are moving. This information is combined with the latest traffic and weather reports. The computer also compares the journey with previous patterns, allowing it to calculate the impact of a traffic jam, a thunderstorm, or just a busy Friday afternoon. It then uses this information to predict a travel time for the collection and delivery and allocates each new delviery to the most appropriate courier. The whole process takes milliseconds."(See Despatch Manager article <a href="http://www.ecourier.co.uk/pdf/eCourier_News_DM.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ecourier.co.uk/pdf/eCourier_News_DM.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<p>Vote was 10 of 16 to delete, should have been closed as no consensus especially knowing that this article from an obscure airline was going to be used to justify deleteing articles for major airlines. Votes for deletion did not consider the reasons why the articles exist. They were first created when this information became large relative to the size of the airline article. By splitting this data out, the parent article size becomes more manageable. The destinations are encyclopedic since they define the very nature of many airlines. The are easy to verify from any travel website, airport websites, government required notifications, government approvals and many other sources, so the votes citing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> should have been considered with less weight. It this vote is upheld, it may set a very interesting precedent. It would in effect support deletion of any type of destination list. That could lead to deletions in other areas. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 01:30, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I deleted and stand by it. Only five people wanted to keep; one gave a reason as precedent that other airlines have destination articles but s/he would endorse deleting if they all were; one basically gave <a href="../../../i/n/t/WP%7EINTERESTING_6e23.html" title="WP:INTERESTING">WP:INTERESTING</a> as a reason; one cited <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> which doesn't even apply. A strong 10 vs. a weak 5 with the final person wanting to merge and redirect.

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>. "Slippery slope", while arguably a valid reason in an AfD, is most certainly not a valid reason in a DRV (since it isn't XfD round 2}, and AfD is not a vote, so vote counts are irrelevant.

<li><b>Endorse delete</b>, no satisfactory reason was given as to why such a list should be on Wikipedia in the first place.

<li><b>Relist</b> - A satisfactory argument has to be made that the article <i>should</i> be deleted, and it wasn't really. Half of the nominator's statement was incorrect, as WP does have other such lists. Aside from that, it's interesting how wknight manipulates the numbers there. The counts were actually 10 delete, most of which made sense, a couple were weak; 5 keep, 4 of which were perfectly reasonable; and 1 merge, which is still a keep, since the content should remain. Moreschi has some interesting comments on his talk page indicating he supports deleting everything in sight, and an administrator went so far as threatening to block him over another deletion issue, so this diminishes the credibility of his comments. 10-6 (or, more like 9-5) is no consensus. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 20:02, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Overturn and merge</b>. The fact that the mass listing of the airline destination lists seems headed for a "keep" indicates that this result is an anomoly. By deleting this article we lost valid and verifiable information about <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livingston_Airlines_884c.html" title="Livingston Airlines">Livingston Airlines</a> and that is a great pity. Information about where an airline carrier flies is present for just about <i>all</i> other airlines we have here and is <i>highly</i> relevant for coverage of the company. In regards to the arguments presented for deletion, all of them can be rebutted.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The list is not an indiscriminate collection of information because information on where an airline flies is relevant to the coverage and therefore encyclopedic.</li>
<li>Unless you are seriously claiming that the airline schedule is not a reliable way of determing where an airline flies (why on earth would an airline say they fly to a place if they don't?), I cannot see any way in which this article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>.</li>
<li>Newspapers frequently report about airlines coming and leaving their local airport, so <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> should not be a major issue.</li>
<li>It is not a travel directory, but valid information about where an airline goes. The book I have on airlines (Modern&#160;:Commercial Aircraft) is paper and is therefore forced to say things like "Heavens Airlines flies to 43 destinations in North America, Europe and Africa", as an online reference we can do better and provide the full destination list.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>At least two of the "delete"s presented no real argument for deletion, I will mention CyberAnth and Akihabara ("delete this along with some other articles" with no reasoning). Hence, I think AFD got this one badly wrong and this should be undeleted.</dd>
<dd>(The reason I am saying "merge" is that the airline in question here is small (a fleet of only six aircraft) and a destination list for an airline of that size can be reasonably put into the article.) <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, the article was unsourced, but that doesnt make any of the information invalid or incorrect - anyone who has played the game knows that its fine.

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>, now that I've seen the Guardian and NME "articles". The Guardian article is on myspace, not the band, only one paragraph on what the guitarist thinks myspace is doing to bands, nothing that says anything substantial about the band.

<ul>
<li>Also, myspace &lt;&gt; <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Criterias for <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>&#160;: <i>has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works... (This criterion includes published works in all forms..)</i>&#160;: a lot of reviews by independent well-known web-sites about metal seems to fall in this category (they are even mentioned on <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1533974/20060608/shadows_fall.jhtml?headlines=true" class="external text" title="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1533974/20060608/shadows_fall.jhtml?headlines=true" rel="nofollow">mtv</a>; <i>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country</i>&#160;: it is the case, see above (tour has begun now, and you can check at various independent websites, apart from their myspace site (for example <a href="http://www.trustkillshows.com/search/band/532246" class="external text" title="http://www.trustkillshows.com/search/band/532246" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=23256" class="external text" title="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=23256" rel="nofollow">here</a>). It is clear that they meet at least the central criteria + one additional criteria for listing. As for what to put in the article, the amount of reviews about the band proves that it is easy to write a good and lenghty article about them.

<li>Look, it's been in afd 3 times, and been repeatedly recreated with no indication of notability. While it might be possible to write a good article about it, that's never been done, so there really is nothing to undelete. Start an article in your userspace (eg. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHervegirod_Job_for_a_Cowboy_8d57.html" title="User:Hervegirod/Job for a Cowboy">User:Hervegirod/Job for a Cowboy</a>) and if it's good, it can be moved to the main namespace.

<p>This page had nothign wrong with it The Demented Cartoon Movie (2005, Brian Kendall) is a highly popular flash movie. The Wikipedia Article was full of information on the 30 minute flash based movie, incuding info from Brian Kendall himself. I was really sad to learn that it was taken down (possibly deleted), and that is why I am here. If an Admin can't undelete it completeley, I can understand tha,t but can one of you guys please give me a link to it? THANKS!</p>

Most of the discussion seems to be about differing interpretations what the closure entailed, and how it was supposed to be implemented.

<p><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Wikipedia:Esperanza</a> was recently nominated for deletion on <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_EA_ad90.html" title="WP:MFD/EA">WP:MFD/EA</a>. The results, which I agree was a good handling of consensus, stated that "Messedrocker Solution will be applied to the rest of the pages; deletion not required. Esperanza is too big to be deleted without leaving many red-links and making newcomers wonder". The Messedrocker Solution said that "all the Esperanza pages (except Wikipedia:Esperanza itself) are blanked and made into redirects to Wikipedia:Esperanza, which is replaced with a notice on how it's closed down. This way, the history is still around, but it is effectively deleted".</p>
<p>However, a majority of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Esperanza%2F&amp;namespace=4" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Esperanza%2F&amp;namespace=4" rel="nofollow">Esperanza's subpages</a> were deleted by a few admins <b>against consensus established on MfD</b>. They removed the histories of the Esperanza subpages and replaced them with redirects. IMHO, this is a serious offense against what the Wikipedia community wanted to have done. Therefore, I request that <b>all pages under <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Wikipedia:Esperanza</a> history be restored, maintaining the redirects to the main Esperanza page</b>.</p>
<p>I realize that no DRV is needed to request page undeletion. However, this situation is currently under debate, and I think that we need a wider opinion here. Many requests for undeletion on <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EEsperanza_f704.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Esperanza">Wikipedia talk:Esperanza</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_58c0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Esperanza">Wikipedia talk:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Esperanza</a> have been met with opposition by those who were against the MfD results.

<li>Just to be clear, the status quo per community consensus is whatever the closing admin decided.

<li><b>Endorse deletion, no history restoration</b>. There is no good reason to restore the page histories and there is no good reason to overturn the decision. My reading of the MfD decision was that pages were to be deleted and redirected (and they were). Let's just this unpleasantness fade from memory. The essay should be sufficient for anyone interested. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 16:50, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>alphachimp, your deletions violated MfD decisions to follow the Messedrocker Solution. Mailer Diablo specifically said "<i>No deletion required.</i>"--<i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup><small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Ed_8b99.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Ed">Reviews?</a></small> 16:55, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't like the thought that my deletions (and those of many other admins, although I appear to have been singled out) violated that decision. What part of "no deletion required" precludes deletion? My read of the decision (and that of the admins I queried on and off wiki) was that they should be deleted. Deleting the pages was a lot more difficult than, say, just salting and redirecting. If anything, the admins assisting in this tedious task should be commended for their good faith efforts, not hauled through a procedural quagmire. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 05:18, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You don't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> your deletions. You are responsible for them, but if they are overturned, please don't take personal offence. I am currently reviewing the deletion log, so don't worry about being singled out. A dispassionate, and objective record of what happened is needed. There are a lot of pages, I agree, but saying that deleting is more difficult than <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salting</a> shows you don't understand salting. Salting is deletion followed by recreating the page as a protected warning. Possibly you meant blanking and redirecting, which can be done by anyone, not just an admin, but still probably involves more key presses than deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:56, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, so I got a term wrong. Delete and redirect (3 actions): Delete -&gt; Create Redirect -&gt; Protect; Redirect (2 actions): Create Redirect -&gt; Protect. Those descriptions don't include clicks between, which would make deleting about 2x as much work. Again, the pages were only deleted after discussion both on and off wiki that validated the aforementioned action. I don't "worry" about being singled out. I know that I am the only admin (other than Mailer) involved in closing this MfD who has been contacted regarding this DRV. Let it be very clear: I did not delete pages without consultation. I did read the MfD, and there was no mention of the histories. We can sit here and debate this constantly, but this purely procedural nomination is ridiculous. If some admin wants to run through restoring histories, they're more than welcome to do so. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 17:09, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Messedrocker solution, as it appears later in the MfD, quite clearly states that page histories are to be kept. I honestly don't see how that sentence is vague or unclear in any way. Regarding due process - the point about due process is that it's public. I'm uncomfortable with the idea of a handful of people having a private chat, then deciding to change the result of an MfD as hotly contested as this one without informing anyone else. Wasn't the Esperanza council heavily criticized for having closed meetings just like that? As for you being singled out, I'm guessing Ed just picked your name cause it appeared several times in the deletion logs. If you'd be willing to contact the other admins you discussed this with, I'd like to hear their thoughts on the matter. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 18:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A random sample indicates that a substantial number of the Esperanza subpages do not have any deleted history to undelete. Some do, but expecting a closing admin to go through every single page on what is four to five screens' worth of pages on my monitor (and I have a big monitor) looking for pages that <i>might</i> have had some history deleted, that <i>might</i> be of use to someone, then undelete them, is a total waste of time. No-one in this discussion has specified a single deleted edit that needs to be undeleted and made available to everyone. I've never seen a case for undeleting that was so clearly process wonkery, or in full, "overturn because I won't be the one doing the tedious process of overturning".</dd>

<dd>So you claimed repeatedly that you contacted other admins on and off wiki...did you bother to contact non-admins who also participated in the discussion? Is it possible that one of the editors you talked might have shown the slightest objection to the page deletions? It would be nice if you could prove the fact that you discussed this on wiki. Off-wiki, however, should not be a suitable venue for discussions about that "complicated MfD discussion". How did you communicate? Did you use email? chatroom? IRC? telephone? conference call? physically meeting each other? Those forms of communications are not necessarily setting binding decisions, since:
<ol>
<li>Logs are not available, or might not be credible</li>
<li>No proof can be shown that the discussion took place</li>
<li>Only witnesses to the discussion are those who participated</li>

<dd>Now, a discussion to <i>change</i> the result of an MfD, on the other hand, is perfectly fine. Some people have said that all the pages should be hard-deleted. Ed requested that "all pages under Wikipedia:Esperanza history be restored, maintaining the redirects to the main Esperanza page.". I agree with Ed. Why? As I said previously, in Wikipedia terms, Esperanza's pages are the "primary sources" about Esperanza, and any historian or encyclopedia writer should recognize the importance of primary sources. The MfD is a reflection of Esperanza, but it is not Esperanza. Similarly, the Esperanza essay is a secondary source. Esperanza has been closed down, but it is still a part of Wikipedia's history, warts and all, and it should not be denied, glorified, or swept under the rug.

<li><b>Request full list of pages deleted</b> - it's a simple request, isn't it? Please provide a list of all the Esperanza pages that were covered by this MfD. Yet, stunningly, the MfD failed to list them. To expand on this point, some of the Esperanza pages were not just: (a) blanked and redirected (the MfD solution); (b) deleted and recreated as a redirect (what this DRV is trying to get overturned and done correctly, per 'a'); (c) deleted and recreated as a protected 'salted' page (what the MfD decision stipulated for the memberships and governance pages, but the salted pages were then later deleted); but some pages were (d) outright deleted (these outright deletions should be covered by this DRV, even though they were not specifically mentioned). The Special:Prefixindex list of subpages that Ed provided above will not show these outright deleted pages. Consequently, I requested from the closing admin a list of all the pages that were deleted (I feel that all these pages should have been listed in full on the MfD itself, or on a subpage as the list is long, as once deleted it is difficult to find out what pages were deleted unless there is an actual list somewhere). The closing admin's response was: <i>"I think trawling through the deletion log is the only viable method at the moment I can think of, but I don't expect the deletion period to stretch to over two to three days.

I may be able to do this list, but seriously, it shouldn't be so difficult to get a list of the pages deleted.

If you don't have the time to make the list, ask for help in making the list (copying and pasting from the subpages listing is one way).

<li>My initial thought on looking through the list is that deletions and redirects were carried out inconsistently.

As far as I care, there's no difference for these election pages. There's a big fuss being made here that admins did what they want over the consensus and close by Mailer - this is nonsense, and everyone needs to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and take a look at the close again, and try contacting the admins who performed the salts (etc) which might need undoing.

<dd>Once I realized that some of Esperanza's subpages were deleted, I immediately put it up for discussion and requested them to be undeleted. My request, however, was met with opposition, so I posted this DRV. We need to send the message that actions taken unilaterally against consensus will not be regarded as acceptable to the Wikipedia community. This debate isn't just about the histories of Esperanza's subpages; it's about the principle of consensus! If the consensus changes, then that's fine, but as far as I'm concerned, the consensus was to keep the histories of Esperanza.</dd>
<dd>Also, you can't just assume that another DRV will be posted after consensus here is established.

<dd>I do understand the phrase you use "actions taken unilaterally against consensus" to be in dire contravention of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a>. I'm sure that the deleting admins were all acting to the best of their ability, interpreting the close as well as they could, and making inevitable mistakes (yes, admins aren't infallible). It is unfair to attack the integrity of these admins in this way, and Carcharoth's analysis of the deletion period can help us to resolve these issues properly, as I'm sure everyone is eager to do. For my part, I salted a number of the governanace/election pages, as mandated by the MfD close, and I was careful to do it correctly (though I suspect I will have made some mistakes - everyone does!). The admins handling the deletion/Messedrockerification or Esp had a lot of work to do, and deserve to be cut a bit of slack from these accusations. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 15:20, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Quite frankly, I can't possibly assume every deletion was the result of a good faith interpretation of Mailer Diablo's closure. At the very least, there were people who read the first four paragraphs of the closure and conveniently ignored the "Messedrocker Solution will be applied to the rest of the pages" paragraph. It's troubling that some people have made comments along the lines of "KILL IT! KILL IT! BURN BURN BURN RARGH!" There were multiple pages in which the Messedrocker solution was applied at first and then later on the pages were deleted and salted (by you yourself, alphachimp). Why was this done? If you want an example, check out the history and logs of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_Images_0d3a.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/Images">Wikipedia:Esperanza/Images</a>.

<dd>(edit conflict) I think that what alphachimp was saying was a response to the attack on the involved admins who "didn't like osmething" - this is a gross <a href="../../../a/b/f/WP%7EABF_c955.html" title="WP:ABF">assumption of bad faith</a>, and this sort of attitude here is getting out of hand. Ed, please note that the admins involved were only acting upon the close by Mailer Diablo, which had one or two "grey areas", and we did our best to follow the consensus with the deletions which took place (and the close indicated that there <b>was</b> a consensus for deletion of some pages, so alphachimp's comment re: the consensus is correct). Ed - the admins involved should (if I can blow my own horn) be commended for their work, and not be admonished in the ways we see here. We did our best to act upon the consensus, and collaborated with editors and admins, to make sure everything got covered. There may have been some mistakes in the deletions, but efforts will always be made to correct them, making this DRV unneccesary. It presents an uninformed view and the confusing majority seems to advocate the undeletion of everything (which, does not compute with your DRV statement about out of process deletions being the reason for this DRV) - to overthrow MD's close which permitted the deletion of some pages. As a result of this lack of detail and onfo made public, this DRV is descending into a farce. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 19:37, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>So you claimed repeatedly that you contacted other admins on and off wiki...did you bother to contact non-admins who also participated in the discussion? Is it possible that one of the editors you talked might have shown the slightest objection to the page deletions? It would be nice if you could prove the fact that you discussed this on wiki. Off-wiki, however, should not be a suitable venue for discussions about that "complicated MfD discussion". How did you communicate? Did you use email? chatroom? IRC? telephone? conference call? physically meeting each other? Those forms of communications are not necessarily setting binding decisions, since:</p>
<ol>
<li>Logs are not available, or might not be credible</li>
<li>No proof can be shown that the discussion took place</li>
<li>Only witnesses to the discussion are those who participated</li>
<li>The discussion doesn't dictate consensus, since the venue is off-wiki and available to a small population
<ul>
<li>unless it is an office action</li>
</ul>

Therefore, your so-called "consulting" other admins do not establish decisions on how to handle a discussion. If you were confused, you should have consulted the closing admin.</blockquote>

<dd>Ed, we engaged on Wikipedia after the close and we obviously have differing opinions on how the close was to happen. This was a hard close to read, and I don't see any value in asserting admins acted in bad faith. As to the DRV, I think it opens from a flawed position, in that it quotes selectively and isn't supported by the close. Also, I think it would be better to have a list of the pages that require review, rather than consider the whole deletion debate. Can we all calm it down a bit. This close took a lot of work by a lot of admins.

<dd>Good questions. I agree that the situation may not be as bad as the DRV statement makes it appear. When I looked at the lists <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_Esperanza_MfD_review_1417.html" title="User:Carcharoth/Esperanza MfD review">here</a>, I realised that a lot of them are indeed governance-related pages. I am much happier now that the list has been produced (though less happy that I had to do it and that the admins involved didn't list at the MfD the pages they had deleted). I suggest that the DRV here be closed with no result, but <b>without prejudice</b> to a future DRV that will present a detailed list of precisely which pages should be repaired to conform to the MfD. Even simpler would be if the five admins who did most of the tidying up work would agree to review such a future list and agree to any more tidying up that may be needed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 21:00, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

I've seen accusations that I deleted the collaboration process when I kept all relevant history, it's a pity the deletion edit summaries allow more text to be added that actually display, granted, but I did attempt to add all details on where stuff went. Now I'd suggest that this DRV is opened on a flawed premise since it is quoting selectively and that it alleges bad faith.

<dd>Please don't take this so personally. I removed that piece of text because I felt it needed more explanation, and I didn't have time to explain at the time. I'll quote my edit summary: <i>"remove admin stats - on second thoughts, this is not helpful until properly explained"</i>. My thought was that, without proper explanation, some of the admins listed there might take offence (though they really shouldn't), so I removed it. Please note that I removed it 6 minutes after it had appeared when I created the page, and 12 minutes before I even posted the link to the page at the DRV. My aim with compiling that list was (a) to get a list of all the pages being discussed in the MfDs and the DRV - <b>the first time such a list has been produced</b>;(b) to identify the admins involved so that this can be discussed with them - previously it has not been clear which admins other than the closing admin were involved, and hence should be approached about this; (c) counting the number of pages helped make it clear to me that 5 admins did the bulk of the work (for which they should be commended). If I had asked at the beginning of the DRV for a list of all the pages deleted and which admins I should contact, would you have been able to tell us? That is a big part of what I am trying to do here, make it clearer precisely which pages were deleted. The rest (details of actions taken by admins) follows on from that basic information that was missing. I'll also repeat what I said on this DRV's talk page: this is not about Esperanza. I have never been involved in Esperanza or a member of Esperanza. This is a general principle to ensure that Wikipedia organisations in general are shut down properly. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Steve, there was also this quote in the closing statement:
<dl>
<dd><i>Messedrocker Solution will be applied to the rest of the pages; deletion not required.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Messedrocker later describes his solution as:
<dl>
<dd><i>all the Esperanza pages (except Wikipedia:Esperanza itself) are blanked and made into redirects to Wikipedia:Esperanza, which is replaced with a notice on how it's closed down. This way, the history is still around, but it is effectively deleted.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of what anyone thinks about it, that's the state the pages should be in right now - membership &amp; council pages should have been deleted and salted, the rest should have been blanked and redirected. Now, if someone wants to change that decision, one way or the other, DRV is the forum for it. Some people want to argue the case to change that decision, and delete everything? Fine, I'll argue the case to change the decision, and bring back all the page histories. The Messedrocker solution built up quite a bit of support on the MfD. Quite a few people here support restoring page histories. Why make an exception for governance? I believe we should keep the page history for things like governance, exactly <i>because</i> it was the worst thing about Esperanza. By keeping the history, people can see exactly what was wrong with it. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 00:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>You are quoting selectively here. The close had already stated to which pages the messed rocker solution did not apply, which negates Messed Rocker's earlier outline.

<li>Regarding quoting selectively - you quoted one half, I quoted the other. The truth is a mix of both. As for duplicate votes, the point I made during the MfD was that someone who had simply voted "delete", without any explanation (is that just "get rid of the group", or "get rid of everything asoociated with the group"?) could always go back and change their vote into a "Messedrocker" or a "slash and burn delete", to be clearer - and quite a few people did exactly that. I agree that a discussion about interpreting the closing statement might have been useful, but we couldn't do that until the MfD had been closed in the first place. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 00:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But that is what I tried to do. I tried to say that the consensus is for it to be shut down, so how are we going to do it, but that was pushed off the table. I don't know, sometimes it feels like to some the process is more important than the practicality. The truth of the quotations is that this DRV should quote the whole of the close, and not selective parts that make it appear to strengthen one case over another. It's silly not to think there are grey areas. Still, I'm looking at a way of resolving this. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 09:41, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree. The main thing though is that a list of pages has been recovered. Without that, it would have been difficult to say what pages were deleted. Can I urge anyone dealing with an umbrella nomination like this in future to keep a copy of the list they work from during the deletion (or get it from the deletion log afterwards), and put it on the MfD page to ensure an accurate record is kept of what was deleted. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The trouble is, it was left to admin discretion which pages related to governance and membership and which didn't. I tried to clarify all of this at the time of the close and was told by <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed">User:Ed</a> to "Read the results of this debate. It should have the necessary steps to take". Now that's what we all did and it appears we all read different things. To be honest, I don't think we're best served having this discussion, it's recreating tensions the close was supposed to put to bed. I had thought there was to be a month of seeing how the dust settled before we revisited it all. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:13, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> so wait, some stuff was moved then the redirects were deleted and then re-created as protected redirects, which might explain a lot of the confusion.. why was that done?

<li>Apparently, yes. The first redirects that were created preserved the history, until the pages were deleted, which hid the history. A complete log of what happened is being created to better understand what's going on.--<i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup><small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Ed_8b99.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Ed">Reviews?</a></small> 04:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It sounds like the histories have been preserved, but the histories moved with the page move. Without a history showing where the page was moved to.. it makes things very confusing. In other words, there is a history for X, but we don't know where it is. I don't understand why this was done.. It should be fairly reasonable to find out <i>where</i> the history is for a given page. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 06:15, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Governance - most, if not all, were deleted per MfD decisions</li>
<li>Membership - most, if not all, were deleted per MfD decisions</li>

<dd>Avoiding the histrionics in your post, I'd like to point out that Esperanza has already 'died'. This process is an embalming of Esperanza before sticking it in a dusty drawer not to be looked at again for several years, if ever. This process might be distasteful to some, but some people like to try and finish something that is started, rather than leave something half-done and incomplete. OK, having said that, if anyone mentions any of my half-finished projects, they are urged to help me write the essay Wikipedia:I've started so I'll finish... (seriously, if there is an essay on how to get the balance right between giving up on something and leaving in a fit state for others to carry on working on it, I would like to know). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:26, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Let it be</b>. I've been working to try and get some sort of agreement on a way forward, but I can't seem to broker that, so in all honesty, this isn't worth the energy anymore. Let it be. Open invitation, though that anyone who wants to read through the history of any given page, is free to ask me and I'll be happy to restore the page to a position where the history can be read. I think ultimately, we're here to edit the encyclopedia, not research the history of a portion of the communities discussions. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:14, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Fair enough. I'll cary on working on preserving a record of what happened and what pages used to exist (as was not done at the time at the MfD). Can we be sure though that things will be done properly in the future? We need to recognise that sometimes we will need to dismantle and close down monolithic sub-organisations within Wikipedia, and it would be nice to let the historians and archivists take over, rather than just have everything turn into red links. Thanks also for the offer to restore pages on request. The main problem with that is that it presumes you will be around for the indefinite future. Also, I will say again that deletion should not be considered a rough-and-ready way of archiving. Stuff in the deletion tables was lost in the past, and considering the sheer amount of stuff in there (including images now), I wouldn't rule out future technical problems causing loss of deleted material. I think the deletion process needs an overhaul to distinguish between archiving and deletion. At the moment, the tests, spam, nonsense and other stuff that is deleted (and wouldn't be missed) is mixed up with old discussions and old versions of pages that might be of use one day. I'm going to check with the developers about this, as the situation might have changed since I last checked. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:34, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a>, you know I wholeheartedly agree with you. I would be more than happy to put together a working party to go over this, I tried to during the debate, at the time of the close and I tried to here. But I'm not interested in finger pointing. You make an excellent point that these closes require thinking and discussion, but that needs to be accepted by the community. Where I tried to instigate one during the debate I was told it was inappropriate, and where admins try to discuss such discussions in private we are accused of operating a cabal, and where we try to discuss them in public they descend into farce. There is a serious and fundamental problem at play here, and perhaps it needs to be examined. However, I hope such problems never occur again, because I would rather we just all assumed good faith, and worked hard to avoid future organisations and factions.</li>
<li>Your points about the servers crashing and information being lost are well made, but I think they are underpinned by a misunderstanding. At some point, this information will be lost, will become meaningless, and we should never see ourselves as a preservation society, locked in a battle to save for some future historian the intricacies of the past. As someone with a minor interest in genealogy, I say this from experience; the people in the future will be more forgiving of us for losing stuff than you may believe. When we are long gone and all dust, we should be thankful that someone, somewhere, is happy just to know we existed. They don't need to know what colour socks we wore on a certain day, nor, ultimately, do they have to resurrect and extract all meaning from anything posted here. Such research is a double edged sword, as I think we can all agree, based on our experiences editing articles here.</li>
<li>Let's not assume grandiose ideals of our own worth to future generations, let's live in the here and now. What's the more important bequest we can make to the future? An encyclopedia, or the Esperanza minutiae? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>"the people in the future will be more forgiving of us for losing stuff than you may believe"</i> - LOL! Well said, Steve. Though I hope what we've said here has got through to some people. Enculturating a historical perspective is hopefully never wasted effort. It helps when writing encyclopedia articles, remembering to put things in their historical context. All encyclopedia editors should be at least a little bit aware of historical issues. Mine are <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock.html" title="Sock">white</a> today by the way... (ooh, scary article there, with a fetish section). Anyway, I hope no-one minds if I carry on working on that list in my spare time. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've discussed the issue with the other main admins who helped administer the close by Mailer Diablo, and Mailer Diablo himself, and we are all happy to review the close and undertake to tie up any loose ends as we can per the closing comments of the deletion debate. I believe that commitment to rectify any errors caused by the workload and the number of admins involved should satisfy the demands of the deletion review process at this point. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Closing admin's comments were "The result was delete. Reasons to keep are neither rooted in policy, nor convincing. Duplicate of the related category." Actual votes cast were 6 keeps (one of them "strong"), 5 deletes, 1 keep which was withdrawn so maybe should be counted as a delete, one abstain (from procedural nominator) and two speedy closes which I think need to be disregarded (one of them from a user who also voted keep). On the face of it, therefore, an obvious no-consensus default-keep, leaving us only to deal with the closing admin's discount of the keep votes and his or her own opinion that the list is duplicated by the category. It's hard to rebut the "not rooted in policy" assertion, since I cannot see what the closing admin based it on, nor what policy he or she thinks the delete votes <i>were</i> based on. I expect Proto will come here and comment, and I will either agree, or rebut, when I see that explanation. For my own part, I would assert that my vote ("nothing indescriminate or unmaintainable about it") is precisely AS rooted-in-policy, no more no less, than the nomination which asserted that the article should be deleted because it was indescriminate and unmaintainable. That leaves the suggestion that the article was duplicated by the category. The relevant guideline on this, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">here</a> says <i>"Wikipedia offers three ways to create groupings of articles: categories, lists, and article series boxes... These methods should not be considered to be in competition with each other. Rather, they are most effective when used in synergy, each one complementing the other."</i> When looking for "official guidance" (so to speak) on whether a list and a category can be redundant with one another, therefore, the wikipedia guideline says that they are not. I see a keep voter saying "The list clearly provides more information than the category and is a well-organised source of information with a clear definition". I do not know why that was considered "unconvincing", and I cannot now look at the page to check, since it has been deleted and I am not an admin. However if David Edgar is right on that point then Proto is wrong. I would argue (and our guideline seems to support the view) that a list is not redundant with a category even if it contains exactly the same information, since it has <i>scope</i> to expand in a way the category does not. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 14:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Endorse (my own) closure</b>. If we have to go through them:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>Keep as a common and notable character archetype</i>. - OK, so we should have an article about the archetype. This wasn't it. Non sequitur.</li>
<li><i>Keep. Easily defined profession and archetype. Messiness is not grounds for deletion.</i> - see above.</li>
<li><i>Speedy close. This is a relisting and lacks an explanation for deletion</i> - Docu's first vote, ignored as clearly incorrect.</li>
<li><i>Speedy close without prejudice. Nominator gives no rationale for this proposal.</i> - ditto.</li>
<li><i>Strong Keep Good list: nothing indescriminate or unmaintainable about it</i> - fair enough.</li>
<li><i>Keep as per above two comments</i> - ignored as above two comments were to delete, and was Docu's second "vote".</li>
<li><i>keep as good and as useful as all the others. In this case a notably important list for the genre</i> - nothing but keep it as I like it and it's useful.</li>
<li><i>Keep. The list clearly provides more information than the category and is a well-organised source of information with a clear definition</i> - good argument, referring to WP:NOT issues and why the user doesn't believe them to be an issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So there were two decent "keep"s, three poor ones, and two ignored. Of the deletes:</dd>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> just a response to the statment that we should have an article about the archetye, there are at least two <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_fiction.html" title="Detective fiction">Detective fiction</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_Procedural_d956.html" title="Police Procedural">Police Procedural</a>, and in fact, a version of this list (and several others) can be found at the bottom of the first page. I do not think that information should be removed, does anyone here? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>Delete as nominator - originally part of mass nom at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of fictional actors. These are indiscriminate lists drawing largely unrelated articles from a wide variety of genres, difficult if not impossible to maintain and will never aproach completeness</i> - OK, so asserts indiscriminate (WP:NOT). This in contradiction to one of the keep votes, but I'm not judging whether or not you are right, I'm determining whether the votes are argued well and rooted in policy. So, referencing WP:NOT, good argument.</li>
<li><i>Delete. A stock character of a genre, of which the only thing they have in common is carrying a badge: not nationality, era, medium, personality, hair color, height, etc. Sounds pretty indiscriminate to me. There's this thing called "Categories" which would be more useful</i> - again referencing WP:NOT ("indiscriminate list"), and also pointing out the belief that categories duplicate the content. Good argument. There are then three 'delete per this arguments', which are fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So that's five good deletes, rooted in policy. The nomination was also broken up, making it look purely like a procedural nomination despite being done in good faith, but even with discountint the nomination as an argument to delete, it's still five solid delets versus two solid keeps and three very weak ones. I am aware that viewing each argument is always going to be subjective, but I believe the arguments for deletion outweighed those to keep, particularly as most information is retained via the category. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 15:17, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Endorse</b>, Proto should have made more closings in that group since several of the others were closed incorrectly. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:07, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Overturn</b> - There is nothing better about the delete comments than the keep comments. Most of both were "it's useful" or "it's unuseful listcruft". As for the arguments: are you telling me that there's a huge difference between <i>keep as good and as useful as all the others. In this case a notably important list for the genre</i> and <i>The list clearly provides more information than the category and is a well-organised source of information with a clear definition</i>? By your reasoning, the second invokes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, while the first is <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. This is pretty shaky grounds, and I'm worried the admin is reading what he wishes into the comments. Just as bad, he completely ignored Docu's "vote", despite the fact it contained clear reasoning (i.e., look at the reasoning in the previous afd). <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 16:33, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak endorse closure</b>. I think the actual result probably should have been "<i>no consensus</i>" (thus "<i>keep</i>"); however, this one was a judgment call and the closing admin displayed a reasonable exercise of judgment. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>It is my impression that dpreview.com is _the_ online ressource for cameras. The site was recommended to me, and when I got down to the camera store I found that they used it too. Seems to be an established site, with comprehensive coverage of current high-end camera models, ahve very active forums. Searching for "dpreview" gives me over 4 million hits.</p>

There doesn't seem to be any complete reviews of the site on the web, but nytimes and cnet regularly link to it. Why not simply undelete the stub and use it as a starting point?

<p>This AfD debate was closed <b>by a non-administrator</b> as a "keep". Per <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELPRO_aee5.html#Non-administrators_closing_discussions" title="WP:DELPRO">WP:DELPRO#Non-administrators closing discussions</a>, any closes by non-admins must be <i>"unambiguous "keep" decisions"</i>. This, in my opinion, wasn't one of those. <span style="color:red"><b>Note:</b></span> the current "disputed" tag is not about this sentence of that section, but rather an addition to it regarding closing as "delete" which is unrelated to this DRV. The fact that the section is disputed is non-consequential to this because it is unrelated to the part I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Firstly, remember AfD is not a vote. Donald Albury's input was still under dispute as to whether it brought up a good reason to delete, and the status of that argument is certainly ambiguous. Although some of the keep opinions were explained, a lot weren't, and I would have felt that, at the third-last version<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Heritage_Guitars&amp;oldid=99736351" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Heritage_Guitars&amp;oldid=99736351" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, a no-concensus close is right on the money.</p>
<p>However, this diff<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Heritage_Guitars&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=99736351" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Heritage_Guitars&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=99736351" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, the last before it is closed, is the best argument of the lot, in my opinion. With this, any hint of unambiguity is vanquished and this becomes an AfD which needs to be interpreted on the guidelines of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> by an <b>administrator</b>. I feel that, given Nick's argument, this should either be relisted to gain further input so concensus can be reached, or else the AfD reopened, allowed to run a couple more days to discuss Nick's extremely valid input, and then closed on its merits again.</p>
<p>Note that I am a huge advocate of non-admins closing discussions, and I acknowledge that people do make mistakes; maybe I made one by nominating this for DRV, who knows? I hold nothing against the closer, however I felt that he/she should probably have erred on the side of caution given the circumstances, especially the undiscussed last deletion comment by Nick, and left it for an admin to apply the guidelines to.

<li>That argument was also made by Donald Albury on 7 January, four days earlier. Had I found (and even looked at) closing that AFD, I'd have closed it as keep. (Although I do think that argument should have been better responded to - either by explaining the depth of coverage in those books or by agreeing with it if the depth is trivial.) Since reopening it and closing with the same outcome is pointless; I <b>endorse closure</b> and award the non-admin closer one light slap on the hand. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>As noted at the AfD, the page was almost devoid of content, because there are no sources for any content, because the show has not yet aired. The only information that is not devoid of content is "The episode's title was originally given to the seventh episode, which was ultimately titled "Nothing to Hide".", which is unsourced. The rest is simply ""Nothing to Lose" is the fifteenth episode of the TV series Heroes." That's not an encyclopedia article, and an influx of fans of the show saying "Every other television show has an article" does not change that; calling every episode of every television series "inherently notable" is bizarre. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 13:30, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is a problem precisely because we have a discussion in order to gain consensus - otherwise, any admin could delete any file without community input. If a closing admin disagrees with the prevailing consensus by bringing up a <i>new point which has not been mentioned</i>, it should be placed in the text of the discussion under <i>delete</i>, simply because sometimes, certain arguments to not occur to those in the discussion, and the new idea should be discussed, not unilaterally decided.

<li><b>Overturn</b> (no objection to relisting) - I find it very alarming that an admin would close an AfD with a reason that hadn't even been mentioned by any of the people supporting deletion, it gives the impression that instead of determining consensus, he ignored it and made a unilateral decision. In addition, information being uncited is something that is potentially fixable, if this had been brought up <i>during</i> the AfD instead of being mentioned for the first time at the closing, editors would have had the opportunity to remedy that (if that's possible). If it turns out there's no verifiable info about the episode yet (I don't personally know either way), then the article will only stay deleted until the first information arrives, which is a matter of a couple weeks, if not days.

<p>It was deleted for absolutly no legitimate reason, without any discussion. Oi! is a genuine music genre, and not a "neologism" as described by the editor who incorrectly deleted the article. There are many, many Wikipedia articles that link to the Oi! article. It should be restored immediately. Also, judging by the comments on <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">User:Jimfbleak</a>'s talk page, perhaps his powers of deletion should be revoked, at least temporarily until he gets a better handle on Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 12:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The Game" is the name of a legitimate game that does not exist on any physical medium. That it does not exist physically is one unique aspect of The Game, another being that no one can ever win The Game, though that point is debated by some. The way The Game works is as follows: when you think of The Game, you lose The Game. The Game restarts after one who loses The Game "forgets" about The Game, i.e. when it leaves the person's present state of thought. When one loses The Game (meaning he thought about the game), he anounces it to those around him which technically makes them lose The Game, however the loss does not count for them in when this happens. The Game deserves a page on Wikipedia for the same reasons that Monopoly or The Game of Life deserves a page on Wikipedia. Just because it is not well known, is not tangible, and is simple does not mean that it is illegitimate. Please consider this appeal. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 12:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Catholic-link is a talk page template which recommends the use of the 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia. Such a template is unprecedented for Wikipedia. This will open the way for similar banners from other sources, such as the Jewish Encyclopedia, the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica, and many others in the public domain or otherwise, resulting in conflicts over which sources should be given special lobbying treatment. Already there is considerable conflict over this (the TfD was "no consensus"), but the issue is bigger than that - do we want users lobbying with banner templates for a particular source to be used? Recommend a change from <b>no consensus</b> to <b>Delete</b>. Thank you. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 02:51, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Endorse closure</b> The closing admin was correct, there was no consensus to delete. Nominator here does not cite a policy that overrides consensus. We frankly could use more pointers to old historical sources; we aren't very good at using them in our daily editing.

<li>That is true multiple listings could be created. But I've rarely see someone who is an expert on a topic use old encyclopedia articles, so why encourage it? Wikipedia is beyond the stage of having to fill up blank space, it needs to improve quality, not encourage old material that has not been properly vetted by an expert who knows if it is still accurate or not. It takes someone with a lot of skill, time and knowledge to properly import an old article into Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 20:00, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The keep arguments are weak in comparison to the problem.

<li>Amarkov, it is redundant in comparison to the effects that a simple, plain text notice and signature can produce on an article's talk page. It duplicates a very simple effort that any interested editor can perform, but it adds a pseudo-official feel to the suggestion, especially for new editors who mistake templates for official endorsement. But its function can be accomplished by plain text; that's how it's redundant. And I've addressed the POV-and-can't-be-fixed criterion below, especially in my replies to Gimmetrow. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 02:41, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

There was no consensus here to keep these templates and the concerns from a wide variety of editors (including me: I've written articles for the Saints wikiproject, as have Stbalbach and Wetman) were real and justified. We should not encourage the addition of any more CE or EB material. <b>Overturn and delete</b> per clear consensus at TfD. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:11, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Endorse Closure</b> There are a number of items here that have not been addressed. Despite what Angus McLellan says the original summary is right in one respect, there was "considerable conflict" on this subject. The nominator also overlooked the negative response to an attempt to drum up indignation <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles_2550.html#Catholic_Encyclopedia" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles">here</a>, which he did revisit later without deeming to pass this on. Although this has nothing to do with the fact that there was no consensus it should be pointed out that his was an admitted attempt to insert a "late-twentieth century secularist systematic bias" to Wikipedia articles. This makes the original nomination, and even more so the review, an inappropriate nomination. If the two objectors wish to enforce a bias against pre Vatican II Catholic beliefs and practices through a purge of <i>links</i> to an online source they really should try to change <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> first.

<li><b>Overturn and delete.</b> Consensus was clear. Thirteen votes for deletion, <b>five</b> for keeping. One of those keeps (Mr. Darcy) was obviously an argument for keeping <a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECatholic_bd86.html" title="Template:Catholic">Template:Catholic</a> by mistake, and another (Grutness) was almost certainly making the same mistake of conflating with Template:Catholic. Three clear votes for keep, one of which (Goldfritha) made no argument. So, <b>two</b> actual arguments for keeping (JASpencer and Freder1ck).<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Of these two arguments for keeping, Freder1ck's was the strongest ("<i>I would like to see more articles that integrate historical points of view with contemporary points of view</i>", but Wetman countered this argument ("<i>In general, no template for Wikipedia articles can be automatically applied. A cut-and-pasted note on a talkpage — "This article might benefit from material in the Catholic Encyclopedia" — where explicitly relevant, might be a useful head's-up</i>") as did Sugaar ("<i>The appropiate way to do it is to use Template:Expand and, if appropiate, suggest that this or that source may be helpful (in the talk page)</i>") and myself ("<i>There isn't usually any useful information there to be had. When there is, an editor can take eleven seconds to make explicit note of it on the article's talk page. The templates sitting around add very little helpful direction. ... They mention that the CE could be used. A nice sentiment in theory but in practice it's practically cruft</i>"). Thus Freder1ck's argument should have been considered adequately answered, and then it's just JASpencer against the world. In the face of thirteen Deletes, I fail to see how this <b>one argument standing</b> could be considered No Consensus, and so I believe that RyanGerbil10 closed the TfD incorrectly.<br /></dd>
<dd>Regarding the template itself, now that I've addressed the procedural problems, I'd like to make something clear that was not fully discussed in the TfD. Templates carry a weight of authority. Multiple IPs and new users have mistaken me for an admin just because I left warning templates with stop-signs on their talk pages. This has happened to me often enough that I am certain others among you have experienced it as well. Wikipedia should not be giving the appearance of officially endorsing a partisan source, and regardless of intention, this template gives that appearance. This template is a blinking POV barrier to many potential new users, and will discourage participation from many communities whose participation we need in order to thrive. When there is actual useful information in the Catholic Encyclopedia for an article, a plain old text note on the talk page, followed by a user's signature, will make that clear to everyone without inadvertently suggesting any official endorsement. JASpencer loses nothing when this template is deleted; that user is perfectly capable of using unadorned text to make notes. But the unintended consequences of this template upon the rest of Wikipedia are not worth the convenience it may serve for JASpencer. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 09:57, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This same argument could be used to support a keep, and contrary to nominator there is precedent for templates which "suggest" some other text be used.

<li>"<i>Neither of these arguments were addressed by other "delete" voters</i>" I believe I have addressed this in my (apparently TLDR) post above. The problem with using a template to suggest this particular text (the CE) is that it gives an appearance of official partisanship on the part of Wikipedia. Templates are mistaken by new users for being something that only admins can apply. Shouldn't be that way, but that's how it plays out. An appearance of official Catholic partisanship on the part of Wikipedia cannot be a good thing. As to the progress tracker for a wikiproject, this is something the wikiproject can handle on their own project page, isn't it? It's one thing to say "this page is within the scope of the Catholicism WikiProject"; it's quite another to use a template to suggest that the Catholic Encyclopedia needs to be consulted before this article can be considered finished. It's not a huge deal to say "try consulting the old Brittanica too" but the suggestion that an openly partisan source like the CE must be consulted is a different thing entirely. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 05:46, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Because it seems clear to me that I have. You cannot "agree with [me] that the template text should be rephrased" because I hold no such stance.

<li>1) There is a precedent for templates suggesting some text could be used to improve an article. The nominator said there was no precedent. I see nowhere you have addressed this.</li>

<li>I hold that the current text is unacceptable for (I'm going to assume) much the same reasons you do, however that does not preclude some other template that functions as a wikiproject progress template.

<li>There is certainly no precedent <i>for templates suggesting openly partisan sources</i>, nor should there be; this template would be <i>the beginning</i> of such a precedent. The template cannot be considered an alternative to a category, because it <i>adds</i> a category. And the template is <i>not</i> being used as a progress tracker, because as DGG points out above, it is being abused and applied even to articles that have already long since passed the point of potentially being helped by CE material. Read the TFD again. JASpencer will not let the template be removed unless an article "<i>has all the usable text from the Catholic Encyclopedia article</i>". This is not a progress tracker; it is an attempt to force Wikipedia to mirror all CE partisan content. I object to any templates that would be applied whenever a Wikipedia article has not used "enough" of another particular source yet. We should not be beholden to any particular sources, and we should not have to carry around templates reminding us that we haven't used the CE or any other source "enough" yet, as though we should or must and cannot shed such templates until we do. On a side note, if it your opinion that there should be further discussion of the template's actual usefulness, then a vote of "relist" is more in line with your thinking than one of "endorse". Endorsement will not lead to further discussion, only acceptance of the current template's status quo. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 07:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for telling me how to vote and telling me to read the TfD again, but I disagree. The TfD was closed correctly as "no concensus", even though it was closed <i>opposite</i> to my view.

That's all. Forget I said anything to you about relisting. I should have kept my mouth shut. So anyway, please, can you explain to me why two arguments for keeping and over ten arguments for deletion should be construed as "no consensus"? And how could the template possibly be used in such a way that the deletion arguments would be irrelevent? Any kind of CE progress tracker template, no matter how worded, would effectively mean that Wikipedia has not used "enough" CE yet, and still needs to use more. This is simply not something we should carry around on article talk pages, no matter how worded. The meaning behind it, "Wikipedia needs more Catholic Encyclopedia" is tantamount to taking articles hostage. There's no wording that would change the effect of such a template. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 20:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I thought this was a debate not a vote, so as far as I can see the consensus was clearly for delete (see Coelacan's thorough analysis). The delete arguments are stronger if improving this encyclopaedia is your chief concern. The Catholic Encyclopaedia of 1913 fails <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> in too many areas (the same goes for the 1911 Britannica). The whole idea of this template is based on the false premise that the longer an article is, the better it must be. But less is more in this case. I've improved articles by chopping material from out-of-date sources, including this one. We should be aiming for increased accuracy, not increased length. The "Catholic Encyclopaedia" is available online anyway, so what's the point of reproducing it here? Just give an external link. When you access the CE site, you know what you are getting; it's quite clear what POV the authors are working with and the era they were writing in.

And what is it that overrides the fact that JASpencer has already stated intention to use this template to hold articles hostage until full mirroring of CE content? Again, it's very convenient to say "oh this is turning into tfd again" because that gives the impression that we're just using DRV to argue about content, but please, point out exactly who is not attesting to broken procedure and overlooked consensus? Yes, there will be discussion of content. That is pretty much unavoidable, but it doesn't negate the fact that every deletion argument is also about procedure.

<dd>There is definitely nothing wrong with a simple list, "a reference to available old sources on talk pages". That is not what we are talking about here. The template functions as a requirement that the CE be used more, until it has been used "enough". I'm sorry, but your argument raises no new issues that the simple response of "use a plain text note with a signature instead" does not address. And you do not address any of the issues raised in this DRV or in the TFD concerning the appearance of official endorsement, the functional redundancy of using a template (see my response to Amarkov. above), nor the fact that there was not a supermajority but a clear consensus with every objection (that is, <i>both</i> objections) adequately addressed. Nor do you address the fact that even the closing admin endorses deletion by our NPOV and RS policies here,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Coelacan&amp;diff=101012414&amp;oldid=100983876" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Coelacan&amp;diff=101012414&amp;oldid=100983876" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> and the only thing standing in the way of that is the counting of the votes and the weighing of the arguments.

As I set out in more detail on the Operation Show Me How <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Operation_Show_Me_How_ede1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Operation Show Me How">AfD talk page</a>, the international Show Me How operation <b>(i)</b> was addressed in a Czech government confirmed report of the French non-governmental Observatoire geopolitique des drogues (OGD) organisation released on April 20, 2000, <b>(ii)</b> was mentioned in an April 20, 2000 news article by the United State government's World News Connection, and <b>(iii)</b> was detailed in an article in the June 15, 2000 Issue of CIO Magazine. Items (i) and (ii) are significant new information that has come to light since the deletion. Further, since enough source material appears to exist to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic, the topic appears to be notable.

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> The original afd nomination focussed on the point that the claimed encyclopedic notability of Operation Show Me How as an especially important anti-drugs operation was unverified by sources (including the CIO magazine article which I uncovered myself during pre-nomination research). I took a look at Jreferee's presentation of new evidence. The origins of the Show Me How name is still a matter of totally unreferenced speculation. Proving the existence of a colouring book does not prove that a connection between the book and the operation name. And this is a marginal issue anyway. <i>One</i> (not two) new source is introduced - the article from the World News Connection database (a US govt. database of international news items, not a US govt service which produces news articles itself) which is said to discuss a French report which mentions the operation. (A link is provided which is supposed to go to the French anti-drugs organization which published the report, but it seems to go to a French academic centre for Latin American studies instead). But this is apparently a closed database, so I can only evaluate it currently on the basis of how it is described by Jreferee. Even overlooking this issue,I don't see how this information verifies that this operation is encyclopedically notable. The only information described as being in this source is the one line about Nigerians being arrested in the Czech Republic, and this helping to undermine drug gang activity in the Czech Republic. There isn't enough here to reopen the article, in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Please see my commentary on the new source above, where I looked through Jreferee's presentation. There actually hasn't been much presented since the afd at all. The CIO article and passing mentions in interpol reports were already discussed in the afd (Fresheneeze brings up one Interpol report which I don't think I've seen before, in which the operation is given a passing mention along with another operation. This source does not add anything to the information presented in the afd. Here's another interpol report which gives slightly more detail with a paragraph in the middle of a list of other drugs operations<a href="http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/GeneralAssembly/AGN68/Reports/AGN68R01.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/GeneralAssembly/AGN68/Reports/AGN68R01.pdf" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. The other two sources raised by Fresheneeze were discussed in the afd. There is still no evidence of encyclopedic notability, and very little is verified. Interpol is a major, leading international police organization. They run operations all the time.). I also ran a Factiva news database search too as mentioned in the afd nomination, in which nothing came up. Major drug bust successes (mostly non-encyclopedic in significance) are publicized in the news media. This operation, though it resulted in "numerous" seizures and arrests, wasn't. As I noted on the day of the DYK listing, this was a poor article choice for DYK, and it remains so. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 06:15, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Thanks very much for your abrupt comment, but I'm entirely within DRV bounds, I believe. My argument is based on the petitioner's evidence page which he put together <i>specifically for this DRV discussion</i> which pivots on assessing if sufficient new evidence has arisen. Are you suggesting that we should relist articles just because someone has put together a new evidence page without any assessment of the evidence page? I treated the petitioner seriously and even went ahead and found the report from the defunct organization for him. The petitioner's argument for relisting is based on his belief he has found several pieces of substantial new evidence. I don't believe he has. The French report he references <i>does not mention the Operation at all</i>. The news article about this French report which is also mentioned is in a closed database, and the way he describes it does not sound it is a substantial article. The magazine article was discussed in the original afd. Another piece of evidence is just speculation about the colouring book. Of the references provided by Freesheneeze, I point out that two of the refs were already discussed in the original afd, and the third I didn't think had significantly more information. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>We can certainly disagree on the validity of the sources, if these were presented at the AfD had I seen it, I likely would have suggested keeping. The simple fact remains that there is significant new material, and it should be relisted and discussed on those grounds. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:19, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Disagree with the reason for deletion (non-notabilty) and the manner of deletion (speedy).</p>
<p>This webcomic has been running for 5 years, several hundred strips and 2 print collections. The whole thorny issue of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is one that may be argued over for years but as I've mentioned with regard to <i>By The Saints</i> I feel that editors are overzealous in deleting on the grounds of 'non-notabilty' especially when it comes to webcomics.</p>
<p>Tales Of The Questor is the best webcomic I have ever seen, so why do lousy comics like "Darken" get an article? This comic is not un-notable, so why? Amitabho Chattopadhyay 03:54, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>At least <i>By the Saints</i> had an AfD review, but the <i>Tales of the Questor</i> article, after at least two <i>years</i> online, was speedily deleted by <a href="../../../n/a/c/User%7ENaconkantari_d810.html" title="User:Naconkantari">User:Naconkantari</a> on 3 January. I feel that speedy deletion in cases such as this goes completely against the grain of Wikipedia's democratic ideals. If an article is considered for deletion those involved in editing the article should have some say in the matter. Otherwise it looks as if any Admin can come along, look at an article and say "I don't like that, let's just dump it". <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 15:18, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Disagree with speedy deletion</b>. It should not only not have been speedily deleted (ie such a long lasting article should at least get a review) but it should not be deleted at all. The first print collection won the 2005 Ursa Major Award for Best Anthropomorphic Other Literary Work (though that is not noted on the wikipedia page, the wikifur entry <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Tales_of_the_Questor" class="external autonumber" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Tales_of_the_Questor" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> mentions it). ToTQ has also been the subject of significant "fan fiction" activity in the Comic Genesis forums which means it has enough of a following to draw committed artistic groupies. That would also make it notable. One went so far as to start an fan created animation <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/218174" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/218174" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> though that project seems to not be moving forward much. Recap, won a fan award, long-running comic, has seen print not once but twice (and Ralph Hayes Jr. shows enough signs of poor financial condition that these are not mere vanity prints, he lives from his comic income) and has created a stable of writers who produce derivative works making ToTQ the founding artistic work in what some call the "Questorverse". I would say that the article does need some work but the appropriate solution for that is to mark it as a stub article, not kill it outright without even a review. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> (<a href="../../../t/m/l/User_talk%7ETMLutas_94d6.html" title="User talk:TMLutas">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TMLutas_aa07.html" title="Special:Contributions/TMLutas">contribs</a>) 03:17, 12 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Endorse</b> without prejudice. The article in history does not assert -- or even mention -- any of the justifications against (speedy) deletion that have been raised here. Without comment regarding the merits of those arguments, admins cannot be expected to react to articles on the basis of information about the topic that is not <i>in</i> those articles. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the article wasn't protected, I would have simply added the award, which makes it notable, as well as probably improved the article in general. It's understandable that some of the early commentors might not have done their homework before commenting but after being notified that this is an award winner and given a link to an article demonstrating this, those early endorse comments should be discounted as being essentially uninformed. I would like to protest the idea that deletion is an appropriate response to an article that is notable but its notability was not included in the article to date. The emergence of notability means that the article should be restored and improved so that it includes the elements that make it notable. <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 21:03, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your argument, Sam, amounts to introducing a new speedy deletion criterion called "anything which would in the deleting admin's judgement not survive AfD".

<li><b>Endorse Deletion</b> Sam Blanning is correct that the history (log of article, history of AFD) shows the article was deleted by Jimfbleak before NeoChaosX even finished writing his AFD nomination. Any objection has to be to the speedy deletion by Jimfbleak. The deletion log also shows a speedy deletion an hour and a half earlier by Daniel Olson citing <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. Now, neither neologism nor dictionary definition is a speedy criteria, and "not a dictionary" and "neologism" are specifically called out at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Non-criteria" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Non-criteria</a> as not being a basis for speedy deletion; in the case of a neologism specifically because it needs wider input. But when I do a google search, I get (jamify - Wikipedia) I get no reliable sources, 39 uniques (including domain names for sale, people w/ a name of jamify, etc...) out of 236 total. So despite my bias towards extra process, this doesn't stand a chance at AFD, so I endorse the deletion because the extra process isn't worth it. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:21, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I will confirm that Sam Blanning is correct - I found the article, realized it didn't fall under a CSD category and began setting up an AFD; but when I was finished writing the AfD report it had already been speedied, so I closed the AfD. I'm no admin, so I'm not the one who deleted it. However, I do agree that the word deserves a legit chance at AfD, although a Google search suggested to me it wouldn't have a chance. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">walk</a>)</font> 18:09, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Image had fair use rationale, and was deleted as replaceable. I don't think its replaceable because I uploaded the image specifically to show readers the difference between (magnified) natural snow crystals and man-made snow particles - which requires a magnified view of the man-made snow. Obviously if a free version is found or made, it can replace the fair use image. Until then, I think the image is quite useful, useful enough to keep it anyway. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 05:57, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Can you provide a few more details? Specifically, where did the image come from and what article was it being used in? Thanks. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:58, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm the deleting admin. The image did not have a fair-use rationale, it just said "This picture should be used until a free close-up photograph of artificial snow is found", which isn't really an explanation of why the image qualifies as fair use. In answer to BigDT, it came from <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/class/class.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/class/class.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/class/class.htm</a> and was being used in <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow.html" title="Snow">Snow</a>. I agree this image isn't as easily replaceable as a photograph of a building or bridge, but neither is it so <i>very</i> unlikely that either there's a Wikipedian with access to a snow cannon and magnifying equipment to take a freely licensed picture, or that some branch of the U.S. government doesn't already have a magnified image of artificial snow that's in the public domain. As ever, a fair use image is replaceable if a free equivalent <i>could</i> be made, even if such a free equivalent has not yet been made or found. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 09:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> per Angr. Thank you for clarifying. I should point out, Fresheneesz, that on the source website's copyright page - <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/copyright/copyright.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/copyright/copyright.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/copyright/copyright.htm</a> - they seem somewhat agreeable to allowing others to use their images. If you email them to ask, they may be willing to release one under the GFDL. (Please note that simply having permission to use it for non-commercial purposes or having permission to use it on Wikipedia is not enough - it needs to be released under a "free" license, such as the GFDL.) Please see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission</a> for more information and at the bottom, there is a sample letter that you can use.

<p>My fault about the fair use rationale (or lackthereof), I had thought I provided rationale, but since I can't see this history.. well I couldn't remember.

<li>The article was around for 29 days before an AfD was created, which serves as a "time to make this an article" five-day warning, easily long enough to find sources at the very least (currently, custom doesn't even require that they be used in the article). The "time period" that you ask for totals one month, three days. Does it really take over a month to expand an article on something notable beyond a sentence?

<p>It's not an advertisement</p>
<p>I see no difference in terms of written information between this page and the other shoe company pages I've seen on Wikipedia - which I researched and looked into before posting this.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Shoe_companies" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Shoe_companies" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Shoe_companies</a></p>
<p>Do you simply not allow information about small companies? Is that the issue? If so, please realize that the shoe industry is a very small world. The reason I'm putting this up on Wikipedia specifically is because of the number of designers-in-training that are ending up on our site, both from the US and internationally. It's far easier for them to be able to go down a list of shoe manufacturers and see if the company makes the kind of products they want to design than it is to go to each individual website, or such was my thinking. As you can see reading the article, the information presented specifically tells young designers what they need to know about this line. Isn't that part of the purpose of Wikipedia?</p>
<p>If the size of the company is the issue, then I strongly feel you need to rethink that policy, particularly when you're talking about this sort of industry. My next entry was going to be on Ars Sutoria, but if Wikipedia is just going to delete it, then I won't waste my time.</p>

<p>The article Quikbook was not made intentionally as spam. It's was legitimate information about a privately held Hotel booking company specializing in boutique hotels that's been in business for around 20 years. Some of the questionable marketing content could have been edited instead, but overall, listing the company is warranted. Independent articles mentioning the company have appeared in various publications over the years (ie. Washington Post, NY Times, Money Magazine, CNN.com). Its entry should be no less legitimate than some of its more generic competitors in the industry (travelocity, orbitz). 20:30 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know that in the past the Kingsofchaos wikipedia article was littered with petty in game politics and things that could not be proven. However, the article at the time of deletion was in the process of a complete cleanup, including citation of notable sources. One of said sources was a major periodical, The Washington Post. Another of said sources was a video played on a local news channel. For these reasons I ask that the article be reinstated and in some way locked to prevent vandalism by petty KoC players that feel they should be a part of the article. Furthermore, much of the information that I and others added to the game history can be found in its changelog on its front page <a href="http://www.kingsofchaos.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.kingsofchaos.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsofchaos.com/</a>. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoop0x7b_ef1a.html" title="User:Snoop0x7b">Snoop0x7b</a> 18:52, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>What a messy AFD for the low number of participants. However, it does become reasonably clear that there was consensus that independent sourcing was going to be essentially impossible. This brings the article afoul of our various notability guidelines, most importantly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and most specifically <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The Washington Post article described above was not mentioned in the AFD. It is mentioned (unfortunately, not linked) in the deleted article, as "An article in the Washington Post on 24 December 2004 discussed the everyday lives of the four creators" (personal info on them omitted here). Based on that description, I'd have to say it isn't primarily about the game, so doesn't help establish notability. I'm currently leaning towards endorsing deletion, but I want to read the closer's rationale, so I've dropped {{<a href="../../../d/r/v/Template%7EDRVNote_6736.html" title="Template:DRVNote">DRVNote</a>}} on their talk page. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>you missed something then, if you go to the bottom of the page and read citations, the washington post web article is definately there; atleast as per the last revision that I looked at. And yes it was relatively messy; but again we were in the process of a colaborative cleanup; and I do not believe that mistakes of past wikipedians (I.E. crapification of the article) should impact those seeking to make a page that is both factually accurate and independently confirmable. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoop0x7b_ef1a.html" title="User:Snoop0x7b">Snoop0x7b</a> 19:43, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - the distinction between 'overturn and delete' and 'speedy delete' is a bit academic here, because if someone did delete the article it wouldn't halt this discussion (as a speedy deletion halts an AfD). We'd still be having a discussion about whether to delete the article, only it would be about a speedy deletion instead. 'Overturn and delete' and 'speedy delete' amounts to the same thing at DRV's closing, except if we speedy delete the page before the closing, non-admins won't be able to see the page and there'll be a confusing break in the direction of the bolded words in the middle of the discussion. Anyway, <b>delete</b>, not compatible with the goal of building an encyclopaedia.

<p><b>Endorse closure</b>. As a Wikiproject, working on either referencing or removing the claims of debunkers, or indeed of quacks, this has merit.

<li><b>Wow.</b> I closed this AfD so I guess I can't vote, but: (1) I didn't find the arguments for deletion to be particulary strong and I still don't, and (2) the idea that projects aren't and can't be allowed to keep lists of articles of interest, liable for the introduction of biased material by self-interested parties, to be watched that reason, is plain scary.

If you rename it to something without the word quackery, then it isn't the same article, but I would assume that the lead would have to change as well to reflect the title. If that were the case then it is a different article anyway, so delete it. There is no reason this author should not have to work within NPOV guidelines just like the rest of us.

I have just perused the space where the article is being editted and discussed now (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Pseudoscience/List_of_articles_related_to_quackery" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Pseudoscience/List_of_articles_related_to_quackery" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>) and it seems that its most staunch defenders are claiming that it is a private article and outside viewpoints are unwelcomed (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Pseudoscience/List_of_articles_related_to_quackery&amp;diff=100428339&amp;oldid=100381949" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Pseudoscience/List_of_articles_related_to_quackery&amp;diff=100428339&amp;oldid=100381949" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>). Are the rules different in Wiki Project spaces? Is article ownership allowed there?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - AfDs are <i>not</i> a vote. The closing admin reviews the votes, but they are weighted by the arguments. In this case, the closing admin found <b>move to project space</b> the better argument. However, that should have included renaming &amp; editing the article to make it NPOV, which apparently was neglected. Also, yes, rules are different in project space, as they are not actual articles (which is why I endorsed moving/merging this list there). I am disappointed it was left in a very NPOV (possibly <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a>) form, but this <i>can</i> be fixed. I'm abstaining here, but pointing out what the AfD actually reached consensus on, as there seems to be some misunderstanding. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 23:36, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Query</b> - there is much support (as demonstrated here) to delete this article entirely from Wikipedia. It is clear that the page's "owners" are unwilling to compromise their POV and change this from an attack piece to an NPOV article. Is this the right forum to vote this page off of Wikipedia or is there a better place to do this? Do we need to nominate the Wiki Project article for deletion now and go throught he whole process over again?

<p><b>Delete</b> Project space is not a refuge for POV attacks that are unacceptable in the main Wikipedia. Allowing this list to stay creates a precedent which gives attack groups a back-door into Wikipedia. How about: Articles related to Communism (Hillary Clinton, New York Times, Stalin, Pol Pot, mass murder, etc.) or Articles related to Fascism (Hitler, genocide, George Bush, Republican Party, Fox News Channel, etc.)&#160;? <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxPont_6146.html" title="User:MaxPont">MaxPont</a> 10:36, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>According to Docg***</p>
<p>1***) The list is against the neutrality of the encyclopedia as labeling people or subject matter as quack or quackery.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Answer: The simple answer is changing the title to the 'List of articles related to scientific skepticism'.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the name of science, this list will follow in the foot steps of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pseudosciences_and_pseudoscientific_concepts.html" title="List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts">List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts‎</a>.</p>
<p>2***) This list is against the seriousness of this project.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Answer: The topic matter of *scientific skepticsim* is very serious. The purpose of 'Wikipedia' is to build the world's largest (and of course best) 'free encyclopedia'!</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>*What is scientific skepticism?*</i></p>
<p>Like a scientist, a scientific skeptic aims to decide claims based on verifiability and falsifiability rather than accepting claims on faith, anecdotes, or relying on unfalsifiable categories. Skeptics often focus their criticism on claims they consider to be implausible, dubious or clearly contradictory to generally accepted science. This distinguishes the scientific skeptic from the professional scientist, who often concentrates her or his enquiry on verifying or falsifying hypotheses created by those within her or his field of science. Scientific skeptics do not assert that unusual claims should be automatically rejected out of hand on a priori grounds - rather they argue that claims of paranormal or anomalous phenomena should be critically examined and that such claims would require extraordinary evidence in their favour before they could be accepted as having validity.</p>
<p>3***) This list is against the spirit of WP:BLP.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Answer: Simple solution: The list of persons has already been whacked and permanetely eliminated. In fact, there is no BLP concerns because the persons sections was removed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Simple problems have simple answers. The process of developing and improving this new list is underway. The comments made by many Wikipedians has and will conitune to strengthen the article. In the last 24 hours the list has gone thru some changes. The POV title can be changed with just one click. The topic is scientific, serious, and important. In the spirit and harmony of Wikipedia I merely ask this list remain and continue to sprout, expand, and strengthen its roots &amp; beginnings on Wiki. As the information is updated the list will become more focused, directed, and centered for all to read, get informed, and educated. As I journey onward in the project, I will continue the collaboration process.</p>
<p>Good will to all and god bless. Cheers from a true believer, advocate, and promoter of Wikipedia. --QuackGuru 18:27, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The list has been updated within the last 24 hours. Most of the comments made by Wikipedians to delete refers to a prior version that no longer exists. Comments such as the BLP concerns no longer are valid. So, most of the deletion comments do not pertain to the current version.

<li><b>Observation</b> Qguru, I think you mean this list will benefit the donation box of Stephen Barrett Enterprises, a so-called 'non-profit' whose actual non-profit status can't seem to be verfied. Many Wikipedian articles in your "list" have been fertilized with numerous links to SBE (Donations Gladly Accepted!) by his disciples. Even your list has multiple SBE links. I was wondering if you are in some way connected with him. Could you let us know, eh? This is one of my concerns as to why it, IMO, doesn't pass the smell test no matter where you place it.

<li>My main grip is that judging "consensus to transwiki and delete" was premature, and Proto was wrong to delete. I admit that that as articles, the pages were substandard. But there could be found a solution, within wikipedia, other than delete. I didn't agree with transwiki because the contents of the page are not, in my opinion, suitable for <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:harrypotter" class="extiw" title="wikia:harrypotter">wikia:harrypotter</a> nearly as much as for wikipedia. I also have a serious problem with <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:harrypotter" class="extiw" title="wikia:harrypotter">wikia:harrypotter</a> being substantially a copyright infringement as a derivative work (debatably). A better solution would be to merge to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_in_translation_3067.html" title="Harry Potter in translation">Harry Potter in translation</a>. Unfortunately, this can not be done properly without undeletion because the pages' histories and discussions have been lost. Note that the pages were very old and had a great many contributors (contributors who thought there contributions were worthy).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I propose that the pages be undeleted and marked to state that the contents are not encyclopedic (excessively long lists) and that they are to be merged with similar pages (probably <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_in_translation_3067.html" title="Harry Potter in translation">Harry Potter in translation</a>). Time must be allowed for the merge to ensure that the effect on the destination page(s) is an improvement.

<dd>Simple math says you're wrong. 10 deletes, 3 keeps. Hard to understand? The point of the Wiki is to write about HP in an "in-universe style" (which I'm assuming is why you referenced the MOS). As far as "derivative work" goes, you've yet to show any examples of how this applies. If you can find any (which you won't) feel free to continue this discussion on my talk page. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reaves_5821.html" title="User:John Reaves">John Reaves</a> 23:24, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Comment, satire &amp; analysis are considered "transformative", a key meaningful word used by US courts. Transformation breaks the "derivative work" problem. This is here a tangent on a tangent.

<dd>Again, note the consensus was to delete. It got transwiki'd to the wikia project as a sidenote, rather than as the aim of the AFD close. Only 3 people suggesting transwiking to Wiktionary out of the 16 people who contributed to the discussion (10 requested 'delete'). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 14:00, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, that is not consensus. Its sounds like you are holding on to the rejected <a href="../../../s/u/p/Wikipedia%7ESupermajority_264c.html" title="Wikipedia:Supermajority">Wikipedia:Supermajority</a>. It is not even the ill-defined <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_consensus.html" title="Rough consensus">rough consensus</a>. Transwiki does not mean delete; you have to leave a redirect to preserve the history. Several of the "Delete"s were refuted. Never has is been necessary to "refute" every "delete" argument. There were arguments for "keep" that were not answered. I really do not think your definition of consensus is mainstream. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 03:28, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Two problems. One, if there is a good reason for deletion, it should be just as necessary to refute all the deletes as it is to refute all the keeps.
<dl>
<dd>No, to refute means to prove wrong. It is a very strong word. An argument may be weak without being refutable. Also No because the default is to “keep”. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 03:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And two, if it's indeed a non-mainstream opinion, <i>why</i> does only one person agree with you? -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 03:38, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, I am surprised at the limited support and the vehemence of opposition. I really can’t see why my proposal is so abhorrent. How can it hurt? The final solution, a redirect, is very cheap. Perhaps another answer is that there is a biased culture of deletionism here in the Afd pages. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 03:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have tried to contact the closing admin before bringing this to DR, however the closing admin has not responded to my thoughts on their talk page, hence I proceeded with the process. I believe that the closing admin had not followed the <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">Deletion Guidelines for administrators</a> which quite clearly states:</p>
<p><small>Note also that the three key policies, which warrant that articles and information be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, avoid being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> are held to be non-negotiable' and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines or by editors' consensus.</small></p>
<p>While I was the only person who had made the decision about deleting the article, I do believe I was correct in my thoughts. The only sources provided are links to the club's webpage, a homestead.com page which has been disabled, a personal angelfire.com webpage listing the owner as a missing person (which is a direct copy of one of the external links from doenetwork.us) and finally a blog from a band that played there years ago. When I pressed for Multiple, Independent, Reputable, Reliable, Third-Party, Non-Trivial Published sources, the only link was to a local news article that spoke only of the missing club owner but said nothing about the club at all. There were no sources provided about the club. <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> was brought as the reason to keep but no one could provide any sources that satisfied <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As for <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> it states:</p>
<p><small>If enough reliable and verifiable information exists about the subject to write a full and comprehensive article about it, it may make sense for the subject to have its own article. If some source material is available, but is insufficient for a comprehensive article, it is better to mention the subject under the article for its parent locality. If no source material, or only directory-type information (location, function, name, address) can be provided, the subject may not merit mention yet at all.</small></p>
<p>As it is, There are are not enough Reliable and Verifiable information sources to validate an article. We can't ignore the fact that there are no news stories on the club itself. What I am saying again is, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> can not be ignored.

<li><b>Endorse deletions</b> but there is room for creation of a new article. The articles have not made use of and cited the sources. I see enough sourcing that an article that actually used and cited the independent sourcing would stand a chance at AFD, although some of those sources are trivial and others may not be deemed reliable. The historical versions are eminently deletable. I recommend writing a new article at a user subpage or on our own computer's text editor, citing <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">independent</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources using your <a href="../../../c/t/t/WP%7ECTT_ba6c.html" title="WP:CTT">citation templates</a> and references system, and then creating the article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:47, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Deleted 5 times. First was an attack page only, so ignore it. Second time was the first AFD; his own site was an external link and there were no other sources. Third was a dubious G4, but applied to something not an encyclopedia article and with no sourcing. Fourth was a G4 during the second AFD, same content as the third, no sourcing. Fifth was an A7 immediately after your {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} tagging, no sourcing.

<li>Have a look at a new preliminary version at User:Knverma/Bill Britt. So what is the next step?
<dl>
<dd>The page is not protected deleted, so the new article can be moved in. I believe that it is not A7 eligible because of the references to news coverage and not G4 eligible because it is far more extensive than prior versions, and has independent sourcing. I think you'll get the move button in the next 24-48 hours (it is only available to those who have been a registered user for at least four days). <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>. Version in Knverma's user space also reads as advertorial. The fact is, Amway people are usually not significant outside of Amway, and the majority of sources are not independent. Admittedly I am deeply suspicious of terms like "Crown Ambassadro level" in <s>pyramid</s> MLM schemes. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 20:47, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let me clarify. Am I adversiting Bill Britt? What about the criticism and lawsuits section? I am citing newspaper articles, are they not independent? I cited the IBOA site only as proof that he is crown ambassador and that he is on the IBOA board. OK, Amway people are not significant outside Amway, but Amway itself has 3-4 million distributors. Why are all these newspapers talking about them? Britt is not just another Amway guy. There is a small chance of him being called "the most significant" distributor (this is open to contest). -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 21:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The term crown ambassador is an official title amwarded by Amway. It just indicated that he is among the select few people in the eyes of Amway. Hence I see no ground for any suspicion. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 21:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, he nominated it here, I told him (above) that I endorse the deletion because none of the prior articles used source. Because he'd shown sources here, I also told him that he should write a new article in userspace. A bit later, he moved it into main space. Guy and I disagree about whether the new article is good enough to keep or not. But since the page has never been salted; deletion review does not have to give permission for the new article. Only when both 1) a page is salted or protected redirected and 2) we get asked does deletion review have any say over creation of new articles. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 05:04, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The composer is well known among students and associates of American composer Stanley Hollingsworth, and was regionally very well known in Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Canada in the late 70's and throughout the 80's as a member of the Flauto e Basso Baroque Duo. Significant within the world of modern harpsichord music. Morphixnm 03:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> - consensus was clear at the AFD. With no data (sources) on the Baroque Duo, it isn't significant additional information. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:51, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>COMMENT. The fact that information is not available by googling is not an accurate measure for past or even present significance. The documentation for Flauto e Basso is available only by looking at microfilms of press articles, reviews, and public radio (WDET) broadcast records from twenty years ago, all pre-internet. I don't have the time or resources to put all that material up on the internet for the sake of this article. Public concert performances of Jencka's chamber music compositions have occurred in San Francisco, Atlanta, Toronto, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Detroit, and other cities, but not to large, attention-grabbing audiences. At any rate, the direct connection with American composer Stanley Hollingsworth would convince anyone who knew much about 20th century classical music that the serious work of one of his long-time students was worth noting in a brief entry such as was deleted.</li>

<p>Suggesting an overturn of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kimberly_Franklin_071e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kimberly Franklin">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kimberly Franklin</a>. All of the keep arguments were based on a flawed assessment of PORNBIO criterion #7 ("There is an original film (not a compilation) named after the performer"). Franklin's filmography includes a compilation titled <i>A Cum Sucking Whore Named Kimberly Franklin</i>, which was probably thrown together by the production company to squeeze more money out of stock scenes. There were no substantive arguments brought up by the keep votes, just a chorus of "she passes PORNBIO #7". However Kimberly Franklin fails every other inclusion criterion under the sun, she has made some thirty films, well beneath the one hundred film standard proposed by PORNBIO. The article on her is poorly written, uninformative, and not just a little creepy. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 18:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Relist</b> This discussion seems to be turning into an argument for the inefficiency of PORNBIO in general, and criterion #7 in particular. As pointed out above, however, this subject apparently <i>fails</i> PORNBIO notability in general, and criterion #7 notability in particular. The AfD was based on a flawed interpretation of #7. The failure was with the AfD process, not the notability standards. There seems to be sufficient cause to relist for AfD. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:16, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Overturn and relist</b> Five of the seven "Keep" recommendations were based on the erroneous statement that she meets <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> #7. She doesn't, and some other reason will need to be found for a recommendation of "Keep" for the next <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a>. The criterion specifically states that the film must be an original, not a compilation; the film being cited is a compilation. Additionally, the only information in the article that is sourced is her name, her height, and the name of her sister. Nothing in the article asserts her notability.

<p>Here we go again. This article does not assert any notability for the school aside from being old (which, in and of itself, is not necessarily a criteria for keeping an article using <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> any longer), and this claim of age is not cited; in fact, it is not even supported by the school's web site, which makes no mention of the school before the 1880s. The article cites no non-trivial reliable sources, just the school's web site and an Ofsted report. The AfD, closed by <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">User:Doc glasgow</a> without any rationale given, was closed as a keep. The only rationale given by the three keep&#160;!voters is that the school meets WP:SCHOOLS by being old. Meanwhile, six people&#160;!voted for delete, in addition to one&#160;!vote for redirect (thereby noting that the school does not stand up on its own) and the nominator. This gives an 8-to-3, or 72.7%, consensus going <i>against</i> the closer's decision (which, again, was given without any reasoning). <b>Overturn and delete or redirect.</b> <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Admin's rationale</b> I hate School articles and would delete the lot. But there is no consensus to do so, as hundreds of AfDs have shown. If you want something deleted you needs a clear consensus for deletion, all other option (retain as is, merge, redirect) are editorial decisions that have nothing to do with AfD. There is no consensus to delete in this debate, which means a 'default keep' closure. If numbers matter we had 6 straight delete&#160;!votes verse 4 verses votes otherwise (3 keep and 1 redirect). (1 vote I discounted since it said 'delete or merge/redirect' - it isn't clear whether that person wishes the article deleted or not). That means 6:4, and 60% is not a consensus. Beyond arithmetic there is no policy reason to override the lack of consensus. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is not policy, and no-one was suggesting the article was unverifiable. I <b>stand by my closure</b>. Sure, another admin may have called it differently, but this was within reasonable judgement. Editors are welcome to merge or redirect this if they wish.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 18:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>First, in your 6/4 count, you did not count the nominator, who obviously should be taken into account, as the nominator (by the very nature of the position) feels that the article should be deleted.</s> Second, a redirect should not count as an "otherwise"&#160;!vote. Someone urging for redirection is noting that 1) they do not feel the article can stand on its own, and 2) there is nothing in the article that is important enough (or sufficiently verified) to be placed in another article. If there were 8 delete&#160;!votes, 1 keep&#160;!vote, and 3 redirect&#160;!votes, you surely wouldn't keep the article as no consensus even though 11 of the 12&#160;!voters do not feel the article should exist. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 20:02, 8 January 2007 (UTC) <small>The nominator <i>was</i> counted.

<li>My, I certainly didn't realize that&#160;!voting "delete or redirect" would get me ignored by closing admins; I do so based on proposed guidelines at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, and thought it would be obvious that my feeling was that the article should not be kept as a stand-alone article.

<li><b>Overturn and delete</b>, with no independent non-trivial coverage in the article or cited by those arguing to keep, consensus and policy both point towards deletion. AfD is not a vote and consensus is not a percentage value - not 70%, not 60%, not 99% - but with such a weight of opinion backed up by policy and no strong arguments coming the other way that make them void, there's clearly a consensus here, and not to keep.

<dd>I'm not sure how its plain wrong when I'm citing the policy directly, unless you mean the policy is wrong. Kicking222 and Sam Blanning have raised <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues here. I don't see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review#South_DeKalb_Mall" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review#South_DeKalb_Mall" rel="nofollow">South DeKalb deletion review</a> as a "red herring" comparison. In that afd, you closed as keep when there was a 8-to-3 majority against keep as well, and lack of non-trivial sources are at the centre of that review debate too. The references in the school article are currently: 1) the school's own website and brochure 2) reports by government school inspectors. If this is sufficient sourcing then <i>every school has its own publication about itself and has been inspected by a government authority</i> is supposedly encyclopedically notable.

<li>Merging and redirecting remains an editorial option even if an AFD is closed as a keep.

Continuing the debate here is pointless, because if the deletion is overturned, it will be sent back to afd for a re-run. If the deletion is upheld, there will almost certainly be a second nomination afd sometime soon. We go back to AfD either way. Unless anyone objects in the next few hours, I'm going to relist this article on AfD, without prejudice, and let's hope for a clear consensus there.

I have been saying "redirect" all along, and I could certainly live with a merge of verifiable information (and an unmerge, if you will, when more sources are made apparent), but at this point, the WP:RS issue is still unsolved. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 20:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Overturn, delete</b>. No assertion of significance or importance is provided in both the article and the AfD - in fact this is a borderline A7 speedy. The closing admin is encouraged to give a rationale when a decision will predicably evoke controversy.
<dl>
<dd>Guy has already commented on the significance; even though DRV is not AfD this should be expanded a little further for the participants here who are not English. In England education did not come under the purview of the government until the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_Education_Act_1870_34c3.html" title="Elementary Education Act 1870">Forster Act</a> of 1870. Before that the responsibility of providing education lay with the parishes. Judging from the name, this school was set up by a Catholic parish to provide primary education to the children of (presumably Irish) labourers. In a time when the population in the Midlands rose quickly, this was one amongst hundreds. There are no sources for any of this in the article, though. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 20:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not going to&#160;!vote in this discussion, because trying to convince the SCHOOL cartel that not every school in the world is notable is futile.

<li><b>Endorse closure</b> - There has been no suggestion that the article breaches any WP policies.

<li>I see no history. According to the article, it existed. It may not harm the project as long as the writers keep watching the page, and as long as the school prospectus isn't false, which it very well might be—even if they aren't aggrandizing the history of the school or mutating it, I doubt it their prospectus is the product of a historian. Then, once these people stop watching the article, the article will decay, people will spend time reverting it—or not—until finally some students start adding nasty remarks about their teachers and the article is protected. Then it will be deleted in a year anyway because, shockingly, no one adds any reliable sources. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>According to the article, nothing ever happened there. It was found 192 years ago, then the location was moved to a new building 40 years later, then it "remained in the same location from 1863 through 2002." Fascinating, all that history.

<p>The day before this article was deleted I edited it substantially to include links and references to prove her notability, but I believe the edit and the points I made on the deletion talk page were overlooked. The references I included give her two credits from the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I asked the administrator to review this but he never responded and now is on administrative Wikibreak. Pui-Mun Law is probably the most well known watercolorist in contemporary fantasy working today and her clients include every big name in the business; she's also done work for authors who have their own Wiki articles and other editors have included her name in related articles such as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairy_painting.html" title="Fairy painting">Fairy painting</a>. There are many fantasy artists of much lesser renown with Wiki articles, so if hers remains deleted then they should ALL be reviewed (so as not to show personal bias) and therefore maybe the notability of contemporary fantasy artists in general is in question. I hope the page edit I made still exists to show undeletion for this article should be carefully considered. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkgod_048b.html" title="User:Inkgod">Inkgod</a> 04:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I had already opined in this AFD before this edit and comment on the deletion review. I glanced at it at the time, and saw no reason to comment again in the AFD.

These awards are fan awards awarded at one of two Gen Con sites, which used to be when I was a gamer long ago the top RPG con in North America.

<dd>The article could be expanded biographically; there are genre sites that have reprinted much of the existing information in various length and form, and there are neutral interviews from reliable sites including the Crescent Blues one (which was done by a writer from <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Fiction_Weekly_3b82.html" title="Science Fiction Weekly">Science Fiction Weekly</a>). I've also found more references that cement her heavy notability in the field, including work done for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Swanwick_8872.html" title="Michael Swanwick">Michael Swanwick</a>, a list from <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locus_%28magazine%29.html" title="Locus (magazine)">Locus (magazine)</a> recognizing her credits, and an upcoming project with <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Elmore_c793.html" title="Larry Elmore">Larry Elmore</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Hm. When you say "reprinted the information", reprinted the information from where? An official bio? Also, I'm not sure working for a notable employer automatically implies notability for a subject, otherwise every single employee from a large company would automatically meet the criteria. In addition, what is "large"? That seems subjective to me, so it's actually better to argue from sources instead of how large something is, because people can just argue back that it's not "large enough". Lastly, you misuse the term "neutral interview" - interviews by their very nature report the subject's words, and therefore would not be neutral (due to the subject being a primary source. However, any bio information in an interview is secondary source material.). Remember, with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, we can remove anything that isn't sourced, even if it's accurate (because we have no way of verifying such), so the artists you mentioned may be valid removals, even if we have heard of them. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 14:59, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I meant reprinted as the content in each is largely similar - yes, the base source may have been a published bio; when I used the word "neutral" in regards to it and the interview though, I meant extracting the neutral, factual information, such as schooling, a timeline and accomplishments... nothing subjective like personal opinion. The primary source material should be her prolific artwork done in the industry, which brings notability (good or bad) because fantasy games and books (and their synonymous artists/artwork) are an entertainment medium with an inherent worldwide fanbase; a comparison would be an actor working for a movie studio, not just a lineworker working for Boeing, and the validity of <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizards_of_the_Coast_1d36.html" title="Wizards of the Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gen_Con_0fbf.html" title="Gen Con">Gen Con</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/HarperCollins_e546.html" title="HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a> etc. has already been documented in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong Support:</b> I do not understand why this was deleted. To some it may seems to be vandalism, however it is not. Since Wikipedia should have "something on everything" it should have this article. First off, this page <i>did not</i> support vandalization, it just explained techniques and talked about people that have vandalized before. This is truly an information article and not one that was meant to be a vandalization. Wikipedia should not be exclusive in it's content, for that is censorism. This article needs to stay. BTW, I am not sure if the above title is correct, someone please help me out here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen-Dragon_28f3.html" title="User:Green-Dragon">Green-Dragon</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGreen-Dragon_26ea.html" title="User talk:Green-Dragon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Green-Dragon_d473.html" title="Special:Contributions/Green-Dragon">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> Giving instructions for vandalising Wikipedia - or any Wiki - is vandalism as much as actually vandalising articles.

<p>This should be a pretty straight-forward unprotection. Anyways, the previous, deleted article was about some blogger. However, <i>Rance</i> also is the name of a well-known Japanese series of <s><a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novel.html" title="Visual novel">visual novels</a></s> RPGs. <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rance" class="external text" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rance" rel="nofollow">Has a very long article over at the Japanese Wikipedia.</a> I'm not quite sure if the article <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rance.html" title="Rance">Rance</a> should be for this series with a Template:For1, or if it should be made into a disambig page. I would like for opinions on that. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 11:21, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I don't read a lick of Japanese, but the article there looks like it has a pair of warning flag templates on top, so I'd prefer to be cautious. I'd recommend cleaning up the what links here list for Rance then using {{tl:For1}} on top unless there is something else appropriate for this name. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The article was unfairly targeted as "non-notable fancruft" by Ezeu who has an axe to grind against flash games and are forms of video games. This is a real video game and it has had an impact. The supporters who voted against deletion included the following users and their comments:</p>

<li><i><b>Do not delete.</b> The rules of citation in Wikipedia exist to ensure the quality and encyclopedia-worthiness of the articles. A well written article about a flash game that has been played by millions of people is clearly encyclopedia-worthy. Documentation of the type desired is not possible, because official references on this game do not exist, but because the game is significant, the spirit rather than the letter of the rules on citation should be followed in this case, and the article should be allowed to remain.

<li><i><b>Do Not Delete.</b> Blogs may not always be the most reliable sources, but Ben Leffler's blog is a primary source.

<li><b>Restore the article</b> I just would like to make a point. Whether or not the article is restored really isn't much of an issue anymore since overwhelmingly the sentiment seems to be against restoring it. I have seen articles deleted because they are nonsense and or fake, etc. What I am perplexed by is the fact that Exmortis is neither nonsense, nor is it made-up, but it is real thing (in this case a real series of flash games). If video games can be considered wikipedia articles why then must this game because it uses blogs as sources be designated as non-notable/unreliable? If Exmortis didn't exist I would support the deletion -- but the game exists, it clearly has a cult following, it pushes the boundaries of the flash game genre -- but it is still non-notable fancruft? The case could equally be made that other articles on wikipedia (that deal with video games as well as other topics) are also non-notable? And yet such articles are not deleted because they may have a vast array of so-called "reliable" sources that happen not to be blogs. I do not really see the merits of this policy. It is rather self-destructive. I don't like that fact that people question the validity of this game. It exists, it has a cult-following, so why can't wikipedia have an article on it? This situation simply does not make any sense to me. Ladb2000

<p>I have reviewed the deletion policy and still have no idea why the page was deleted. WfMC is a non-profit organization which produces technology standards, some standards you even list in wikipedia. Pages on those standards refer to WfMC but there is no page on the subject. So I added it. The cryptic removal note says "copyvio" which I assume means copyright violation and refers to a press release which has a substantially similar description of the coalition. The first paragraph was the same description that the coalition approves for use in all press releases about coalition activities. It is a well crafted paragraph which explain quickly and succinctly the working of the coalition. Am I to assume that you can not make Wikipedia articles about any subject which has been mentioned in a press release. I put significantly more work into the page which was original content as well. I don't see any indication that there was copyright violation. It is my first page creation on wikipedia, so it may be that I don't understand the rules, but I have re-read the gidelines many times. There are other pages on other similar organizations. There was nothing defamitory or anything that anyone would object to. It was objective and I believe would generally be helpful to people using the wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/o/f/User%7EGoflow6206_aff5.html" title="User:Goflow6206">Goflow6206</a> 22:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK well, I am learning. Thanks for the patience. Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) is a legitimate consortium which has had a defining effect on the information technology industry over the last 13 years. There are 300 member organizations spread across the world. There are local chapters in Japan, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Taiwan, Korea, and a number of other place. The standards are incorportated into dozens of commercial products, as well as a dozen or so open source workflow systems. There are many academic paper written on the subject of the subjects of comparing research implementations to the WfMC reference architecture. I will try to collect "evidence" of this notability. Seriously, the coalition is at the center of a lot of important research -- I realize being in a very specific field somethings are obvious but those outside of the field it is not so obvious. I have no interest in "advertisement" but in providing a clear succinct description of what the coalition is to those people looking for this information. But it is going to take some time until I get the proof that it is important enough. Until that time, wikipedia will have to do without a page on the Workflow Management Coalition.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm <b>Abstaining</b>, though before the comment above I'd probably have supported it's deletion. However if evidence (such as the academic papers, or coverage of WfMC in the media etc...) is shown I'd support overturning the deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 06:31, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This wikipedia page, which discussed me (Dr. Ben Goertzel), was deleted, I believe after a deletion request made by someone who is angry at my colleague Bruce Klein because of politics within the Immortality Institute. This individual has been vandalizing the agiri.org wiki site and spamming Bruce's colleagues for a few weeks recently. I am a PhD scientist with 17 years track record. I have about 75 refereed publications including 7 books with major scientific publishers, and am currently CEO of an AI software consulting company, Novamente LLC (whose Wikipedia page was also deleted, but I am focusing on getting mine restored first, as IMO the case why I merit a Wikipedia entry is even more obvious). I am also CEO of a bioinformatics software consulting company, Biomind LLC, which is currently helping to build a major portal site for the NIH, Immport, and has an ongoing relationship with the CDC which has resulted in a number of refereed co-authored publications in Pharmacogenomics. The wikipedia page on me was brief and not very extensive (a little more than a "stub", though), but there are plenty of other scientists with weaker publication records than me who have wikipedia pages, so I don't really see why mine should have been deleted. Apparently it was deleted simply because some individual who was mad at my colleague Bruce Klein requested it to be so. It was not a "self-promotion" page -- in fact I never edited that page. I encourage you to reinstate the page, or else discuss this matter with me at ben@goertzel.org. Thanks, Dr. Ben Goertzel 69.140.44.37 20:03, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi Ben. Your article has actually been deleted twice. The first time was the result of a full Articles for Deletion discussion on 7 August 2005 (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ben_Goertzel_2d14.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben Goertzel">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben Goertzel</a>) where the entire community was invited to debate the merits of the article and its subject. It was decided that your notability had not been established to Wikipedia's standards. I don't think the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Klein_707c.html" title="Bruce Klein">Bruce Klein</a> article even existed at that point. Your article was subsequently recreated and deleted a second time on 2 January 2007 through <a href="../../../s/d/_/WP%7ESD_2382.html" title="WP:SD">an expedited process</a> because the new article also failed to establish your notability. I was present on IRC when the matter of the second deletion was raised. (I remember the incident because you and I know each other, so I was surprised to see the name of your company mentioned.) The decision to delete the article for a second time was made by <a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar">User:Alkivar</a>, a DJ who has no connection with you, Bruce Klein, Biomind, Novamente, or any other company you are associated with.

<p><b><s>Abstain for now.</s></b> This article/list/category has a most convoluted history:</p>
<ol>
<li>First it was spun off from <a href="../../../f/i/e/FieldTurf_74a2.html" title="FieldTurf">FieldTurf</a> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_FieldTurf_installations_a3eb.html" title="List of FieldTurf installations">List of FieldTurf installations</a>.</li>
<li>Then it was nominated for AfD - the consenus was keep.</li>
<li>Next I found it, and without noticing the fist AfD, nominated it yet again. This time the result was categorize to Category:FieldTurf installations.</li>
<li>A few days later, this category was nominated for CfD - the result this time was listify.</li>
<li>Now we're going around in circles, passing this article back and forth like a <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_potato.html" title="Hot potato">hot potato</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am bringing this article to deletion review because I want to get some sort of definitive ruling.

<li>Speaking as someone who's a fan of an American football team that recently installed FieldTurf on their playing surface, it was quite newsworthy. I don't consider this any sort of marketing thing at all, it has a newsworthy purpose to fans of sports. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I like the idea of combining into a list of all-weather pitches. My only concern is whether that list would be too long.

<li>It certainly is interesting to sports fans, at least American football and baseball fans. I think we should have some kind of listing of what stadiums use what types of turfs. Wikipedia isn't really a meaningful place for these companies to advertise anyway... their market is the 1000-2000 athletic directors, stadium owners and so on who decide what kind of field a stadium uses, It's rather silly to believe those people are relying on Wikipedia for their information, or that they don't have a list of which stadiums use what anyway. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 04:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Suggestion</b>. What if we kept this as a category, but broadened the scope to Category:Artificial turf installations? That would avoid <a href="../../../a/d/_/WP%7EAD_5bbf.html" title="WP:AD">WP:AD</a> and excessively long lists while keeping information useful to sports fans.

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../f/i/e/FieldTurf_74a2.html" title="FieldTurf">FieldTurf</a> or <b>Delete</b>. If the information is encyclopedic, then the list needs to be kept. Since <a href="../../../f/i/e/FieldTurf_74a2.html" title="FieldTurf">FieldTurf</a> is not long, the list could be retained in that article. So we go back to the way things were before all of the discussions. If the material is not encyclopedic just delete. However this should not be a category. I see the merge as a compromise and the delete as the better solution since news worthy and interesting are not the same as encyclopedic. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 08:36, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Return to list</b>. The last version of the list presented the information in a way that was not well accomplished by a category. The second AfD didn't offer any compelling reasons to delete the list, so I see no problem either recreating the list as a separate article or merging it back to the FieldTurf article. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 20:21, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge to <a href="../../../f/i/e/FieldTurf_74a2.html" title="FieldTurf">FieldTurf</a>.</b> Let's just undo all of this silliness. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELovelac7_4e12.html" title="User:Lovelac7"><span style="font-family:times new roman, times; color:#006633;">Lovelac7</span></a> 23:23, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Listify</b>. Categorization loses information and merging it back into the article means the article becomes overly long. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:56, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> as above sounds like the best solution. Listify is a plausible alternative; category isn't needed here. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, the list is far too long to be merged. Those calling for categorisation in the recent AfD and listification in the CfD, as opposed to outright deletion, are in the minority, so I don't see why the heavy consensus for deletion in the recent AfD and the CfD was ignored and should continue to be. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:11, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Categorize</b>The information is important to sports fans as a list. Furthermore, it would be important to article readers of any particular stadium as a category. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 18:19, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep as a list, not a category</b>. This is the kind of thing that best makes sense as a centralized list, not a category spread out amongst the edit text of dozens of pages. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 00:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Looks more like a list of <a href="../../../f/i/e/FieldTurf_74a2.html" title="FieldTurf">FieldTurf</a> stadiums at this time.

I felt at the time that the deletion violated consensus (and it looks like the closing admin thought so too, hence his/her close comment), but I didn't have the energy to deal with DRV. Contrary to the closing comment, I feel that the article <i>asserted</i> notability, the AfD discussion asserted notability, and the sources provided in the article, AfD and by Johntex above show verifiability. It is difficult to source sex articles due to a myriad of social stigmas in traditionally reliable sources, so in my opinion we have to take what we can get.

<li><b>Overturn</b>. Theoretically, this is about process rather than content, so I'll confine myself to that side of things.

(2) Although the number of Keep vs Delete opinions is irrelevant, many of the Delete opinions seem to be based on a distaste for the subject rather than the merits of the article; indeed, many of those&#160;!voting Delete had obviously not even <i>read</i> the article beforehand. (3) As we can see from the re-creation of this article, the wider community quite clearly believe that this topic - which <i>is</i> a major part of contemporary pornography, like it or not - needs to be distinguished from anal sex <i>simpliciter</i>.

If anyone has any suggests or wans to work in it from there, feel free. So far I can stablish that there are at least 35 pornographic films using Ass to mouth, ATM or A2M as their <i>titles</i>, it is unlikely to be able to estimate how many films the act is performed it though it will be considerably higher. I can't think of another sex act that is regularly performed in such films and, let's face it, real life as well that doesn't have an article. The article is true and verifiable. The notability comes from its prevalence. I have further demonstrated the use of the term in gay pornography which was not in the article when it was deleted. It has already been demonstrated that the use of the term has escaped the environs of pornography. It is obvious that the term won't be bandied around everywhere as most media perform some kind of censorship (thank God for Wikipedia), and it's hardly a dinner table subject.</li>

The nominator displayed disruptive behaviour which I mentioned on her talk page. I do not think it was her intention to distract from legitimate debate but that was the upshot. Deletion of the article has caused many redlinks to appear though this will not currently be apparent as someone has created a new article on the subject which is vastly inferior to the one that was deleted. This is the effect relinks have, of course, they are an invitation to expand into areas Wikipedia has missed so far. Wikipedias strength is that it will go into territory other encyclopaedias balk at.

<li><b>Endorse status quo</b> - a redirect (to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a>) is fine (but note it is not <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal-oral_contact.html" title="Anal-oral contact">anal-oral contact</a> - ass to mouth is when a woman (or a man) has a penis up their bottom, then puts it in their mouth. Anal-oral contact is rimjobbing, etc). The use of 'ass to mouth / a2m / A2M' in the title of a mnovie doesn't mean we ought to have an article; the phrases 'Buttz', 'Teenage Anal Princess' or 'Naughty College Schoolgirls' appear in the title of plenty of porn films, but we don't have an article on that. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:54, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A valid point - on the other hand, we have <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_throat_%28sexual_act%29.html" title="Deep throat (sexual act)">deep throat (sexual act)</a> as an article in its own right, rather than a redirect to <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a> or to <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Throat_%28film%29_f946.html" title="Deep Throat (film)">Deep Throat (film)</a>. I would argue that A2M is equally, if not more, distinct from basic anal sex as deep throating is from basic oral sex, and so would support a separate article. In any case, if we keep the page as a redirect, someone <i>is</i> going to rewrite it - if this DRV comes up with a delete recommendation, I think we'd better go all the way and salt the page. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 16:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Endorse Deletion</b>I consider myself to be one of the most liberal editors on sexual topics having undeleted <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Online_f9ca.html" title="Playboy Online">Playboy Online</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Cyber_Club_67fa.html" title="Playboy Cyber Club">Playboy Cyber Club</a> and related pages I must say that I actually support the redirect approach. The page is to trivial in terms of content. If the page had more significant content then I could factor in the number of page links. However, in this case, unless the editor wants to propose an expanded page, there is no reason to have anything but a redirect. My vote is to endorse the deletion, but keep the door open for a significantly expanded reconsideration. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 18:15, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you think the deletion was wrong, ok, but at least read the discussion first. The article wasn't deleted based on consensus, it was deleted based on "Almost totally unsourced, and it failed to assert notability.", aka, policy. A consensus is not required to delete something for failing policy. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 09:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am fully aware of the reasons behind the deletion. I disagreed with them. Notability is a guideline, just like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> is a guideline. Apparently there were some sources before the deletion, so it would pass verifiablity. Therefore the closer was using the existence of one guideline (WP:N) as justification to ignore another guideline (WP:C). But, now that Johntex found an aditional reliable source, it now passes WP:N as well. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 20:52, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Overturn</b> - The arguments for deletion were valid; it was unsourced and did not seem to improve over the 5 days of AfD with suggestions that it would be difficult to source. The arguments for keep were equally valid; it is not a neologism, nor was it original research, and it is a notable sex act. Therefore the decision should have been to <b>keep by default</b> per <b>no consensus</b>, but it seems like the closing administrator took it upon themselves to delete instead (even noting that we should come straight to DRV). As a side comment, I'd like to point out that while the article was deleted, the sandbox version fixes all of the policy complaints of the nomination/close and so the discussion is somewhat moot since the final decision was (by default) without prejudice. Whether the sandbox is merged into an overturned DRV or placed on an open article space, the result is the same and would easily withstand a new AfD. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:13, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly Endorse Overturning deletion</b> - As the editor above pointed out it should have defaulted to <b>no consensus</b>.

<p><b>Overturn</b> No offense to the closing admin, but this is a situation where the "votes" were counted and the fanboys were feared. These three articles clearly violate policy and had been given plenty of time to be corrected. What good is our policies on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">plot summaries</a> if it can be so easily dismissed? I stated shortly before the AfD close, I could probably create some plot related Lost article, for no good reason and intentionally make it pointless, and people will <i>still</i> find a reason to keep it. This is not logical thinking.</p>
<p>The original version of these three articles was something that conflicted with the individual episode articles. A <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_mediation_Lost_episodes_7992.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Lost episodes">mediation case</a> was opened on which set of articles to keep. Individual episode articles were to be kept, but to help settle the dispute the mediation looked for a <i>new</i> reason to keep these pages. They found a new role for the articles, but so far those articles have yet to successfully obtain that new role, and no indication that anyone is interested in actually doing it.</p>
<p>Keep arguments did nothing to address the policy issue. It's only a duplication of plot summary, something we have way to much of on Wikipedia. The logic for deletion was strong, and the logic for keep was flawed. This is the kind of close you get when people want to avoid a dispute with tons of fans who don't understand the policy, so I understand, but it's not an acceptable solution. Someone needs to step up to the plate and do what is needed. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 03:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As the nominator of the AfD, I wholeheartedly agree with Ned Scott's opposition to the outcome. The nomination and those who voted to 'delete' cited where the articles currently violate policy, whereas the keeps did not state a counter to this policy violation. I do not have much to add to Ned Scott's accurate disagreement of the outcome here. One thing I can say is that my nomination was falsely criticized by some editors for not informing WikiProject Lost of my concerns of the articles first, when actually, a week before the AfD, I in fact posted the issue on the WikiProject talk page and did not gain many responses. This false criticism swayed some opinions. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 04:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The closing admin, acts based on the opinions put forth and does not put their own opinions into it. So that means that unless the article can be interpretted as having more than a "no consensus", it cannot be deleted be deletion review.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's pretty clear that from the discussion alone it was "no consensus", however it still violates policy, and we don't get to follow or not follow policy just "whenever we feel like it". I would say there is a fair consensus (or no consensus) to use fair use images of living people, and we don't allow that. We are not a democracy, and AfDs should not be judged by the micro consensus alone. The policy reflects a much larger community consensus as well as being <b>policy</b>. Making the argument that there was no consensus means nothing, because the articles should still be deleted. This is one of the major reasons we are not a democracy. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 21:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>They've had months to "improve". The fact of the matter is they were originally created as alternative to episode articles, but we couldn't have both episode articles and season articles.

<li>I agree with you that the discussion was split, my point is that policy has weight on the issue as well that was not considered. Like I said before, I could intentionally make a pointless article and people would vote keep on it. There's no logic being used here, it's a bizarre pattern being seen all through Wikipedia, and it's a real problem. We have a very clear policy on plot summaries, and we had a goal for these articles, and we have no indication that the situation will improve for these articles. This is not a popular vote, it doesn't matter how many people you find that say keep or endorse no consensus, because policy in this case trumps that. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 05:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Endorse no consensus</b>. The argument you use that these articles cannot be kept to the policy concerning plot summaries can also be made with all the individual episode articles. Should we delete those as well? One of the purposes of these articles, if I'm not mistaken, is to provide a concise season summary so that those looking for a reference on a particular season don't have to wade through 23 individual articles. This is what sets them apart from any random LOST plot article that you might make. However, I see your point that they cannot be kept to policy, and I do question their usefulness. So there are two points of view, and especially judging from the comments here I do not see a general consensus. --<a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahlfin_e857.html" title="User:Kahlfin">Kahlfin</a> 22:09, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Endorse no consensus</b> Right now <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a> is popular. As a encyclopedia we should cater to the popular demands in terms of informational needs. Thus, although it might not be proper to have plot summaries and episode summaries for an average television show, it is probably correct here because the pages contain sought information. I do believe that the most popular shows should have such pages since their popularity will likely ensure adequate editorial quality.

<li><b>Endorse no consensus</b> - This was only ever closer to the mark of Keep than even Delete, and the closing admin's decision to review to no-consensus was the best desision at the time.

<li>I am equally as frustrated as Ned is with this kind of response. As it has been stated and restated, the articles violate policy, and the keep votes have not formed any reasonable counter to this fact. An AfD should not be decided on 'votes' at all.

<li>I never said that it was votes that decided. Deletion is based on the general consensus, not the power of the arguments. If it was more agreed that the articles should have been deleted, then it would have been. But it was undecided. I think it was unreasonable to have bought this to Deletion Review, as it questions the admins desicion after the AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not surprised at people's responses here. However, my whole point has been that consensus, or a lack of consensus, is shadowed by our policy on episode summaries. This is totally going out of our way to include not just summaries, but a redundant summaries. The only reason those articles stand today was because they were a compromise in a debate long since dead. They didn't occur naturally and I question the "need" for them. This isn't even in a gray area for plot summaries. Editors are blindly defending the articles without good reasons, why is that given more weight than policy? Because no admin wants to deal with all the keep supporters bitching at them for deleting the articles, that's why. I don't blame them, and there's far more important things to spend our time with rather than pointless little articles like these that will eventually die one way or another. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 04:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Overturn</b> - The article Winston Olde English Bulldogge was at wikipedia yesterday because I worked on it and now it is deleted without a vote. This is a breed a dog and should be in Wikipedia. I have been advised that <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a> has decided on his own that the article is not warranted and it was deleted. He recently tried to have the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Olde_English_Bulldogge_e9f4.html" title="Olde English Bulldogge">Olde English Bulldogge</a> deleted with a vote and it is not succeeding, so now he is simply deleting dog breed articles he does not like. I would like the article brought back and a vote taken. I believe that this dog breed exists and it should be in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Overturn and list on AfD</b> On process grounds, A7 'Unremarkable people, groups, companies and web content' does not yet include dogcruft, so 'no assertion of notability' is NOT a reason for speedying. I'm a little concerned with something as subjective as 'notability' is becoming such a key deletion criterion - but it is certainly not a speedy criterion. I was the one who came up with the wording for A7, and it was never meant to be a justification for shooting things an admin didn't hold to be notable, or deemed 'cruft'. More importantly, on content grounds, sure there's a debate over whether this breed is verifiable and 'notable' but the place for that debate is AfD.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 02:51, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I would agree with you if notability were the only concern.

<li>Perhaps, but it isn't. Read the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">policy</a>. Anyway lack of sources&#160;!= unverifiable, it just means it is currently unverified. So mark it with {{verify}} or try to source it yourself. If, and only if, after a time that proves impossible, then list on AfD.

<dd>And, I maintain, this is completely unsound reasoning: "If you feel the need to call deletion of your article vandalism, it probably should have been deleted" (Aramkov, 6 Jan 2007).

<dd>I used my own reasoning skills, not Headphonos input, to determine my perspective on this Deletion review. My recommendation is per Doc, as you can see above. Based on what I have seen regarding Winston Olde English Bulldogge, if the article were restored, and I chose to lend a perspective in the AfD, it would be to Delete the article. (Remember, there's the possibility that I may do more research, and then decide that I was neutral, or that I wanted the article kept. Right now, if I had to vote, it would be to delete the article, if it were up for AfD.) I don't know if that is what Headphonos wants or not, and it doesn't really matter. Does it? Being a member of both of the major dog projects on WP, and being relatively active in a relatively wide variety of tasks here, there's a very, very good chance that I would have run in to this discussion even if Headphonos had never touched my talk page. What are you going to do if editors who watch my contributions list, for whatever reason, decide to lend their opinion here? Believe me - This has happened - They just do it - And there's no regulation against it. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 16:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Overturn and list of AfD</b> - I am one of the other editors whose notice of this discussion was deleted from their userpage. I'm not sure I'm real happy about that, by the way.&#160;:) Personally, I tend to agree that right now the breed may not meet the standards of verifiability, and note that right now notability requirements are not extant in this subject. Therefore, I have to conclude that the only reasonable basis for deletion is verifiability, which is not speedyable. Also, I have taken the liberty of personally informing one of our editors who may be most knowledgable about this subject of these related discussions. I hope that we will hear from her shortly.

<dd>True. However, I think those who have responded all consider the article at best dubious, but are just thinking that all the data might not be in yet.

<dd>Does anyone know the answer to this? <b>Question: Can we tell whether the hangon tag was exercised in this instance of speedy delete?</b> Also, my instinct now tells me that our nominator is not "new." They also do not seem to have 'thank you' in their vocabulary, at least in correspondence with me. They do not answer questions when I ask them. They don't implement suggestions when I make them. Believe me, I have significant questions about the variety of bulldog articles (i.e. confusing mess) on WP.

<li>This was absolutely the right call on David's part. A fourth nomination on something that was decisively and high-profile kept when no new information has been added and in fact the old information is being actively ignored (since the AfD didn't even btoher linking back to AfDs 1-3) is querelous and an abuse of AfD's tolerance for repeat nominations.

<li>We can conclude two things from this. Either AfD is a court of infinite appeals, or we should acknowledge that the GNAA was a special case where the votes were overrun by trolls and being used to maximize disruption. The former case calls into question the legitimacy of this page, since the mantra of its creation was "DRV is not a court of infinite appeals." The latter makes the observation irrelevant to this point, since the article was not kept because of an army of trolls but because a lot of people were inclined to listen to the argument "Look, I'm a real, legitimate expert on webcomics and I think this is a reasonably important topic." <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 18:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Overturn closure</b>. There is no such thing as an "expert close". Experts are of course encouraged to join in the discussion, but "expert" opinion does not necessarily weigh more heavily than the opinion of other editors, nor does it override general consensus: this is especially true in areas like webcomics where what constitutes an "expert" is not readily defined: as far as I know there aren't any Nobel Prizes given out in the field of webcomics yet. I encourage the editors who consider themselves experts to actually improve the article by adding verifiable, independent, reliable sources. That would truly put the matter to rest. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Overturn closure</b> The AfD ought to have been allowed to run its course. I fail to see how the nomination was "querulous" or "spurious" when it was well over a year since the previous AfD nom. While I have no qualms about someone who claims expertise from weighing in with their expert opinion, the appeal for someone with <i>proof</i> of expertise was a bit too much <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> for my liking. It was also disrespectful to those&#160;!voters who commented to the contrary, several of whom referred to various policies. This is not to say they were right or wrong, but their opinion mattered and should have been weighed. I also am a bit unnerved by his shot-gun ultimatum in his comment, and do not think an admin posting a comment in the AfD should be the closing admin. It would have been sufficient to&#160;!vote "speedy keep" with the reasons for that&#160;!vote, but it crosses the line when that admin is the closer of the debate. It is always possible for an admin to speedy close, but I do not think this was a situation where things like <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> or <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> applied. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Let's see. We've got a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Able_and_Baker_d35d.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Able and Baker"><i>Delete</i> outcome in October 2004</a>, then in October 2005 and in an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Able_and_Baker_5f4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Able and Baker">AFD initially closed as delete</a> then overturned by the closer for another AFD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Able_and_Baker_%282nd_nomination%29_cefd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Able and Baker (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Able and Baker (2nd nomination)</a> that was closed as keep.

Ok, obviously consensus on our relevant notability guidelines <i>has changed</i>, so that AFD is irrelevant. Since the relevant guidelines have changed, the policy <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_can_change_4d99.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus can change">Wikipedia:Consensus can change</a> clearly applies. <b>Overturn speedy closure</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:35, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Overturn</b>, speedy keeps are only to be used in the case of an obvious outcome or clearly bad faith nomination. This one was neither. There was evidence presented in favor of keeping, and arguments made for deletion. Closing as speedy keep when the result is in clear dispute stifles legitimate discussion and goes against fundamental wikipedia policy of building consensus rather than imposing rule from above. Further, we don't care about expertise on wikipedia, we care about what you can cite, and in its current status, the article doesn't cite any of the information that was presented as evidence of its notability in the debate. Thus, it has <i>no claim to notability</i>. Even an article about George Washington, if it didn't mention anything that made him important, would deserve to be deleted.

<li><b>Overturn</b> - This is no way a speedy keep. The reason Phil so expertly argues that Able and Baker (webcomic) is notable, is that it's a member of the Dayfree Press. This is the same as saying every book published, and every signed band is. I'd disagree with any literary expert who claims that every book published is inherently notable and encyclopedic. Just look at the presented arguments in the AFD, that the Dayfree Press guy mentioned Able and Baker in an interview, and that it's linked from other comics.

In any case, with some people having said openly that they do not think the mention in Dayfree is sufficient for encyclopedic merit, this discussion should be allowed to play itself out. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:00, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I noticed there was no article called Allie Sin, and so created it, only to find it deleted a little while later. I checked into it more (something I should have done even before I created the article, I admit) and found the article used to exist, but was deleted for her lacking notibility.</p>
<p>However, according to this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28pornographic_actors%29#Valid_criteria" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28pornographic_actors%29#Valid_criteria" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28pornographic_actors%29#Valid_criteria</a></p>
<p>An erotic actor or actress <b>may be demonstrated as notable by meeting any one</b> of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performer has won an award from:
<ul>
<li>Adult Film Association of America</li>
<li>Adult Video News</li>
<li>X-Rated Critics Organization</li>
<li>GayVN Awards</li>
<li>Adult Erotic Gay Video Awards, the "Grabbys"</li>
<li>Gay Producers Association</li>
<li>Gay Erotic Video Awards</li>
<li>Discontinued gay pornography awards</li>
<li>A major pornographic magazine, such as <i>Penthouse</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, <i>Hustler</i>, <i>Playgirl</i>, or other well-known magazines, as well as their counterparts in other pornography genres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
Allie Sin won the 2006 <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_Video_News_54ba.html" title="Adult Video News">Adult Video News</a> - Best Oral Sex Scene Video according to this page: <a href="../../../a/v/n/AVN_Awards_2007_aa89.html" title="AVN Awards 2007">AVN Awards 2007</a></p>
<p>Therefore, I submit that she is notable, deserves her own article, and I nominate the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allie_Sin_b0f1.html" title="Allie Sin">Allie Sin</a> article to be restored.</p>

<p>This was an inappropriate deletion that did not follow procedure. There was no concensus for deletion in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_2022_Winter_Olympics_%282nd_nomination%29_d293.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2022 Winter Olympics (2nd nomination)"><s>original deletion review</s> 2nd AfD</a>. Both sides made arguments. The two articles were nominated and deleted together. I fail to see the rationale that the administrator used to judge that consensus had been reached. Both articles were subsequently re-created as redirects by one of the participants in the discussion. I personally do not care about the articles themselves, only that it appears that an administrator inappropriately deleted it without consensus. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveOinSF_7bbf.html" title="User:DaveOinSF">DaveOinSF</a> 02:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Overturn and undelete</b> I must confess I was a bit perplexed at first, because I expected, having read the nom, to find an out-of-process deletion or a deletion of an article for which some recent mass AfD had been closed as <i>no consensus</i>; neither situation, of course, actually exists here. Neverthless, I must imagine that the proper close of the second AfD would have been <i>no consensus</i> as regards the deletion of either article (the close, though, it should be said, is not unreasonable, such that, were we to review the close for <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abuse_of_discretion.html" title="Abuse of discretion">abuse of discretion</a>, we would likely be inclined to endorse closure). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 07:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

That discussion caused the person that had previously opined to keep to change their mind to deletion, becuase they decided only one of the sources was useful. Some of the keep opinions like "information will become available" directly contradict the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CBALL" title="WP:NOT">policy about not being a crystal ball</a>, and therefore are supposed to disregarded. I know that JJay later disagreed, but he didn't explain his thinking. Since some of the keep opinions had to be disregarded, a delete close is well within admin discretion. I wouldn't object to userfying for someone who wanted to create the possible<i>future</i> olympics article, but that article will have its own crystal ball problem. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding your first point, I saw that, but the reason Patstuart offered for changing his opinion didn't make a lot of sense. Evaluating his arguments, he was right the first time. Why would the fact that the sources are conjectural matter? We can report on conjecture, especially educated conjecture, and especially where the topic at issue has unquestioned significance. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 22:09, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>note to author</b> Keep in mind that 'notability' and 'importance' are far different things. There are many things important to many people that sadly, cannot be verified. The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> policy is our collective protection against becoming swamped in the truely trivial and inconsequential. Specifically, once the subject of your article is reviewed or disscussed significantly by a third source independant of yourselves, then it meets the requirement for notability and verifibility. Also note that it is generally accepted Wikipedia policy not to edit articles in which you may have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of interest</a>, this generally means not writing about yourself or things you're involved in. There can be exceptions made provided the subject is truely notable and you can write it in accordance with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutrality</a> policy. Again, note that criticisms of the article are not criticisms of you personally, you appear to have abundant good faith and be willing to discuss, big big bonuses in working on the encyclopedia, and often sadly lacking qualities in some newer users working on articles near and dear to them, and also that lack of verifibility or notability does not equate to lack of importance. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 05:09, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reason: Author feels that the company meets notability criteria.<br />
<br />
Earth Point has been the subject of several independent articles. These include</p>
<ol>
<li>The Idaho Statesman - a metropolitan newspaper,</li>
<li>Inman News - a leading trade journal,</li>
<li>Google Earth Blog - the definitive blog for Google Earth, and</li>
<li>Google Maps Mania - the definitive blog for Google Maps.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
Note 2 of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> illustrates the point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hewlett-Packard satisfies this criterion by, amongst other things, being covered in a feature article in the Palo Alto Weekly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By way of comparison:<br />
The circulation of the Palo Alto Weekly is 43,024 once a week. <a href="http://aan.org/alternative/Aan/viewCompany?oid=oid%3A69" class="external text" title="http://aan.org/alternative/Aan/viewCompany?oid=oid%3A69" rel="nofollow">aan.org</a><br />
The circulation of the Idaho Statesman is 65,000 every day. <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho_Statesman_023b.html" title="Idaho Statesman">Idaho Statesman</a><br />
<br />
If Hewlett-Packard is notable because of a feature article in the Palo Alto Weekly, then likewise, Earth Point is notable due to a feature article in the Idaho Statesman.<br />

<li>Right - I used the word "definitive" above to say that these are credible blogs and could be considered for notability purposes. Such subjective terms do not appear in the deleted article itself. I can remove the blogs from the article. However if there is a way to certify a blog, I would be happy to learn it.</li>

Here is part of section 1.1. My question is this. Pretend HP is just getting started. Would it be possible write this paragraph in the present tense?
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Their first product was a precision audio oscillator, the Model 200A. Their innovation was the use of a small night-light bulb as a temperature dependent resistor in a critical portion of the circuit. This allowed them to sell the Model 200A for $54.40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over $200. The Model 200 series of generators continued until at least 1972 as the 200AB, still tube-based but improved in design through the years. At 33 years, it was perhaps the longest-selling basic electronic design of all time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What if this section was written in the present tense? Would that sound like advertising?</dd>
<dd><b>My dilemma</b> is that using the HP article as a guide, I am not sure how to write an acceptable Earth Point article. It would be <b>very helpful</b> if someone would say "In your article, that sentence right there, that is advertising."</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Admins's response</b>. I've been misunderstood here. My reason for closing this as a keep was that <b>4 keeps to 7 deletes is not a consensus to delete</b> = default keep. When Shimeru asked me about it he made the additional comment that "keep&#160;!voters didn't address the sources or notability" - my extended rationale was to that. They don't have to. If the existence of the Mall was being questioned then failure to verify would be an overriding reason to delete. But that wasn't being questioned - so any sourcing of particular claims/information is something to be sorted by clean-up, and not a reason to delete <i>in the absence of a consensus.</i> Notability is subjective, and not an overriding reason to delete <i>in the absence of consensus</i> either. Basically, I closed this as keep as there was no consensus to do otherwise.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 20:03, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sorry Doc, I have to point out you are incorrect. Notability IS a citeria for deletion. Per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Topics that do not satisfy notability criteria are dealt with in two ways: merging and deletion.</i></p>
<p>As an admin, you should be well aware of ALL wikipedia policies, if not have them committed to memory. Also <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">Notability is not subjective</a>. Further more as a closing admin, you have a responsibility to read <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">Deletion Guidelines for administrators</a> which quite clearly states:</p>
<p><small>Note also that the three key policies, which warrant that articles and information be verifiable, avoid being original research, and be written from a neutral point of view are held to be non-negotiable' and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines or by editors' consensus.</small></p>
<p>It seems you were just vote counting and not reading the AFD. If there are 100 keep comments but only 1 for deletion, and that deletion comment did prove that there were no Verifiable sources and not a single Keep comment refuted that or just said "it's notable" without proof, then closing the article as Keep would be wrong. You have an obligation to digg deeper than just a quick glance and close. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 19:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bizarre. You confuse notability and verifiability again. I agree, if someone had suggested that the article was unverifiable, and the debate didn't indicate otherwise, I would have deleted it (numbers be damned). But, in reality, the article is verifiable, so that really isn't an issue. As for notability, it is contentious. And I have never said it isn't a reason for deleting - just that it isn't one that overwhelms considerations of consensus. If there had been a consensus that the article should be deleted for lacking notability, I would have deleted it (have no doubt about that). But I saw no such consensus. No, I didn't just vote count, as I have already indicated: please don't imply I'm lying.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 19:51, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>this is a true new rare breed dog that comes from the founder Danielsoren 07:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The breeder is one of the founders of this breed of dog... you are allowing Olde English Bulldogges which is the name invented by David Leavitt who was a co-breeder with Tim Kelly... and now the breeders have broken gain into Leavitt Bulldogs and British Bulldogges -- these are the inner working of the breeders at the center of this movement... the circle of breeders includes Tim Kelly who is the founder of the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club which you allow on wikipedia. He has indeed founded a new club the BBKC... I am not trying to spam about the club, while I am a member -- these are rare breed dogs that deserve a small corner of the universe to tell their story... and I simply want to put them on the pages where they belong... the breeding program that started in the 70's has progressed and the different strains are now established and the circles are evolving and the story should be able to be told.</p>
<p>you allow this one....</p>
<p>Main article: Wilkinson Bulldog</p>
<p>Lolly Wilkinson of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, has been breeding a strain of Bulldog referred to as the Wilkinson Bulldog, for many years that is similar to the Old English Bulldog. Due to the small number of bulldogs and the potential for inbreeding it is of questionable quality; however, the Wilkinsons claim that it is a healthy breed and suffers few genetic diseases. In addition, the breed is not recognized by any major kennels. Whether this breed will gain worldwide popularity and more people accept that this is the real Bulldog, remains to be seen. while Tim Kelly is well known in the breed circles and Lolly is what is considered a starter... Tim is part of the foundation of the breed that Lolly is working with... David Leavitt has all but left the breed behind in the hands of the OEBKC which was founded by Tim and now his movement into to family dog aspect of the breed is complete</p>
<p>your editors don't know anything about this rare breed, but the breeders sure do and I am a starting breeder and enthusiast who is attempting to document the story, it is a true underground story that needs the chance to be recorded here!...</p>
<p>so I may not be the best writer in the world... but help me edit it rather than throw it away!</p>

<li><b>Overturn</b>, with no strong opinion on whether it should be relisted (I wouldn't).

<li><b>Overturn</b> This wasn't an advertisement. It received what is in my eyes an overly enthusiastic expansion on 27 December by an editor in good standing, not a single purpose account.

<p>The template is still present on several Gentoo-related pages, and has been there for months.

<li>I deleted Template:Lyriki, created by the same user, because it served only to link to copyright violations. When I noticed that he created another, similiar, external link template, I looked at the website it was linking to and found it to be a poor, uninformative resource and that the template was designed to create links to the website for its benefit, not for the benefit of Wikipedia ("spam", in other words).

<p>This article and other of the same kind were deleted under unconcrete arguments proposed by administrators which are not editors of articles of the same kind(football) and simply have opted for deleting them under arguments of excessive detail under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which this article does not fall into that. This information is not published as here elsewhere and this kind of articles help people in different ways, professionally or personally. This article is informative and can help in any form of football research. For example, a sports journalist could write an article on an <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_68f5.html" title="FA Premier League">FA Premier League</a> player who is not a top scorer but wants to know how many goals he scored in a particular season, and how he has evolved. This kind of article provides just that. It may be unnecessary to some, but helpful and necessary to others. Maybe these goalscorer football articles should only be kept for top-level European leagues, such as the Spanish, Italian, Dutch, English, Scotish and French and German if the articles are created. I agree that second level league goalscorers are excessive detail and some top-level leagues such as the Libyan or Danish one. I have contributed a lot to these articles (my ISP changes my IP continously, and I use a different IP all the time) and I hate to see these articles going simply because some administrators think that they are unnecessary. Administrators and others have argued that this is a list of facts and trivia, but there are other lists that are worth keeping which are not deleted and are similar to these articles, but on a different topic. An example could be <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaths_in_2006.html" title="Deaths in 2006">Deaths in 2006</a> (there are 12 subarticles for this one) Thank you 190.40.185.235 14:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Overturn, undelete</b> - First of all I say that I totally agree with the arguments made above. I was considering this deletion review myself as well, but decided to talk to the moderator in question first to ask him why and get some clarification. I quote the moderator from the AfD: <b>"In this case, wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, nor a sports reporting center, nor a complete collection of all of history so we can look at wikipedia in the future for everything that has happened in the past. I like it and "we've worked really hard" are also not reasons for keeping an article."</b> Reading that I think the moderator is right and I agree that Wikipedia is indeed not all that what he described. But to me (I can't talk for others) this kind of information is there to describe an event, to inform others what has happened in a certain event that they are interested in. It's not an overkill of information, but just a split-off from the original competition articles to reduce the size of these pages. The information like this can be found nowhere else on the internet, at least not in this form. There was not just the "it's useful and I like it" arguments to keep this up and running. Like the user above me already said, articles like <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaths_in_2006.html" title="Deaths in 2006">Deaths in 2006</a> and other years are a good example of this type of articles that do work pretty well. From what I know all of these goalscorers articles were up-to-date as of today, which shows that at least the people work on the articles consider it important enough to be included in an encyclopedia and keep this up-to-date. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 15:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Clearly in this case the information is neither overkill nor inappropriate. By contrast, it is relevant, informative and useful for research for many people. That is clear by the commenting on the AfD. If this information is not on it's own page, it would be on the appropriate competition pages, and, judging by the size of those and the size of this page, that clearly is not appropriate. I'd like to quote: "Why make Wikipedia less informative just for the sake of it? I know this article is of great use to sport journalists (which I am) and is not 'freely' available elsewhere. There is all sorts of 'Almanac'-style information in many encyclopaedias such as Encarta or Britannica.". The fact that it's notable and of use to people, as many other list articles (deaths) are, coupled with the 'keep' support and argument the AfD received surely means this needs a review. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhilding87_b841.html" title="User:Whilding87">Whilding87</a> 17:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't like to say what I'd do in this situation as a closing admin - its one of those awkward situations where the majority have given one opinion but that this is an opinion that appears to contradict most interpretations of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. So my only comment in this review, as the original deleting nominator, would be to note that contrary to what 190.40.185.235, and others have claimed, this article has not been nomianted for deletion by non-footballing, uninterested admins. Many of us who have voiced that we should delete these articles have been heavily involved in improving Wikipedia's footballing and sporting coverage. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 16:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Overturn, restore</b> Along with the two editors above, I agree that these pages should be reinstated to wikipedia. I personally believe that pages are encyclopedic, are useful to users of wikipedia especially due to a similar resource not existing elsewhere on the internet, not to mention being a well maintained and well laid out article in wikipedia. I also think that eleminating these pages reduces the overall quality of each leagues 2006/07 article. <a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiall123_9f3d.html" title="User:Niall123">Niall123</a> 17:12, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Overturn, restore</b> This is one of those cases where one side says: "Look, this thing clearly violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>" and the other side says "no, it doesn't". We've had plenty of those before (schools spring to mind), and they promote a lot of factionalism and 50-50 splits. Both sides carried valid arguments in the debate, with Mjefm and SportsAddicted etc. outlining why the article is of use, and Robdurbar, Oldelpaso, Dsreyn etc. arguing that . In the end, it thus comes down to what way you interpret <i>indiscriminate collection of information</i>. But using only that as an argument, you could virtually delete anything on Wikipedia, since everything here is a collection of information and it's just a matter of calling it indiscriminate or not, assuming you got the closing admins or enough editors to listen to you. That's fine. Most times you don't, of course, since editors have a clear sense of what is notable and what is not, but in such borderline cases it's best to leave it to a public debate rather than judge the arguments and then make a decision where some kind of personal decision has been thrown in. In this case, the debate seemed to have reached little consensus, with a lot of people not seeing the merits of the arguments held by the delete side, and the closing admin should have taken that into account.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ellison, This information has been collected from people that watch the matches and from articles like League Results by month. Also, there are sites and many news articles which say who scored in a match, and based on that this article is created. I have in fact searched for it and found none. There is no site that Wikipedia users are aware of. I know some of you who want this article deleted want a summary of the top goalscorers. But how are we supposed to know who the league top scorers are if we can't keep count on the player's goals? I mean, the player with the lowest amount of goals listed in <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_2006-07_783b.html" title="FA Premier League 2006-07">FA Premier League 2006-07</a> has 8 goals, and how will we know which players have 7 goals so that when they make it to 8 we add them there? There is a reason for subarticles.190.40.185.235 13:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Err, because there are sites that list the top goalscorers? <a href="../../../s/v/e/Sveriges_Television_53ce.html" title="Sveriges Television">Swedish State Television</a> has such a list on <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teletext.html" title="Teletext">teletext</a> <a href="http://www.svt.se/svttext/web/pages/370.html" class="external text" title="http://www.svt.se/svttext/web/pages/370.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>, and I fully support Elisson's remarks. Wikipedia is not the place for such things.

This works the same for other teams in the same and other competitions. So the information (at least in some leagues and probably more on other websites on the net) is available but people has to click through tons of different pages on the same website to get the results that was available in Wikipedia on just one article about the goalscorers of a league. Also, I'm pretty sure that as soon as this years leagues are over this information will be gone on that website and replaced by the goalscorers of next season, meaning the information would be harder to find in the future. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 07:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>. Closer correctly pointed out that (quite aside from the lack of third-party sources) there was no context explaining the encyclopedic significance of the data. For plot summaries we require that "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot."

<li><b>Comment</b> - Right, so where do these articles not meet your criteria then? What part of these lists does not make real world context? As you can see above they can be sourced, offering detail is available as these lists are complete. Being written in detail is not necessary in this situation, or are we also going to delete all lists on wikipedia without written detail? These goals are scored by notible figures playing for notible teams in notible leagues, which have affect on the results (final rankings) of these teams, which shows the historical value of these goals. They're not just a summary, they are a list like there are many lists on Wikipedia and they are an expansion on the articles about a certain season of the league. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 07:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I want to know the signficance of the goals, and I want that to be based on outside sources. As always, notability is conferred by coverage <i>about</i> the topic, not tangential <i>references to</i> the topic. Data without interpretation is not encyclopedic. At any rate, it seems to me you are continuing a deletion debate here, but that's not what the page is for.

<li>Well, like I said before somewhere above this message inbetween some of the many replies I do believe there was a procedural error in the closing as there was no consensus reached yet at the AfD and thus these articles were deleted too early in my opinion. That was the main issue here in the first place, but as others are continuing debating about this as well instead of giving their opinion on whether the moderator in question made an error by deleting these I simply have to react and defend my point of view. You want the significance of the goals based on outside sources? Does that mean you want proof for the goals to be not accidently scored but by a player's skill?

<li>No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm trying to say that I would like to see a distinction between data and knowledge. If there is no background information explaining why the number of goals scored by each individual is important - say, important (i.e. Wikipedia-notable) awards given to the player with the most goals - it is just information. It is the distinction between data and knowledge that separates "indiscriminate" information from important information. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 16:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Maybe Libyan and Danish leagues are not sufficiently noteworthy but I am not challenging those deletions - England, Scotland, Spain, Italy and the other major leagues must stay. WP is here for a purpose; to be informative, useful, detailed and definitive. Those who delete articles like the major league goalscorers lists are making WP worse just for the sake of it. WP doesn't exist just so that we can all sit around smugly and say "Look at this in-no-way-Almanacky encyclopædia we made that is useless if you're a sports journalist trying to do some research."

<li><b>Comment</b> The Actim list fo goalscorers does not provide the same information that is provided in Wikipedia. In Wikipedia, the goalscorer articles gave the amount of goals scored by each player per team and the nationality of the player. The Actim list of the FA premier league site is only a ranking and if someone looking for information want so know which team does the player belongs to, it has to actually search more for it, possibly here. Plus, you can't find this information for other top level leagues. SportsAddicted apparently knows about the Dutch one, but you can't find one for the Italian, Scotish or Spanish. I say we just keep the following articles: Serie A goalscorers, La Liga goalscorers, Eredivisie Goalscorers, FA Premier League goalscorers and Scotish Premier League goalscorers.190.40.185.235 16:16, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Further Comment</b> The list of goalscorers is on Flash there and it takes quite some time to scroll down by the way. And I support SportsAddicted remarks that the information will be deleted next season. You may find the Dutch ones, but when this season is over they will be deleted.This articles involve one per year per league. I'm talking of 5 leagues so lets just make it 5 articles per year. Compare the to the 12 per year on the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaths_in_2006.html" title="Deaths in 2006">Deaths in 2006</a> list. These articles are useful.190.40.185.235 16:16, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Would you care to speculate on why they will be deleted next season? Is it because they aren't very notable and/or are more newsworthy than permanently informative? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 16:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, and would you care to explain why only those five leagues should have such articles, if such articles should exist? And as noted on top of this discussion, we are not here to debate if the articles should be kept of not, we are here to debate if the closing admin did anything wrong, and I still wait to see such evidence put forward. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 19:38, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Dekimasu, that site is a site that covers football per season, and it is not an encyclopaedia. The sites of football teams don't keep with the results of every single season the club has been playing but they do keep the current ones and some sites the ones of last season. However, this is an encyclopaedia, and the article provides important information to some adn it does not go into excessive detail to qualify as an indiscriminate collection of information. If the article would say the exact date, time and location alongside each player and there would be articles like, for example, FA Premier League 2006/07 goalscorers by Stadium, by minute, etc., then I would call those an indiscriminate collection of information.</li>
<li><i>Ellison</i>, I'd keep all the existing one, at least the ones that are regularly updated. But under the given circumstances, those are the ones that are the most important because they are the top-level leagues in Europe, the most widely seen and the ones that are more probable to help someone. I'd be happy to keep <b>all</b>. I say that the deletition of this articles was wrong because there was absolutely <b>no</b> consensus reached in the AfD. Simply, the administrator that deleted the article took side with the deletition proposers because they were fellow admins and because admins are saying so then it's because they're right. There was no consensus reached therefore no clear reason for the deletition.190.40.185.235 21:24, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Why was there no consensus reached in the AfD? Claiming that there was a <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">cabal</a> of administrators (which, I guess, would include me) that wanted the articles deleted is not helping your case, but instead only strenghtens the view of you as one of the WP:IWORKEDONITHARDYOUDELETIONIST people, as Amarkov so eloquently expressed it above. I think that the closing admin made it pretty clear that keep&#160;!votes such as <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"I like it"</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"it is useful"</a> and <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"it is interresting"</a> does not help build a consensus and can pretty much be ignored as they don't bring the discussion forward.

<li><b>Comment</b> Excuse me, <i>Ellisson</i>. The administrator deleted the article under the excessive detail under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> argument. But these articles do not qualify in the section: "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", and admin Robdurbar went to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> added a section on Wikipedia not being an almanac <b>wihtout</b> reaching any consensus before as it is explicitly said at the top of that page to make the article qualify because he thinks it is almanac-style information. Afterwards, I proved that there is a lot of almanac-style information in Wikipedia that is not nominated for deletition, such as lists of countries by categories, airline destinations, deaths per year, etc. 190.40.164.57 15:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow wow wow, that's all a little misleading. Upon seeing these articles I proposed that almanac - thinking only of sports alamancs, though it was then pointed out that other almanacs contain much more details besides sports- be added as a clarification of 'not a collection of indiscriminate information'. After around a day or so there were only comments supporting this move, so I thought I'd add it in order to promote more discussion - I never claimed that it couldn't be removed, but I thought a consensus was emerging on the talk - and I later took it off when it was pointed out to me that it could be seen as conflict of interests with the ongoing afd's; the section could not have been on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for more than 24 hours and has had contributors supporting a re-phrased repositng of the point. I thought - and from their comments, all the users voicing for deletion of the article thought - that the article qualified as an indiscriminate collection anyway; the intention of adding to the policy is to clarify this. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 15:29, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I appreciate it being taken off, but it was only placed there at the time to be used to support the deletition of these articles. As Mjefm has said repeatedly, encyclopaedias contain almanac-style information in its nature, be it sports facts or lists of historical dates. For example, I have found many other <b>sports</b> articles that could qualify as an indiscriminate collection of information under your arguments, and have never been proposed to be deleted. Take a look, for example at <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._seasons_972a.html" title="Liverpool F.C. seasons">Liverpool F.C. seasons</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._statistics_4390.html" title="Liverpool F.C. statistics">Liverpool F.C. statistics</a>. The latter even has the word "statistics" in its title, which is the very thing you're against! I'm not saying that these articles aren't useful. but I think that there should be no exceptions made. I don't see the encessity of these articles being deleted. These aren't articles being used to vandalize Wikipedia or make fun or something, and it does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. As I said before, I think they would qualify as an indiscriminate collection of information if there were many goalscorer articles per league per year, with goals by player's nationality, time, stadium, month, etc.190.40.164.57 16:24, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I for one, did not know that the "almanac paragraph" had been added, and I doubt a lot of the users at the AfD did know that. And not a single of the delete&#160;!votes referred to any almanac paragraph. Robdurbar mentioned an almanac discussion on the talk page, and a keep&#160;!voter, Mjefm, mentioned it, but other than that, I see no-one specifically saying that "Wikipedia is not an almanac". You consider the articles to not fall under "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information". I, along with several other users, including several administrators, consider it to fall under both that, and "Wikipedia is not a directory". Regarding the two Liverpool examples you give, the difference is that those two articles summaries various statistics of a club's history spanning more than 100 years. The articles we discuss here summaried a single statistic of a single season. BTW, my name is "Elisson", "E-L-I-S-S-O-N", not "Ellison" or "Ellisson". Swedish. Not American or British or Australian or something like that. Not very important, but hey, I prefer to correct it instead of happily ignore that people spelling my name wrong. Do note, you are not alone. Not even most Swedes get it right, often spelling or saying "Eliasson" (note the a), which is a much more common surname. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 20:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Excuse me again, <i>Elisson</i>. I'm from South America and not a first language English speaker either. Well, I did notice what was added to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Someone pointed out that under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> the article was eligible for deletition and I read that section, I checked the page's history, and it turns out that it had been recently added by Robdurbar, after the deletition was proposed. I removed it (under another IP) because it was there to favour the deletitionist side and there had been no consensus reached to add it. I agree that Wikipedia is not a directory, and I wouldn't like to see phone numbers or facts of regular people around, but these articles contain basic information available for any kind of researcht that helps people in different ways. Plus, this article is a sub-article. Wikipedia articles have a lot of subarticle. Practically ever general article I read has a lot of subarticles! In this case, the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_2006-07_783b.html" title="FA Premier League 2006-07">FA Premier League 2006-07</a> article has the top scorers summary and a link to the goalscorers articles for more information. Where are people supposed to look to find out how many goals has Player X scored in that season. This article has benefited in a personal way and has in fact increased my knowledge of English football, which I admire, and it has also contributed to some users professionally, as Mjefm said. And the Liverpool articles wouldn't qualify in the "Wikipedia is not a Directory" section of policy? I think that the articles are in fact useful, but they are very similar to the gaoslcorer articles and would qualify in the same article category. I'll give you another example then: <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_destinations_2abc.html" title="American Airlines destinations">American Airlines destinations</a>190.40.164.57 21:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I see no reason to believe that the closing admin used that paragraph when closing the discussion. And that is what this DRV is about. Just because an article can have subarticles, does not mean it <i>should</i> have subarticles. The number of goals a player has scored in a specific season is a perfectly fine statistic to include in the player's article. And once again, <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"I like it"</a> is not a good argument.

<li>The big question still is, how does this article falls under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>? It is not a birectory, and it is not an indiscriminate collection of information. If it had excessive detail, such as time, location and the way it was scored, then I would agree it being an indiscriminate collection of information. In the player's articles, the number of goals scored by each player is not season wise but carreer-wise per club, and it only includes domestic league goals. And, those are not regularly updated, therefore unreliable and it is hard to keep the actual count of how many goals the player has scored in his professional carreer. And having this article is the only way to keep up with the summary in the league pages. How would we know which players have 7 goals and score one to move to 8 so that he is added to the summary?190.40.164.57 03:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Pretty clear to me. There are of course various types of directories, some more useful than others (for example <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_World_Cup_hat-tricks_4bfe.html" title="FIFA World Cup hat-tricks">FIFA World Cup hat-tricks</a>, a featured list). <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information.

<li>These articles don't fall anywhere close under the section "WIkipedia is not a directory". It doesn't even come close to the examples written there. It is not a list of ordinary people that have done nothing of notoriety, or something with entries relation with the future (TV/Radio guides as mentioned there, odds of scoring again in this case). I guess <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaths_in_2006.html" title="Deaths in 2006">Deaths in 2006</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_destinations_2abc.html" title="American Airlines destinations">American Airlines destinations</a> are also direcories, therefore they violate policy. What makes you think that a list of hat-tricks is more useful than a list of goalscorers on important football leagues? Yes, in fact, some articles have a list of the goals scored, but that doesn't occur with other players such as <a href="../../../n/w/a/Nwankwo_Kanu_839c.html" title="Nwankwo Kanu">Nwankwo Kanu</a> <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thierry_Henry_ecb5.html" title="Thierry Henry">Thierry Henry</a>, and with almost all players in Wikipedia. You may find the goalscorers list in the Swedish League site, yes, on the English one, probably not. I had never seen it before actually, and you showed it to me for the first time. It is quite hidden and it is on flash. It is also hardly scrollable and you can't see which player actually is which. I scrolled down the list (which I took a long time) and I found two Coles. Which is which? I know about at least 3 Coles in the <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_2006-07_783b.html" title="FA Premier League 2006-07">FA Premier League 2006-07</a>.

You also don't comment on those articles because they clearly violate policy if this one does too. Those articles are very much alike and only differ on the subject. I hadn't clicked on the Swedish site because from all I read, I understood that it contained only Swedish goalscorers. The Premier Site is not exactly unreliable, but it lacks information.

<li><b>Overturn and restore</b>. The opening sentence at <a href="../../../5/_/_/WP%7E5_d6bd.html" title="WP:5">WP:5</a> explicitly states that Wikipedia includes elements of specialized encyclopedias and almanacs. Assuming that such a thing as a world soccer, er football, encyclopedia exists, it is not unreasonable to expect that a list of goals for each major competition would be listed. Wikipedia can enhance that by providing more detail, since Wikipedia is also not a paper encyclopedia. Wikipedia is also not a newspaper, but, a historical summary of goal scorers is not a newpaper article either. The single scores are news, but, the collection is not. Another argument made against these articles was that it could result in thousands of articles. To this, I only point to an archived message by Jimbo, that was linked in another recent AFD: <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-November/008266.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-November/008266.html" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 00:04, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

The undeletion of the template would in no way serve your goals of finding those images which used it, as it would also require the reversion of some 3000 edits (rough guess) - it's really not worth it when one can look through contribs. Finally, as the closer of the debate, I had no idea that <a href="../../../h/v/_/WP%7EHV_16b5.html" title="WP:HV">WP:HV</a> existed, and so wouldn't have known to have contacted them, though I'd expect one of their members to notice the TfD notices replicated on {{<a href="../../../c/o/a/Template%7ECoatofarms_8278.html" title="Template:Coatofarms">Coatofarms</a>}} or MartinBotIII's edits in removing instances of the template, rather than launching a deletion review (a review which has aims which are impossible, and which is against the purpose of DRV) half a month after the event, when OrphanBot started its work. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 11:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Martin closed the TFD, yes and his bot removed the template, WP:HV didn't notice either and OrphanBot is removing images. Don't waste time on paperwork or who's-to-blame.

<li>The template has been removed from the images from the image pages themselves - the template has been orphaned, and resurrecting it would not provide anyone with any indication of where the template was previously transcluded.

<p>But as for the template itself, I say <b>keep deleted.</b> It might be true that, because of federal law of a country, a coat of arms image can be in the public domain. But for those that are not, we cannot just claim something is fair use because it is X. We need to justify why this is fair use based on our usage of the image, not because of what it is. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 20:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The issue here is not the template but how much time there'll be to sort through the images. According to the image description pages, we have not one week but two days, i.e. a deadline on Friday. The most obvious cases where such images are PD (Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Finland) have pretty much been salvaged now. So has the British 18th century images. I haven't checked but I'm pretty sure that the material from the Czech Republic and Romania (both PD) has been salvaged as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, it would be really great if somebody could check the legal situation for some of the U.S. and Canadian material as well as for Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Hungary and Bulgaria. I suspect the Serbian material for being PD, see <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Flagge_Belgrad.PNG" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Flagge_Belgrad.PNG">Commons:Image:Flagge Belgrad.PNG</a>. If it turns out that some of this material is indeed PD, please create a template for it (<i>with a link to the relevant copyright law in English!)</i>, see the templates for the countries mentioned above for examples, e.g. {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-Coa-Lithuania_d6c1.html" title="Template:PD-Coa-Lithuania">PD-Coa-Lithuania</a>}}). Btw, Armenian images are PD according to a template on Commons, but I've not had the time to verify this (which should be pretty easy) so any help with the (tiny) Armenian material would also be welcome. There is a link to the relevant law from <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Yerevan_coa.gif" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Yerevan_coa.gif">Commons:Image:Yerevan_coa.gif</a> (bottom). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 20:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Undelete</b>. The original AFD was six months ago and was very questionable whether there was any consensus (one delete or merge, one merge, one keep and expand). As there have been other articles created about this game since that time, the inconsistency that the nominator pointed out doesn't make sense. Thus, undelete. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:22, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Undelete</b>. Normally I'm for the keeping of all the EVE Online material to fewer articles, but the main article was really getting to be a mess, as is the Ships article. It would definitely be effective to split up the material into the racial articles. "Recreation" doesn't really apply as a deletion reason if circumstances have changed (in this case, the other three races were created). — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 11:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Dan Boeckner has also played with Modest Mouse at parts of live shows and opened for Modest Mouse in his side project, Handsome Furs, which I agree does not need an article but they are also on the large indie label <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub_Pop_fb44.html" title="Sub Pop">Sub Pop</a>. Johnny Pollard of Atlas Strategic also played with <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf_Parade_2342.html" title="Wolf Parade">Wolf Parade</a> for a song on their tour in August, and Steve Simard has been in many other bands including Breakwater and Republic of the Freedom fighters, which I doubt youll find anything on them on the web but they had a few releases. Atlas Strategic should also be counted as being "on" <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub_Pop_fb44.html" title="Sub Pop">Sub Pop</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Brock_%28musician%29_6cf8.html" title="Isaac Brock (musician)">Issac Brock</a> of Modest Mouse was working to get them signed to Sub Pop but Dan Boeckner left the band and moved to Montreal whih ended any chance of anything really being done.

<p>one quick question, does it make a difference that nothing on the web site is copyrighted, to save me the time of verifying it and everything? mikqick</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, because although the website may not currently <i>claim</i> the copyright, such a claim could be made later. If the website were to be licensed under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, that would be okay, because it can't be revoked. However, many on here take a <i>very</i> dim view of Wikipedia including content from a promotional website whether or not permission is given. Such circumstances could well be viewed as falling under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> criterion G11 (the spam criterion). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, what exactly would such an image add to an article?

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>, obviously. News media photos cannot be used as fair use unless the photo is iconic. We're trying to move away from the "I can't find anything free so I'm using something from somewhere on the internet" photos. I would suggest asking on a Patriots message board. Surely, there are people on those boards who take their cameras to games and someone might be willing to release a photo under the GFDL. Fair use is for things like logos and screenshots - where there is no such thing as a free version of the work because anything we could create would be a derivative of the copyrighted original work. For something like this, anyone with a camera could (or could have) taken a picture, so there's no compelling reason to ignore our goal of being a free-content encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:32, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - we may need to consider making non-iconic news media photos a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. Nothing whatsoever good can come from using news media photos. Unless the photo itself is newsworthy (in which case, you are using it as a fair use image to comment on the photo itself, not on the subject of the photo), it's a blatant copyright violation. You can't just call something fair use in order to avoid paying royalties, which is what we would be trying to do with this image. Whoever took this photo took it for the purpose of selling it to newspapers - that's how they put food on their family's table. If it is "fair use" to use the image without paying for it, why would any newspaper ever pay for a photo? We don't use news media photos and we can't use them ... that's one of the easiest ways for Wikipedia to get into copyright trouble. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:17, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article (on Globulation 2, an open source real-time strategy game) was deleted on 20 december 2006, please see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Globulation_2_9592.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Globulation 2">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Globulation_2</a>.</p>
<p>I (one of the main developer but not the creator/editor of the page on Wikipedia) think that wrt to <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> and compared to other free software around, glob2 has his place on Wikipedia. Two reasons have been given for deletion: 1) alpha software and 2) no evidence of notability.</p>
<p>1) It is true that we list glob2 as alpha software on our web site. I personally decided so some years ago with respect to classical software development cycle, where alpha version is a version with not all features, beta version is a full-featured version with some bugs, and final version is (theoretically) perfect software. This model apply less to free software, where they are released often and constantly improved. Glob2's actual state is much more mature than most free software games. In particular, it is fully playable, including on the Internet, and included in most major distributions. I thus think that the objection about alpha software does not hold.</p>
<p>2) There is several evidence of notability, mostly distribution inclusion but journal article and web reference. Distribution inclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/games/glob2" class="external autonumber" title="http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/games/glob2" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> <a href="http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_real-time-strategy_game_.28globulation_2_alpha21.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_real-time-strategy_game_.28globulation_2_alpha21.29" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> (listed as the real-time strategy game)</li>

<li>Darwin Ports <a href="http://glob2.darwinports.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://glob2.darwinports.com/" rel="nofollow">[55]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also several RPM packaged by individuals on the net for RPM-based distributions. Glob2 may be included in other distributions, but I think that this sample shows its inclusion is not isolated. Glob2 has also been mentioned in several journals and web sites:</p>
<ul>

Being an open source program, it exists mostly on the Internet. But one clear fact is that glob2 has a large distribution inclusion. In addition, there is technical facts (the innovative gameplay for instance) that make glob2 different than, for instance, a clone of some commercial game&#160;; but I understand that those facts do not enter Wikipedia's definition of notability. --<a href="../../../n/c/t/User%7ENct_48f9.html" title="User:Nct">nct</a> 00:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>This debate was closed after twelve deletes and five keeps as a "keep". Whether AfD is a&#160;!vote or not, this is clearly a slap in the face to consensus, and I believe the closing admin should be reprimanded. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 01:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I strongly disagree with your interpretation. Most of those voting to delete did have a reason. They may not have written an essay, but such is not required. On the other hand, most of the verbiage among the keep comments had not to do with why this person is notable, but rather, how awful it went to AfD so quickly. When delete or keep votes were registered is not a matter of consideration. <b>Overturn and delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 02:19, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Endorse closure</b>. When delete or keep comments were registered is relevant. The initial batch of votes came before the article was finished. After the article was completed, all subsequent votes were to keep. Although the original article did not do a good job of explaining notability, and predictably received mostly deletion votes, the finished version received no deletion votes, and should be allowed to remain. Also of note is that the AfD is not a vote, but an opportunity to come to a consensus: the arguments are what matters, not just the vote count. A good number of the votes violated <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>, and as the original deletion request was based on the idea that the subject did not fulfill the notability guidelines, which was shown to be incorrect, there is no reason for this article to be delted. -<b><a href="../../../s/n/e/User%7ESneakyTodd_6f8a.html" title="User:SneakyTodd"><font color="orange" size="+1">Todd</font></a></b><font color="#007FFF" size="-2">(<a href="../../../s/n/e/User_talk%7ESneakyTodd_a39a.html" title="User talk:SneakyTodd">Talk</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SneakyTodd_dbfd.html" title="Special:Contributions/SneakyTodd">Contribs</a>)</font> 03:03, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse closure</b>, AfD is not a vote. I agree with Majorly that the delete opinions were very weak, and failed to explain why they interpreted the idea of notability as such in this case (see <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">this essay</a>, there's a secton on it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ILIKEIT#Just_a_policy_or_guideline" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ILIKEIT#Just_a_policy_or_guideline" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>).

<p>re-emphasize the notability of ASHIKA , who are about to embark on their third world tour (icluding JAPAN , AUSTRALIA, USA andEUROPE.) A member of ASHIKA (Ro Prasad) is a member of the legendary KILLING JOKE, as a DJ. These are all criterion for inclusion. It appears you have no real understanding of contemporary rock/metal and cannot realize the notability of ASHIKA. There is an article reviewing BLACK CELEBRATION festival, 7th nov 2005@ astoria theatre in London uk. where Ro Prasad represented KILLING JOKE,as a DJ. type BLACK CELEBRATON in google search.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As deleter, I deleted this per the seventh article criterion at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion</a>. The article made no assertion of importance beyond the claim that the band are the first to fuse rock with Eastern instrumentation, something I think was achieved at least 30, if not 40 years ago. Further, I fail to get any hits on a search of either the NME for Ashika, <a href="http://www.nme.com/index.php?search_term=Ashika&amp;class=search&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;search_type=site" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nme.com/index.php?search_term=Ashika&amp;class=search&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;search_type=site" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>, or Kerrang, <a href="http://www.kerrang.com/nav?page=kerrang.reviews.artist&amp;subresource_filter=news&amp;slug=Ashika" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kerrang.com/nav?page=kerrang.reviews.artist&amp;subresource_filter=news&amp;slug=Ashika" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. I also have access to a database of newspaper and magazine articles going back to the early to mid nineties, and can find no reference to Ashika or Ro Prasad. What references I can turn up are biographies added by the band itself to places such as MySpace or the communal editing sections of the Channel 4 website. I would also think that there's a strong possibility the 11th general speedy criterion applies. Once Ashika have completed their tour with Killing Joke, hardly a band I would describe as contemporary, maybe they will have generated enough press on which we can build an article. Until that point, I stand by my deletion. I have already pointed the opener of this review to appropriate policies, such as <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>, and I think there may be a misunderstanding here of what sort of a resource Wikipedia is. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 10:38, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It rather depends on the bar to publication. Christian books are a dime a dozen and the vast majority are sold in relatively small numbers only through the web or specialist booksellers. An ISBN is a good start to finding out how important the book is. The "article" did not make any claim of notability whatsoever, nothign,l for example, about circulation or anythign else. Your articles on the books republished on Al-Islam.org have the appearance of a walled garden, each asserting notability by reference to others whose notability rests in turn on the original. How about, instead of arguing over a one-sentence substub, writing an article which actually makes some substantive claim of notability? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> - valid AFD with no new information. Virtually all churches will get plenty of g-hits simply because there are lots and lots of websites that index churches ... but those are trivial references, not meaningful ones. Size itself isn't really a meaningful criterion for notability. If there aren't any non-trivial and non-self-published sources of information, we don't really need an article on the church or anything else.

If it is indeed the "largest church of a small city" then it deserves mention there, and that article isn't too long to talk about religion in the city.

<p>I normally wouldn't contend this kind of decision, but I'm having a couple of problems with it. It was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anal_stretching_78a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anal stretching">nominated for AfD</a> by <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamKinney_653f.html" title="User:SamKinney">User:SamKinney</a> with the justification: "Wikipedia is not a how-to guide nor is it a dictionary. Nothing within this article is actually referenced and the bunch of external links at the bottom are not valid citations so I say delete this and salt the earth.". The article is encyclopaedic. Even if it were not the case, the subject has the capacity to be encyclopaedic. The rest of the justification is concerned with referencing: deletion seems like a rather destructive way of dealing with a lack of references. The article now seems to have been protected from recreation so even if I wished to create a fully referenced encyclopaedic article, I can't (being an administrator I could, but I won't). The subject of the article is notable (375k Google hits, several mentions in scientific journals), it is verifiable and referencable (the journals). I hope to have this article recreated so that the community can deal with it in a constructive manner. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 17:00, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ok ... some of us don't have the benefit of being able to see the history. But what is wrong with that talk page that justifies deletion or protection? Even if the discussion isn't meaningful, there's no reason to cut off potential meaningful discussion on the appropriateness of either an article or a redirect by this name. If that is the only content on the talk page, I guess nothing is lost by deleting it, but I don't see a justification for protecting it. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

Apparently both articles have been deleted, including the edits I made to them. I'm not sure why they were deleted -- the subject is obviously notable as a major bike manufacturer, and I can't find a related AfD vote. The weird part is that I didn't see them in the deletion log, and the deletion was apparently pretty recent.If the articles are still available to admins, they should be undeleted. <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwinxor_67b4.html" title="User:Twinxor">Twinxor</a> <i><a href="../../../t/w/i/User_talk%7ETwinxor_cb15.html" title="User talk:Twinxor">t</a></i> 07:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for your advice, ColourBurst. Based on the admins' comments, it looks to me like the page might have replaced with an advert for Specialized.

<p>Originally was deleted because a camper created the page and posted nonsense, causing the page to be deleted in protection from re-creation. The same thing may happen to an alias of the camp, Camp Ramah in Wingdale, created by the same camper and with similar vandalism nonsense. The thing is, Camp Ramah in the Berkshires is an important and notable place and should be allowed to be recreated. I don't know so much about this particular camp, but there are editors who can <i>constructively</i> create and expand a flourishing article.

<p>The deletion seems to be based upon the criteria that the LudumDare.com website is not notable. The LudumDare is an event rather than a website. The competition itself has occured 8 times, The fact that the competitiion occured twice while the LudumDare.com website was unavailable distinguishes the two clearly and dmonstrates that the event is notable in it's own right. The Ludumdare is one of a class of peronal challenge competitions that includes the <a href="../../../n/a/n/NaNoWriMo_1319.html" title="NaNoWriMo">NaNoWriMo</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_day_roguelike.html" title="Seven day roguelike">Seven_day_roguelike</a>. 218.101.24.51 22:18, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>well first of all, is it agreed that if the competition is as I say then it is notable (that is, the event has occured 8 times with over 60 competitors completing games in the most recent competition, larger numbers for entrants who drop out of course.) , then I can look at hunting down some sources to confirm that.
<dl>
<dd>No, that's not even close. My school's homecoming game has occured at least 36 times with 60 competitors, yet it most definitely is not notable. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 03:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think playing an instance of a game is somewhat less notable than the creation of a game, and it seems disingenuous to suggest that an instance of a team event can be counted on the same basis. In actuality there are only two teams competing. Never mind that though, Rather than poking holes in your comparison, I'd rather get to the matter at hand. Here's what I know of the Ludum Dare. It's a competition amongst programmers where they develop en entire computer game from scratch in a 48 hour period. It has been held a reasonable number of times, Given the difficulty of the challenge and the number of finishers, I think it can be considered worthy of note, but in terms of wikipedia noteworthyness it seems it might be difficult to find sources, although it gets talked about quite a bit I haven't yet managed to find something that would be a good source. I think it is noteworthy so I'll keep half an eye open to see if someone writes about it. Having said that I do still think that the deletion criteria was incorrect, it may meet another deletion criteria, but not the one that did it in.</dd>

<p>Speedy deleted with no explanation. Google for "slashdot.org" returns 1,320,000 results. Google for "linux.org.ru" returns 568,000 results. Considering the number of people that speak English and the number of people that speak Russian, one may make a reasonable conclusion that the popularity of Linux.org.ru is at least as high as that of slashdot.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I still think they should be deleted, but we could have problems with people recreating them under other names, without understanding <i>why</i> they're not appropriate. For now, what about crippling and re-directing the 90's category (plus 90, 91, etc. sub-categories) to a brief "child protection" page, saying why these are bad ideas and aren't allowed? If, later on, we decide some age groups are okay, we can re-activate those specific ones. E.g. if we decide 13's the cutoff age, we can turn 90, 91, 92, and 93 into valid categories, but keep the others as locked down redirects. Next year, we activate 94, and so on. If we decide 16's the cutoff age, then we only re-activate 90 for now. I don't know if this is practical with categories or not, but I'm just throwing the idea out there. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 13:44, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b>. Nonetheless, it will no longer be a category just for children. "It contains only children (and liars)" may very well be a valid argument against a category, but "it contains many children" (or even "it contains mostly children") is not. There are numerous other categories that contain <i>mostly</i> children, conveniently filed under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_by_interest_c3ea.html" title="Category:Wikipedians by interest">Category:Wikipedians by interest</a> or psuedocatted under userbox whatlinkshere? pages.

<li>No, but it will just mean virtually everyone in it will be a child. I've also yet to see any argument stating why we need these categories in the first place.

<li>BTW I've already said I would delete most user categories as worthless. In fact, I would change the burden of proof so that if any editor wanted a new user category they would first have to show it was necessary for WP. Most of them are simply tolerated because they have no potential to cause harm. This one does. How is "basic demographic information" in user categories necessary for building this encyclopaedia? (In any case, this user category would be statistically worthless as it would be filled only by random self-selectors not the sum total of all Wikipedians born in the 1990s). --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 11:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>On <a href="../../../u/c/f/WP%7EUCFD_b337.html" title="WP:UCFD">WP:UCFD</a>, interested in categories are probably the most kept set, because they are encyclopedic and do aid in collaboration on those subjects.

<li>Amarkov, as a Wikipedian you are smarter and more computer literate than most people. I understand your concern because Wikipedia shouldn't be serving as a parent but I don't see how the encyclopedia is being harmed by being over-cautious here. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendan_Alcorn_93cf.html" title="User:Brendan Alcorn">Brendan Alcorn</a> 04:32, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe it isn't being harmed. I don't know if it is, although I believe it. The issue of the encyclopedia being harmed should still be decided through an XfD, not through an admin unilaterally deleting, or claiming a law which does not apply really does. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 04:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Again, I understand your concern but it looks like he acted in good faith in concensus to the other category deletion.

<ul>
<li>But the argument for deletion is that the category <i>is</i> children, not just that it might contain some. Any category is likely to contain some children, but that's useless, without knowing anything more. For that matter, I don't think that the specific year categories are helpful at all, which is why I deliberately did not include them in the DRV. Thus, we don't really have the problem with specific years giving ages. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 05:08, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Endorse closure</b>. "Strong community interest" (whatever that means) is not a reason for undeleting an article which had noted <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and sourcing problems. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 09:59, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse closure</b>, brave and valid. Only one source was ever found for this supposed "global phenomenon", and this despite the existence of an external web community dedicated to finding references. I'm not even convinced that the newspaper report was independent, as it may have used Wikipedia as its source for the supposed scope of the game. It's also been a vandal magnet for ever. Bwithh's comments in the AfD are especially persuasive. In the end, as the closer more or less says, <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> does not trump <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:05, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No Vote</b>. I will be the first to point out that I don't spend much time editing Wikipedia, so red flag my name all you want. I haven't read all the WP guidelines and therefore I am refraining from "voting" on this subject. However, I wanted to throw out there that while there may be no official or reported (at least ones that qualify) sources, the existence of such a game can exist and be of significant interest to humans now and in the future. While I understand the importance of keeping opinions out and facts in, I also wonder if the simple fact that such a game has spread to so many people is worth mentioning anyway, perhaps noting that there are no verifiable sources for it. Again, against my credibility on the subject, I would like to mention that for 7 years (possibly 8) my friends and I have introduced such a game to most people we meet and have "played" ourselves for just as long. Even now as we are college students having started "playing" in middle school we will hear someone yelling about having lost with all of us subsequently fretting about losing as well. I must admit that something that has stuck so strongly is probably worth mentioning somewhere, though perhaps an encyclopedia is not the best place. I just feel that Wikipedia is the perfect place for such storage of knowledge as it presents itself as an encyclopedia written by the everyman and edited, reedited, and verified by their peers. What better place to save such information, if it is truly worthy of saving that is. So with this long winded, opinionated, whatever you want to call it, I'll leave it up to the more reputable and common editors of this fine piece on Internet real-estate to decide what it should contain.

<li>The problem is the <i>verified by peers</i> bit.

<li>You can't really make an article and have it say that no verifiable sources exist; having sources is a requirement for keeping the article here. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 11:05, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Unfortunately, there inlies the problem. Just because an encyclopedia is edited by common people doesn't mean we can use common people's knowledge as reliable sources of information. Many people believe things that are patently false; <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legends.html" title="Urban legends">urban legends</a>, for example.

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b> - valid closure within admin discretion. AFD is not a vote and admins have to look at the arguments.

<li><b>Overturn</b>. I count 24 <b>Keep</b> votes and 28 legitimate (non-joke or "article is dumb") <b>Delete</b> votes. Of these delete votes, I count 6 that accept the notability of the article, but simply have concerns about the lack of sources, NPOV concerns, or request cleanup. Since by definition the stipulation of notability means the article passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, I don't think we can count these as delete votes. That leaves us with a 24:22 keep victory. This is a <b>No consensus</b> result, NOT a consensus for deletion. I'll remind editors that the number or subjective reliability of published sources is completely irrelevant to this debate; the existence of this <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">meme</a> and the nature thereof are well-established (sourcing these is an article quality consideration, NOT a possible justification for deletion). The sole concern here is its notability, and the number of websites dedicated to the game and the thousands of Google results for it obviously satisfy notability. There's no debate here, restore the article.</li>

<li><b>To clarify</b> my position: This article would be eligible for deletion if one of two conditions were met: The article fails factual accuracy, or is non-notable. The first condition is not met, as the factual accuracy of the article is not in dispute. More sources would make the article BETTER, but this is simply an article quality/cleanup consideration, not a justification for deletion. As for the second, I believe the article is clearly notable, as it is the subject of a newspaper article and has two domains, one that includes a line of clothing. There are also dozens to hundreds of blog posts discussing this meme, and Google returns over 10,000 results of Game references. I think we have two main problems here that lead editors to think this article was eligible for deletion, which is the confusion or conflation of the two conditions above, and confusing WAYS that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> can be satisfied with REQUIREMENTS for its satisfaction. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlereon_9ed2.html" title="User:Alereon">Alereon</a> 20:06, 1 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlereon_9ed2.html" title="User:Alereon">Alereon</a> 19:49, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The IFD discussion of this image was closed as a keep <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2006_December_15_b590.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2006 December 15">here</a>. This is a news media photo for which Wikipedia has permission to use, but which is not a free image. (The permission was obtained late in the discussion - we had neither the permission nor even the source for most of the discussion so most of the discussion is moot.) We do not use "by permission" images unless they also qualify for fair use. <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html#counterexamples" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR#counterexamples</a> lists news media photos specifically as not qualifying for fair use. We only use media photos for an article on the photo itself, not to illustrate the subject of the photo. Most of the keep&#160;!votes were <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> and no reason was ever demonstrated why this image should be an exception to our general rule on using media images. I suggest <b>overturn and delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:34, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Overturn and delete</b> as not fair use (by permission" images that do not qualify for fair use are speedy deletion candidates). --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#3399FF">desat</font></a></b> 05:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Overturn and delete</b>. It is not obvious that this is even legal fair use. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 07:02, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Overturn and delete</b>. Wikipedia is not the only place these photos end up - several for-profit sites use the images/text from WP as well, and therefore a "Wikipedia-only" license is most definitely invalid. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 16:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Overturn and delete</b> unless permission is granted to allow this image to be used by others than Wikipedia. If not, these images are speedy deleted by order of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> since May of 2005. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 20:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should be worth noting that we can use our permission only images if fair use also applies; I say this without commenting on whether fair use does apply in this case. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 23:19, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are correct, of course. Permission is essentially a "non-issue" for Wikipedia's image use. Even if we don't have permission, we will use the image if it qualifies for fair use. If we do have permission, we will not use it if it does not qualify for fair use. My contention is that this image is a media photo being used to illustrate the subject of the photo, rather than for commentary on the photo itself, and therefore it does not qualify for fair use according to <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html#counterexamples" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR#counterexamples</a> #5. News media photos are deleted regularly at IFD and no reason was ever given why this image should be considered any different from any other media photo. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This (translated) term is a concept mentioned in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrash</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishna.html" title="Mishna">Mishna</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemara.html" title="Gemara">Gemara</a>, and in Yad Hachazaka of the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambam.html" title="Rambam">Rambam</a>. I think they deserve to be differentiated from the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Laws_of_Noah_49a8.html" title="Seven Laws of Noah">Seven Laws of Noah</a> due to the fact that according to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> they where inact for the 930 years from <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam.html" title="Adam">Adam</a> to <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a>, as predecessors of the Noahide Laws. <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">frummer</a> 02:39, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Endorse closure</b> There was consensus in the AFD. You have two paths forward - you can either go find reliable sources and rewrite the article using them, or you can redirect to <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noahide_Laws_3e06.html" title="Noahide Laws">Noahide Laws</a> and add a sentence about "the first six are sometimes known as the Six Laws of Adam", or something to that effect. For the latteryou should at least have a source for that fact. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:12, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse closure</b> - valid AFD and no source provided for the information. If the six laws of Adam are discussed in the Talmud, can you point to them in an English translation of it? Wikipedia is not the place for novel religious interpretations or theories - if this is a new interpretation of the Torah, it really doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:50, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
