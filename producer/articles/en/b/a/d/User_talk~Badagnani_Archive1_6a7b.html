<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry I didn't reply sooner, but I set your question aside, and then, of course, I forgot about it.</p>
<p>The dot maps are made using Paint Shop Pro 8. I start by datamining the Census Bureau's databases and TIGER mapping facility, Wikipedia, and anybody else, usually the target state's mapping agency, for all the raw data I need. I put together a rather nicely automated Excel spreadsheet that has the municipalities for each county in the target state, including latitute and longitude. The spreadsheet also "calculates" the various strings needed for each Wikipedia article (like "Image:MNMap-doton-Winnebago.png|right|Location of Winnebago, Minnesota" and "MNMap-doton-Winnebago", so that part is just cut and paste. The other element is to take some x,y points from each state's image that I can reference to a longitude and latitude and then do a linear regression to create map coordinates, again calculated by Excel. For instance, given Winnebago's longitude and latitude, its dot should be centered at (104,283) on the image.</p>
<p>I place the dots manually using Paint Shop Pro (never figured out the Python code I'd need to automate that part) and most important, I compare the location I put the point with its location on a county map for each county. This is <b>necessary</b> because of non-linearities in the process, and other minor issues that can move a point a few pixels away from its real map position.</p>
<p>I'm very slowly finishing Minnesota - the other states I've done have gone much faster, but since April, I've had to spend more time in the real world. Still, I'm gonna see it through. Thanks for your question. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatbar_f27b.html" title="User:Catbar">Catbar (Brian Rock)</a> 21:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>It could be harder, but it does take some time and effort. I tend to think of it like a crossword or jigsaw puzzle, but with some permanent benefit - a Wikipedia Dot Project map.</p>
<p>I think the tech to automate it fully is around now, or is coming available. I see it being used to replace these maps with some more spiffy ones. Some of the base maps are a bit fuzzy.</p>
<p>My wife is going to school in Kent right now - we were there yesterday. She's there four times a week, and I get over once in awhile to eat at Ray's Place with her. I like Kent - it's a nice place. Take care. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatbar_f27b.html" title="User:Catbar">Catbar (Brian Rock)</a> 02:23, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is much easier for someone coming to the USA to keep the name intact (perhaps removing diacritics) and bend pronunciation. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 21:29, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One more reason: the Czech language actually doesn't need any diacritics, the proper pronunciation is almost always deduced without any ambiguity, naturaly to native speaker (Masa gets pronounced as <i>Máša</i> while Masha is a foreign word never to used by Czechs).

<p>Thanks for the reformatting. I'll check your code and see how you did it. Should the photo credit also appear in the caption on the main page or is it proper to only list it in the page you get when you click on the photo? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 20:48, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now I notice the photo in the saxophone article is back to the original uncropped photo from Jay Easton's site, with poor contrast. I did spend some time adjusting it so that it would work better in the article. Is the reason you changed it back because you objected to the cropping and contrast adjustment? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 21:03, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think credit in the info page is enough. I swapped it for the original large version just so the large version would be available (it's resized for the article).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hadn't realized you'd cropped it...doesn't really bother me, but neither would recropping as long as it's noted. I was about to make the contrast match, but then I remembered that images are oddly darker and less contrasted here on my Linux box than on most people's computers. I've no objection to upping the brightness/contrast on the big one - I'll even do it if you like.</dd>

<dd>Now, do you think you could ask Jay to release it under a free license? You see, at the moment it's by permission, and as you'll see on the information page, Wikipedia will soon be removing all such images from its content <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. ¦ <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReisio_4712.html" title="User:Reisio">Reisio</a> 21:09, 2005 August 6 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, as far as I know. I think Wikipedia really operates more along the lines of "We trust what the users who upload images label their licensing as...unless evidence to the contrary is brought forward.". So as long as you and Jay are square and the image is watched (as of course it will be) so that its licensing isn't abused, everything should be peachy. ¦ <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReisio_4712.html" title="User:Reisio">Reisio</a> 21:56, 2005 August 6 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd reverted the edit. The country he died was then called Czechoslovakia. IMHO it is the best to avoid country name at all as the official name had changed dozen of times during last 150 years. The Moravia itself was not country, rather large administrative unit.</p>

<p>Regarding adding the Ogg Vorbis DN! audio links to the Cindy Sheehan page: The audio is only in non-free formats, namely RealAudio and MP3. The links to the Ogg Vorbis files are not linked to from DN!'s transcript pages despite that free formats are available on archive.org as well. I was under the impression that Wikipedia cared about Ogg Vorbis audio more than other formats, hence the links to the Ogg Vorbis formats would be welcome. J.B.

<p>Badagnani, you wrote... <i>Amazing editing on the Sheehan article. Re: Bush's decision to leave, make sure you make a distinction (doesn't exist with your newest edit) between Bush's *decision* to leave Crawford and his *leaving* Crawford.</i></p>
<p>My intention in that edit was to capture two things 1) Cindy Sheehan had planned to leave Camp Casey on August 25. Her leaving Crawford was actually before her planned date by a few hours. Her leaving had little to do with Bush leaving, it was nearly according to plan. 2) Bush decided to leave his vacation, but actually dragged his heels and went to Washington. He did not even stop in Louisiana to make a supporting visit and speak. It's almost as if the man totally lacks compassion. I will add the time he actually left. Thanks for reminding me.</p>
<p>Also note that he originally planned a five week vacation. If he left nearly a week and a half early, it might focus on it. Notice how the media conveniently changed it to a month long vacation (meaning four weeks)? <a href="../../../k/g/r/User%7EKgrr_00fe.html" title="User:Kgrr">Kgrr</a> 05:49, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Badagnani, thanks for your help in the edits. YES!! It definitely looks like they cooked the books with the five week vacation. Also, how interesting that this disaster is almost exactly four years after 9/11. I wonder if he had to be coached to leave his golfing vacation to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Also, it looks like Cindy Sheehan will take the next three weeks to take the bus tour all across the US. I really believe that we are about to see the end. If Bush is not very careful, he will look like a fool by continuing the war in Iraq and not sending relief efforts (the National Guard) to Louisiana in time. Maybe this is Bush's accidental exit strategy. We'll see. <a href="../../../k/g/r/User%7EKgrr_00fe.html" title="User:Kgrr">Kgrr</a> 06:56, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Badagnani, bwwaaa-haha! I think Bush's address of the Boy Scout Jamboree is classic! Don't you think it would have been better if he cancelled that appearance and landed in Baton Rouge to have a face-to-face with the Governor of Louisiana?? Do you think he scheduled this visit to the Jamboree at the last minute? (afterall he cut his five week vacation short to go to Washington DC to deal with this emergency) <a href="../../../k/g/r/User%7EKgrr_00fe.html" title="User:Kgrr">Kgrr</a> 07:33, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You wrote:</p>
<p>Perhaps you have forgotten, but your actual words were not "far left" but "read - fundamentalist left wing." You know and I know that your edit was made with blatant POV, and as such not appropriate to WP. General policy is to use the term individuals prefer to describe themselves. The summary on the WP page for "Free Republic" begins: "Free Republic is an American Internet forum and activist site for conservatives." Would I, or any other responsible wikipedian, add to this: "read - fundamentalist right wing"? Absolutely not. This is an encyclopedia, not a blog. Badagnani 07:05, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fair enough, and though I have some reservation, I won't start up with a freedom fighter. (or anyone for that matter) For example, David Duke refuses the label 'racist' and many communists would prefer to be called humanists etc etc. So again - objectivity doesn't exist. For example, compared to me even Pat Buchanan and Michael Savage aren't right-wing. (not enough, anyway) but I guess the guy with access to the ban button has the last say in all matters, and here as in most places, we need not say what side on the social spectrum they are. <a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWww.jpfo.org_fb61.html" title="User:Www.jpfo.org">Www.jpfo.org</a></p>

<p>Yes, the preserved tofu with whole soybeans and rice is what I was trying to indicate with "...paste made of rice and soybeans." I just made the changes to the article to better communicate this. I am also certain that with your continued work on the tofu article it will eventually become a featured article.

<p>I think it's also just silken or a softer asian firm tofu. Maybe the fact that it's curdled with seawater deserves a special mention? As for the "uncurdled" part, I have no idea what it means. Maybe its "pure" and "uncurdled" goodness comes form the "sincerity" needed to make it.&#160;;) As for the "tubu chorim", I'm not sure it's a good idea to put recipes in the section. Food ingredient articles can potentially wander off the track to become recipes repositories or endless "preparations lists". If you want to write about it, by all means, mention it in the preparations section. However, the bulk of the recipe should be put in the wikibooks cookbook. If it is culturally important (as <a href="../../../m/a/p/Mapo_tofu.html" title="Mapo tofu">mapo tofu</a> is to Chinese), place it in as its own section in wikipedia, and mention in <a href="../../../t/o/f/Tofu.html" title="Tofu">tofu</a>. --<a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 19:16, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gotcha, but the whole uncoagulated, uncurdled thing is confusing, I guess terminology can really get mixed up. Curdling is the coagulation of milk or milk-like protein solutions into a semi-solid. As schu sundubu is a unpressed, seawater curdled tofu. Let's put it down as a special kind of silken tofu/douhua since it appears to be an unpressed tofu made of plain seawater instead of a seawater derived salt. -- <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 20:08, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Provided that the amount/concentration of coagulant use in producing the tofu is well managed (as should be by the manufacturers) there should not be a bitter taste in the tofu made using magnesium chloride. Although the textures of tofu made from calcium(tasteless) or magnesium(bitter) salt coagulants are different I personally cannot tell from taste alone which tofu is made from which coagulant. --<a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 19:34, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is Burmese tofu really made from chick peas instead of lentils? The Burmese restaurateur who explained it to me told me it was made of lentils. Lentils don't really resemble chick peas (lentils are flat and so much smaller), so I don't know how these two legumes could have been confused. Badagnani 22:51, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nice work on the Folk musicians site. It looks like you're "fixing" many diacritics that were already in place, by inserting their codes rather than the actual diacritic characters. This means that you see the codes rather than the actual characters while editing, which makes it a bit more difficult when editing. One of WP's continuing improvements is that, recently, things were changed so that the characters can be added via the panel below the edit window rather than keying in the codes. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 22:33, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! Yes, it's quite laborious. I tried cutting &amp; pasting from the panel when I first tried editing wiki pages a few months ago and it didn't work. I use a Mac, so perhaps that's why... <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESiGarb_95a2.html" title="User:SiGarb">SiGarb</a> 23:01, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When you edit, can you see a selection of about 100 diacritic characters, in blue, preceded by the text "Insert"? This is directly below the large rectangular gray buttons that say "Save page," "Show preview," and "Show changes." If you click to insert these characters, then they show up as that character instead of codes in the edited version as well as the text of the article itself. That seems to be the way to go since this feature was introduced.</p>
<p>BTW I had no idea there were so many artists in Northumberland (or is it Northumbria?). I've got to check this music out. There was a compilation released in the States some time ago called "Northumberland Rant." <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 23:38, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've tried both clicking and cutting-and-pasting from the "Insert:" pane, but neither works for me! The underline appears but nothing happens in the Editing window. I suspect it's a Mac thing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Cutting-and-pasting gives the character on first use, but then when I "Show preview" (or sometimes much later!) a black diamond with a question mark appears instead of the character. It doesn't always happen straight away, for instance, I'd been working on the "List of folk musicians" for a while before the previous editor's accents all disappeared and were replaced with question marks (which has made it difficult for me to track down some of the names I didn't know - I Googled various versions of the name until something appropriate came up! There are still a couple I can't find).</dd>

<dd>Northumberland is the county, Northumbria is a historical region (at one time, everywhere between the River Humber and the Scottish border!) but Northumbrian music has a definite identity and is widely played in County Durham, so it doesn't just belong to Northumberland. It's a very vibrant tradition and still very much alive, with a lot of excellent new players coming through.

<dd>Caura is one of the valleys on the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Range_cb8f.html" title="Northern Range">Northern Range</a> - northern part of the island, pretty much right in the centre. To tell you the truth, I have never heard of Aroquita, but there could easily be a place by that name in the hills above Caura. Unlikely that it would be Arouca - that's down in the lowlands. Of course, he could have made it up, to seem like he came from somewhere more remote...he cultivated a "Spanish" mystique about him, it may have been true, but it was <i>also</i> part of the "legend".</dd>
<dd>I don't know all that much factually beyond what you have. I read some of his book, which probably warrants mention, I know some of his music, and I have seen many interviews with him on TV - he was "the" historian of calypso, the person that the tv stations went to for a sound bite or an interview. I'll ask my brother-in-law about Aroquita - he knows the hills above Caura fairly well (far better than I do). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 22:25, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, it is not resolved; there's hours of discussion of it in the WP:TOL talk archives - as a generality, those who actually deal with wildlife a lot tend to use caps (it is what you will find in e.g. the vast majority of field guides), while those coming in from a non-wildlife linguistic background tend to argue for lower case. Any day you've a few hours to kill, take a look through those archives&#160;:-). Of the individual articles overall, all or virtually all birds are with caps, most mammals and reptiles are with caps, most fish are lower case, and plants are split about half-half (except the ones that are at scientific names) <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 22:18, 10 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can see your point - I think the problem stems from that while the scientific names are formulated <i>Genus species</i>, English word order switches this to "species Genus". So if one were to follow the scientific principle for English names, then it would be "common Starling", which of course looks silly. Thus the move to capitalise both. That birds and mammals are more capitalised than other 'less glamorous' groups is to a certain extent a reflection of individual wiki editors, but also that the more glamorous groups tend (because of their popularity) to have more stabilised formal English names agreed by governing authorities (e.g. <a href="../../../b/o/u/BOU_5669.html" title="BOU">BOU</a>, <a href="../../../a/o/u/AOU_107f.html" title="AOU">AOU</a>) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 22:46, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Badagnani - the sale of Cassia labelled as Cinnamon is also common in Britain, and I strongly suspect also India, as the packs of Cassia sold as Cinnamon that I can get here are packed in India. It isn't just the US where this happens! Of the refs/ext links, I merged them so as to reduce the number of headers to just three, thereby getting rid of the contents box (only useful for very long pages, which Cassia isn't) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 19:08, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks; the position here doesn't seem to be quite the same as you're saying for the US, both are readily available here, both labelled as cinnamon (so one needs to know both to know what one is getting!). There is though a distinct difference in where one gets them, 'real' cinnamon from "native English" shops, and cassia labelled cinnamon from Indian/Pakistani ethnic shops. This I suspect at least in part derives from the use of cassia as an Indian food spice (put a couple of pieces in rice while it is cooking, for lovely aromatic rice to go with curries), while cinnamon is used more in traditional European sweet dishes (powdered cinnamon sprinkled on stewed apple, etc) - but that doesn't explain why the Indian shops sell their cassia labelled as cinnamon. Several UK cookery books on Indian food by ethnic Indian authors go to the trouble of specifying cassia for Indian recipes and then go on to state that it is usually sold labelled cinnamon, which probably does help people here understand the difference. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 21:32, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds delicious&#160;:-) My mother points out that selling cassia as cinnamon also makes things difficult for people who want cassia: they look for it and can't find it because the label conceals it.

One hesitates to take on <i>New Grove</i>, but italicization in a case such as this is, I think, the superior style--allowing us, indeed, to distinguish such a name from (enquoted) nicknames introduced by parties other than the composer.<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDCGeist_4ed5.html" title="User:DCGeist">DCGeist</a> 19:26, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, NYPL has m-a-n-y microfilmed Cowell holographs, as you suspected. I'll go through all the symphonies, not only to address our cataclysmic "Madras" style question, but also so I can informedly add Cowell's work to all the appropriate places in Wikipedia's "Symphony" entry, where he does not currently appear! —<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDCGeist_4ed5.html" title="User:DCGeist">DCGeist</a> 20:40, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you're writing a new section, I won't try to tell you how to format the markup, but if you're editing an existing article, there's no reason to modify the markup for existing sections. For example at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_name_controversy_7f75.html" title="Native American name controversy">Native American name controversy</a> you removed all of the spaces around section heading names. This just adds extra work for people like me that verify all of the edits to articles that we police, and while I don't think it makes any differenece at all, you are chaning markup that is already in keeping with the <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">guidelines on how to edit a page</a>.... -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 04:50, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps my expansion of the "tone cluster" article today may remind you of the "earlier tone cluster guy" you had in mind. The question of which of Ornstein's pieces is the TRUE first tone-cluster one is agonizing: the Violin Sonata, by both encyclopedic attestation and my own ear clearly features clusters--but its dating is ambiguous and I've not yet been able to determine when it was first performed; <i>Three Moods</i>, which I've never heard (or looked at), I submit on the attestation of a responsible scholar; <i>Wild Men's Dance</i>--this is the killer. Any number of scholarly works associate it with Ornstein's use of tone clusters--in adjacent sentences, even in the same sentence, but I haven't found one that specifically affirms that it includes tone clusters. I have listened to two performances--Schleiermacher's interpretation includes what sound unmistakably like clusters, Hamelin's doesn't quite. Either Schleiermacher is absolutely hammering near-clusters or Hamelin is being "musical" and slightly pulling apart what were intended as true clusters. For the moment, I'm going with the second surmise. Off to the library... —<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDCGeist_4ed5.html" title="User:DCGeist">DCGeist</a> 15:38, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Concerning your reversion of my edits:</p>
<p>Since you did not leave a comment of Sheehan's Talk Page it seemed most appropriate to respond here. As I requested in my explanation, please provide a reason that you feel the information re-introduced is important or noteworthy. You did neither. Simply stating that it removes the product of effort of various individuals is not justification for those entries, especially when such an explanation avoids even commenting on my reasoning. If the efforts of many people have undesirable results then those results should still be removed. Further still, your explanation is guilty of the Bandwagon Logical Fallacy. Please, explain why those entries that I removed are important. Such a topic may be extrapolated on in bulk even - you certainly do not have to respond per instance, as I did.</p>
<p>The changes I made were hardly without warning, as I posted a request for opinions on this subject in Sheehan's talk page nearly a full 24 hours prior. While, technically speaking, these changes were unilateral due to a lack of a two-way dialogue, they were so only because no one deemed the issue important enough to comment on. Numerous changes were made to the article, including the chronology, without eliciting comments on this subject, thus leading me to believe people did not have opinions on this matter. Indeed, even in removing my changes you have failed to comment on it. Thus, if one desire multilateral discussion then one must participate IN that discussion.</p>
<p>Once again, please give justification for replacing those events I removed. The information violates wikipedia policy, as I indicated, and as such it should not remain without reason. I am responding here in the hopes of preventing an edit war; however please know that unless justification can be given I will remove the information again. If you do not feel that this issue can be addressed in a timely manner, then please, at the least, indicate so. I await your response. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThought_b324.html" title="User:Thought">Thought</a> 18:41, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you greatly for your reply. However I find particular instances of your reasoning to be somewhat puzzling. By reverting my changes, whole sale, you erased changes that do not add context to Sheehan's actions. Some examples are: The removal of the word "allegedly" from the Activism section, the removal of Viggo Mortensen, Camp Casey Chico, Bush's record for vacation days, Baez's performance, Casey Sheehan's boots, and indeed everything from the Bus Tour section. The Bus Tour is clearly actionary, not reactionary. As for the rest, how did Sheehan react? Providing the causes for a reaction without indicating the reaction itself is less than preferable. The same goes for those events that I did not specifically mention above but that may provide context. If these events provide necessary context then, logically, that which they provide context for aught to be included as well. Thus I might (and do) ask, what was Sheehan's reaction to Bush's August 20th campaign tour? On a final point, going over my changes again I am unable to find an instance where I "purg[ed] mention of Bush's reactions" to Sheehan. Or is the August 20th campaign tour what you are referencing (in which case one can hardly claim that Bush was reacting to Sheehan, but rather general anti-war sentiment of which, at best, Sheehan is a minor spokesperson for)? By my count, out of the 20ish changes I made, only three <i>might</i> provide context (though, as stated, to what I do not know). Those being August 12 motorcade, Bush's August 20th tour, and Sheehan's September 3rd tour. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThought_b324.html" title="User:Thought">Thought</a> 20:37, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Again, thank you for your reply. A dialogue is always a delight. I apologize for the extensive reply, but you raised issues that require precise responses.</p>
<p>To address a minor point that you brought up, Cindy Sheehan certainly holds less significance than those articles that I originally alluded to. Perhaps you disagree on that, but such seems to be a relatively safe assumption given the historical context. More disturbing still is that her article is longer and more exhaustive than Martin Luther King, Jr.’s. This indicates significance far greater than her actions have thus far merited. It is not really a question of Sheehan’s importance in the anti-war movement (she makes a rather good figurehead but as far as an orator she lacks the ability to persuade individuals through reason), but rather her importance in a larger context.</p>
<p>Your concerns, while valid in an abstract sense, do not seem applicable to Wikipedia. It does not matter how many websites contain a comprehensive synopsis of Sheehan, Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia, should not. By nature, an encyclopedia aught not be exhaustive but rather introductory. Perhaps we might be disagreeing as to the extent of information an Encyclopedia aught to contain? If so, then that can be addressed separately.</p>
<p>Political figures supporting Sheehan are, admittedly, of some significance. However, looking over my edits again I note that other than those three instances I have previously mentioned, I did not remove any events concerning political figures. As for celebrities, I must continue to disagree as to their importance. Surely we are capable of determining importance based on merit rather than popularity. Considering that Sheehan’s protest is primarily politically directed, we cannot even suppose that celebrities are capable of providing legitimate political commentary; to do so is to be guilty of the Appeal to Authority Logical Fallacy. Perhaps if there had been a change in either Sheehan’s or Bush’s behavior after celebrity visits, then it might be supposed that they were significant events. Certainly in Viggo Mortensen’s case this is true; though Joan Baez is slightly more complex (at least she has been involved in politics prior, though her performance in this instance does not appear to have made an effect).</p>
<p>As for the boots, I must still maintain that they do not belong in a chronology (I also maintain that they are insignificant, but that is a different discussion). Their use in the AFSC’s display may be notable (though truly the display more so than the boots), but their return is not. Indeed, if these boots are so important to Sheehan’s character, why is the original donation not mentioned in the article?</p>
<p>There, of course, needs to be a respect for consensus and I mistakenly took the lack of a prior discussion on the topic (at least, lacking in either of the discussion archives currently present) and seeming continued lack of concern as evidence that the general population did not care. I will most certainly take NightMonkey’s advice to heart and give much longer warnings in the future. However, that being established, an argument for preservation based on consensus is somewhat faulty. True, Wikipedia encourages consensus and it is something that aught to be aimed for and respected. However, it cannot stand as a sole justification on any given point (rather, it is an important secondary point). At its base, this is a logical fallacy, specifically <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandwagon_fallacy.html" title="Bandwagon fallacy">the bandwagon approach</a>. Like any logical fallacy, its status as such does not mean it is an invalid argument, rather that it is an incomplete argument. We might imagine a situation where a consensus has been reached but that it accepts a false statement as fact. Again, it is a valid point but one that aught not stand alone.</p>
<p>On an incredibly minor note, I would recommend that you look over my exchange with Homoneutralis again. Other than being simply astounded at the length of the article, I do not believe I took a tone that was joking in the least. Rather, if you perceived humor I would suggest that it was from Homoneutralis and not myself. I attempt to be as professional and academic as possible. Humor can, unfortunately, lead to misunderstandings (though in this case it seems to have happened regardless).</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, these are topics whose further discussion should wait until they are brought up on the page itself.</p>
<p>And once again, thank you for your time. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThought_b324.html" title="User:Thought">Thought</a> 04:31, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rather than reverting your reverts, I thought I'd post a note here. My edits did not remove any information or links from the article. I think it is a better article if we shorten it without removing information. I mean, why do we need to know exactly which day each of those folks was there? Why do we need to know which day those organizations announced that they were going to do something that we describe in a date entry two days later? Could you explain why is it important to know which day Katrina hit land in THIS article instead of only referring to it in the line on Bush's vacation? The article is far too long and I would think that removing repetitive information would improve it. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 16:48, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is the Cindy Sheehan text to be deemed beyond reproach? I find it frustrating that any reduction of repetitiveness in the timeline is reverted. The article is far too long and the timeline is exceedingly repetitive. Announcing when the boots are removed from the show and when they get to Sheehan seems excessive. Listing the 16 August announcement of the planned rallies and then listing the rallies themselves seems excessive. Listing the date Katrina hit and the date Bush ended his vacation to deal with Katrina is either repetitive or a comment on Bush (and thus, germane either to an article on Katrina or Bush, not Sheehan). Could you explain why these entries are critical? Or answer the questions in my prior post? I'd like some communication rather than just reverts without explanation. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 13:52, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that you reverted 64.142.90.216's changes to Cindy Sheehan's article and since I undid that particular reversion I thought I would let you know why. Perhaps you are unfamiliar with this feature, but if you click on the picture, or the link below the picture, wikipedia will take you to an information page regarding that photo. In this particular case the page includes who took the picture, when it was taken, and how it was taken, in addition to links to the wikimedia page and to the photographer's website. This information has been available to viewers of Sheehan's page since the image was originally incorporated. Further, if even that is not to be trusted, following the link to the photographer's page will allow you access to his photos. As the Wikimedia page indicates, it was taken on Sept 13th and, verily, the photographer has that very same image of Sheehan posted on his page under the 13th of September. At the time that I write this, you may find the image at the following link. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioerror/page70/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioerror/page70/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>In response to your response: I freely admit I was blunt, but as for rude I would argue the point; indeed I believe the opposite. I undid a change you made and thus it is only right and proper that I give you a reason for doing so. Further, as to the content of my reply, I attempted to be as exhaustive in my reasoning as possible so that you would know that I did not override your change for no good reason. Since you left less than a sentence as to why you found the credit offensive, I had no idea where the chain of investigation broke down. Lacking such information it was most prudent to include the complete process of investigation so that you might fully duplicate it and confirm this information for yourself. Perhaps it was my closing paragraph that you found so objectionable? I believe I was polite up until this point, but here I became blunt. I, unfortunately, must be blunt again. You did revert a person's contribution (small as it may be) because it <i>might</i> have been invalid. Any addition <i>might</i> be invalid, which is why each aught to be confirmed. Such a reason is unacceptable, as I hope you may objectively see. Thus, I merely identified the offending situation and listed two proper reactions.</p>
<p>If anything I said was rude or improper, please let me know so that I may improve. Though it was far from my intent, allow me to apologize for any offense my post may have given. Yet I hope the thoroughness of my comments indicate my desire for an intellectual understanding of the point in question. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThought_b324.html" title="User:Thought">Thought</a> 06:56, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great job on the Regina Spektor article. Where did you get all the info?!</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks! If you sign your post, I can tell you!&#160;:) Just kidding, I listened to her music, then listened to all the audio interviews from NPR and PRI (I added links to them in the article), and read some interviews. Then I synthesized the info into the article. So most of the info is from her own mouth. The analysis about her voice and style I just came up with on my own, and other editors added some in there as well. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 02:02, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Japanese citrus category is a member of the Japanese cuisine and Citrus categories, so according to <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a>, the yuzu page should not be in the parent categories.

<dd>Sorry if I sounded impatient on my talk page. I'd just recategorized <a href="../../../j/a/p/Category%7EJapanese_language_2a7d.html" title="Category:Japanese language">Category:Japanese language</a> and I am in the middle of recategorizing <a href="../../../j/a/p/Category%7EJapanese_cuisine_0674.html" title="Category:Japanese cuisine">Category:Japanese cuisine</a>. Before our discussion I'd had three separate people reverting the edits I'd made, and I was getting a little tired of explaining myself. If you look at the Japanese language category then you can have an idea of how I'm trying to organize the Japanese cuisine category. It does require some skill and judgement to do this, but I think most of the categorization is correct. In the case of yuzu I think you made some valid points as far as the citrus category and yuzu is concerned, although I'm not convinced about the Japanese cuisine category. Most of the other articles in the Japanese citrus category are very short ones. Anyway, the "yuga" is part of the citrus category now. If you still want to include "yuzu" in "citrus", I think it is OK. --DannyWilde 00:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thans for translating the article into English. I've fixed some name-translations like "Breisgau - mashs gau": Breisgau is the name of a geographical area around Freiburg and is often added to the towns name to distinguish it from other cities named Freiburg as well, like Freiburg an der Elbe or Freiburg in Switzerland. "UA" is the abbreviation of "Uraufführung", which means "first night" or "first première at all"; here I don't know how the correct English expression, could you fix that? "Bde.", finally, is the abbrev. for "Bände" which means "Volumes".

<p>Hi Badagnani - Thanks for starting the page! I've found out the reason for the different spellings of the sci name; Nees originally spelled it as <i>Cinnamomum loureirii</i>, but being named after the botanist João de Loureiro (not "João de Loureiri"), this is to be treated under the <a href="../../../i/c/b/ICBN_59d1.html" title="ICBN">ICBN</a> as an orthographic error for the correctly derived spelling of <i>loureiroi</i> (for similar cases see e.g. <i><a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuartia.html" title="Stuartia">Stuartia</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_Pine_81a9.html" title="Gray Pine">Pinus sabineana</a></i>). I've also moved the page to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saigon_Cinnamon_0496.html" title="Saigon Cinnamon">Saigon Cinnamon</a> (with cap C) for consistency with other Lauraceae pages - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 10:48, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>That sounds like kao fu alright. I can see what you mean by the "tripe" part, but I don't see the fluffy part. May be it's just the way I eat them does the dish you had look anything like <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/food/2005-09/07/content_3432480.htm" class="external text" title="http://news.xinhuanet.com/food/2005-09/07/content_3432480.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>?

<p>Regarding the debates on depleted uranium:</p>
<p>The revised page looks much more polished than the earlier version, but its hard to tell which is less POV or factually accurate. Also, the debate seems to be far too heated. Various parties are coming back with references and citations, and it seems they are being dismissed out-of-hand, without just cause. As an article on DU, this article seems long enough. However, this is a matter of considerable interest in the current political and social climate, and it thus would be quite approriate to split this into four or five articles, including health effects of DU, DU in munitions, UN legal status of DU, and so on, each which could treat the topic in extended detail. These are rather interesting topics, and shouldn't be dismissed over concerns about length or wikification. On the other hand, many people have very good noses for when the truth is being stretched, and when subtle lies and distortions are being introduced, and so further development requires that '<i>all</i> editors take the utmost care when putting these articles together. Controversy doesn't help the editing process or the editors state of mind, discussions should stay civil. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 01:56, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Badagnani, I've reverted the change. What was it you wanted to change in the article? The katakana is スモモ and the hiragana is すもも, in case that helps. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 07:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi again. Here are some answers, although I've already gotten your next message:</p>
<p>1) the katakana appeared twice after your change;</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've reverted that. Sorry for the confusion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) why is the Japanese Wikipedia title in katakana if this is a Japanese fruit?;</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Japanese article is on the species. Species names go in katakana, so that must be their rationale for writing it that way. My dictionary has the entry in hiragana, as is suitable for non-scientific contexts. So apparently either is acceptable, depending on the intent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>3) why does it have two kanji (one that looks like Chinese "li," and the other that is phonetic)? My Japanese-language skills aren't good</p>
<dl>
<dd>My dictionary gives 季, and marks it with an ×, indicating that it's not a <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joyo_kanji.html" title="Joyo kanji">Joyo kanji</a>. The Japanese WP gives 酢桃, which I see you've just reinstated (an earlier edit said it's not really used; I have no expertise to judge that). The first kanji, 酢, means "vinegar" or "sour" and is pronounced <i>su</i>; the second, 桃, is <i>momo</i> and means "peach." It's not unusual to have multiple ways to write words in Japanese.</dd>

Its name entered English with its Cantonese pronunciations. As for romanisation, most Cantonese terms do not enter English with the official way(s) of romanisation, since none of the official romanisation methods for Cantonese is popularly used.

<p>I don't know why you've latched on to this particular article for deletion; judging by "Recent changes" there are certainly a plethora of musical groups (often made up of junior high or high school kids with no performance experience or releases) added all the time. The Filipino American contribution to hip hop music and culture is probably the third most significant (after African American and Puerto Rican American), and yet remains little known or acknowledged. I did not make the Native Guns website (another, more expert writer on Filipino hip hop did) but welcome it here, as an educational tool allowing readers to gain more knowledge about this musical subculture. I do assume good faith about your work here (what I have observed until now has been all good), and hope that you will do the same; my work on music articles is always done with complete sincerity and in the hopes that it will help others to learn more about these musics, which are so rarely covered in major media here in the U.S. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 13:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We certainly should cover all walks of music on Wikipedia, that we agree on. While I do not dispute the contributions Filipinos and others have made to the hip hop community, that does not mean we should grant special exceptions to Filipino rap groups such as <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Guns_9292.html" title="Native Guns">Native Guns</a>, nor does it mean that we should be excessively linking to non-notable MySpace pages from the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_hip_hop.html" title="Filipino hip hop">Filipino hip hop</a> article. Native Guns is a rap group from California, not the Philippines, so I see no reason why it should be treated any differently than any other Californian rap group with regards to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<p>I noticed that you reverted my revert of Umph's edits. I don't have anything personal against the guy, but his edits were basically putting the article into a state of dis-repair, something that we took it out of.

<p>The band infobox isn't a problem for me, in fact, I think that was there a few months ago and was removed. However, there were several changes that are against the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a> such as excessive and non-context related linking and <i>removing</i> bulletted lists. Also, the personnel box is huge and highly redundant. This is why I had changed it into a list of personnel like every other band page has. As I said before, his edit was essentially revert to an older version in the first place. It nearly reverses the changes we had made over the past month.</p>
<p>If anything, it seems Umph is against the progression of this article. Another theory could be that he likes the old version better. However, a quick check to the Manual of Style will prove the old version needed a big facelift/copy-edit.</p>
<p>For the sake of saving time, I propose we revert to your edit (prior to Umph's edits) and add his acceptable changes (such as the band infobox) to that edit.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to get Umph's reasoning behind his changes before I do anything to the artcle.--<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatCam_b535.html" title="User:SatCam">Kevin McManus</a> 01:52, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've read about DU in use being contaminated with waste isotopes, but the people who have access to the slugs that can be picked up of the ground haven't confirmed it. My guess is that if it happened, it was probably an exception rather than the rule. There is evidence that the U.S. has experimented with a wide range of DU weapons, including cluster bombs, 9mm ammunition, grenades, and mines. However, apparently only prototypes were ordered, not large quantities. Some of the bunker buster bombs are secret, so maybe they do and maybe they don't have DU. —<a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026"><i>James S.</i></a> 10:43, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I punctuate in the British (Commonwealth, you could say) style, but I do agree with you that the style should, as it does with most other things, be appropriate to the article. It's odd to read articles with American spelling and Commonwealth punctuation. I don't know why that decision was made. Perhaps you could propose changing it on the talkpage so that either can be used. It must be very difficult for American writers to use a different style from the one they habitually use. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 00:59, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This one's been discussed a lot in the MoS talk archives - it appears the so-called 'American' style is not such, but apparently an old 'printer's style' introduced (everywhere, including Britain, etc) because of printing problems with logical punctuation; when modern printing processes made logical punctuation possible, Britain etc returned to it, but the US (at least in part) didn't. I get the impression that quite a few US writers support using logical quotes, because it is, well, logical.</dd>

<dd>On the quotes round article titles, I think this is a Harvard peculiarity, I'd need to check, but I'm fairly sure <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style_fd3b.html" title="The Chicago Manual of Style">The Chicago Manual of Style</a> doesn't use them - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 01:48, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Strange - the odd thing is, I can't ever recall having seen any journal actually use quotes, and that includes papers I've got reprints of from dozens of US scientific journals (for one example available online see <a href="http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/reprint/86/5/711.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/reprint/86/5/711.pdf" rel="nofollow">this (pdf)</a> from the <i>American Journal of Botany</i>: this matches exactly the style I use). I wonder if maybe it is a sciences vs. arts difference? The only US/UK difference I've ever noticed (and very ill-defined with plenty of exceptions both sides) is that US journals tend more to use colons (<i>Journal</i> XX: Y-Z), whereas somewhat more UK journals use commas (<i>Journal</i>, XX, Y-Z tho' plenty also use colons) - in this case I definitely prefer the US style.

<p>Sorry about this. I just don't have the time to check through all of s9arthur's edits and see what other things he's messed up, so I'm concentrating on adding the link back in. It's demonstrative if you like, rather than actually aimed at fixing the article. I'm rather hoping he'll chill out a bit and start discussing what he wants changed rather than make a war of it, once he realises that he can't write the article unilaterally. I don't want to revert everything he does because he's adding useful content but working out what's useful and new and what's stuff that he's deleting is hard work!

<dd>Clicking on 'go back' will just take you to the point where you clicked the inline ref, so I don't find it all that annoying. This way of referencing also leaves more space for a better explanation of the sources. And yes, you are right in your assumption that this is just another way of stating sources, however..these inline refs have become somewhat the standard on FA.

<dd>May I say that I hate the "Jewish" category label ("Author" "Canadian thinker", whatever) in all its variants and colors, other than perhaps in history, religion or ethnology. I find it outrageous that someone would identify, for examle, Jane Jabobs as a Jewish whatever. Her ethnicity is her own business and has nothing to do with anything. I mean profoudnly zero. (If you don't believe it, ask her.) I would love to think we could xx them forever. But if it's Jewish somethings you are looking for, check out the wonderful Michael Wex. Maybe you or others you know can help round this out.</dd>

<p>Hello, I am not a Korean expert and I do not know the exact reason for the hanja being not "neong" in hangul, but for many other similar cases, I found that there is a rule that says if a word with ㄹ (r/l) or ㄴ (n) is pronounced one way, then the written form will follow that way. In other words, somehow the word got to be pronounced one way, and then the hangul spelling followed the pronunciation.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>大怒 대로 <i>daero</i> (the second hanja is usually <i>no</i>)</li>
<li>許諾 허락 <i>heorak</i> (the second hanja is usually <i>nak</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, usually the l-n combination doesn't change the hangul even though it's pronounced <i>ll</i>, so I don't really know why it's changed in <i>seolleongtang</i>.</p>
<p>I had a similar question in my mind when I created the <a href="../../../h/o/e/Hoeryong.html" title="Hoeryong">Hoeryong</a> article myself (the second Hanja is usually pronounced as <i>nyeong</i>, the same hanja as in for example <i>annyeong haseyo</i>)! -- <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittySaturn_4d7a.html" title="User:KittySaturn">KittySaturn</a> 17:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Badagnani - sorry, I can't help on this one, I'm about as musically proficient as the average cat, and don't know anything about the subject!<br />
PS - pronunciation of Açaí - that heavily aspirated "ahsighee" can't be right, the alternative spelling 'Assai' is surely much closer to the Portuguese pronunciation? The h-s combination sounds particularly difficult to make (unless one has a bad attack of bronchitis!) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 21:38, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>""ah" isn't aspirated" - err, sorry, not so! (at least, not outside of the US). The purpose of including an 'h' in a pronunciation guide is to indicate aspiration; thus "ah" indicates a pronunciation like the comic-book fake WWII German accented 'Ah so!'. Actually, checking the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28pronunciation%29_303e.html#Other_transcription_systems" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (pronunciation)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (pronunciation)#Other transcription systems</a>, it advises against transcriptions altogether, because they are followed so differently by different people - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 21:56, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There's a difference between words and pronunciation guides! The word 'ought' is pronounced "ort", but if one used "ought" in a pronunciation guide, it would be to indicate a pronunciation with each letter in turn, "o-u-g-h-t", sort of like "oe-ugg-hit"! - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 22:40, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My trip to China was related to my job as a software engineer. Although I have the impression that China is currently very active musically (is that correct?), my musical experiences were quite limited. I attended a disappointing concert at the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai_Grand_Theatre_4c0a.html" title="Shanghai Grand Theatre">Shanghai Grand Theatre</a>. Although advertised as traditional music, it was the worst kind of fusion, with inappropriate electric bass, guitar and keyboards, and overloud drums. Apart from that, I saw a couple of bar bands, mostly Filipino. I think Beijing is much more of a center for cultural activities of all types (art, film, music). In Shanghai, it's probably easier to see Western or Filipino musicians playing for foreigners than to see <i>local</i> jazz or rock bands.</p>
<p>I did bring back some interesting CDs of "traditional" music. Actually, I'm guessing that any music featuring large ensembles is not very traditional, since I suspect it's influenced by Western ideas about orchestration.</p>

<p>On my "talk" page, you said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It's called a double bass because it's twice as big (and twice as low) as the bass instrument of the string family, which is the cello. That's reflected in the text I wrote (which is the way the article reads now); how better can it be put, and what is your suggestion?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think my quibble was with anything that you wrote; in any case, what bugged me was that the article said</p>
<dl>
<dd>The instrument's standard English name, "double bass," is a literal translation of the Italian <i>contrabasso</i> (contrabass).</dd>
</dl>
<p>This was clearly wrong (the literal translation of <i>contrabasso</i> is not "double bass", but something else, right?). Anyhow, it's better now, though it's still not clear how one gets "double bass" from contrabasso (though it is fairly clear that "double bass" has to do with the doubling of the lowness of the instrument's pitch, relative to the 'cello). I guess I'm not enough of an expert on the subject to do much more at this point. --<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 02:07, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

As regards, surname Bhadani, you may see little details (partial) in <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhadani.html" title="Bhadani">Bhadani</a>.

As regards your name, I may add few words after you have “de-mystified” the same: Bada is certainly Big or great – and, Gnani if spelt as “Gyani” (with few more variations of spellings, in different parts of India) means in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> and several other languages a learned man.

<p>Hi Badagnani - thanks for the explanation; I guess in this case it might be worth elaborating further and incorporating the links into the text rather than just a 'See also' which doesn't offer any clue why one is given the link. I'd removed them because I thought it a fairly pointless link which can easily be done via the genus page, but there's clearly more to it. On <i>P. lactiflora</i>, that is also very widely used as an ornamental plant as well as medicinal, it is not only <i>P. × suffruticosa</i> that is used that way. If/when a <i>P. × suffruticosa</i> page is started (probably should be, and I'll give it a go sometime soon), should the Chinese national flower details be transferred to it, or is it specifically the wild species that was chosen? - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 11:15, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah I think I'll add the info suggested, great suggestions.

<p>Hi Badagnani, Thanks with your quick help with Alan Canfor. Yes, "Canfield" is indeed an inexplicable typo. If you're interested in doing more work on this article, I'm a bit concerned about the copyright on the photo. It's used a lot of the web but I didn't find the copyright info. I like to have the clearance on that so it can continue to be included in the article.

<p>"== Wang Chang Yuan == + This is not a contest to see who can be more precise in their Chinese romanization. We've got the pinyin there, and the alternate spellings are there to assist Wikipedia users in pursuing more information about this individual. When it comes to Chinese names, or any other names commonly spelled in other alphabets, there are many romanizations, some of them "wrong" ones, often the preferred romanizations of the individuals themselves. Wikipedia is a starting point for people finding more information about subjects. All the romanizations I listed are ones for which there are Google hits (websites). Removing them means that those doing research will not have access to those websites unless they're very clever and try many permutations of spelling, which most people will not do. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 17:10, 29 January 2006 (UTC) "</p>

<dd>for some reason i just saw this on my talk page a few minutes ago . . . dunno how i missed it . . . For cat renaming, there's a bot (NekoDaemon) that automatically makes the changes, provided you put the proper template on the old cat page, and you are an admin. as i'm not an admin it didn't work . . . but some other unapproved bot started to do it instead, so all the cats were changed. i assume there's redirect bots too . . . but like you, i've often spent hours and hours fixing redirects and cats and whatnot. To run a bot you have to get approval, and of course you have to write the program . . . but some people will run bots for you, i think. that time was the only time i've ever needed something done and a bot did it. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">User:AllyUnion</a> runs a bunch of bots, and i'm sure there's others around too. thanks for helping out!! and sorry for the belated response, i really don't know how i missed that. happy editing! --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeah_0915.html" title="User talk:Heah">talk</a></sup> 21:03, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see what you mean, but I just thought that because of the fact that alot of the rap artists (in the Philippines mainly) do not have myspace.com pages readily available (those are majority Filipino-American rap artists), whereas with the current format all the samples (both Filipino and Fil-Am) are available on one page rather than clicking to different sites all over the net. Most Philippine artists tracks are not as openly available as their Fil-Am counterparts as I had to extensively comb the net for those records. But point taken, should we open up a designated section for the myspace.com links? Perhaps re-listing all the myspace.com links under the link section of the page? thx for your input! <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedian13_6860.html" title="User:Wikipedian13">Wikipedian13</a> 23:35, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the opportunity to give input. Having worked very hard for months to make the chronology complete and thorough (something which exists nowhere else on the Internet) I have to say that the new version is only a shadow of the chronology. I don't support this change, as more information (especially exacting and accurate information) is better than less. It is a resource that was built up for the future as the events occurred, and took a tremendous amount of work (with constant reversion of vandalism). The trimming should occur in the commentary section, as it has been doing over the past few days, not the chronology, which is well documented and thorough. There's no need to impoverish the article, as those who feel Sheehan is not a figure of great importance are trying to do. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 20:01, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the article is too long <i>and</i> the chronology which it would replace exists, in exact detail, in the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Casey%2C_Crawford%2C_Texas_aa3f.html" title="Camp Casey, Crawford, Texas">Camp Casey, Crawford, Texas</a> article, which is far less prone to vandalism than this. The reason that the paragraphs are only a shadow of the chronology on the Camp Casey period is that we have a main article for that period - just as we recently did (though not in paragraph form) for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bring_Them_Home_Now_Tour_a14a.html" title="Bring Them Home Now Tour">Bring Them Home Now Tour</a>. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 20:05, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, this makes sense; I don't think that had been explained before. Keep in mind that Camp Casey, though the most well known of Sheehan's activities described in the chronology, is not the only event (or series of events) described in the chronology. And the chronology did make up the bulk of the "story," or drama, as it unfolded, in a way that the text of the article did not (and still does not fully, in the alternate version I read). By the way, who says the article is too long? The text, especially the tit-for-tat criticisms/countercriticisms, maybe; but about the chronology, I don't agree. It's either covered fully/completely or it isn't. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 21:16, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you leave the comma out, as in [[June 5]] [[1985]], then the Wikipedia software knows to treat this as a complete date and not as just a day next to a year. What do you see here?</p>

</dl>
<p>If your settings are set to American, you'll see June 5, 1985 with a comma. If your settings are set to European, you'll see 5 June 1985. This is because the wikicode doesn't have a comma. On the other hand, if I had put a comma in, the Wikipedia software wouldn't see it as a date, so it wouldn't change it based on your settings. According to the MoS, it's best to leave the comma out, and let the software show you dates in your own preferred format. I hope this clears things up.

<p>Hi. I am a bot, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 16% for major edits and 21% for minor edits. (Based on the last 150 major and 150 minor edits outside the Wikipedia, User, Image, and all Talk namespaces.)</p>

<p>Hello. No, your addition of Lentinus/Lentinula to Agaricaceae is not accurate at all. According to <a href="http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp" rel="nofollow"><i>Index Fungorum</i></a>, Lentinus belongs to Polyporaceae and Lentinula (including the shii-také mushroom) belongs to Marasmiaceae. Unfortunately there are many different classifications of fungi into families; I think <i>Index Fungorum</i> gives the best most up-to-date one. But Lentinus &amp; Lentinula are each definitely very different from the Agaricaceae and they are also different from each other. I will revert your change. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrobilomyces_4519.html" title="User:Strobilomyces">Strobilomyces</a> 11:50, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment. Well, I think that perhaps in the distant past all gilled mushrooms were called Agaricaceae. I see that Marasmiaceae does not exist yet; I will create it sometime if no-one else does. I added the authority and changed the family of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiitake.html" title="Shiitake">Shiitake</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrobilomyces_4519.html" title="User:Strobilomyces">Strobilomyces</a> 11:54, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

The first official description of <i>edodes</i> was made by <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Joseph_Berkeley_2800.html" title="Miles Joseph Berkeley">Miles Joseph Berkeley</a> in 1878, but he called it <i>Agaricus edodes</i>, which would put it in the Agaricaceae. There are 9 other old synonyms, including <i>Lentinus edodes</i> by <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolf_Singer_f46e.html" title="Rolf Singer">Rolf Singer</a> in 1941, which would put it in Polyporaceae (which is very different!) In 1976 David Norman Pegler gave it its modern name, <i>Lentinula edodes</i>, and it is in Marasmiaceae. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrobilomyces_4519.html" title="User:Strobilomyces">Strobilomyces</a> 13:21, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm actually away for a week, so drop me a line and if you're up for it, I'll nominate you when I come back.

<p>Hi, from my understanding <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnamese.html" title="Vietnamese">Vietnamese</a>-speakers use the term "cẩm quất" as simply a corruption of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese.html" title="Cantonese">Cantonese</a> name for the <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit.html" title="Fruit">fruit</a>.

The thing is, most Vietnames-speakers are either not actually aware of this <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a>, or find the "proper" pronunciation stilted, preferring simply to call it by the Cantonese way.

<p>I'm not sure if it should be "dimo" or "di mo". Is it regarded as one word or two words in Chinese? As it means lit. flute membrane, it could follow English by using two words, but a Chinese word of more than one syllable should be written as one word in pinyin. There isn't an "ar" in pinyin, I guess it should be "er", there's only a few "er"s, is it the one that means ear? <a href="../../../l/d/h/User%7ELDHan_af5b.html" title="User:LDHan">LDHan</a> 02:41, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Word division is a tough question in Chinese. Linguistically, at least in Putonghua, you could probably argue that "dimo" is one word. There's far from universal agreement on what constitutes a "word" in Chinese, though.

<p>I'm not a chinese linguist but I think it may also be colloquial?? In Singapore, I was always taught to "say it all the same". The Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese also always do dou4fu3. I've personally never head of tone changes depending on word order in Chinese, but then again, like I said, I'm not a linguist. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 01:08, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is the question here whether <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tone_sandhi.html" title="Tone sandhi">tone sandhi</a> exists? I've heard that some tones are changed or neutralised depending on the tone that precedes them, I think. The WP article also has an example. I've read elsewhere that such tone changes must not be reflected in Pinyin, but that instead that those tones should be used that would occur if you were to pronounce the isolated syllable. I don't know whether this is of any help.—<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipeditor_a998.html" title="User:Wikipeditor">Wikipeditor</a> 13:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../j/e/n/Image%7EJeney.jpg_f6ed.html" title="Image:Jeney.jpg">Image:Jeney.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an arguement why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below).

<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>Hi, thanks for pointing that out. I assume you mean the last comma in "Snooland is a town in Polk County, West Virginia, U.S., at the 2000 census the population was 33."

<p>Hi Badagnani - from my books, <i>Citrus ichangensis</i> is correct (except that it is probably of hybrid origin, not a true species; i.e., <i>Citrus × ichangensis</i>); <i>C. grandis</i> is a synonym of <i>C. maxima</i> (Pomelo) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 17:21, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Badagnani! I saw that you returned an image that was removed from the Chauvet Cave article by Shizhao. Just to keep you updated, that image is currently up for deletion at Wiki Commons. I had been working on the article and noted there were problems with the copyright but I don't know that I took all the steps I should have to alert people to the RfD.

<p>Well, there are two separate lists now, but <s>fairly shortly</s> I plan to replace the existing A-K and L-Z lists with pages that simply transclude the by-letter lists. This is based on a proposal I made quite some time ago, at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Korea-related_topics_4e8f.html" title="Talk:List of Korea-related topics">Talk:List of Korea-related topics</a>.</p>
<p>The LKRT has become so unwieldy that despite its high profile it gets very little use or attention from the community. The hope is that this situation will improve if it is changed into a longer-format list with capsule descriptions (and maybe a few pictures); at least then it will be more fun to browse.</p>
<p>Sorry for the temporary mess -- I didn't want to make the final switch until I've tidied things up a little. But now that you mention it, it's probably best to just make a clean sweep, so that hopefully others will notice and take an interest.

<p>I realise now that we got off on quite the wrong foot with this <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Chi_Chen_b17c.html" title="Chen Chi Chen">Chen Chi Chen</a> thing. The situation is basically that I hate fair use images, and so I generally insist on people following the rules with regard to using them. To do otherwise is, I think, not only illegal but an abuse of the trust that Wikimedia puts in us when they let us edit the encyclopedia. I realised that when you wrote "no one will object", you meant, "no one with a legal interest in the image". However, that point is purely speculation; it's probably true of most unfree images used in any given fashion that they will never actually be the subject of a legal dispute. But I don't think that's a very good excuse for misusing them. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 23:09, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Translating Vietnamese-specific topics from English to Vietnamese is fraught with difficulties: everyone's an expert and chimes in about how it's wrong. This is like drawing a ghost versus drawing a horse: nobody knows what a ghost looks like so you can get away with anything, while everyone knows what a horse looks like so you got to get it right. Many Vietnamese-related topics from the English wiki have inaccuracies that would be unacceptable in the Vietnamese version. For some reason, most people over there like to comment instead of writing articles. We got about 1000 more users than articles!
