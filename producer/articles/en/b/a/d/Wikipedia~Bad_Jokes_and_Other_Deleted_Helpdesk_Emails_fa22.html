<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>You have to consider seriously this message if you want to save your freedom. I met by accident a new system used by the secret services to control people’s opinion and to reduce them like a vegetable on two legs. The enemy is already inside our countries and in this case the first target is the media system but it’s not the only one&#160;!</p>
<p>They use different kind of tools like sublimal messages, drugs like LSD for example, high-tech electronic systems based on a talkie-walkie system where they can talk with you by telepathy until a total insanity by torture, of course they can play on the volume and the frequencies that’s the reason why someone can hear them and not the others (for this aim they have a lot of experts in mental manipulation like doctors in psychatry). The effect of the attack start by a problem with your faculty to be well oriented by yourself with the peak of the attack you have a sensation to have a screw driver in your head and a high degree of pain, the schale of pain can be modified to 0 to 100 percent. Of course, they play all the time on the empty spaces of laws and the borders of the mental illnesses. Nowadays, it’s easy to use satellites system with GPS and high frequencies ray microwaves, antenna, modified car with a special CB, modified helmet if they are on a motorbike, microphone , microcamera, microchips implants but it’s already obsolete and mobile phone for example because it’s up to date and more conventional, they use a gang of agents, up to 215, (for example, they use bus driver, taxi driver, children, old persons, etc…), for spying you night and day by opening your mail and make an unauthorized listening-post and wash your brain. They can also follow you in the street etc… If you have already seen the movie " State Enemy " with Will Smith, their possibilities are under the truth than in reality.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the secret services do their job without a real control from the goverment and they are in the long term a state within the state without any democratic command on what they are doing in the daily people’s life. In this kind of system you don’t have rights, personal life and the capacity to change your life for a better one because the secret services can destroy what you want to do if they decide to do it.</p>
<p>Another dangerous aspect with this system, they can manipulate the masses. They can influence a vote from a person who traditionally votes for the conservative party to a labour party vote, or the opposite, or push people to the extremism . They can create social problems like strikes in any kind of company. They can push you to kill somebody, they can push you to commit suicide, they can organise a rape, they can push you to make a wrong financial decision, they can spy your ideas, etc….So, " Big Brother " seems to be a tourist if you compare them to him. I met this system in different countries like&#160;: Switzerland, France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Germany, United Kingdom, Iceland, Belgium and Tunisia. I estimate more or less that they can command 5 to 20% of the population in each country. Of course, it depends on the educational level in the country and if people in the target are clever or not and other parameters like a free mass media system for example.This rate is inc reasing because it’s their policy day after day. Most of the time people don’t realise that they are under their influence because you have no evident evidences and people think to talk with themselves like a schizophrenic&#160;!&#160;!&#160;! That’s the reason why it’s so perverse and efficient because they don’t realise that they are under control like a robot.This people attitude is a benediction for the secret services for hiding what they are doing in our daily life and they can preserve the appearance of the democracy.</p>
<p>This system started during the cold war against the Soviet Union by a CIA project which is called artichokke (The Physic Nobel Price Brian Josephson had complained because he couldn’t realise experimentation about telepathy, now we know why&#160;!&#160;!&#160;!). Nowadays, this system is used by CIA of course, DST &amp; DGSE (in France), P26 &amp; P27 (in Switzerland), MI5 &amp; MI6 (in United Kingdom), BND (in Germany), MOSSAD (in Israël) etc…</p>
<p>I hope that you could copy this message and forward this information to people because the first step for fighting this system and the secret services aim (reducing democracy like a dictatorship system with only the appearance of a democratic world) is to know that it exists and it’s the beginning to destroy this system like the Berlin wall. I don’t need a doctor Aseum or a political superintendent and you&#160;?</p>
<p>The communist system is not dead, you have to decide if you can die another day&#160;!</p>
<p>If you imagine the worste, it’s worse what you can imagine. The world system that you already know is completly collapsed by this one. The political system, the economical system, the financial system, etc… are already dead&#160;! They can neutralise at any time all the systems and substitute their choices and establish their policy and friends in power.</p>
<p><b>name</b></p>
<p>P.S.&#160;: No rules are respected but they aren’t enough cunning (I have names)&#160;!</p>
<p>You have to consider that after the cold war the secret services budget collapsed. So, if they need a budget they have to create false cases and problems. Maybe, it’s the reason why a tourist with none budget and his hands in his pockets can win against them&#160;! (You have to shoot the monkeys and clean this kind of agencies if you don’t want another world war in the end, because with the high-technologies everything go fast and it’s easy to make a big mistake)&#160;! Finally, you have to notice that you have more monkeys in Geneva and in Swiss army than citizens&#160;!</p>
<p>They can sale anything if you offer the price (including a war).</p>

<p>Hi there. Just wanted to have an expert opinion regarding my experience. I got a bargirl and didn’t know her sexual history. We decided no penetration would occur. We just kissed (for about 45 minutes). Afterwards, she told me to place my finger insider her so she could cum. I really don’t have any idea if she climaxed or not. The twist here is that I realized I had a cut on my upper lip, as well as a wound on the finger I used.</p>
<p>With this story, I have a few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are my risks regarding STDs and HIV?</li>
<li>Is it true that saliva only have traces of virus (of all types) and that it will not be in a position to infect me?</li>
<li>How about my open wound? Can I get infected with vaginal fluids and possibly semen (if she came)?</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you could satisfy my inquiries. Til then.</p>
