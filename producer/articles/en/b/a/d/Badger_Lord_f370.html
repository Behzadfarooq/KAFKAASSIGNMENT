	    <p>A <b>Badger Lord</b> is the ruler of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron_%28Redwall%29_d54e.html" title="Salamandastron (Redwall)">Salamandastron</a> in the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redwall.html" title="Redwall">Redwall</a> series by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Jacques_713c.html" title="Brian Jacques">Brian Jacques</a>.</p>
<p>Salamandastron, the mountain fortress on the coast, defends itself and <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossflower_Woods_7469.html" title="Mossflower Woods">Mossflower Woods</a> from <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermin.html" title="Vermin">vermin</a> and searats or corsairs. The mountain is populated by fighting <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hares.html" title="Hares">hares</a> that serve the Badger Lord or Lady, known as the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Patrol_f0f8.html" title="Long Patrol">Long Patrol</a>. Many Badger Lords (or Ladies) come to find Salamandastron later in their life, guided by destiny to rule there. Sometimes the mountain does not have a badger ruler for a long time, and then it is only lived in by the hares.</p>
<p>The son of a Badger Lord usually, once he reaches adulthood, will go off on his own to wander for a time, as two grown male badgers find it hard to get along sometimes.</p>
<p>Badger Lords or Ladies are often inflicted with the Bloodwrath, a condition which comes upon them in battle, in which they go into a berserker rage, disregarding wounds, and focus solely on the enemy.</p>

<p>The father of Lord Brocktree, Stonepaw ruled at Salamandastron for many years. However, his long reign came to a tragic end when the mountain was attacked by <a href="../../../u/n/g/Ungatt_Trunn_5847.html" title="Ungatt Trunn">Ungatt Trunn</a>. Old and weary, with only the most elderly hares to command, Stonepaw was soon overcome.</p>
<p>Hiding with his remaining forces in the cellars of Salamandastron, Stonepaw sought a way to escape. However, just as he found a way out, Ungatt's horde found their hiding place. Buying his forces time to escape, Stonepaw did battle with the vermin, coming under the thrall of the Bloodwrath. After fighting off many foes, Stonepaw cheated his enemy of capturing him by diving into a bottomless pool with the last of his strength.</p>
<p>Stonepaw's chosen weapon was a javalin. He is one of the few Badger Lords who does not seem to have a memorial in the mausoleum of Salamandastron. However, he is known as the Lord who ruled longest.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Lord_f370.html" title="Edit section: Lord Brocktree">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lord Brocktree</span></h2>
<p>Lord Brocktree is the father of <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boar_the_Fighter_c614.html" title="Boar the Fighter">Boar the Fighter</a>, and the great-grandfather of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunflash_the_Mace_cb96.html" title="Sunflash the Mace">Sunflash the Mace</a>, also legendary Badger Lords. Like his descendants, Brocktree came to the mountain of Salamandastron, where he lived until the end of his days. His weapon was a mighty sword, so massive that only a badger could wield it.</p>
<p>Brocktree, like all Badger Lords, left his childhood home to come to the mountain of Salamandastron, where dwelt his father, Stonepaw. Along the way, Brocktree met many friends and allies, and like his great grandson Sunflash had a soft spot for young ones. However, Brocktree's enjoyable trip to Salamandastron was ended when news reached him of <a href="../../../u/n/g/Ungatt_Trunn_5847.html" title="Ungatt Trunn">Ungatt Trunn</a>, the wildcat who had taken <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron.html" title="Salamandastron">Salamandastron</a> and killed Stonepaw.</p>
<p>Gathering an army of friends and allies, Brocktree marched on Ungatt, an enemy first seen in his dreams. The mighty badger drove the wildcat and his horde from Salamandastron, claiming it for his own. To finish the battle, he challenged Ungatt to single combat. Brocktree was victorious, and in his victory founded the famous <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Patrol_f0f8.html" title="Long Patrol">Long Patrol</a>, bringing the mountain into its golden age. He ruled for many years, the last spent in the company of his son Boar when the younger badger came to the mountain. When he died, he was placed in the mausoleum of Salamandastron, where his memorial is one of the most prominent, and where his hand points out the hidden entrance to the mountain's treasure chamber. Brocktree later appeared in a vision to his great-grandson, Sunflash, along with Boar and Sunflash's father <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Badgers_in_Redwall_adae.html" title="Minor Badgers in Redwall">Barkstripe</a>, preventing Sunflash from going to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Forest_ef74.html" title="Dark Forest">Dark Forest</a> before his time.</p>

<p>A legendary warrior, son of Lord Brocktree, Boar the Fighter fathered <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Mother_6f94.html#Bella_of_Brockhall" title="Badger Mother">Bella of Brockhall</a>. After years of ruling Mossflower, he departed for <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron_%28Redwall%29_d54e.html" title="Salamandastron (Redwall)">Salamandastron</a>, leaving the woodlands in the charge of his son-in-law, Barkstripe. However, after Boar's absence, the wildcats took over; the battle ended in Barkstripe's death.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_%28Redwall%29_c5d4.html" title="Martin the Warrior (Redwall)">Martin the Warrior</a> came to Mossflower some time later, he set out to find Boar to seek his aid against the wildcats. Boar instructed Martin and his companions, providing them with weapons and reforging Martin's sword. He later saw his fate written on the walls of Salamandastron. Accompanied by Martin and his friends and the hares of Salandastron, Boar did battle with a horde of sea rats led by his sworn enemy Ripfang.</p>
<p>During that last battle, Boar was overtaken by the Bloodwrath. He slew many a corsair, but at the cost of his own life. However, Martin fulfilled his promise to Boar and saved Mossflower, and Boar's grandson Sunflash the Mace later came to take his grandfather's place in the halls of Salamandastron. He also made an appearance from Dark Forest in <i><a href="../../../o/u/t/Outcast_of_Redwall_54d2.html" title="Outcast of Redwall">Outcast of Redwall</a></i>, joining his father in preventing Sunflash's death.</p>

<p>Born the son of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Mother_6f94.html" title="Badger Mother">Bella</a> and Barkstripe, Sunflash takes his name from the yellow streak of fur on his head.

<p>While wandering Mossflower, seeking revenge against the Greeneyes, Sunflash is captured by <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swartt_Sixclaw_cda1.html" title="Swartt Sixclaw">Swartt Sixclaw</a> and his small troupe. Swartt uses him as a beast of burden, and calls him "Scumtripe".</p>
<p>Sunflash won his freedom from Swartt after saving a hawk named <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Birds in Redwall">Skarlath</a> from death, gaining the bird as a friend. Skarlath bit through Sunflash's bindings, and Sunflash attacked Swartt with a tree limb, shattering his six clawed left paw. Keeping the tree limb as a weapon, Sunflash called it his <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mace.html" title="Mace">mace</a>.</p>
<p>After fleeing for several months, Sunflash became a legend as he righted wrongs across the land. During one of these incidents, he saved two families of moles and hedgehogs.</p>
<p>Sunflash and Skarlath took up residence with the family, and Sunflash learned to be a farmer and friend to beasts of all ages. However, Sunflash still felt something missing, which was revealed as he lay sick after being bitten by two <a href="../../../a/d/d/Adder.html" title="Adder">adders</a> before he slew them. At the edge of death, he found himself at the gates of the Dark Forest. There, he saw his father Barkstripe, grandfather Boar, and great-grandfather Lord Brocktree guarding the entrance. He was denied entry, for his time was not yet done. Sunflash then saw a vision of his mother Bella, and learned that he was destined to go to Salamandastron.</p>
<p>Leaving Skarlath with the families, but still at his beck and call if need be, Sunflash traveled on. Befriending <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrew.html" title="Shrew">shrews</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squirrel.html" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a>, and <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otter.html" title="Otter">otters</a> alike, Sunflash made his way to the mountain. There, he took command, and became a popular Lord because of his ability to befriend creatures of all age groups. He again took up farming, and later wrote his own poetry. Under his guidance, the mountain flourished as never before.</p>
<p>Sunflash's peace was not to last, as Swartt arrived with his new horde in tow. Donning black armor and chain mail, Sunflash was overtaken by the Bloodwrath as he battled his sworn enemy. Defeating the horde, he pursued his adversary to Bat Mountpit, the peak that was home to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat.html" title="Bat">bats</a>. Along the way, Skarlath was slain by Nightshade, a clairvoyant <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox.html" title="Fox">fox</a> working for Swartt. Sunflash, pursuing Swartt in a blind fury, was knocked out when he was struck from behind with a boulder.</p>
<p>Rather than killing Sunflash outright, Swartt decided to torture him, staking him next to a campfire. He was saved by a mousemaid from Redwall, named Bryony, who had followed Swartt's son Veil to the camp. Bryony loosed Sunflash's bonds enough that he was able to break them, whereupon he killed Swartt by hurling him over the side of a mountain.</p>
<p>Accompanying the Redwallers home, Sunflash met his mother Bella for the first time in years. He stayed at Redwall until her death, then returned to his mountain. He became a terrible foe for all wicked beasts, known only as the Mace to those who faced him. Sunflash took his title of "the Mace" from his weapon, the oaken branch he had crushed Swartt's paw with while escaping.</p>
<p>He later changed his proper name to the more gentle Sunstripe. His legacy would live on in his great grandson, <a href="../../../r/a/w/Rawnblade_Widestripe_aa4d.html" title="Rawnblade Widestripe">Rawnblade Widestripe</a>. Sunflash was unique in his love for all ages, particularly the young children, whom he would play with whenever the chance arose.</p>

<p>Rawnblade is the lord of Salamandastron who is featured in the book <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariel_of_Redwall_ee28.html" title="Mariel of Redwall">Mariel of Redwall</a></i>. His sworn enemy is the pirate king <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabool_the_Wild_e676.html" title="Gabool the Wild">Gabool the Wild</a>, who killed three hares under Rawnblade's command. Rawnblade commissioned Joseph the Bellmaker to craft the Joseph Bell for him, but it was later stolen by Gabool. Setting out to gain vengeance for his friends and to end Gabool's threat, Rawnblade was overtaken by the Bloodwrath, slaying an entire ship's worth of rats and taking their vessel, the <i>Waveblade</i>.</p>
<p>Fleetleg comments "No badger Lord has suffered the Bloodwrath since Boar the Fighter." meaning that between the reign of Boar the Fighter and Rawnblade Widestripe, only those two suffered the Bloodwrath. However in the book <i><a href="../../../o/u/t/Outcast_of_Redwall_54d2.html" title="Outcast of Redwall">Outcast of Redwall</a></i>, a hostage situation causes Sunflash the Mace to slaughter the captors single-handedly. Skarlath the kestrel describes Sunflash's berserk condition very similar the Bloodwrath, "setting off the bloodwrath in him."</p>
<p>Rawnblade later found Mariel out at sea, and together the two traveled to Gabool's stronghold. Meeting up with Joseph and Mariel's companions, Rawnblade set out to attack Gabool's fortress. He entered into a competition with Mariel, Joseph, and several others, all of them swearing to slay Gabool. In the midst of battle, Rawnblade was overtaken by the Bloodwrath, and made his way to fight Gabool.</p>
<p>Inside the fortress, Rawnblade faced his hated foe. Falling into a trap, he became locked in battle with a giant scorpion. However, Rawnblade threw the beast upward and it slew Gabool. Rawnblade accompanied the freed slaves and heroes back to Redwall, where he gave the Joseph Bell to the Abbey. He later returned to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron_%28Redwall%29_d54e.html" title="Salamandastron (Redwall)">Salamandastron</a>.</p>
<p>Like many Badger Lords, Rawnblade is a skilled swordbeast. He carries a massive blade called Verminfate, and is the first badger lord to fall to the Bloodwrath since <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunflash_the_Mace_cb96.html" title="Sunflash the Mace">Sunflash the Mace</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Lord_f370.html" title="Edit section: Urthstripe the Strong">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Urthstripe the Strong</span></h2>
<p>Born the son of Urthound and grandson of Urthclaw, both legendary warriors, Urthstripe was the greatest badger warrior ever to have lived, his power could not be matched and his skills and lust for war were twice as great as any other badger. He was orphaned by the vile <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferahgo_the_Assassin_d14f.html" title="Ferahgo the Assassin">Ferahgo the Assassin</a> along with his brother <a href="../../../u/r/t/Urthwyte_the_Mighty_1502.html" title="Urthwyte the Mighty">Urthwyte the Mighty</a>. Wandering off, the badger found his way to Salamandastron, and took over rule of the mountain fortress. He became good friends with the Long Patrol of hares stationed at the mountain, and like predecessors was a fierce warrior.</p>
<p>Wielding a massive spear, Urthstripe stood against Feragho and his forces when they came to conquer the mountain. After the death of two of his troops and the seeming death of two others, Urthstripe challenged Feragho and his son Klitch. Despite a valiant effort, he was beaten by overwhelming numbers. The Badger Lord eventually managed to kill Ferahgo, but at the cost of his own life. Later, clues left by Urthstripe allowed his brother to find the treasure chamber of the mountain, where Urthstripe was laid to rest.</p>

<p>The albino twin of <a href="../../../u/r/t/Urthstripe_the_Strong_e334.html" title="Urthstripe the Strong">Urthstripe the Strong</a>, Urthwyte was orphaned when his parents died at the hands of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferahgo_the_Assassin_d14f.html" title="Ferahgo the Assassin">Ferahgo the Assassin</a>. Urthstripe wandered off to become lord of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron_%28Redwall%29_d54e.html" title="Salamandastron (Redwall)">Salamandastron</a>, but Urthwyte was found and raised by his grandmother. Growing up with a fierce hatred for Ferahgo, but being rather simple and really quite gentle, Urthwyte was believed to be a ghost by those who saw him.</p>
<p>Urthwyte was pulled into battle when <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Mother_6f94.html" title="Badger Mother">Mara</a>, the adopted daughter of Urthstripe, came looking for him. He came with her and her companions to Salamandastron, and helped face Ferahgo. Sadly, Urthwyte arrived too late to meet his long lost brother, as Urthstripe died. Later, Urthwyte uncovered the treasure chamber of Salamandastron, and laid his brother to rest within.</p>
<p>With Urthstripe's death, Urthwyte became Badger Lord of Salamandastron. He took his brother's damaged armor and hammered it back into shape himself, and wore it as lord of the mountain. He was ceremonially presented with his weapon, a massive club of oak wood. He was also known as "Whiteghost" due to his spectral appearance, a fact revealed in <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlfox.html" title="Marlfox">Marlfox</a></i>. He is fabled as being the strongest Badger Lord known, for when given the task of moving the boulder that leads into the Hall of Badger Lords, Urthwyte didn't just move the rock, as one hare commented "He's lifted the bally thing!"</p>
<p>In the novel <i>High Rhulain</i>, Lord <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandoral_Highpeak_d395.html" title="Mandoral Highpeak">Mandoral Highpeak</a> reveals that Urthwyte developed a special talent for forging armor.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Lord_f370.html" title="Edit section: Orlando the Axe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Orlando the Axe</span></h2>
<p>Warrior Lord of the Western Plains, Orlando wields the weapon of his name, a massive battleaxe. He has as a battlecry the ancient warcall of badgers and hares, "Eulalia". His only known of family are his deceased wife Brockrose and his daughter <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Mother_6f94.html" title="Badger Mother">Auma</a>. Living near the mountains, Orlando's only companion was Auma. In the years before he came to Redwall, he became a skilled cook-though he would never let anyone besides Auma know, fearing that his acquaintinces would think he was going soft.</p>
<p>Orlando's happy life was shattered when <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slagar.html" title="Slagar">Slagar</a> came to the plains. Orlando, fearing no beast, ignored the fox and his band, but unwittingly as he passed by them one day, he left a trail back to his home. Orlando returned to find his home in ruins, with Auma gone. Realizing that it was the work of Slagar, Orlando vowed to hunt the slaver to the end of his days, nearly becoming maddened by the Bloodwrath of his kind.</p>
<p>Setting out after Slagar, Orlando found himself in Mossflower Woods. After traveling some distance and becoming lost, he ran afoul of a family of hedgehogs, accusing him of kidnapping one of their children. It was this strange sight that greeted <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthias_%28Redwall%29_073d.html" title="Matthias (Redwall)">Matthias</a> of Redwall and his companions as they came upon Orlando during their own hunt for Slagar.</p>
<p>Realizing that their goals were common, as was their enemy, Orlando and Matthias joined forces. The two became fast friends of similar spirit, the only contention between them the dispute as to which of them would kill Slagar. Orlando's good humor and fighting ferocity were a welcome addition to the band of Slagar's enemies. Despite the occasional disadvantage of his large size, he made friends with the group.</p>
<p>After many adventures, the group arrived in the realm of Malkariss. Orlando attacked the creature's followers with utter ferocity. Many fell before Orlando's weapon, including the slavemaster <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wearet.html" title="Wearet">Wearet</a>, whom Orlando slew after his seeming murder of Matthias. Reuniting with Auma and the other young ones, along with a host of other allies, Orlando defeated Malkariss' horde. As it had turned out, Malkaris was just an old, deformed <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polecat.html" title="Polecat">polecat</a>.</p>
<p>With the battle won, Orlando and Matthias took it upon themselves to destroy the statue of Malkariss. However, an earthquake seemingly buried them, only for a geyser to send them flying through the air. Encountering Slagar, Orlando and Matthias charged at him, only to see Slagar fall into a underground well and die.</p>
<p>Along with Matthias, his newfound friends and the freed slaves of Malkariss, Orlando came to live at Redwall Abbey. He became a good friend to Constance, and the two were seldom apart. During the time he spent at Redwall, his axe hung in the Great Hall. Some years later, Orlando left to go to Salamandastron. This was mentioned by Rollo the Recorder in <i><a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearls_of_Lutra_4283.html" title="Pearls of Lutra">Pearls of Lutra</a></i>. It is unknown if he assumed the title of Badger Lord, as the tomb of the Badger Lords has not been revisited since before then and he has not been mentioned by any Badger Lords after that period of time.</p>

<p>A young Badger Lady, Cregga Rose Eyes was a dangerous force. She led the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Patrol_f0f8.html" title="Long Patrol">Long Patrol</a> of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron_%28Redwall%29_d54e.html" title="Salamandastron (Redwall)">Salamandastron</a> against the Rapscallions of Gormad Tunn and his son, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Vermin_in_Redwall_ebba.html" title="Minor Vermin in Redwall">Damug Warfang</a>. Her name comes from her red eyes, and the fact that she is more taken with the Bloodwrath than any creature known before.</p>
<p>After mortally wounding Gormad, Cregga became obsessed with hunting down his forces. Traveling at great speed without pause, she set out with half of Salamandastron's force to destroy her enemy. She eventually discovered them when she sent two runners to investigate a fire, which had been set by Redwall Abbey's defenders. She finally found Damug, and engaged him in battle. She killed him, but at great cost: her face had been wounded by his sword, so much as to blind her for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>For a time, Cregga fell into depression and would not eat. However, while at Redwall Abbey, she encountered the orphan badger baby who would come to be known as Russano the Wise. The two became fast friends, and she taught him much of the ways of badgers, grooming him as her replacement while he served as her eyes. Cregga herself remained at Redwall as the new <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Mother_6f94.html" title="Badger Mother">Badger Mother</a>, and was much beloved for her gentleness.</p>
<p>Cregga served as badger Mother for many years, outliving all her old comrades. She was offered the position of Redwall Abbess several times, but refused. She was much beloved among Redwallers, and her departure was a sad event. She took a vermin arrow in the chest while attempting to defend a small harvest mouse,Nimbalo The Slayer, and survived for a week before dying, happy and content, during a feast held in her honor by her bedside (which had been moved under the Tapestry Of Martin).</p>
<p>Cregga's chosen weapon was an axpike, a long pole with a dangerous head at the end. This head consisted of three sharp weapons: an axhead, spearpoint, and hook.</p>

<p>Russano was orphaned as a baby by Rapscallions, foul rats serving <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Vermin_in_Redwall_ebba.html" title="Minor Vermin in Redwall">Damug Warfang</a>. Saved by members of the Long Patrol and a squirrel named Russa Nodrey, he was taken to Redwall Abbey. His name was taken from Russa, who died from wounds inflicted while saving him. He became much beloved at Redwall, as the Abbey had lacked a badger for some time.</p>
<p>Before a battle between the forces of Redwall, Salamandastron, and the Rapscallions, Russano had a vision. He saw the battlefield, with the forces of Redwall asleep. As he watched, he saw several figures of old warriors. Of mice he saw <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_%28Redwall%29_c5d4.html" title="Martin the Warrior (Redwall)">Martin the Warrior</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthias_%28Redwall%29_073d.html" title="Matthias (Redwall)">Matthias</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattimeo_%28Redwall%29_da7b.html" title="Mattimeo (Redwall)">Mattimeo</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariel_Gullwhacker_9585.html" title="Mariel Gullwhacker">Mariel</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonff_the_Mousethief_6d7b.html" title="Gonff the Mousethief">Gonff</a>, and the like. Of badgers he saw such great figures as Lord Brocktree, Boar the Fighter, Sunflash the Mace, Urthstripe the Strong, Urthwyte the Mighty, and Rawnblade Widestripe. As the army of Redwall lay asleep when one of the warriors touched them, they would follow them. He in fact had witnessed who will live and who will not live after the battle.</p>
<p>Later, young Russano befriended Cregga Rose Eyes, the blinded Badger Lady who had come to Redwall after the battle. He became her eyes, and she groomed him to become the next Badger Lord. He came to Salamandastron with the Long Patrol, and had as his weapon a unique stick belonging to the late Russa Nodrey.</p>
<p>Russano was one of the few Badger Lords to raise a family in Salamandastron, having a wife named Rosalaun and a son and daughter named Snowstripe and Melanius. He also became an avid scholar, and assembled an account of the coming of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Brocktree_%28Redwall%29_dc9a.html" title="Lord Brocktree (Redwall)">Lord Brocktree</a> to Salamandastron. Russano seldom went into battle, but came to Redwall with a thousand hares when Cregga Rose Eyes, in death, visited him in a dream. Russano arrived just in time to save the Redwallers from a horde of Juska, and placed a medallion on Cregga's grave. His legacy would later give rise to the young Badger Lord <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sagaxus.html" title="Sagaxus">Sagaxus</a>.</p>

<p>Wife of Lord Russano the Wise, Lady Rosalaun lived at Salamandastron with him. Rosalaun was a kind, understanding person, often amused by her husband's childlike enthusiasim for his pet projects. She also enjoyed teasing him, threatening to send him off to bed for being naughty. She also encouraged him, and was the one who convinced him to read his account of the arrival of Lord Brocktree at Salamandastron.</p>
<p>Melanius and Snowstripe were Russano and Rosalaun's daughter and son. Melanius was the older of the two, and it is unknown which of them continued the line of Badger Lords to later years.</p>

<p>The parents of Sagaxus, Lord Hightor and Lady Merola ruled over the mountain of Salamandastron. They were rather distressed when Sagax departed to go off traveling, though they accepted that it had to happen sooner or later, due to the legendary tension that occurs between two full grown male badgers living in the same space. Hightor was rather put off by Sagax's choices, including his friendship with <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kroova_Wavedog_a166.html" title="Kroova Wavedog">Kroova Wavedog</a>, whom Hightor saw as a bad influence.</p>
<p>Hightor and Merola were most surprised when Sagax returned a season later, sailing a pirate vessel with a crew of Guosim and Redwall creatures. The two were most impressed by how much their son had matured, though Merola was startled by his carrying of a battle-axe. When Sagax sailed off again, Hightor sent a score of <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Patrol_f0f8.html" title="Long Patrol">Long Patrol</a> hares to accompany him. Following the defeat of the Pure Ferrets, Sagax promised to visit them every season, and also made arrangements for them to visit <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redwall_Abbey_ecec.html" title="Redwall Abbey">Redwall Abbey</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Lord_f370.html" title="Edit section: Sagaxus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sagaxus</span></h2>
<p>Son of Lord Hightor of Salamandastron, Sagaxus is also known as Sagax, and his full name means wise, or wisdom, in some unknown language. Growing up, Sagax's greatest friend was a troublesome and gluttonous hare-gluttonous even for such a beast-named Bescarum, Scarum for short. Hanging out with the mischievous hare led to trouble, and finally the two left the mountain to go off on their own. Hightor approved, as he thought it would be a chance for his son and Scarum to grow up.</p>
<p>Setting out on a journey with a sea otter named <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kroova_Wavedog_a166.html" title="Kroova Wavedog">Kroova Wavedog</a>, Sagax quickly became disenchanted with his hare friend. Scarum's overly gluttonous matter, combined with his fibbing personality and bad manners, led to quite a bit of tension between the two. This, however, was nothing compared to the trouble the gang ran into, as they ran afoul of a gang of Freebooters.</p>
<p>Held captive by the vile corsairs, the three were saved by <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trisscar_Swordmaid_3e8f.html" title="Trisscar Swordmaid">Trisscar Swordmaid</a> the squirrel and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shogg.html" title="Shogg">Shogg</a> the otter, both adversaries of the Pure Ferrets, who commanded the Freebooters. Joining forces, the band of five set out for Redwall Abbey. Sagax became good friends with Triss and Shogg, and joined in the search for the lost badger keep of Brockhall.</p>
<p>In the chambers of the great dwelling, Sagax joined his newfound friends in battle with the Freebooters and three evil adders. Overtaken by the fearsome Bloodwrath, he slew the adder known as Harssacss. He helped cleanse the woodlands of Freebooters, and joined Triss as she sailed to Riftgard, home of the Pure Ferrets. Pausing only to stop at Salamandastron, Sagax and co. overthrew the vermin and freed their slaves.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Sagax came to live at Redwall with Bescarum. He planned to visit home once every season, and also arrange for his parents Hightor and Merola to visit the Abbey.</p>
<p>Sagaxus' weapon is a massive battleaxe taken from Plugg Firetail, a Freebooter captain who lost it and then died during a battle with a <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_Ferret_4267.html" title="Pure Ferret">Pure Ferret</a>. His name came from the fact that his mother hoped he would grow to be like his ancestor, Russano the Wise.</p>

<p>Never having known his mother or father, Lonna was raised by an older badger named <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Badgers_in_Redwall_adae.html#Grawn" title="Minor Badgers in Redwall">Grawn</a>. Born with the gifts of a Seer, Lonna saw that his friend's time was growing short. The two made their way towards Salamandastron, where the old badger could live in peace. However, they were set upon by the vermin crew of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Vermin_in_Redwall_ebba.html" title="Minor Vermin in Redwall">Raga Bol</a>, who killed old Grawn and wounded Lonna, giving him a scar across his face. However, Lonna was able to take Raga's left paw.</p>
<p>Left for dead, Lonna was found by a local group of sea otters. After recovering and spending some time with them, he departed in search of vengeance. Along the way, he met a troop of squirrels, and during time spent with them he discovered a love for young ones echoing that of Badger Lord Sunflash the Mace. He later encountered a party of travelers from Redwall Abbey, and spent some time with them.</p>
<p>One of the party carried the sword of Martin the Warrior. Admiring it at night, Lonna met the spirit of Martin, who told him to come to Redwall. The Abbey, under siege by Raga Bol and his vermin, was defended by a gallant few. Joining forces with the beleaguered beasts, he killed Raga and the entire vermin horde. Later, he would complete his journey to Salamandastron, and become Badger Lord.</p>
<p>As his name would suggest, Lonna's main weapon was a massive yew-bow. With arrows large enough to serve other creatures as spears, Lonna was the most accurate archer ever to face vermin. He also carried a long knife, taken from a slain rat. Lonna's most dangerous weapon, though, was his great strength and the Bloodwrath. Taken with this force, Lonna was so unstoppable that he destroyed every vermin who invaded Redwall.</p>

<p>Ruler of the moutain of Salamandastron and commander of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Patrol_f0f8.html" title="Long Patrol">Long Patrol</a>, Mandoral lived in the time of <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiria_Wildlough_327a.html" title="Tiria Wildlough">Tiria Wildlough</a>, High Rhulain Queen of Green Isle. He met the warrior otter when she came to Salamandastron at the behest of her transportation, a hare from Mandoral's Long Patrol. Mandoral greeted her coridally, and brought her into his stronghold.</p>
<p>Mandoral spoke to Tiria in his inner sanctum, speaking to her of her ancestor, the former Queen. He revealed that she had been a friend of past Badger Lord Urthwyte the Mighty, and how the albino badger had made a new set of regalia for her that she had never come to claim. Mandoral then presented it to Tiria, and sent a band of thirty hares with her to liberate Green Isle.</p>
<p>Mandoral later sent a letter to the current Abbess of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redwall_Abbey_ecec.html" title="Redwall Abbey">Redwall Abbey</a>, another friend of Tiria's. He gave her news that he was in possession of two ships: one which Tiria had travelled in, the other liberated by Mandoral from a band of vermin "not fit to walk its decks."

Bloodpaw</a>, the leader of the forces Mandoral sent to Green Isle. He sent the two ships and their Long Patrol crews up the river to Redwall, where they would take on several Redwallers to visit Green Isle.</p>
<p>Mandoral Highpeak, as a Badger Lord, was a massive and fierce warrior. However, rather like his esteemed predecessors Russano the Wise and Sunflash the Mace, he was a dedicated scholar. His chosen weapon was likely a sword, axe, spear, or club of some kind, typical of most badger warriors.</p>
