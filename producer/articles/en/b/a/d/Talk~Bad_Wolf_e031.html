<p>It wasn't. Honestly, it wasn't. I've watched that scene over and over again. Ran it several times to check it out. I can see where the grunting sounds of the Nestene Consciousness <i>could</i> be interpreted as the phrase "Bad Wolf" if you do the aural equivalent of squinting, but it's not. The clearest reason why not is because when the Nestene Consciousness <i>does</i> say an audible phrase, "Time Lord," that's clear as anything. Why would that phrase be so clear and yet "Bad Wolf" be muffled and nearly unintelligible - particularly since RTD has been sledgehammering us over the head with the Bad Wolf references? It doesn't make sense. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 07:03, May 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure it does. The references started off almost invisible, then (at least for a while) got more and more overt. Note that this is the only time you actually see the Consciousness mouth words. And it's forming very specific shapes with its lips. If you study especially the sides of the mouth -- the "jaw" portion, if you will -- it's clear how much work went into getting this animation precisely right. It's not just arbitrary. It's been futzed with endlessly. And the words it shapes, visually, are "[something with a soft consonnant, followed by "aaa", then a hard stop] wolf". The "wolf" in particular is very clear. You've even got the labial fricative on the "f".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Combine that with a distorted vocal performance which, at the least, amounts to "AAA, OOOF!" (matching the mouth animations), and. Well. If he's not saying "Bad Wolf", then someone went to a lot of trouble animating something that looks and sounds very close to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you're going to play the "why" game, it's easy enough to turn it around and ask why Davies put the reference into every episode except for this one, yet there's an expensive and deliberate digital animation that can be so easily interpreted as a reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But then you got to ask yourself why "Time Lord" is so clearly voiced and yet "Bad Wolf" is not. I think it's just people seeing what they want to see. The animation may suggest it, but Nicholas Briggs's voice does not. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 22:11, May 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You know, I've never heard it say "Time Lord". Not once. I frankly don't even know what you're talking about. Yet I hear "Bad Wolf". Seems there's a difference in ears here. And again, just look at the animation. My memory was vaguer than the actual case. You actually see the pucker for the "W" in wolf. If deliberate facial animation doesn't count as a reference, then there are some bizarre problems around here.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's not at the same point - a little later. Immediately after Jackie screams when facing the Auton brides, it cuts back to the Doctor struggling, then cuts to Rose and Mickey - and at that point you hear a hoarse but very audible "Time Lord". No need for lip reading at all there. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 00:20, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, we don't know if the payoff will explain why he didn't put it in <i>Rose</i>. I didn't put my own theory in because it's speculation and thus not encyclopedic, but the question is why there <i>are</i> Bad Wolf references and why they are where they are. Something is scattering clues through history, like little ripple effects in a pond when a stone is tossed in reaching forward and back. Could it be that this only began when Rose started travelling with the Doctor and not before? Could it be that Little Red Riding Hood is also the Big Bad Wolf?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, this is mere speculation, but it does provide a possible explanation as to why Bad Wolf is not in the first episode, as Rose has not travelled in time yet. I don't propose to debate the merits of this theory, just to offer it as a reason as to why we assume that Bad Wolf was mentioned in the first episode (or, granted, conversely, that it wasn't). I'd provided a compromise wording to the note and hopefully that's acceptable. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 22:21, May 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I thought the commonly cited "Bad Wolf" reference in <i>Rose</i> was a line (from either Rose herself or Clive) about the Doctor being a "wolf in sheep's clothing"... Or is that not there either? -- <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuybrush_2438.html" title="User:Guybrush">Guybrush</a> 07:18, 16 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't remember that at all. Rose does say she thinks the Doctor is dangerous, and Clive notes that if the Doctor is making "house calls" then all of them are in danger, but I don't recall any wolf references in any of those conversations. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 07:36, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Not to insert a huge spoiler or anything, but in episode 3 a boy spray paints "bad wolf" onto the tardis; the moment it is alleged that the nestene says bad wolf is also the moment that it sees the tardis and goes psycho.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there are clear Bad Wolf references in every episode aside from <i>Rose</i> which is what the above discussion was about. Read the notes for each episode article for the explicit ones. (we mostly left out the more subtle, implied ones) --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 01:29, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I think this is pretty definitive. The BBC site www.badwolf.org.uk/clues.html shows "Bad Wolf" references for every story <i>except</i> "Rose". --<a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudegalea_1a9b.html" title="User:Dudegalea">DudeGalea</a> 12:12, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If I was taking a guess, I would say it would refer to the Doctor, based on his comments on the extinction of the rest of his race (just a guess, and I'm most likely wrong)</p>
<p><b>Suspects for the Bad Wolf</b> - If the 'Bad Wolf' is a person, who?</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> Has been accused of spreading 'death' everywhere he goes. The clues seem to lean far more for Rose than him. Was surprised in 'Boom Town' to see the latest reference yet suddenly shugged it off. Is the Doctor even who he claims to be?</p>
<p><b>Rose:</b> The Doctor seems very certain on traveling with her. The clues only started to appear following her entry into the TARDIS, the first time in a long while that the 'Doctor' has had a companion. Rose has certainly lost much of her navity since her first appearance.</p>
<p><b>Mickey:</b> Disgrunted with Rose in <i>Boom Town</i>, and reappears in <i>Bad Wolf</i>. His website is very researched and he hasn't gone to any lengths to tell Rose about it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unlikely to be the real Mickey in <i>Bad Wolf</i> though, seeing as it's set around the year 200,100. Unless the Daleks use their time travel technology (which they undoubtedly still have, having been participants in the Time War). Same goes for Jackie too. As for Mickey's web site, he tried to tell Rose about it in <i>Aliens of London</i>, but by the end of <i>World War Three</i> seemed to trust the Doctor (another case for the BBC's site seeming non-canon, though bitterness at Rose's second disappearance may well still bias Mickey against the Doctor). He doesn't seem to have picked up on the "Bad Wolf" references. -- <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuybrush_2438.html" title="User:Guybrush">Guybrush</a> 03:36, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Jackie:</b> Might be hiding something from Rose and the Doctor. If so, what? Also appears in <i>Bad Wolf</i>.</p>
<p><b>Jack Harkness:</b> What happened in those missing two years of his life? Has he perhaps met the 'Doctor' before?</p>
<p><b>Adam:</b> Knows the forthcoming history of the next 200,000 years at the end of <i>The Long Game</i>. Knew the Doctor via Mickey's website yet seemed unaware a mere six years later in <i>Dalek</i>. Did Adam use his knowledge to change history in order to keep himself alive, and bring the Daleks back to life? Is he the mysterious white figure seen in the <i>Bad Wolf</i> Teaser? Rumour even has it that Adam is strangely begining to seem like someone the Doctor knows very well... A figure who has a cybernetic implant turned into a third eye...</p>
<dl>
<dd>No evidence that he remembers any of the data about the next 200,000 years, in fact the evidence points to quite the opposite: when viewing the news broadcast, the Doctor says Cathica is only a conduit for the information and cannot remember any of it after transmission. Adam transmits it back to his home telephone so that he can access it later, which he would only need to do if the Doctor was right. The Doctor destroys that data, so Adam has no remaining future knowledge beyond what he's seen during <i>The Long Game</i>. And as for him turning up on Satellite 5 in 200,100, that's as likely as Mickey or Jackie - and given they're in the cast list and he isn't, I'd say much less likely. -- <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuybrush_2438.html" title="User:Guybrush">Guybrush</a> 03:36, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Van Statten:</b> Like Mickey and Adam he should be even more aware of the Doctor - he owns the internet! Was erasing his memory a good idea - he might have known something important...</p>
<p><b>Clive:</b> Oh yes. He might be dead, but he's not ruled out. The clues only started following his death. Original owner of the <i>Who is Doctor Who</i> website. Warned Rose about the Doctor. Despite his website he seems unaware of the other 'Doctors' lurking about in Earth's history.</p>
<p><b>The Editor:</b> Since the forthcoming episode is set on Satellite 5, is the Editor still alive? Could he be perhaps both the 'Bad Wolf' and the strange white figure?</p>
<p><b>The Daleks:</b> Could it be as simple as the Doctor's oldest enemy? They certainly fit the 'Wolf' catagory.</p>

<p>e.g. Psalms for church service in Father's Day, bus numbers on bus stop, date in Dr Constantine's diary, Geocomtex phone number, and an entry in the 'whoisdoctorwho' website.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of speculation.</p>

<p>The people have been transmatted to the ships for years and years and years -- what happened to them? Secondly, where did all the Daleks come from? Speculation . . . cf. <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation_of_the_Daleks_8e4a.html" title="Revelation of the Daleks">Revelation of the Daleks</a></i>. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonQuixote_bdde.html" title="User:DonQuixote">DonQuixote</a> 00:45, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Or: the communications satellite and the Doctor have created an alternative reality, and the Daleks can exist in that AR.</p>
<p>The simplest answer is often the best. Cf. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Parting_of_the_Ways_8f2b.html" title="The Parting of the Ways">The Parting of the Ways</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonQuixote_bdde.html" title="User:DonQuixote">DonQuixote</a> 04:31, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The running theme (as distinct from a running gag) is an interesting idea - even if the characters will not be aware of all the references.</p>

<dd>No speculation. Just pointing out two discrete facts. One, Davies did say in DWM that the word had already been said, and it was an anagram. Two, Torchwood was an answer, and it is an anagram of "doctor who". I leave it to people to draw their own conclusions.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 09:23, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The AskOxford site does have "foetus" as an alternative ("Brit.

It might be one of those adjectival oddities like "humorous". —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>) 02:38, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
