	    <p>Anthony Heath (who was born on April 26, 1984) is a B-list socialite who currently resides in the harbour city of Sydney, Australia. He is also a bartender, university student, accomplished rugby player and co-founder of jewellery chain, ‘Adults Only’. He is popularly known as “Badger,” which was coined by a friend who believed the young Anthony to look like the animal bearing his new nickname. “Badger” is best known for his extremely lowbrow humour, uber-cool fashion sense, excessive lifestyle and larger than life personality.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger1984_87bd.html" title="Edit section: 1.0 CHILDHOOD">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1.0 CHILDHOOD</span></h2>
<p>Badger was born in Sydney to an accountant mother (Eve) of strong Jewish heritage, and VFL hero father (Kevin), who was once named Cleo Bachelor of the Month.<sup id="_ref-Cleo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cleo" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the late 1980s the Heath family lived in Dover Heights, before their move to Bellevue Hill in the early 1990s. Badger’s mother believed that these suburbs were the best environment for her son to be brought up in, as they were both Jewish strongholds with local synagogues around the corner. However, cable T.V proved to be Badger’s biggest single influence as a child, and in particular his fondness for American culture. It was through watching comedians such as Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy that shaped his personality from a young age, and this has continued through adolescence, and now early adulthood.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Anthony attended Cranbrook School in Bellevue Hill from 1989-2001. Whilst Badger was not what one would consider to be the brightest of students, there were several areas of study in which he excelled. These included his passion for Business Studies, in particular corporate ethics, and Computing Studies. However, it was perhaps in Physical Education where his star shone brightest. Having been an influential member of the undefeated 13E Rugby team in 1996 <sup id="_ref-Cranbrook_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cranbrook" title="">[2]</a></sup> , Badger set himself the goal of making it to the school 1st XV in his final year. He gradually worked his way through the grades, despite his apparent lack of ability. However, his sheer will power and single-minded focus finally paid off, when in 2001; he was selected to play in the 1st XV against St Pius.<sup id="_ref-Cranbrook_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cranbrook" title="">[2]</a></sup> Whilst he did not receive the accolades that he deserved at the end of season function, one thing is for sure, his name will forever be etched in the memories of all those people who watched him play, in particular his brutal defence, which left many an opponent dazed and confused.</p>

<p>On completion of his tertiary studies, Badger was required to return to the homeland of his forefathers to carry out compulsory military service with the Israeli Army in early 2002.<sup id="_ref-Kevin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kevin" title="">[3]</a></sup> Being a grandson of a former Mossad agent, much was expected of Badger. Despite early signs of Badger realising his potential as a key member of the Israeli Secret Service, he decided to return to his place of birth on completion of his 2 year stint, having got word of a job offer that was just too good to refuse.</p>

<p>Badger began his working career in June 2002<sup id="_ref-Global_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Global" title="">[4]</a></sup> at Global Colours in Marrickville, otherwise known as “the Paint Factory”. Many days were spent carrying out the menial and mind-numbing tasks of applying stickers to paint tubes, cleaning paint buckets and painting the exterior of the factory. This line of work was not mentally stimulating for Badger; however, he believed that if he put in the hard work from a young age, the rewards would start to come. Before the benefits materialised, he was promptly fired from the “paint factory” for sniffing whiteout and falling asleep on the job.</p>

<p>Having suffered this early setback, Badger promised to get serious with his work, and turned his attention to the glamour and glitz of the bartending scene. This started with his employment in 2003 <sup id="_ref-Watto_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Watto" title="">[5]</a></sup> at The Watson’s Bay Hotel. Badger soon realised that one of the perks of being a bartender was that alcohol was always readily available, and perhaps more importantly, accessible. Despite making a pact with himself before he started the job to become more professional, this quickly evaporated, and many shifts behind the bar were soon spent boozing the night away.</p>

<p>Realising that the liquor laws at the Watson’s Bay Hotel could not accommodate his partying ways, Badger decided to cease his employment there and take up a job at The Eastern Hotel in 2004,<sup id="_ref-Eastern_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eastern" title="">[6]</a></sup> the new ‘super club’ of Sydney. He soon came under the expert tutelage of a fellow bartender, Andrew Marich, who was at the time one of the top bartenders in the country. Andrew was more than willing to teach his young apprentice in the ways of the hospitality world, and they soon struck up a close friendship. Together they became the toast of the Eastern Suburbs bartending scene, in much the same way as Brian Flanagan and Douglas Coughlin did in the movie ‘Cocktail’.<sup id="_ref-Cocktail_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cocktail" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Believing a change of scene was needed, the two decided to part ways with The Eastern and began employment at the much trendier Ruby Rabbit on Oxford St in March 2006.<sup id="_ref-Ruby_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ruby" title="">[8]</a></sup> However, they quickly found out about the fickle nature of the bartending world, and their rock star status began to wane. This was too much for Andrew to take, and he decided to leave. Without his mentor around, Badger’s passion for the job diminished, and he only recently quit.</p>

<p>The long arm of the law has never been too far away from Badger. It must be said however that he has generally been quite lucky, and been fortunate enough to dodge more than one bullet. Whilst much is known of his high-profile drink driving cases, less is known of other incidents, such as his confrontations with DB Security, bouncers at TANK nightclub and also a recent trip to Brazil in February 2006. <sup id="_ref-Brazil_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brazil" title="">[9]</a></sup> Badger nearly found himself in an extremely explosive situation with a corrupt Rio de Janeiro policeman for his refusal to attend a “love motel,” or as they are more affectionately known as amongst locals, a “Moey.” The trouble started when Badger got himself caught up at a well renowned nightclub on Copacabana Beach called HELP, which is involved in the illegal rackets of ‘the world’s oldest profession’. Details remain scarce, however, according to the official police report, Badger left HELP nightclub at 6am and returned to the Lemon Spirit Hostel at 10am, having forgotten the preceding 4 hours.</p>

<p>Badger began his socialising days at the old Paddington Green Hotel in late 2001, which was an extremely popular nightspot amongst the young Sydney social set, before its untimely closure in 2004. It was here that he began to make a name for himself as a heavy drinker, anecdotalist and free spirit, who lived life “to the max,” as he has so famously pointed out.<sup id="_ref-Copper_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Copper" title="">[10]</a></sup> His chief accomplices during these heady days were ex-Cranbrook students Nick Condos and Michael Hatsatouris. The night would usually follow a familiar pattern of booze and debaucherus behaviour, coupled with a trip to Good Bar, Blue Room or Sol (whichever was the most popular club at the time), and finished off by sunrise at Q-Bar. It was during this time that Badger became a part of the bathroom scene, as well as catching the eye of a young Sydney model called ‘Michaela’. Their romance blossomed for several months, with the two taking it slow and steady, despite Badger’s insistence that it should become hot and heavy. Michaela’s overseas work commitments proved to be too big an obstacle for the couple to overcome, and they both decided on an amicable break-up. Badger soon realised that the benefits associated with having gone out with a model are numerous, and he seeked to capitalise on this newfound attention from the opposite sex with results. Not many women have been spared in recent years, and high-profile girlfriends have included Nina Karnikovski and Alex Empson.</p>
<p>Badger’s excessive lifestyle hasn’t just been confined to the Sydney nightclub arena. It has also encompassed England, France, Italy, Spain, USA, Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, China, Thailand, South Africa and Israel. All of these countries have felt the repercussions of Badger and his trailblazing partying ways, and have learnt valuable lessons from the experience.</p>

<p>Badger began his undergraduate studies at Macquarie University in 2002,<sup id="_ref-Macquarie_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Macquarie" title="">[11]</a></sup> where he undertook a course in Business Administration. However, he soon became disillusioned with the subject matter and decided that a change of universities was needed. This led him to The University of Technology Sydney, Kuring-gai Campus in 2003, where he enrolled in a Sports &amp; Exercise Management Course, majoring in Leisure.,<sup id="_ref-UTS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UTS" title="">[12]</a></sup> It was the courses’ focus on leisure that appealed to Badger, in particular the practical side. He was scheduled to complete his degree in 2005, yet a total dedication to the practical elements of the course has meant that his graduation day has been indefinitely postponed, with Spring 2007 now set down as the new likely date. Badger commutes to his daily lectures using the services provided by the University, which include the UTS Shuttle Bus, where he has made numerous new friends and contacts.</p>

<p>Badger has redefined the way many people look at fashion. Close friend Luke Adams has referred to him as a fashion ‘demi-god,’ and many well-respected aficionados within the industry believe that he is the yardstick to which all others are now judged. His inspiration has been drawn upon from many different eras, and is a mixture of punk rock Vs street-cool. However, it was a chance meeting at Q-Bar with Australian designer Wayne Cooper in late 2002 that ignited his passion for the industry. In early 2006 he co-founded jewellery label ‘Adults Only’ with friend and business partner Jack Jeweller. The two have been accused of manufacturing their products in sweatshop conditions in the U.S territory of Saipan, an accusation that they vehemently deny. These accusations were dismissed in August 2006, as there was no evidence to suggest that this practice ever took place. Many friends believe that Badger was the subject of vicious slander campaigns from powerbrokers within the fashion industry.</p>

<p>Badger is currently focused on expanding his jewellery label, ‘Adults Only,’ into overseas markets. He is also working on a new fashion look for the upcoming Sydney Summer; a look that he believes will start a new fad amongst the young trendy crowd. He is currently single, and was unlucky to miss out on the 2006 “CLEO Bachelor of the Year,” which contains one of the best fields in recent memory.</p>
