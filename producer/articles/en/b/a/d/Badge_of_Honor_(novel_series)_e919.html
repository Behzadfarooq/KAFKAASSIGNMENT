Like Rizzo, Carlucci served 26 years as a police officer and held "every rank but policewoman" (which is not true, since the Philadelphia Police did not have women police officers until 1986).

<p>Penelope Detweiler was the only daughter of Richard Detweiler, the majority stockholder in Nesbitt Foods. She was involved with Anthony DeZito, "Tony the Zee", and was present when DeZito was murdered.

She was hospitalized in a private sanitarium in Nevada, and when she returned to Philadelphia had a brief relationship with Matt Payne. She died of an overdose in "The Murderers."</p>

<p>Jesus Martinez is a <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective.html" title="Detective">detective</a> with the Special Operations Division of the Philadelphia Police. He started off partnered with Charlie McFadden as Narcotics undercover detectives. The two of them were highly effective, but their career ended when they caught the murderer of Highway Patrol chief "Dutch" Moffett. The publicity ended their Narcotics careers, and Martinez went undercover as an officer at the Airport Unit to catch a crooked corporal. After that stint, Martinez was assigned to Special Operations.</p>
<p>Martinez and McFadden are best friends as well as partners; however, Martinez does not like Matt Payne, whom he regards as a spoiled rich kid.</p>

<p>Michael J. "Mickey" O'Hara is a police reporter for the <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Bulletin_5c8f.html" title="Philadelphia Bulletin">Philadelphia Bulletin</a></i>. He is regarded as one of the best police reporters on the East Coast, and he is held in high regard by the police for several reasons, including listening to their side of controversial events. O'Hara drives a car equipped with several police band receivers (at the time the series was written, computer-controlled scanners were not available). In this, he resembles Larry Krebs, the former police reporter for <a href="../../../w/m/a/WMAL_946e.html" title="WMAL">WMAL</a> in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Although O'Hara is held in high esteem by the police, he has published stories that the police wanted played down, such as the arrest of a crooked police captain. He has also been on the site and taken photos when significant events took place, such as when Matt Payne shot and killed the Northwest Serial Rapist (in <i>Special Operations</i>).</p>
<p>O'Hara is married.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badge_of_Honor_%28novel_series%29_e919.html" title="Edit section: Matthew Payne">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Matthew Payne</span></h3>
<p>Matthew Payne is the central figure of the <i>Badge of Honor</i> series. He is the son of Officer John X. Moffit, who was killed in the line of duty. His mother, Patricia Moffitt, took a job as a legal secretary to make a living, and met Brewster C. Payne, a prominent Philadelphia attorney and widower. They fell in love and remarried. Brewster Payne legally adopted Matt.</p>
<p>Matt went to private school, where he was an average student with some clashes with the police and then to the University of Pennsylvania, where he attended Marine Corps ROTC. A minor medical condition prevented Matt from obtaining an officers' commission in the Corps. About the same time, Matt's uncle, "Dutch" Moffitt, was killed. Matt decided to join the Philadelphia Police Department.</p>
<p>Immediately after graduating from the Philadelphia Police Academy, Payne was assigned to Special Operations. This was done to keep him out of trouble; higher-ups in the department figured that Payne would come to his senses and leave the Department in time. Instead, Payne found himself a hero when he shot and killed a serial killer/rapist, who Payne found by accident, and who was attempting to run him over. His shooting saved a woman who had been inside the van.</p>
<p>Payne was then assigned to the East Division's detective office and worked routine operations such as retrieving stolen cars. He was reassigned to Special Operations by order of Mayor Carlucci and served as Peter Wohl's assistant. In <i>The Victim</i>, Payne ended up shooting and being shot by one of a gang of armed robbers (again, not intentionally; Wohl had sent him to escort Mickey O'Hara and stay out of trouble).</p>
<p>Payne's stay in Special Operations was troublesome at times. Wohl reprimanded him for climbing on the ledge of the Bellvue-Stratford Hotel to replace a surveillance microphone that had been knocked loose. He has also at times been referred to, sarcastically, as "Sherlock Holmes, Jr." Wohl also suspended Payne when he was assigned to Harrisburg and ended up romantically involved with a woman who was providing cover for animal rights activists who had become terrorists.</p>
<p>Payne is not married. He was in love with Penny Detweiler, but she died of a heroin overdose.</p>

<p>Amy Payne is Matt Payne's sister. She has a double doctorate, the first in theoretical mathematics, the second in medicine, and works as a psychiatrist. Among her patients have been Penelope Detweiler and (reluctantly) the granddaughter of Vincenzo Savarese. She has also assisted the Special Operations Division in profiling the Northwest Serial Rapist and an insane, but intelligent man trying to kill the Vice-President. Amy Payne is prone to being distracted as a driver, makes snap psychological judgments of her brother, and annoyed when she runs into the bureaucracy of the Philadelphia Police Department. She is romantically involved with Peter Wohl.</p>

<p>Martha Peebles, in her late thirties, was the heir to a fortune based on anthracite coal mining. Her father disinherited her brother, Gerald, for being a homosexual. Gerald stayed with Martha, however, was forced to move out after several cases of pilferage. Martha asked for police assistance to protect her home. Captain Dave Peckach was sent to respond for public relations reasons. The two fell in love and Peckach moved in with Martha and later married. Martha doted on Peckach, and one of his biggest problems is preventing her from buying things for her "Precious."</p>

<p>Captain Dave Pekach commands the Highway Unit of the Philadelphia Police Department. A former Narcotics Lieutenant, he was given command of Highway Patrol because Mayor Jerry Carlucci thinks that the former number 2 man in Highway, Captain Mike Sabara, "Looks like a concentration camp guard in uniform". Investigating a series of burglaries at the Peebles home he won the affections of Martha Peebles.</p>

<p>Vincenzo Savarese is the head of Philadelphia's Mafia family. Although he has refined manners and is an accomplished violinist, Savarese is capable of ordering, albeit indirectly, a person's death. Savarese has a son who is a builder and is not involved in crime, and a granddaughter on whom he dotes. When she was raped by a rogue Narcotics cop, Savarese prevailed on Brewster Payne to have his daughter, Dr. Amy Payne, take care of her; he also arranged for the man who sold her drugs to be kidnapped and left to starve to death in the dark.</p>

<p>Sergeant Jason Washington is regarded by his peers, and himself, as Philadelphia's finest Homicide detective. He is physically imposing, but sharply dressed: his nickname among other police is "The Black Buddha." He speaks with a highly educated vocabulary. He is a master of using psychology with subjects under interrogation and in determining the anomalies in their stories. He would be regarded as vain if he was not able to back up his words with actions.</p>
<p>Washington did not want to be transferred from Homicide to Special Operations because, as a Homicide detective, he earned considerable overtime pay. However, Inspector Wohl convinced him that he would be able to work as many hours as he wanted.</p>

<p>Staff Inspector Peter Wohl is the head of the Special Operations Division. In his career he served in the Highway Division as the youngest corporal in the unit; he was also the youngest sergeant, lieutenant, captain, and staff inspector in the Philadelphia Police Department. He has a reputation for honesty and for fighting corruption; before he was assigned to Special Operations, Wohl's investigation a corrupt Judge Moses Flinderman into prison. Wohl insists that his officers do things the smart and effective way and has chastised Matt Payne several times for doing courageous but "stupid" things, including suspending Payne at one time (until Mayor Carlucci overrode him).</p>
<p>Wohl is the son of Augustus Wohl, the retired Chief of Detectives. Augustus served as "rabbi" for several officers, including Carlucci.</p>
<p>Peter is unmarried, though he has had a relationship with Amy Payne.</p>
