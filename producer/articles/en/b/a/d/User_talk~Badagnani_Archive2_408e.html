<p>I've always thought 烧酒 is called 烧酒 because the wine is traditionally heated in a water bath til slightly under the boiling point of alcohol before being consumed. As well, in minnan "烧" is the word used two say hot(temp.), whereas in mandarin the terms that are used are "烫"(tang4) or "热" (re4). It's to my understanding that this dialect thing and wine heating tradition is where the term 烧酒 arises. I'm not sure about the burning/scorching process.

<p>I'm not sure where an accurate list of all ethnic groups in Myanmar is, but the government list can be found <a href="http://www.myanmartravelinformation.com/mti-myanmar-people/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.myanmartravelinformation.com/mti-myanmar-people/index.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. However, the list is politically influenced. For example, the "Shan Nationality" groups together all of the various ethnic groups in Shan State, which are not ethnically nor linguistically related. Other ethnic groups, such as Indians, Rohingya, Chinese, and Malays are not included. A CIA map of ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar exists, but it is outdated (1972), and contains the following groups:</p>

<p>Hi Badagnani,</p>
<p>Thanks for all your hard work on Korean drinks and foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Re your question, <i>muk</i> in the sense of "jelly" is a pure Korean word, without hanja. Thus, the hangul for acorn jelly (<i>dotorimuk</i>/<i>tot'orimuk</i>) would just be "도토리묵". For mung bean jelly (<i>nokdumuk</i>/<i>noktumuk</i>), we would put "녹두묵" for the hangul and "綠豆묵" for the hanja. Hope that helps! Interestingly Naenara and Dprkorea.com come up near the top of a Google search for 녹두묵. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 08:50, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Memilmuk</i> (buckwheat jelly) is 메밀묵 (no hanja, "memilmuk" in both RR and MR).</dd>
<dd>It is interesting that <i>cheongpomuk</i> is not attested in any dictionary I have handy, but seems from a cursory Googling to be nearly 100 times more common in online discourse. Odd, that... not sure what the reason might be. <i>Cheongpomuk</i> (and <i>hwangpomuk</i>) seem like probable borrowings from Chinese; possibly these names have come into favor as the bean market has become increasingly import-dominated? Can't tell you anything more about <i>hwangpomuk</i>.</dd>
<dd>Hope that helps, -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 06:40, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, I was rather pleased with myself when I found that info. All along I'd been assuming <i>cheong</i> was 靑, referring to the color of the bean; of course, that led me nowhere. Turns out all I had to do was type "청포" into Naver to get the answer.</dd>
<dd>Memilmuk is indeed brown; in fact, before we knew better my wife and I called it "brown tofu." &#160;:-) Best, -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 09:13, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have revised the Double Bass article to reflect the nickname comprimise reached on the discussion page. However, and this is the third time I have said it, in your reversions you have deleted all of the requests for citations I have made, as well as brought back references to individual players. There was a consensus reached about this on the discussion page, and you're reversions are going against that "team effort" you talked about on my talk page. My edits to the technique section were because Wikipedia is not a players guide to playing double bass. There should be mention that you can sit or stand while playing the instrument, however, specific things such as the first finger in first position being at your eye level are not relevant save for a method book. If you do object to any of these edits, please leave your opinion on my talk page or the discussion page in the future.

<p>You might not have noticed, but I am the one who built that discography and therefore have a certain knowledge what the URL towards that discography should read&#160;;-) Let me therefore explain, that 'pitchfrm.htm' is only a 'dummy' file containing nothing else than causing (by a little javascript) that the actual file with Pitchford content (pitchfor.htm) opens, *plus* causing that the navigation frame (on top of the page) opens additionally. So any visitor who has unabled javascript will see nothing; if this visitor clicks 'pitchfor.htm' he won't actually see the navigation frame, but at least the content he chose: the Pitchford discography. That's why I changed pitchfrm.htm' to 'pitchfor.htm'&#160;!!! Any arguing against this&#160;?!? If not, I'll change that URL the next time I visit ...

<dd>If you are interested in the reaction of uranium metal and air, then I suggest that you look at the uranium dioxide page. I have just added a link to a US DOE apper on the reaction of oxygen/water with uranium/plutonium metal. I think that if you want to have any hope of understanding the reaction of U metal with oxygen then you will need to read the primary chemical literature. I tryed to discuss with James the mechanism of the oxidation of uranium metal, James only seemed to want to consider simple burning at high tempertures with oxygen. But hydrogen and water do alter the oxidation of uranium metal. Also <a href="http://www.isis-online.org/publications/dprk/ir080194.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.isis-online.org/publications/dprk/ir080194.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=1183" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=1183" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.eh.doe.gov/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081e.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eh.doe.gov/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081e.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> should be read.

<dd>The wikipedia chemists (and allied professionals) have recently had a lot of trouble with James. I think that James came to the uranium pages with a firm idea of what the 'truth' was, and then he tried to find evidence (and at times he seemed to twist the literature to suit his POV) to support his POV rather than reading the evidence and then forming a sensible POV. DV8 2XL can be a little blunt at times.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a></dd>

<dd>I have to agree that uranium oxides are not good for you, I have never taken the view that they are the best thing since sliced bread. The thing that got James into trouble in my mind was his edits (when seemed to go on for ever) about long lasting UO3 gas. The thing about James is that he rubbed a few of the most strongly pro nuclear (nuclear industry right or wrong, can do no wrong) editors up the wrong way with his POV edits, also he had a go at many of the less strongly pro nuclear editors (people like me) which made both camps come together to form a common front to keep the uranium articles as NPOV as possible. I think with James gone that things will calm down and move back towards some reasonable state.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a></dd>

<dd>James was too fixated with uranium he dug himself into a hole, he did have some interesting points. But he did seem to want to write about no enviromental radiochemistry other than DU. I tryed to suggest to him that he should consider writing about radon, plutonium, thorium and other alpha emitters in the enviroment but James just got mad at the idea of writing about any element other than uranium. I have noticed that many people who are strongly anti-nuclear never take the time to learn about the subject in detail, as a result the people who know about the subject tend to more pro-nuclear than average (look at an average antinuclear web site and you will not see much evidence that the author understands the subject in detail, what you are more likely to see is the shock images such as two headed fish and tales of human woe etc). I think that a good page (or set of pages) could be written about these elements in the enviroment. You might want to read</dd>

<p><i>Question: in Dutch names beginning with "ten" or "van," should the name be alphabetized by the "ten" or "van" or by the actual last name? For example, should "Jakob van Domselaer" be alphabetized under "D" or "V"? For Beethoven, who wasn't Dutch, we alphabetize under "B," but I'm not sure for other composers. If you look in the category "Dutch composers" under <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simeon_ten_Holt_54f6.html" title="Simeon ten Holt">Simeon ten Holt</a>, you'll see that it's alphabetized under "T," but I think this may be incorrect.

Thanks, <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 14:48, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Jakob van Domselaer should be alphabetized under the "D", it's the same as with Beethoven. I think that's because "ten", "de" or "van" aren't the most significant parts of a last name. If you only write the last name of a person then you have to capitalize both words, e.g. "Ten Holt" or "De Waal". This is the Dutch schema and I think in Belgium it's again a bit different, as they tend to write last names continuously, e.g. "Dewaal" and "Tenholt". So if a person is Belgian than this will probably the correct way to write his/her last name. The categorisation of Ten Holt is indeed incorrect, it should be alphabetized under the "H". Hope that helps! <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaester_mensch_68e0.html" title="User:Maester mensch">mensch</a> 15:36, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Belgium is indeed different: "ten Holt" is the last name, so we would categorise this under the "T". Again we use capitals for every part of the name, except if the person is a noble then we use a small "d". (eg. "<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefaan_De_Clerck_0947.html" title="Stefaan De Clerck">Stefaan De Clerck</a>" would be categorised under "D". If it would have been "<a href="../../../s/y/b/Sybille_de_Selys_Longchamps_30e8.html" title="Sybille de Selys Longchamps">Sybille de Selys Longchamps</a>", then we are talking about someone with noble roots, but still categorised under ""D".) <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpozio_4b49.html" title="User:Warpozio">warpozio</a> 12:43, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why do you think that this compound is a carcinogen&#160;? If tested negative in the Ames test and while some sources think it is (or could be carcinogenic) others consider it to not be carcinogenic. Bear in mind that the law of California is different on carcinogens to the rest of the USA. Also we need to avoid an overuse of the term carcinogenic, if ethanol is consumed to excess by a human then the chance of getting some cancers goes up but the carcinogenic effect of ethanol is so weak that ethanol is considered as non-carcinogenic. I think that the term <i>carcinogenic</i> should be set aside and kept for the real nasties like <i><a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrazine.html" title="Hydrazine">hydrazine</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../h/m/p/HMPA_5a88.html" title="HMPA">HMPA</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzene.html" title="Benzene">benzene</a></i>, <i>cis-platin</i> and <i><a href="../../../b/e/r/Berylium.html" title="Berylium">berylium</a></i> where a clear link between the compound and cancer is known.</p>
<p>Also you said that the compound is used as a pesticide, are you sure becuase a large class of related compounds with related names are used but I have never heard of this compound being used in this way.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I tried to make that distinction clear by stating that it is "known to the state of California to cause cancer" per Proposition 65. Also, some <i>N</i>-methyl carbamates are indeed used as insecticides (our article on <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbamate.html" title="Carbamate">carbamates</a> states that and could do with expansion), yet this particular compound is quite unlike carbamate insecticides and IMO those don't merit inclusion in the article. Methyl carbamate doesn't inhibit <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetylcholinesterase.html" title="Acetylcholinesterase">acetylcholinesterase</a> like carbamate insecticides do.</dd>

<p>Look we both know that nether one of us would cut is as a Zen or Trappist monk, but we really don't need to keep butting heads. I ask you to carefully read the old versions of the two sections in question and diligently compare them with what I replaced them with and follow the references. I think you will find that they weren't really saying what you think they were.</p>
<p>I am not pro DU. In fact as a pro-nuke the very last thing I want to see is uranium of any sort being blown about in the environment; that doesnt help my cause in the least, does it? I don't think it's an exciting new material and I don't want to see it used in non-controlled industries. I would rather the damned stuff not be produced in the first place, which is why I back heavy water reactors that use unenriched natural uranium oxide a material which also doesn't breakdown to soluble salts like the metal does. they also burn the fuel to the point no one even thinks of reprocessing it.</p>
<p>What I wrote in those two sections points out two very important parts of this fight: there is no good data because the only ones that could mount a study of that size are governments, and they are not; and legally the only way to get the use of this material declared a war crime is to prove that it does do long term damage, because international law puts an emphasis on short term effects.</p>

The 'editorial' is quoted from a brief by Avril McDonald, LL.B., LL.M., MA., Ph.D An expert litigator of international law for The International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons - the most respected players in this matter in the word today. As for lack of consensus I asked for such and yours was the only voice raised in protest. You and I don't like each other and probable we never will. If that's clouded your judgment to the point where you won't think, your loss. --<a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 00:36, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The words on the red diamond say 酒鬼, which means "a drunkard" or "an alcoholic". Baijiu is sometimes collectively (and colloqially) known to some as "酒鬼酒" due the high alcohol content. The other bottles say 湘泉酒, 玉金湘, and 三千年, clockwise from "酒鬼". As for a new classification scheme, I would say no. While the technique used to make them are slightly different, we pretty much have "the bases covered" with the chinese wine article. this classification is likely more for marketing. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 00:43, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah I guess, 湘泉酒, 玉金湘, and 三千年 have not yet been covered, but like you said there seems to be an endless variety of baijiu. Each of them seem to be either produced (1) in a specific region or (2) uses a slightly different process. To list them exhaustively here would be slightly pointless due to the difficulty and (possibly) impossibility of the task. Rather, I prefer to just state the major "themes" and give a few examples. I also agree on moving the lists to baijiu and keeping some major examples in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_wine.html" title="Chinese wine">Chinese wine</a> (like maotai). After a bit of thinking, I decided that the Chinese wine article should be a prodution technique article with wine examples. This way the entire process from grain to either yellow liquor or white liquor could be written out plainly. It would also simplify the article a bit. Thoughts? <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 04:03, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh no, I'm not suggesting any deletions, I just figure you might get a bit tired of listing everything, even a hundred is a lot. What I am saying is that some of the information in the chinese wine article can go to a new sub-article to chinese wine. Agreed on the maotai, and yes this stuff does (quite often) have that nasty nailpolish remover tang. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 04:24, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You may be right, the distillation process for most chinese wines are single and do not typically use distillation columns. This will explain the various "off" flavours present in the liquors. I believe this is done by the manufacturers to distinguish their product from other companies as well as to maintain the loyalty of their customers. It's my own taste, but I personally can't tell between the different branded vodkas. The way they make them now is to distill till the condensation is 90%-95% ethanol, charcoal filter it and add spring water back in to dilute it down to 50% alcohol.&#160;:P <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 05:00, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Vodka does taste sharp and also mild in certain cases. I'm personally lead to believe it's the temperature you drink it at and the mineral contents of the vodka, but I suppose a certain amount of chemical residues in the distillate could contribute to the difference. As for fusal oils and such, yes these are what contribute addition flavours to hard liquours of all sorts, especially moonshine. Fusal oils come from the "tails" of a distillation process (higher boiling point) and compounds that are considered flavourants in chinese wines such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate come from the "heads" of distillation (which may also contain methanol). Vodka distillers cut the heads and tails off to get the pure ethanol flavour in separate distillations. Different still masters cut them off at different times, which I guess contributes to each vodka's flavour (or smoothness). You can actually buy food grade ethanol (at 95%) from Sigma Aldrich and dilute it with your own water, it taste the same if not better then some vodkas, but then again I don't know anything about this...</p>
<p>I sometimes suspect that some manufacturers actually add ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate to their liquors to give it more flavour but that's just a paranoid guess. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 05:37, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah methanol is bad, which is why you get rid of it when it first comes off the still as part of the heads. Interestingly most of the "smooth" and "flavoruful" compounds are also somewhat toxic, at least in very large amounts. Fact is most of what we consider tasty or good smelling in small quantities can be toxic in tablespoon quantities. For instance acetone is very important in perfumes and ethyl acetate is one of the key (natural) flavorants of most Belgium lambic beers, and both are considered to be rather "Bad". So maybe Tito's vodka might be very "clean" but maybe it just lacks some of these potentially toxic substances to make it smooth to one's taste? That or the water he uses for dilution just isn't very good? I dunno. Maybe that's why having a still and some alcoholic mash is not enough to make one a stillmaster? <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 06:24, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On a separate note I think <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirsch.html" title="Kirsch">Kirsch</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slivovitz.html" title="Slivovitz">Slivovitz</a> have many of the same notes as baijiu. Ever tried them?<a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 06:34, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe there is something of a conspiracy with girlfriends buying boyfriends nasty alcoholic drinks...yeah you're not alone in your slivovica... I agree with the ajinomoto deal. Chef used to use that stuff as the sole thing in their soup base, which is an absolutely horrid idea. They have toned down though, now they use less of it, and a tiny pinch goes a long way in vegetable stock or chicken broth. Fact is modern cooking is at a lost without this stuff unless you go to the REALLY high end restaurants, which make the broth concentrates out of you favourite vegetable and animal parts. But then again, this broths will still contains a lot of MSG, since it occurs naturally in all (higher) living things.</p>
<p>The manufacturers are also getting better at producing better umami flavours, for instance by mixing glutamic salts with inosinic acid salts, or adding other types of amino acids salts, such as glycine. I think in general, with all "tantalizing" flavourants it's a better idea to <i>use less</i> then not use them at all. I mean what's life without some danger, or rather some flavour? I going to doze. lates.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 07:11, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I agree that it makes sense that the literal translations sit next to their chinese characters, the fact that we use the terms "Yellow liquor" and "White liquor" in the rest of the text warrants a more formal and emphasized "term introduction" in the article intro than just a cursory mention as "literal translation".

<p>Ok, I'd imagine you're pretty cross right now. I don't want to have a battle, or for you to feel like it's all-in six on one. I <i>did</i> ask someone else to help, in a perhaps not-so-nice way. That person hasn't even come around yet, by the way. What's happened is that one editor sees an article in someone's contributions, or an edit in recent changes. So they go to look. Then the article is in <i>two</i> people's recent changes, so then two <i>more</i> people some to look... snowball.</p>
<p>There's no denying that this article had diverged quie a bit from the norms of wikipedia. I'd say that some arguemtn could now be made that in an attempt to bring it back into line with our usual standards, we're pounding the article like a bag of rabbits.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to lay off a bit, and ask the others that we go a bit slower. Removing <i>every</i> image was probably a bit rough. We can work out something together that makes everyone happy.</p>

<p>Be Patient. I am going to make the category soon. First I'm moving all composers out because they are listed twice.</p>
<p><br />
I think you are misunderstanding that every composer is in: Jewish classical musicians. That's why it was suggested to split Jewish composers and songwriters. Look at the talk page. So to make it easy, I'm removing all the composers and only leaving songwriters or composers who also wrote songs (thats why I kept some you claim did both). However, many never wrote lyrics -- and you keep on returning them. It is slowing down what otherwise would have been a quick and easy change. If you can do me a favor, make <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_songwriters_ddb7.html" title="Category:Jewish songwriters">Category:Jewish songwriters</a> for me.</p>
<p>The composers are already in <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_classical_musicians_a00e.html" title="Category:Jewish classical musicians">Category:Jewish classical musicians</a> - unless you want to move them to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_composers_640e.html" title="Category:Jewish composers">Category:Jewish composers</a> which would just be superfluous. It's easy to put all classical musicians in <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_classical_musicians_a00e.html" title="Category:Jewish classical musicians">Category:Jewish classical musicians</a> and then all the ones who also wrote lyrics in <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_songwriters_ddb7.html" title="Category:Jewish songwriters">Category:Jewish songwriters</a>.</p>

<p><i>Depopulating the "Jewish composers and songwriters" category in favor of putting all the composers simply in "Jewish classical musicians" means that people looking *only* for Jewish people who are/were composers will be prevented from finding this information.</i></p>
<p>I was not the one who put all the composers in "Jewish classical musicians." That was done way before me. The goal here is simple: we want to make a category that will encompass as many of these people are possible. Otherwise we end up with people like Gustav Mahler who would have</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat:Austrian comp</li>
<li>Cat:Bohemian comp</li>
<li>Cat:Jewish musician</li>
<li>Cat:Jewish comp</li>
<li>Cat:Jewish songwriter</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is bad for the article and for anyone wanting to make a simple search. If you look through "Jewish comp and songwriters" you will notice that a good 75% of the people there have "Jewish classical musician" with them. This is extraneous. Hence, I wanted to simply rename Cat:Jewish composers and songwriters Cat:Jewish songwriters and only include lyricists in that category (ie: Billy Joel). This would pretty much save articles from having way too many categories, and would make searching much easier. If you have a better idea, say it and we will work on that. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComposerCleanup_1cbc.html" title="User:ComposerCleanup">ComposerCleanup</a> 11:35, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You can be a condescending as you wish, but I'll continue to try to reach an agreement. We have several options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) Break apart "Jewish classical musicians" and make a "Jewish composers" plus a "Jewish classical musicians" as well as a "Jewish songwriters"</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawback: This would make three categories plugging up a bunch of articles - we don't need that many</p>
<ul>
<li>B) Keep "Jewish classical musicians" as it is and make "Jewish composers and songwriters" simply "Jewish songwriters". This was what I was trying to do and would have within an hour had we not met with a revert war.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one do you see as better? <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComposerCleanup_1cbc.html" title="User:ComposerCleanup">ComposerCleanup</a> 11:51, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In all honesty, I think that option A is better. Why don't we need that many? It's not as if it makes any difference to bandwidth or the like. There is, of course, option C - leave it as it is. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 11:56, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Leaving it be is silly when it could be improved in under an hour. Nobody ever gets a consensus out of a big group of people on wikipedia. The thousands of "no consensus" afds/cfds I see is proof enough. Wiki:Be Bold policy is the best policy available. I don't think anyone would have even raised an eyebrow at the changes I was about to make, but Badagnani likes to be very authoritative and bossy (while putting up this facade of being "fair and balanced" and "following the rules.") This is all a hobby of ours - seriously get over it.</p>
<p>Anyway, how about first creating a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_composers_640e.html" title="Category:Jewish composers">Category:Jewish composers</a> and adding all composers to it. Then having <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_classical_musicians_a00e.html" title="Category:Jewish classical musicians">Category:Jewish classical musicians</a> purely for musicians that don't compose (like Heifetz?). There aren't that many songwriters to be dealt with, so a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_songwriters_ddb7.html" title="Category:Jewish songwriters">Category:Jewish songwriters</a> is ok. If there are no disagreements from you, then I'll get to work. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComposerCleanup_1cbc.html" title="User:ComposerCleanup">ComposerCleanup</a> 12:10, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never had the pleasure of tuning them in from North Carolina. Come to think of it I'm not positive about Tennessee, but I think there signal would have to reach some places down there. The mountians have some weird effects on radio signals. Sometimes you can't tune them in from the next county. They used to claim they had listeners as far away as southern Ohio, but I'm highly skeptical. Up here one must settle for the online stream.</dd>
<dd>While I'm here I should say thanks. I've encountered many music related articles that you've had a hand in. Nice work. Someday we should add some info to <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalshop.html" title="Appalshop">Appalshop</a>, regarding the Seedtime on the Cumberlands festival, and the Roadside Theater (both of which could be notable enough for their own article if one just had the time...). -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 19:13, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am quite sure. To countercheck, perhaps you can use the Hangul version of Ji Hee Kim - cut and paste on the search box if you don't have a Korean keyboard and search for her. If there are results, then it's correct. To check for the romanizations, perhaps you can refer to the principal articles and counter-check on how the romanizations work. I strongly believe it's correct, but please make ammendments if otherwise. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 04:33, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps you can try doing that on "Yahoo! Korea". That would provide higher chances of receiving some results. Also, do try entering the webpages you think which describes her (I did that while searching for Korean celebs, too). There is little need to know Korean in this aspect, however (I hardly know Korean)--I identified my destinated results by looking images posted on specific webpages. Anyway, since you have a chance to meet her, I hope that you can get some of her essential personal data for wikipedia. Cheers! <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 04:46, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah. The best way is to write to her. However, if you wish to, Yahoo! Korea is the second best option---but asking someone personally for someone's info is still the best. Anyway, I thank you for your affiliation with her--otherwise such research would have been harder.

<p>Hi, The point of having wikilinked full dates is so people can set their preferences to see what they like. I prefer the ISO format 2001-04-08 but you can set it to display April 8, 2001, 8 April 2001 or 2001 April 8 if that's what you prefer. --<a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavrdg_6aff.html" title="User:Cavrdg">Cavrdg</a> 08:34, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oops, my bad! Sorry about that, and thanks for catching the miscorrection. <a href="../../../c/m/d/User%7ECmdrjameson_3c06.html" title="User:Cmdrjameson">Cmdrjameson</a> 19:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Ah, that's interesting. If it's being frequently miscorrected, something that can help is to put a HTML comment in the text directly before/after the name saying that it's meant to be spelt this way. People may not notice a comment at the top of a page, but it's hard to miss one right beside the word in question. I saw a similar problem with articles on a band called <a href="../../../d/e/s/Descendents_%28band%29.html" title="Descendents (band)">Descendents</a> before.</p>
<p>Again, apologies for not paying closer attention; usually I'm fairly good at noticing the context and not blindly correcting misspellings, but every now and then I slip up.</p>
