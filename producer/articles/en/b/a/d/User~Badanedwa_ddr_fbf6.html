Each country controlled a part of the former <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">German Reich</a>.</p>
<p>Eastern Germany was initially settled by Germans in the early <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, replacing the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic.html" title="Slavic">Slavic</a> <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wends.html" title="Wends">Wends</a>. The newly aquired land was organised in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markts.html" title="Markts">Markts</a>, German feudal states. Consequent waves of German settlements, later also Jewish and French Hugenots, gradually changed the ethnic composition of the land to a Germanic one, except the small community of <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorbs.html" title="Sorbs">Sorbs</a> in <a href="../../../l/u/s/Lusatia.html" title="Lusatia">Lusatia</a>. Most of the later GDR first became part of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Prussia_1910.html" title="Kingdom of Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Germany_3d8d.html" title="Imperial Germany">Imperial Germany</a> and the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar_Republic_9fad.html" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> the area that would later become the GDR was situated in the center of the territory of the German state. The place was known as "Mitteldeutschland" (Middle Germany), while the term East Germany was reserved to provinces such as eastern <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomerania.html" title="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>, eastern <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg.html" title="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silesia.html" title="Silesia">Silesia</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussia_9913.html" title="East Prussia">East</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Prussia_61be.html" title="West Prussia">West Prussia</a>. After World War II, the victors decided at the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yalta_Conference_09f7.html" title="Yalta Conference">Yalta Conference</a> that the post-war borders of Poland would be moved westwards to the <a href="../../../o/d/e/Oder-Neisse_line_cb8b.html" title="Oder-Neisse line">Oder-Neisse line</a>, just as Soviet borders were also moved westward into former Polish territory. Middle Germany thus became the new East Germany.</p>
<p>When in 1949 the three sectors controlled by the United States, the United Kingdom and France united and formed the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a> (FRG, or "<a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">West Germany</a>") the Soviet part was made its own country, the German Democratic Republic, called "East Germany". The GDR, under Soviet influence, adopted a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism-Leninism_8ebb.html" title="Marxism-Leninism">Marxist-Leninist</a> official ideology and became part of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Pact_810c.html" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>, while the FRG, influenced by the USA, became a liberal parliamentary republic and part of NATO. The first leader of the new GDR was <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Ulbricht_f0e1.html" title="Walter Ulbricht">Walter Ulbricht</a>. The <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_German_Constitution_b981.html" title="East German Constitution">GDR Constitution</a> defined the country as "a Republic of Workers and Peasants".</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, following a decree by the state that all production quotas were to be raised by 10%, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers_Uprising_of_1953_in_East_Germany_1e4e.html" title="Workers Uprising of 1953 in East Germany">German workers demonstrated</a> in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Berlin_ec48.html" title="East Berlin">East Berlin</a> and other industrial centers demanding free elections. Later that day, Soviet troops and tanks suppressed the demonstrations with the loss of a few hundred lives. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/16/international/europe/16GERM.html?ex=1056769415&amp;ei=1&amp;en=5e1488a6203b8ac1" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/16/international/europe/16GERM.html?ex=1056769415&amp;ei=1&amp;en=5e1488a6203b8ac1" rel="nofollow">"In Eastern Germany, 1953 Uprising Is Remembered", <i>New York Times</i></a>.) The June 17th uprising is commemorated in the name of a Berlin street, the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stra%C3%9Fe_des_17._Juni_f02e.html" title="Straße des 17. Juni">Straße des 17. Juni</a>.</p>
<p>Just as Germany was divided after the war, Berlin, the former capital of Germany was divided into four sectors. Since Berlin was entirely enclosed in the Soviet part of Germany, the areas of Berlin being held under the control of the three western countries soon became known as <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Berlin_10b8.html" title="West Berlin">West Berlin</a>. Conflict over the status of West Berlin and supply routes connecting it to the zones occupied by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States led to the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Airlift_a92e.html" title="Berlin Airlift">Berlin Airlift</a>.</p>
<p>The increasing prosperity of the FRG and growing political oppression in the GDR led large numbers of East Germans to flee to the West. The increasing depopulation in the GDR caused the political leadership to order the borders closed, with fences, turrets, dogs, and most of all huge walls which included the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Wall_24be.html" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stasi.html" title="Stasi">Stasi</a> spied extensively on citizens to suppress dissenters.</p>
<p>Competition with the West was carried also on the sport level. GDR athletes were sure winners in several <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> disciplines. Of special interest was the only <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> match ever between West and East Germany, a first round match during the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1974_0f03.html" title="Football World Cup 1974">1974 World Cup</a>. Though West Germany was the host and the eventual champion, East beat West 1-0.</p>
<p>When the GDR closed the western borders, it also literally enclosed West Berlin within a huge wall, the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Wall_24be.html" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a>. Travel was greatly restricted into, and particularly out of, the GDR. Many who had come to the GDR as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-fascist.html" title="Anti-fascist">anti-fascists</a> who were opposed to the quick reinstatement of Nazi functionaries and industry in the west found themselves captives of a dogmatic and economically weak state which, alone, was forced to pay reparations to the Soviet Union. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Honecker_f88b.html" title="Erich Honecker">Erich Honecker</a> overthrew Ulbricht in a technical coup. Despite the inefficiencies of the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">state-dominated economic system</a>, the GDR was generally regarded as the most economically advanced of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Pact_810c.html" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> countries.</p>
<p>Before the 1970s, the official position of the FRG was that of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallstein_Doctrine_2e97.html" title="Hallstein Doctrine">Hallstein Doctrine</a> which involved non-recognition of the GDR (and, by implication, the Oder-Neisse Line as the western border of Poland). In the early 1970s, <a href="../../../o/s/t/Ostpolitik.html" title="Ostpolitik">Ostpolitik</a> led by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany_%281949-1990%29_f26c.html" title="Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (1949-1990)">West German Chancellor</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Brandt_7fb1.html" title="Willy Brandt">Willy Brandt</a> led to mutual recognition between the two Germanies.</p>
<p>In August <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> removed its border restrictions and many people fled the GDR by crossing the "green" border into Hungary and then on to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and western Germany. Many others peacefully demonstrated against the ruling party. These demonstrations eventually forced the resignation of Honecker; in October he was replaced, albeit briefly, by <a href="../../../e/g/o/Egon_Krenz_e2b6.html" title="Egon Krenz">Egon Krenz</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_9.html" title="November 9">November 9th</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> the Berlin Wall fell and with it the whole political and economic system of East Germany. Although there were some small attempts to create a non-socialist eastern Germany, these were soon overwhelmed by calls for reunification with western Germany. After some negotiations (the so-called "2+4 Talks", involving the two Germanies and the victory powers United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union), conditions for <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_reunification.html" title="German reunification">German reunification</a> were agreed upon. Thus, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> the eastern German population was the first from the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Bloc_65e3.html" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> to join the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> as a part of the reunified <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a>. The GDR territory was divided into what is now the city of Berlin and <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_of_Germany_65c0.html" title="States of Germany">five states or "Länder"</a>.</p>
<p>To this day, there remain many differences between the formerly "eastern" and "western" parts of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> (e.g. in lifestyle, wealth, political beliefs and such) and thus it is still common to speak of eastern and western Germany distinctly; one would hesitate however to contend the difference is greater than say that between a southern <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavarian</a> and a <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> resident. In this new Germany the economic chasm is greater than in the former West Germany, and much greater than in the former East Germany. Unemployment and long term poverty have led sometimes to an uncomfortable reawakening of nationalist and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazi</a> sentiments.</p>
<p>The costs of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_reunification.html" title="German reunification">German reunification</a> have greatly slowed the German economy.</p>
