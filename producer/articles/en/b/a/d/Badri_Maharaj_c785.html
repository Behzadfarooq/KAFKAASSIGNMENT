<p><b>Badri Maharaj</b> was an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Fijian_5b85.html" title="Indo-Fijian">Indo-Fijian</a> farmer, politician, and philanthropist. He was born in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> in Bamoli village, near <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badrinath.html" title="Badrinath">Badrinath</a> in the state of <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttarakhand.html" title="Uttarakhand">Uttarakhand</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. He came to <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji.html" title="Fiji">Fiji</a> as an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indenture.html" title="Indenture">indentured</a> labourer in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a> and through his own hard work became a successful farmer. He was the first Indian member of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Council_%28Fiji%29_6ef3.html" title="Legislative Council (Fiji)">Legislative Council</a> serving for two periods between <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> as a nominated member.</p>

<p>He was the first Fiji Indian to realise the need for schools for Indians and at his own expense founded the Wairuku Indian School, near <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rakiraki.html" title="Rakiraki">Rakiraki</a>, in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>, making it the first <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Indian_684b.html" title="Fiji Indian">Fiji Indian</a> school to be established in Fiji. One of the famous <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fijian.html" title="Fijian">Fijian</a> identities to attend the school was not an Indian but <a href="../../../l/a/l/Lala_Sukuna_49a3.html" title="Lala Sukuna">Rau Sir Lala Sukuna</a>, regarded by many as the father of modern Fiji.</p>

<p>In 1916, when it was decided to nominate an Indian to the Legislative Council, Badri Maharaj was given the honour. This choice was not popular with the Fiji Indians, who wanted <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manilal_Doctor_375e.html" title="Manilal Doctor">Manilal Doctor</a>, a lawyer, as their representative rather than a semi-literate farmer. There was considerable opposition to the appointment amongst Fiji Indians, and even <i><a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Times_30c8.html" title="Fiji Times">Fiji Times</a></i> suggested, instead, Manilal Doctor or <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._F._Andrews_6514.html" title="C. F. Andrews">C. F. Andrews</a>, or someone else brought from India be nominated, and urged the Fiji Indians to protest.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badri_Maharaj_c785.html" title="Edit section: Proposed Panchayat System for Indo-Fijians">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proposed <i>Panchayat</i> System for Indo-Fijians</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, Badri Maharaj suggested the establishment of <i><a href="../../../p/a/n/Panchayat.html" title="Panchayat">panchayats</a></i> as a form of Indian administration. In a letter to the Agent-General of Immigration, he outlined his ideas. He argued that <i>panchayats</i> would simplify the administration of justice amongst the Fiji Indians by hearing cases and arranging quick settlement of disputes. If the parties refused the authority of the <i>panchayat</i>, the matter could be brought before the Court. The proposed <i>panchayat</i> system was to include both <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindus.html" title="Hindus">Hindus</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims.html" title="Muslims">Muslims</a> to minimise conflict between the two groups. Badri Maharaj saw <i>panchayats</i> as a way to prevent the abuses associated with child marriage and as an authority to deal with all questions relating to Indian customs and religion. He offered to choose members for the <i>panchayats</i> and stated that it would help preserve Indian customs, minimise dissatisfaction and promote greater unity amongst the Fiji Indians. The Agent-General of Immigration agreed that <i>panchayats</i> were a good idea, but after finding out more about its administration in India and other indentured-labour colonies, concluded that no <i>panchayats</i> existed in other indentured-labour colonies, that it was too risky and the time was not right for its introduction.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> the Legislative Council debated amendments to the Marriage Law to recognise religious marriage amongst the Fiji Indians. Badri Maharaj introduced an amendment to raise the legal age for marriage but retain lower age limits of thirteen for girls and sixteen for boys for legal betrothal ceremonies. He explained the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> culture regarding marriage at that time but the Legislative Council ignored him and never considered the possibility of granting the Fiji Indians authority to define their law.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badri_Maharaj_c785.html" title="Edit section: Supporter of Government Policies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Supporter of Government Policies</span></h2>
<p>Madri Maharaj was seen as a “man of character” by the Government but had little following amongst the Fiji Indian community. When <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vashist_Muni_09cc.html" title="Vashist Muni">Vashist Muni</a> arrived in Fiji, in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, and conducted meetings in different parts of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Division%2C_Fiji_0f98.html" title="Western Division, Fiji">Western Division</a>, Badri Maharaj provided confidential reports on his activities to the Government. In one report he noted that the <i>Sadhu’s</i> followers were “businessmen, planters and civil servants” referring to the people who joined Vashist Muni at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penang.html" title="Penang">Penang</a> as “renegades”.</p>
<p>Badri Maharaj was the only Fiji Indian member of the Indian Franchise Commission, appointed in August 1920 (between the two strikes), to establish the means to provide Fiji Indians with elected representation. He was not present at most of the deliberations, even though one of the issues discussed was whether election should be through the use of <i>panchayats</i>, and had no influence on its outcome.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">31 January</a> 1920, the Governor formally appointed a Commission under the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Justice_fa52.html" title="Chief Justice">Chief Justice</a> to enquire into and report on existing wages and the cost of living and to indicate whether existing wages and salaries provided for a reasonable livelihood, and if not, to suggest measures necessary for adjustment. Badri Maharaj was one of the commissioners.</p>
<p>Badri Maharaj opposed the 1920 strike by workers in the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Division%2C_Fiji_03bf.html" title="Central Division, Fiji">Central Division</a>. He called for workers to return to work and was strongly opposed to the views of Manilal Doctor, who was regarded as the leader of the strikers. Badri Maharaj warned a meeting at <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nausori.html" title="Nausori">Nausori</a> of the danger into which they were being led by agitators. On the following day Fiji Indians were reported to be returning to work.</p>

<p>In July 1923 the Fiji Government introduced legislation to provide for an ungraduated <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poll_tax.html" title="Poll tax">poll tax</a>, called the residential tax, 0f 1 pound to be paid by all non-Fijian adult males between 18 and 60. Badri Maharaj, the nominated Indian member of the Legislative Council, resigned his seat in protest. He did not oppose the tax in principle but argued that it should apply to voters only, not to labourers, who could not afford it. In 1926 the Young Men’s Indian Association asked for an Indian member to be nominated again to the Legislative Council and Badri Maharaj was re-nominated.</p>
