<p>I got rid of most of the series 8 summary. If people want an episode by episode sumamary, they can go to the Bad Girls official website! I also added a section about the cancellation. I would also consider getting rid of, or at least massively rewriting, the recurring elements section... it's really badly written and probably not even necessary. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPellet_8baf.html" title="User:Pellet">Pellet</a> 23:49, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still think the Series plot summaries are far too waffly and verbose. We really don't need to know every plotline in the series here.

<dd>I agree. Who wants to edit it? It should be the same length as the other plot summaries. No reason that the shortest (and worst) series should have the longest write-up! Jtattenbaum 22:25, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I personally think it is pointless having the cast broken up into past and final series, as the series is now defunct. If you're going to do that for the final series, why not every series.

<li>Hi, i'm the one who has done the cast list as it is with the past characters and final series sections. I'm sorry if it looks strange but i only did it so people who hadn't yet seen the final ever episode, would know who was in it. But if people would like to change the section then they are completly welcome to do so. I also tried to list every character that had appeared in Bad Girls (even down to the minor characters) and to help me do so i split the sections into three groups (Past officers, inmates and others.) I would however be obligied that if anyone was to change the list around, they would take note of the characters already on the page because it took me an awful long time to get it as it is.

<li>Hi, new fan/editor here. Wouldn't it make sense to divide the character list by major characters and minor characters? The way it is now feels very overwhelming, and it's hard to spot a character you're interested in. There could be Major Prisoners, Minor Prisoners, Major Officers, Minor Officers, and Other Characters. Thoughts? Jtattenbaum 21:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Does anyone know why ITV3 have seemingly skipped the final episode of series 2? I've turned in tonight to find that it is the first episode of series three. I've scoured the schedules and am certain that I haven't missed one - I definately watched it last Monday. Now one of the key episodes plot-development wise has been jumped, making this week's a bit hard to follow. I wonder what's going on. Copyright complications? Legal problems due to plotline? ITV3 just being stupid (wouldn't be the first time!)??

<p>So, rather worrying that a leading channel don't seem to know what they're doing or don't spot mistakes, but positive in that the episode will be broadcast. =) <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_Firestorm_5b70.html" title="User:Jay Firestorm">Jay Firestorm</a> 20:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is there a section devoted to this message board thread? It seems very peculiar, given the Wikipedia policies about linking to external sites. I mean, it seems fine to have a link to the message board thread, but an entire section about one message board seems a bit much. There are a number of other equally-active Bad Girls discussions/message boards happening online, including on Television Without Pity, Bad Girls Online (which has archived threads going back to 2001), Bad Girls Net, and the Helen and Nikki board, all of which are equally worthy of being featured this way. Which is why, it seems to me, that there shouldn't be any section about any particular website or message board related to the show, and these should be included as links at the bottom, as is traditional on Wikipedia. Anyone else have an opinion on this? Jtattenbaum 22:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you should have left it on because BGA is a much more active disussion board than others. If you go on Bad Girls Online, you'd notice they get probably around three messages a day now if there lucky, Bad Girls Net is rarely updated now and all in all, BGA is a thread on Digitalspy that is still ongoing after it was first started in August 2005, still being posted on everyday. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.141.208.164 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.141.208.164_dc5c.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.141.208.164">contribs</a>) 11:11, March 29, 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Actually, I agree with Jtattenbaum's edits and rationale. Even if one fansite is much more active than others, an entire section in the article devoted to it is not really appropriate (unless it is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notable</a> enough to have been mentioned in the mainstream press). --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 14:23, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, in the more recent readings of the linking rules, it seems it's not even appropriate to link to ANY online discussion forum, so at least it's all fair.

<p>Excuse me Jtattenbaum, but do u own wikipedia?? If not what gives you the right to choose who can post what...I am a regular on digitalspy and find it insulting that you took it upon yourself to edit peoples point of view..kbramman</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just following the Wikipedia rules here, kbramman. No need to get hostile. I don't have a problem with digitalspy, and I didn't edit anyone's point of view, or chose who could post what. If you read this page and view my edits, you can see that I posted here before editing anything on the Bad Girls article. When it came to changing external links, I again asked those more knowledgeable, and Satori Son was kind enough to clarify the Wikipedia external linking guidelines. I then edited the links on this page according to those guidelines, to keep things consistent. And when another poster introduced the issue again, I relayed what I had learned from Satori Son. Jtattenbaum 19:06, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There used to be a link to digitalspy,which has been removed... the link to badgirls net is still there but the bga link has been removed, kbramman</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bad Girls Net is a website. Digital Spy and Bad Girls Anonymous are message boards/discussion forums. The rule is no links to message boards or discussion forums. Therefore all links to them have been removed from this article. Jtattenbaum 21:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the user at 172.189.131.51 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.189.131.51_01bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.189.131.51">contribs</a>) is referring to the official policy of <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a>, then they have badly mischaracterized it. That policy states "If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore them." That policy would be appropriate to cite here if, for example, you knew of this high quality, relevant external link but didn't know exactly how to format it or where to insert it. <b>IAR</b> tells you to not worry about the rules: just go ahead and put the link in the article and someone with more experience will come along and fix it at some point.</dd>
<dd>It does <i>not</i> mean you can ignore existing rules simply because you don't <i>like</i> them. The <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EExternal_links_ce44.html" title="WP:External links">WP:External links</a> rule is a long-standing editorial guideline that has widespread community consensus. If you think a certain website link falls within the inclusion criteria set forth there, then convince us of it. Otherwise, I fully support Jtattenbaum's edits to this article thus far. --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 20:58, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Im fully aware that you may support his edits, but some don't. The problem with wikipedia is that it doesn't matter even if you edit something yourself that could be relevant - someone will still come along, give some excuse and edit it (or totally wipe it) anyway. For example, the user who edited the Series 8 summary has cut alot of it out including references to some of the interesting plotlines. And he's done it because HE doesn't see any reason why (in his own words) "the shortest (and worst series) should have the longest write-up." But what gives him the right to make that decision. Supposing another user decided to add to it... I myself added to the Series 8 summary. I added the final words spoken by Sylvia, words which to a fan might have been seen as the end of an era due to it being the final ever episode, but still it was cut</p>
<p>I mean seriousley, where's the harm in including the BGA thread? It has relevance to the article so why not. In fact, now that Bad Girls is over, it could be mentioned as a type of 'Gone but not forgotten' section, highlighting how important the fan base is which could also have reference to other message boards and sites, and then we wouldn't be breaking any rules.</p>

<dd>First, I'm a "she" not a "he" but I'm glad to know you assumed I must represent the patriarchy. Second, if we include the BGA thread, then we should include links to all the active message boards for the show, of which there are at least four, perhaps more. I personally would be fine with that. However, since Wikipedia has a link guideline, and links to message boards do not fall within it, then I'm happy to follow Wikipedia's guideline. My only true personal concern is that it be "fair" in that one message board not be listed while other equally active ones are excluded. Third, my edits on the series 8 summary come from the same impulse. If every series had a five or six paragraph write-up which covered every storyline, then it would be fine for the series 8 summary to have such a long write-up. However, none of the other series have such a write-up, and so my edits to the series 8 summary were primarily to bring that series summary in line with the others. If you would like to rewrite all of the series to make them equally detailed, then by all means go ahead; I think the Bad Girls page on Wikipedia would be much better for it.
