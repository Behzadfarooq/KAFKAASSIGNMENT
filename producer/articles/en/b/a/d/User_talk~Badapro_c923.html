A tag has been placed on The Blays, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time.

To do this, please add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position.

<p>I came across Catalina cruz (lowercase 'c') on recent changes. I was going to move it to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalina_Cruz_08e6.html" title="Catalina Cruz">Catalina Cruz</a> (uppercase 'c') but it already exists, created recently by you. The content of the lowercase article <i>could</i> be moved cut-and-paste, but it would be cleaner if your article were deleted and the other one moved. If you agree, you can have <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalina_Cruz_08e6.html" title="Catalina Cruz">Catalina Cruz</a> (uppercase) deleted by adding {{db-author}} to it. Then you can move the other article and fix it up.

All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>" and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia's deletion policy</a>). You may contest the proposed deletion by removing the <code>{{dated prod}}</code> notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on <a href="../../../d/e/e/Talk%7EDeep_Side_b51d.html" title="Talk:Deep Side">its talk page</a>. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion process</a>, the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a> or it can be sent to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for Deletion</a>, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 16:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
