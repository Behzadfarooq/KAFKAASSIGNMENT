<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that I've had to remove some of the WP Films banners that you've added to certain topics. Please understand that WP Films and WP Filmmaking do not have identical scopes, and while there are some articles that do have overlap, most articles won't. WP Films tends to deal with specific films, characters, and broad film concepts such as genres and types of films. WP Filmmaking involves the technology, techniques, and terminology of actual filmmaking as a job. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the matter, so as to avoid any unnecessary work. Thanks! <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 00:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your quick reply! But just to clarify, I don't want you to stop using the banner if it seems appropriate; I just wasn't certain that you were clear on what was actually the scope of the WP Films project, not Filmmaking. We've finished assessing all of our tagged pages which were originally all unassessed, but I'm almost 100 percent certain that there are articles on Wikipedia (or soon will be) which are deserving of the WP Filmmaking banner but have not yet been tagged. I find a few every week! <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 20:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there. Could you please be a bit more conservative when adding the WikiProject banners to talk pages (WikiProject Dogs in this case)? I just don't see what the WikiProject on Dogs has to do with <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shippo.html" title="Shippo">fictional kitsunes</a>, <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozy_and_Millie_a61c.html" title="Ozy and Millie">webcomics with foxes in it</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_%281973_film%29_8736.html" title="Robin Hood (1973 film)">movies with foxes in it</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes_7e63.html" title="The Fox and the Grapes">fables with foxes in it</a>, and so on. How can the WikiProject Dogs help to improve those articles? --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 18:17, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see now that the WikiProject Dogs covers canines as well, which is kinda confusing tho. Shouldn't the project be renamed to "WikiProjects Canines" then? I'm not involved in any WikiProject, so correct me if I'm wrong, but <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dogs_4b08.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dogs">Wikipedia:WikiProject Dogs</a> reads like it mostly covers articles about canines and dogs in general, but not the more obscure-but-still-related topics like <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shippo.html" title="Shippo">Shippo</a> (which, in my opinion, looks like a good candidate for a WikiProject Anime). I think that someone who is interested in helping the WikiProject Dogs is quite probably not interested in the least in working on <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozy_and_Millie_a61c.html" title="Ozy and Millie">Ozy and Millie</a>, for example. The WikiProject Webcomics looks like a much better candidate here.</dd>
<dd>The article rating and assessment is a good point, but it is not needed on articles that already have another WikiProject banner. If there is no banner, maybe it might be a good idea to search for a more fitting banner in some cases.</dd>
<dd>I'm just mostly afraid of talk page clutter by those banners. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_%281973_film%29_8736.html" title="Robin Hood (1973 film)">Robin Hood (1973 film)</a> has dozens of different animals in it, and it wouldn't be very helpful to have dozens of WikiProject banners on the talk page, IMHO. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 19:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, after thinking about it for a little while, I think my main reason for opposing the addition of WikiProject banners in these cases is that they can really mess up talk pages. On some talk pages, there is a whole page of banners and notices before the actual content starts, and I usually try to minimize this by removing the not so important ones. Making the banners smaller would be very nice, do you mean like it is done on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Talk%7EWikipedia_74ea.html" title="Talk:Wikipedia">Talk:Wikipedia</a>? That looks pretty neat. Merging two or more banners is also a very good idea. I actually wonder why we don't have one standard banner for the WikiProjects, saying something like "This article is part of the WikiProject Dogs, Cats, Films and Literature". The article rating should be the same regardless of the project, and I just don't see much of an advantage in having a number of banners on a talk page when one would do the same trick.</dd>
<dd>I still think that it's a bit much to categorize (for example) <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozy_and_Millie_a61c.html" title="Ozy and Millie">Ozy and Millie</a> as a WikiProject Dogs article, but I don't really mind as long as the talk page doesn't get flooded by numerous other banners. I certainly see how article assessing and rating is a good thing, and getting a bit more attention (even though I think it won't be much in this specific case) is never bad. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 00:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi ... Maybe you can lend some advice on this. The AfD discussion regarding Tamaskan Dog was deleted and then restored at my request. The administrator who deleted and restored it asked that I'd clean it up. (His text: <i>I can restore the page, but would you be then so kind as to clean it up afterwards? There's some nasty language there. David.Monniaux 14:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</i>) I've asked him for guidelines on how to do that, since, of course, the discussion header says not to edit it. But ... he hasn't been able to reply yet. Do you know how I'm supposed to handle this? You can see a bit more on David.Monniaux's talk page. i.e. Do I just delete objectional text I see, or mark it with a strike through? Do I need to put a note saying what I am doing? Or shall I just be patient until the admin has a chance to reply? Thanks for whatever perspective you can lend ... <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 19:01, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for your thoughts. (Don't feel bad; it's just like me to ask questions that haven't been asked before&#160;;-) )It's been about 24 hours since I <i>did</i> ask for clarification, and I know he's made edits since then. I think I'll give it a couple more days ... since he is an admin after all and probably has tons to do. I too should be doing something else ... but ... <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 19:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think you are right to question whether Taoism deserves its A-class status. I only looked at the article briefly, but noticed that there are no in-line references. Considering that A-class articles are higher on the scale than GAs this is a red flag. Do you know how a case like this is normally dealt with? <a href="../../../i/k/e/User%7EIke9898_2b0c.html" title="User:Ike9898">ike9898</a> 22:48, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi badbilltucker -- may i ask, what were you thinking by adding a dog project banner to the <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel_Van_Helsing_6b26.html" title="Gabriel Van Helsing">Gabriel Van Helsing</a> talk page? that this fictional character briefly turns into a werewolf does not warrant such a global identification, thus i've removed it. did you mean to post something else? regards, <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenstat_f23c.html" title="User:Denstat">Denstat</a> 05:08, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe it's just me, but of all his appearances (which number over 20, if you include games, cartoons, comics, etc.) Twilight Princess is the only one where he appears as a werewolf. It seems kind of funny that as soon as he is labeled a werewolf once, the article somehow goes under WikiProject Dogs' "jurisdiction" or something. I'm not saying that different projects can't preside over a single article, but I think that's a little bit of a stretch. I'm not even sure the article even mentions more than a sentence about his TP appearance beyond the category at the bottom either. Anyway, maybe the purpose of the banner should be reevaluated. It's not like someone from WikiProject Dogs is going to actually going to be maintaining every article so tangentially related to the project. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 21:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not trying to put any of the "blame" (if that's what it is) on you.

<p>Hi Not going to get stuck into the big dispute, but to focus on one tiny issue, I do think it was a little insensitive to select a statue as an image to use when slapping a logo on talk pages connected with monotheistic religions.

<dd>Clearly, several individuals who didn't bother to look at it on the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">Religion</a> page, which clearly states in the caption that it is a picture of a man meditating, will jump to their false conclusions.

<dd>Hi Bill. Please reread what I wrote. It doesn't really matter to people passionate about monotheism what it's a statue of. And even if your argument holds water, that caption doesn't appear on each tag. Meanwhile, I think it's a shame if you decide to leave. You clearly have a lot to offer the Project.

<dd>Bill, in general I support your view on the religion articles, but I think this time IZAK has it right. Although it does not literally show idol worship, it shows a body position widely associated with religions that do worship idols, although often used for less specific or even purely secular meditation. But it shows it in a manner <b>extremely</b> suggestive of that religious practice, and only has a place on a page specifically discussing that religion. I think you used it in good faith, but any religious Jew or Moslem would object. I see it on the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">Religion</a> article, and I am dubious about it there, label or no label. . It would certainly be <b>altogther wrong</b> on a banner used on a page for subjects related to other religions than its own. I think you should be the one to remove it. I mention my usual caveat that I have no connection whatsoever with any religious sect or group. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 17:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Don't worry about this whole tiff with <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">user:IZAK</a> who though being a valuable editor to Wikipedia, has a bit of a rough touch when his feathers are ruffled! Forget about it and carry on editing like before, return to your post at your wikiproject, and understand this issue is a touchy subject. Each religion is a specialised area and IZAK may have been correct in the points he brought up, even though he could have been more civil about it. Your wikiproject can actually be very useful in several roles. The main role it would be very useful in is corroborating with all the separate religion wikiprojects so that their all their content is arranged in navigable format, e.g. Jewish <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halacha.html" title="Halacha">Halacha</a> is parallel to Islamic <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a>, or Christian <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_Law_0558.html" title="Canon Law">Canon Law</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_Law_a6fb.html" title="Hindu Law">Hindu Law</a>, etc. I've been thinking about it for a while, I don't know know it can be done since each religion wikiproject already have allot of their own interlinking templates but its a very important task that I think your wikiproject should undertake. So come back and we can negotiate! <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">frummer</a> 00:40, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You sound like a real nice guy (almost too nice!), and I hope you aren't dissuaded by the wildly accusatory language of some (any more than one would have to be). I don't know much about the situation, but I think this kind of umbrella group sounds like a great idea. Also, as someone who knows more about atheism than probably anything else, my sense is very much that it should be included. Atheists should get to participate too! It's about the subject of religion, I assume, and atheism is absolutely a category. The heading is "Religion," right? Not "Religions." Thanks for your work; I've only been on the periphery, and I don't know if you've unresigned, but I would hope you move forward.

<dd>Also, I just have to say, isn't the whole point of Wikipedia <i>N</i>POV? How can people of one religion say that people of other religions can't comment, evaluate, criticize, add their input, do anything they would do to any other article? That would make the place entirely POV! I'm fairly new here, but the criticism seems totally anti-Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 16:32, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bill, thanks for your note. Atheism is a rejection of religion, not in any sense a religion itself. Atheists reject the idea of the sacred, holy, divine, or of anything other-wordly that should be worshipped. I think the listing should definitely be removed from the religion wikiproject.

<p>Hi, I was going to leave you a message about Wikiproject CSBIR, but I also want you to look at the message I left on SlimVirgin's talk page. To further clarify my statement, it's primarily a Western perception that Buddha=God. In fact, in most (if not all) sects of Buddhism, Shakyamuni Buddha is revered, but he is not considered a God. Another way to put it is that enlightenment does not lead to supreme powers that God/s would have.</p>
<p>Fun "fact": Shakyamuni Buddha was poisoned when he mistakenly ate a mushroom from a follower (who mistakenly picked it). The Enlightened One spent his remaining hours fervently praying for the life of the follower (among other things) and expressing concern that the follower was wracked with guilt. More human than God, really.:)<span class="plainlinks">NinaEliza&#160;(talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NinaEliza_05f2.html" title="Special:Contributions/NinaEliza">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=NinaEliza&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=NinaEliza&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">count</span></a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=NinaEliza" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=NinaEliza" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">logs</span></a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_NinaEliza_286a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/NinaEliza">email</a></span>) 00:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw you are the creator of the Wikiproject Greece. Did you know about the existence of the Wikiproject History of Greece (where you are, of course, invited to participate), which already has 29 participants and is active? I think we should have a serious discussion about the future of these two projects. But most importantly: is the project you created actually active?

<dd>Thanks for your quick response. I also think we should discuss the whole matter. A merger seems a plausible possibility; now I do not know if the name will be "Wikiproject Greece" or "Wikiproject History of Greece". This is something will see. After all renaming a project is also possible. The positive thing with the history project is that it has a good basis of members and some sub-pages and projects working (not all of them satisfactory of course - the assessment page could work better). I have left messages to the other two members of the Wikiproject Greece and we will see. Of course, it is a period of holidays, and I am not expecting all the response to be swift!

<p>Thanks so much for your kind words. Down the road, I might need your help, but it's enough for me to watch everything you do for know - it's a real service to me:). I'm a <i>Mahayana</i> Buddhist, with emphasis on the Lotus Sutra. I'll be happy to explain what this means. I'm also fairly knowledgable in other aspects of Religion as well. Sharing knowledge is a joy to me, so ask any time:).</p>
<p>On that note, you might consider creating some sub-pages for your user page and sticking some of the larger portions of it in them. That way it loads much faster for slower browsers (or browsers behind a firewall). I just learned this recently.

<p>I don't know that these regional boards will draw enough participants, but maybe a subsection of the Africa board that is Sub-Saharan Africa? I'd be interested in writing articles about zoonotic diseases and epidemics of this region. I keep looking at these and seeing all sorts of information that should be added. How about Sub-Saharan (less South Africa, from the economic basis)? <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 21:26, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Morning Badbilltucker. An anonymous contributor (with variable IP address) has been adding content to <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominica.html" title="Dominica">Dominica</a> and related topics recently. Although some of it may be appropriate, most of it is baddly written, non encyclopedic and sometimes straight POV. As this article is scheduled for inclusion on the DVD, what can be done about this? Care to have a look into it? Advice/warning doesn't seem to help. Maybe semi protection might be a solution?

<p>At the moment I think Rev. Margolin will help out, though I'm also trying to attract the attention of Diane Vera. In general I think that the Satanism articles (ranging from the religions, to books, to people) do need more exact attention by people who are interested. A subproject sounds fine as long as there are people concentrated on it and an administrative body to help resolve conflicts (as it is very controversial). I will wait though as I'm new to all of this as I said.<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerewolfSatanist_d585.html" title="User:WerewolfSatanist">WerewolfSatanist</a> 02:46, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Badbilltucker,<br />
I don't know what to say. I really am lost for words. I guess what I am mostly feeling is thank you. Thank you so much. For the barnstar, the promotion, and making me the Cat Project's honorary commander-in-chief. I cannot believe this, it was the last thing I ever expected. I guess I just really believed in the Cat Project, and felt very passionately about it, but I really don't think I deserved all this...And when you look at the project now, it's amazing - a lot of that is down to you. In fact, I feel really humbled just looking at all the projects you belong to, and all the work you do. Really, I'm so grateful for all that you've done for me (although I don't think that I can ever return as Sergeant Snopake; I just wouldn't feel comfortable editing). Thank you so much, <tt><a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESergeant_Snopake_cefd.html" title="User:Sergeant Snopake"><font color="#FF00FF">Sergeant</font></a> <a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESergeant_Snopake_71f8.html" title="User talk:Sergeant Snopake"><font color="#3366FF">Snopake</font></a></tt> 17:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Under the circumstances, no one could reasonably expect you to return after what happened, and I'm frankly surprised you still remembered your password to log on. I know I probably wouldn't have. And, yeah, I really didn't think that there would be much of a chance of anyone returning knowing that they might have your new title as their screen name. That doesn't mean that the recognition isn't deserved though. It is. Like I said, I only wish we had had the award to give you while you were still active. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 18:35, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Badbilltucker. Can you please modify the template of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Egypt_bfdd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Egypt">WikiProject Egypt</a>: {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProject_Egypt_adb3.html" title="Template:WikiProject Egypt">WikiProject Egypt</a>}} by adding a <b>visible</b> importance parameter? So that the template is like the template {{<a href="../../../e/t/h/Template%7EEthnic_groups_825d.html" title="Template:Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a>}} of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ethnic_groups_221f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethnic groups">WikiProject Ethnic groups</a> which you can see at <a href="../../../e/g/y/Talk%7EEgyptians_820b.html" title="Talk:Egyptians">Talk:Egyptians</a>. This will help us find the importance of any article quickly without having to see the code of the page. Thank you.</p>

<p>Needs serious work. More importantly, a copy-edit of the neetham revealed that probably most, if not all, the children articles need to be copy-edited before the parent can truly get up to speed.

<p>Thank you so much for the lovely barnstar! Really, I love working on wikipedia--but that's the problem. The rest of my life has become so much more productive since I stopped living here. I figure if everyone on earth gave as much of 2 years of their lives to WP as I did, then it would be the most totally amazing web site in the universe--and no fundraising efforts could ever keep up with the demand for disk space. Anyway, it was a pleasant surprise when I just logged in briefly.

<p>Thank you very much for the confidence you place in me. I don't actually know all that much about either Islam or Taoism, although I am learning very quickly. I do know something about using sources and reflecting what they say, which is a useful skill in WP, I hope. So I'll try to bring that into the Religion project.</p>
<p>I would like to send you the greetings of the season and will do so in this format, which I got sent and might as well pass on. (Perhaps a warning of what the WikiprojectReligion might become.)</p>
<p>"I wanted to send season's greetings to everyone, but it is so difficult in today's world to know exactly what to say without offending someone. So I met with my solicitor yesterday, and on her advice I wish to say the following:</p>
<p>"Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit, my best wishes for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low stress, non-addictive, gender neutral celebration of the winter/summer solstice holiday, practiced with the most enjoyable traditions of religious persuasion or secular practices of your choice with respect to the religious/secular persuasions and/or traditions of others, or their choice not to practice religious or secular traditions at all.</p>
<p>"I also wish you a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted calendar year 2007, but not without due respect for the calendars of choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make England great (not to imply that it is necessarily greater than any other country) and without regard to the race, creed, colour, age, physical ability, religious faith or sexual preference of the wishee.</p>
<p>"By accepting this greeting, you are accepting these terms: This greeting is subject to clarification or withdrawal. It is freely transferable with no alteration to the original greeting. It implies no promise by the wisher to actually implement any of the wishes for himself or others and is void where prohibited by law, and is revocable at the sole discretion of the wisher. This wish is warranted to perform as expected within the usual application of good tidings for a period of one year or until the issuance of a subsequent greeting, whichever comes first, and warranty is limited to replacement of this wish or issuance of a new wish at the sole discretion of the wisher.</p>
<p>"Disclaimer: No trees were harmed in the sending of this message; however, a significant number of electrons were slightly inconvenienced." <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 17:59, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed your talk page from my watchlist and regret it now.

I still don't get from the language if this is religion or history, or both. I may have perhaps made things a bit too current.</p>
<p>I want to let you in on some thoughts I'm having. I basically need your advice. I want to start two new Wikiprojects. Wikiproject Mental Health and Wikiproject alternative sexuality. I've got no clue how to start either one, but I have a vision for both.

<p>I've noticed that you've been adding ratings to the articles on certain English mediaeval monastic sites and related topics as part of the wiki Catholicism project. Many of your ratings seem to me rather arbitrary and to be honest I would strongly question whether your giving such ratings is useful at all; it would be more constructive to point out where an article is, in your opinion, weak (as you did with the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaulieu_Abbey_be58.html" title="Beaulieu Abbey">Beaulieu Abbey</a> article). The speed at which you are giving these ratings also gives great cause for concern. <a href="../../../f/a/e/User%7EFaeriesoph_b507.html" title="User:Faeriesoph">Soph</a> 01:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC) <span id="63293646327"></span></p>

<p>Hi Badbilltucker.</p>
<p>I'm a member of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Abortion_f8b4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Abortion">WikiProject Abortion</a>, and I've been working on article assessments. I've never assessed articles before, and I'm not sure I'm doing it right. I wonder if you could take a look at a few of the articles I've assessed and tell me if you think I'm way off base.

<p>Whether you intend them or not, I am very troubled by an ongoing focus on me, rather than the issue, on the Hinduism Wikiproject page. If you're concerned about my conduct, let's discuss it in a productive way - but making comments like 'notice the ongoing behavior', etc. are decidely unproductive and I believe entirely unwarranted.

<p>Hello - I wanted to point out that Armenians are not Eastern Orthodox, they are Oriental Orthodox.

<dd>No worries. There is no listing that is appropriate on that page. There should be a separate listing of either the Armenian Church or the umbrella Oriental churches which have an article.

<p>I am just curious, but why are pushing so much for the creation of so many WikiProjects? They should be created by people who are knowledgeable about the subject and will be able to devote time to them - otherwise they will simply be lame ducks with a a bunch of tags around; which will be worse than not having the WP in the first place since its desolate state will discourage new users from joining in - something that won't happen with quality and functioning WPs.

<p>Image wise, the Inverted Pentagram. Its a nonspecific and commonly used in the LHP.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between "work group" and "task force?" They both sound good to me really. Task force kind of suggests a specific set of goals.

<p>If i were to join the council, what would i be expected to do? Or would it just be where i could show that i assisted in Transport in Scotland.

When i have more free time, i will follow the guide and see what happens.</p>

<dd>Hello again. As someone who seems pretty familiar with WikiProject proceedings and Wikipedia in general, I was wondering what your view is on ending the renaming discussion of this project early. I was the silly person who set such a long term for voting (expecting a bit bigger response and a lot more conflict). However, looking at the edit histories of all the past and present members of the Project, I think all but two members have voted who are likely to vote (the other two seem to have gone on hiatus, but at least one supported the change; the other I'm uncertain, but doubt he would object). That would indicate 100% acceptance of the proposal. As I start working in earnest on the <a href="../../../m/i/x/WP%7EMIXA_585e.html" title="WP:MIXA">assessment</a> of articles, it seems ridiculous to continue creating new categories, templates, etc. under the old name only to have to change them in less than half a month. As a result, some have been named using the new name (depending on how optimistic I feel and how difficult it would be to rename the thing later), and some still have the old. Would there likely be any negative fallout from ending the discussion and voting early, even though we have not yet met the early ending criteria I arbitrarily set? We obviously have consensus among those most likely to care or even express any opinion. And waiting makes much more work down the line. I'd appreciate your feedback, here or on <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillscrlt_ad5a.html" title="User talk:Willscrlt">my talk page</a>, whichever is more convenient for you.

<p>Hiya. Regarding your decision to split the Category:Temples and shrines of Kyoto - I'm not particularly opposed to the move, I would just like to mention a few points. (1) I originally created the category with the phrasing "temples and shrines" with the intention that "Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines" was implied. Now that they are split, why not go for "Buddhist temples in Kyoto" or "Temples in Kyoto" and "Shinto shrines in Kyoto" or "Shrines in Kyoto"? That is to say, since all temples (寺) are Buddhist and all shrines (神社) are Shinto, why not shrink down the category names? (2) There is a degree of syncretism in Japanese religion, and while it is fairly simple to label all -dera, -ji, and -in places as Buddhist and all -jinja and -jingu places as Shinto, is this split really 100% accurate? Do these places not contain elements of both faith systems? As I said, I don't really have a problem with this move, I just want to make sure that we've considered all the angles and done what's ultimately best organizationally.

<p>Sir, I've made some additions to the <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html#Teachings" title="Ayyavazhi">Teachings section in Ayyavazhi article</a>. Please take a look.</p>
<p>Also, One thing I wish to remain once again, (perhaps you might not have noticed, which I told earlier)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"one correction; It was noted in the article that, Ayyavazhi was founded by Ayya Vaikundar in 19th century South India. ==&gt; Ayyavazhi was not founded by Vaikundar. Ayyavazhi rise-up as a religion(developed) after the period of Vaikundar only based on his teachings, but not initially founded by him."</i></dd>

<p>Hey.

<dd>Crap alive! I didn't know that was even possible! Consider my objections withdrawn with all haste; that's just awesome (however, I'm still not sure that the 'adding articles to that page' goal needs to be there; that's a pretty mechanical task that can be done using the handy-dandy <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Paranormal_articles_by_quality_log_19d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Paranormal articles by quality log">assessment log</a>). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 01:34, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Rightous! One other thing though: the page seems a bit sparse. According to the Assessment page, the project includes exactly 600 articles at present. Do you think it's just because a lot are missing tags? --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 02:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, cool. Just be careful; <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quang_khem.html" title="Quang khem">Quang khem</a> sounds like an actual animal (and thus not under our scope), and creatures that are purely mythological in nature fall under the Mythology project's scope. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 02:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's dangerous territory, though, do be careful. Many 'mythological' creatures don't qualify as Cryptids (as no one seems to be claiming that they were or ever real, and many would argue that once a creature is confirmed as 'real', it no longer qualifies as a Cryptid (and thus wouldn't be under our scope, anyway). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 02:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
