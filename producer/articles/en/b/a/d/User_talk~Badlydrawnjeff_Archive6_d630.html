<dd>Wow, I'm rather surprised, considering you voted to endorse closure on the Carlsbad grimple, which seems to be much more of a neologism. Is it perhaps the misogyny? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Blythe_7728.html" title="User:Billy Blythe">Billy Blythe</a> 21:24, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Please check what <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">User:Sean Black</a> has done. He's accused me of trolling and apparently unilaterally removed the Tony Danza from DRV. Is this kosher? You've been around the block a few times and fought the good fight. Any advice?

<dd>It's already been discussed to death. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_punch.html" title="Donkey punch">Donkey punch</a> is an essentially nonexistent "sex move" of debatable importance, the Tony Danza thing is a joke based on it. It's been the subject of debate for as long as I can remember, and the creation of the separate articles appears to be a reaction against the consensus which has finally prevailed at the main article. Wikipedia is not urban dictionary, still less Uncyclopaedia. I suggest you try working on subjects of more obvious merit. How is the article on your home town? Your favourite composer or musician? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 19:55, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am very concerned about the recent deletion of around 50 stubs on Australian politicians. These articles lay the foundation for what <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> will one day be..."a multilingual free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language" (Jimmy Wales). This however will not happen overnight. I draw parallels to my own project on <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Coast%2C_New_South_Wales_1d0f.html" title="Central Coast, New South Wales">Central Coast, New South Wales</a> articles. 90% of the suburbs are stubs. But these stubs encourage <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EIntroduction_0d1c.html" title="Wikipedia:Introduction">anyone to edit</a>. Even <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">trivial information</a> has a place on Wikipedia. It should not worry <i>YOU</i> if the articles contained very little information, but you should be happy that the articles had information. In many cases these articles only needed an infobox and they would have been reasonably adequate.

<p>I hope I didn't come off as dismissive in the slightest on the talk of this new page. Any idea that can contribute to FA output is a good thing, AFAIAC.

<p>I agree with your feelings about IAR. In fact, I'd love to see it gone for good. I think it encourages disruptive behavior and rogue admins. But the question on Atlant's RfA seems loaded: if he says he's for it, he gets oppose votes like yours. If he says he's against it, he gets oppose votes for not understanding that official policy is official policy and it's not up to us to decide whether we like it or not. If he doesn't answer it at all, he gets oppose votes for that. It's a catch-22, isn't it? I mean, the most reasonable reply seems to be that it should only be used carefully and only in certain rare circumstances. Which is what he said, and he still got oppose votes.</p>
<p>It's not my RfA, and I'm not personally invested in it in any way, but it just seems kind of unfair. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 14:01, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not really. See my vote on Cazaroth's RfA for a comparison - there's a definite difference in attitude, and a willingness to "rely" on the policy is especially troublesome to me. I know plenty of admins I respect who don't always go by the book, and the ones I don't are the ones most likely to IAR and cause trouble and issues and strife. It's made me more cognizent of the situation, and that's where my opposition comes from in this case. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:24, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But he <i>didn't</i> say he would rely on it in his reply to the question. <i>You</i> said that, in your opposing comments. Only after that did he say that he'd be willing to use it because it's an official policy. I don't think he's a bigger fan of IAR than either of us are; he always participates in discussions and does a lot of investigation when it's needed. I've never seen him arbitrarily disrupt a process.

<dl>
<dd>I'd say that's actually a more valid concern. Personally, I like wikignome administrators. We've got more than a thousand admins, so not all of them need to be in the spotlight of AfD and AIV all the time. It would be nice to have a few admins who just quietly fix the little things that need doing. To me, the most important qualities are intelligence, responsible editing, and a regular presence here. But I know a lot of people don't feel gnomes need a mop, so I guess I could see a lack of support on that basis. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 14:53, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen you around the wiki some and I had hoped that you would be able to help me out with a subject that may be particularly close to your heart. I'm guessing that since you're an aspiring children's librarian from Central Mass. that you've probably read <i>Make Way For Ducklings</i> many times. If not, I apologize and you may disregard this if you like. Regardless, MWFD is currently up for peer review <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Make_Way_For_Ducklings_feca.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Make Way For Ducklings">here</a>, and I was hoping you could take a look at the article and give me some feedback at the review.

<li>I would say that the article may be around <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good article</a> standard, but there is quite some work to do before going for FAC.

<li>The length of the article is relatively short than most FAs. If you can expand it further, it'll be good, but that should not compromise on your chances for it to become FA. (See <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Bana_b43e.html" title="Eric Bana">Eric Bana</a>)</li>
<li>The article needs some copyediting. "Other ventures and post-exploitation" section noticably needs some work in its flow.</li>
<li>Ensure that your reference section is standardised in a consistent manner. Take care of dates, write them in a single format (I earned an oppose once for that). <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> provides some guidelines for this.</li>
<li>AndyZ has an excellent semi-auto script to run through the article for nitpicks, see <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_Suggestions_911a.html" title="User:AndyZ/Suggestions">User:AndyZ/Suggestions</a> for more information.

<p>Hey Jeff, I appreciate the WP:BIO argument, but the debate ran a lot deeper than that. The deletes were generally of the opinion that she's a nn former youtube contributor who enjoyed a brief time in the public eye but hasn't achieved lasting notability, the keeps were mainly technical "meets WP:BIO on press coverage" ops. The press coverage clause of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)"</i>,</dd>
</dl>
<p>and I think it's often forgotten that just being in a few online news stories, regardless of source, needs a bit more qualification than mere proof of their existence to be identified as both "multiple" and "non-trivial".</p>
<p>Keep votes based on "bothered by 3rd nomination" don't address the issue. But even looking at the whole picture there was a significant majority on the delete side (obviously it's not a vote, but we're talking a 70/30 split) and overall I felt the deletion and redirect to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youtube.html" title="Youtube">Youtube</a> (although Notable YouTube memes could be a more appropriate target, what do you think?) was the right outcome and reflection of community opinion. Hope you understand, thanks for getting in touch. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 15:02, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When you remove a prod template, do you worry about the reason given? The stated reason (regarding "Beautifully Broken") was that it was false (there is a long, agonizing history of imaginative users deciding for themselves what Ashlee's next single will be, producing no end of confusion for readers). Yet you removed the template saying that you "assumed" it was accurate.

<dd>Yes, I do. I saw a few rumors here and there when I did a Google and felt it needed a better look and the benefit of the doubt. How long will it survive? At worst, five more days, and at best, perhaps we get a better article out of it. BTW, the note on the prod when removed? "nn song." Not "hoax," not "idle worthless speculation." Even if it's not the next single, I don't necessarily believe "nn song" to be true. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, well in that case someone must have changed my original deletion reason, so it's no fault of yours. I don't think the song is non-notable either, but it is definitely not the next single (in fact there will not be another single from that album at all). Someone could write an article about the song omitting the "next single" stuff and I'd be happy with it (I've written and defended similar articles on non-singles in the past, but they've all been deleted), but seeing as this article is based on something made-up and anyone who invested the time to write a better article would probably just have to watch it get deleted through AfD anyway, I think the best solution is for it to just be promptly deleted. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:55, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sometimes, accurately describing the situation is still poor dispute resolution. I think this may be one of those cases. Of course, you're welcome to ignore my advice... I like to ask myself whether the goal is to be right, or to resolve a situation in the most congenial manner. I know you and MONGO don't get along, but I've seen you <i>both</i> use language that tends to aggravate the situation. If you don't believe me, and you don't believe Tom Harrison, try any authority on dispute resolution - people have studied this stuff, and found some things out. Some things work; other don't. I wish you luck in this particular dispute, as I agree that banning links to ED is quite stupid. Please don't screw up the cause you're working for by using language that exacerbates personal conflicts. Good dispute resolution strategies exist, and they work. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 00:46, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You know, that's the worst part of this. I know you're 100% right here, and yet the dispute resolution simply <i>didn't work</i>. Someone commented over at AN/I about this, and it appears to be true - the 'no action taken" for the obvious abuse of power has nly made it clearer that more will occur. What's left?

<dd>I think I understand which statements in particular you're talking about. I would suggest that providing a rebuttal to the statements in question in the appropriate place will work towards neutralizing the effect of those statements, which I agree are inaccurate. You probably won't get MONGO to say "yeah, that was wrong, I take it back". You don't need that either. Anyone reading up on the situation will read what he said, read your rebuttal, decide who's giving a more accurate protrayal of the facts, and that'll be that.</dd>
<dd>If you want to get specific about specific facts, I would focus very intently on one at a time. It should be easy to establish, for instance, whether any finding of fact was unfavorable as to your intentions. If it's true, then we can say which one. Etc, for the various points you want to tackle. The trick is to not get distracted by any side issue or by any kind of ad hominem - in either direction. Dedicated focus is a powerful tool in such a situation, as is a willingness to be seen taking abuse without dishing any back. It makes you look <i>much</i> better if you consistently turn the other cheek to ad hominems, all the while quietly and calmly repeating clear facts, and insisting on focused answers. If he treats you like a dog, and you treat him like a prince anyway, you gain a huge upper hand. That's one approach, anyway. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jeff, accusing Ryan of "trying to bait you", even if you're correct, is counterproductive, and <i>makes you look bad</i>. Looking good matters a lot here. Most of our status at WP is based on reputation. Just before Ryan's comment that you replied to by calling him out as "baiting", I attempted to discuss the subject about which you'd asked. Now I know I'm not an arbitrator, but I hope you know that <i>I'm</i> not baiting you. Could I persuade you to reply to the content of my comments, and please try not to even discuss whether or not someone is "baiting" you? From where I'm standing, such accusations look just as bad as people accusing you of trolling. Let's get this to work out, instead of getting it to blow up worse, please? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 18:31, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ryan and I have a...history. Let's put it that way. It's one thing to have an issue with MONGO, which seems to stem from perceptions of associations that no longer exist and have been blown out of proportion anyway. The other option was to try and get some administrator intervention regarding repeated violations of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, but I know better than to think that would work. In this case, I had one desire - for Ryan to stop, and it appears to have worked. Now, I know you're not baiting me, and I'm hoping MONGO is willing to take you up on your offer, but I'm no longer all that worried about reputation here. Those who actually bother to get to know me know what I'm about, and there's a stark minority who's reduced to making things up to try and skew perception in an opposite direction. Again, I'm not sure what else I'm supposed to do, but I'd hope that taking constant abuse isn't supposed to be one of them. It's ironic enough given who it's coming from already. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:36, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For the record, I'm not baiting anyone, I wasn't involved in the ArbCom case and I think my motives (to protect MONGO and other users from ongoing efforts to harass them in real life) are quite clear from my conduct.

<p>Jeff, I'm replying to your "what now?" question on my talk page. I read the conversation you linked to, and I think I'd recommend backing off for a bit, and let's talk about what you're after here. You contend that MONGO said some untrue stuff about you, and you'd like him to somehow acknowledge your complaint as valid, and do something appropriate. If my understanding that far is wrong, please let me know.</p>
<p>Reading these conversations, I don't see MONGO recognizing which particular statement you're saying is inaccurate, and why. He seems to be maintaining that he's only paraphrased what ArbCom found. You seem to see it differently, so why not explain to me, here or on my talk page, which particular statement or statements you'd like to see repudiated? If you have a whole list, pick two or three. If you dispassionately present a very specific complaint, about a specific thing MONGO said, with clear and impersonal logic, then you give him something a lot more concrete to respond to. If you present it in a way that he can work with, and that will also bring about what he wants, which is apparently to Create Space, that might go over well. How does that sound - we'll talk about what your goal is, and maybe I can approach MONGO as a third party when you've got your case ready to present in a way that will look to him like a solution - sound cool? I mean, if he really just refuses to deal with you at all, there's probably nothing to do but move on and chalk it up to Ain't Life Funny Sometimes, but I have more faith in MONGO than that. I'm open to working via email, too, if that would help. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 23:11, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>These sorts of disputes detract from the very good work almost all of us try to do in creating and maintaining neutral valid page space while keeping our personal convictions intact. I'm not that terribly wiki political and I rarely post on political page space unless it's vandalism related (I watch all US Presidents for example). In this case, I saw Robert West's notice on the BLP noticeboard, read up on the controversy, and tried to come in to calm things down. You know it's funny; I'm not sure if you and I agree or disagree on political philosophy, based on posts and conversations to date. Perhaps that's how it should be.

<dd>Because I was curious, I spent a few minutes this morning looking at a sampling of your multitudinous contributions. Groovy. If you wish, I encourage you to glance at mine. I notice that we have little overlap, I'm very much focused on biography and military history; while you tend to focus more on popular culture and music. Based on my cursory reading it is my preliminary opinion that we probably don't agree on the merits of <i>many</i> issues, yet we share a loyalty to wikiprocess. I wonder if I might call on you from time to time to help with intrinsic bias. It would be great to find someone here I frequently disagree with, but who I grow to trust nonetheless.

<dd>I talked to a rapper friend of mine (not well known, but a serious figure in music), and he believed I was incorrect about the folk etymology of the idiom "on point", and suggested that the root was more like the idiom "on message" much like the traditional use of the phrase. Since I've heard conflicting explanations from figures I respect, I'm not sure what is in the article is correct. In addition, I'm getting into OR territory, aren't I?

<dd>And there's no reason why you must make any extreme effort on my behalf. My intention in asking your assistance was that I was hoping someone has written about the phrase in popular culture sources, sources I'm certain to be less familiar with than yourself. I'm still looking for some firmer written sourcing for the etymology I first believed correct. No biggie.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I thought about that, but several different deleted versions of the article contain personal information. Any restoration would need to be selective only, requiring me to comb through diff-by-diff. So, the answer is, "at least not for a while." Given that it will take at least a few days to do the restore properly, I think its probably best if discussion begins anew (with the latest bit of history still available) and a rewrite basically from scratch is attempted.

<dd>Hey Jeff. As I've noted on the Emmalina talk page, the article was deleted, the deletion was endorsed and even a second DRV which at the very least put words in my mouth as to why the article was deleted still failed to overturn the result.

<dl>
<dd>Hahah! It's actually really simple, because the MediaWiki software allows us to watchlist articles that don't exist yet. So all you have to do is follow the template. I just plug Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ into the address bar, and plug in random users who don't have RfAs. It's a little harder if people have failed, because there's no consistency to second nomination targets, but if you know people you feel strongly in either direction about, it just makes the RfA pop up on your watchlist the minute someone nominates them. You can do it with any article - everything that's redlinked on my userpage is watchlisted, for instance, so I know if someone creates an article I'm interested in. Very useful! --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I actually like you a lot. I think a few zealous retentionists can keep the deletionist majority honest - I think it's a great idea to have some - and I submit that you do a much better job of it than TBT (who's gotten better over time) and the late Monicasdude, of blessed memory. I know you think I nominate for deletion aggressively, but what you don't know is that most of my admin work sdince resysop has been prod and csd review, and I am very good at declining them where there's a glimmer of hope. I even bring two or three expired prods per day to AfD instead of deleting them - and some ended up being kept, e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Startools.html" title="Startools">Startools</a>. So if you keep doing what you're doing, you're going to influence and educate - subtly - for the good of us all. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 15:35, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no rule but it is common agreed practice. There is little purpose to review an article which will be in constant change (being on the main page). Furthermore experience tells me that these disputes are handled better in talk pages. When talk page discussions fail then it is appropriate to consider if the article does not meet FA standards. Let's give some time after the article is off the main page to see if the OR concerns are addressed. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelr31_1d76.html" title="User:Joelr31">Joelito</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoelr31_6ce3.html" title="User talk:Joelr31">talk</a>) 20:19, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you VirtualDelight and Badlydrawnjeff for spotting and acting on the problem being created since August this year by ottex aka john Mchale Jnr.</p>
<p>This contributor has also been corrupting the page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pop_art&amp;oldid=87253424" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pop_art&amp;oldid=87253424" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pop_art&amp;oldid=87253424</a> since 09 August 2006</p>
<p>and the contribitions he has made to his father John McHales entry, created by a Piers Masterson on 10 August 2006. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_McHale_%28artist%29&amp;oldid=87347055" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_McHale_%28artist%29&amp;oldid=87347055" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_McHale_%28artist%29&amp;oldid=87347055</a> makes interesting if laughable reading.</p>
<p>He has also made erroneous contibutions to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamilton_%28artist%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamilton_%28artist%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamilton_%28artist%29</a></p>
<p>I draw these other problems to your attention as you guys seem to care that Wikipedia should not be used for the dissemination of personal opinion, personal promotion or for defamatory and libelous statements.There have been various recent press stories about Wikipedia being used for attempted character assassination and these "contributions" by McHale Jnr are indeed all of the above.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I wonder what we can do about getting you sysopped? I was extremely disappointed by the last RfA, which I thought focused on personal disagreements over inclusion standards rather than the simple questions: would this person make good use of the tools, and can we trust him with them? To which both answers are, in my view, yes. That's three long-standing contributors I've seen voted down at RfA now, you, Stephen Streater and Georgewilliamherbert. Given that all three of you are, beyond a shadow of doubt, here first and foremost to build an encyclopaedia, I find it problematic that the RfAs failed. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 13:00, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the ED fiasco isn't going to help my case, and unless the 'crats are going to start cracking down on dealing with outright false statements, it's going to happen. I know full well I'd be quite good at it, and I have a lot of time during the day that I can't do a lot of writing, but could clear out backlogs, but the GWH RfA doesn't give me much hope that I'll even get a fair shake. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Man, I wish you wouldn't do this. Your arch-inclusionist agenda is not helpful to the project. Do you not understand that there's no consensus for including unsourced bio articles on non-notable people? Are you aware that we need to have extra high sourcing standards on living people? These people's 15 minutes of fame is <i>already over</i>. There's already no good sources on these people- do you think sources will magically appear now that they're completely forgotten? If they do something noteworthy that causes them to be covered in good sources, we should make articles on them <i>then</i>, not today in anticipation that they'll become significant some day. If you're trying to prove some kind of point, please state your point somewhere relevant rather than by making this kind of unhelpful edit. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:16, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I could see newbies not getting it, but it really bothers me that as an experienced editor you're OK with unsourced original research about living people. This exposes the project to extra risk for no useful reason.

<dd>It's a <i>stub</i>. You're better off asking the folks there to get some bio pages for us than trying to ay my "arch-inclusionist agenda is not helpful to the project." You're better off making it so consensus reflects your views that people on well-known television shows shouldn't get articles. You're better off approaching the people who create the articles who don't know how we do things. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:45, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And P.S., I didn't make some sort of blanket statement about any alleged "agenda" you had when I asked you - rather politely, mind you, considering we've clashed on this before - to reverse those moves. I certainly don't think you have some sort of "arch-redirectist agenda," nor would I ever assume something like that. I do hope you'll think twice before saying something like that again.

<dd>Sorry if it came off as contempt- I have no problem with you personally, I just wish you'd change some of your editing behavior which I see as unhelpful. But, I can see I've let this irritation get the best of me, so I apologize. If I seem unduly annoyed, it's because this has been an issue for a long time and countless people have tried to get you to change your approach, with no results that I can see.

<dd>If I may interject, it seems that Jeff doesn't understand that consensus requires compromise, not a "stay the course" attitude.

<dd>Which parts of my approach, exactly? The ones where I occasioanlly oppose a redirect and reverse it? Or that I suggest keeping a very small percentage of overall AfDs? Would a suggestion that your approach of just redirecting articles without discussion be just as helpful? I'll say this much - folks who prefer heavy deletion simply do not get this type of scrutiny.

<p>I made some comments on the AfD about your neutrality. I don't want you to take offense, but it seems that this issue has become rather close to your heart. I realise that I'm but a limited contributor to Wikipedia, patrolling, tagging, and fixing typos, but I've read carefully all the policy I can, and I think you're in the wrong. See <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a>, which I'm sure you disagree with, but has become a guideline. I've read the previous AfD's, and I'm still puzzled at your reasoning as to how this is an encyclopedia article in the traditional sense, and not something one would see in a lexicon like, say, some of these big French dictionaries I have like the Harper Collins Robert or the Larousse which give defs and usage examples. No need to reply, but if you do, I'll read it here. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Spunky_Toffee_af7b.html" title="User:Mr Spunky Toffee">Mr Spunky Toffee</a> 19:38, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And someday, when our reliable source policy moves beyond what it is now and into realms that are more sensible, this can move from "Lists of trivia can be useful for developing a new article, as it sets a low bar for novice contributors to add information without having to keep in mind article organization or presentation" to something more substantial. I hope you continue to get a good grasp of how things work around here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:26, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My one issue with it is the pseudo-bullet-pointedness of the prose from the "business" section down. I'm not sure if there's plans to expand it further or not, but it feels very stilted. I'm also unsure about the mainstream appearances section, I'd personally either keep it all there and eliminate the list or eliminate the prose and keep the list, not necessarily both.

<dd>Thanks, that's basically what the other reviewers wrote. I'll add it to the review. However, I've noticed that it's a lot harder for me to actually put the reviewer comments into practice than it was for you - with Babb, I would write something, and you would do it, while with Jameson, it's taking many days for me to make better paragraphs out of the broken points. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I really get it. The difference, I think, is that you were working with an entire article that had been written, while I essentially pulled Babb up from scratch. I'll be glad to help you, but certain places that I do Wikipedia editing won't do well in terms of me editing a porn star, if you follow.

<p>Jeff, if you're not aware of how much MONGO doesn't want any mention of the ED website on his page, please just look at his own edit summaries a little lower down in the history.

<dd>It's not harassment to ask the question. Perhaps you should instead reverse his deletion of the talk page against deletion policy instead of harassing me. Or maybe warn him about his <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a> toward me in the archives.

<dd>Oh, I see. I was assuming good faith on your part, but apparently I was wrong. You were edit warring on MONGO's page in full knowledge of it being a hostile act, in fact, if I understand you, doing it <i>as</i> a hostile act and in revenge.

<dd>So, MONGO deletes a page, but then it's harassment to question him about it? Come on... regardless of attempts to deny people the ability to mention a topic to him, he still needs to be accountable for his actions as an administrator. If he doesn't want to ever be asked about ED stuff, he shouldn't be deleting the ED talk page. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:05, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, that was one of my first thoughts too. Though I do think it's appropriate to avoid certain user talk pages and certain topics sometimes. I don't know. In this case, maybe going to DRV might be the only reasonable way to address it? (though I don't understand why G8 isn't appropriate in nearly every case. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_Explanations_3642.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion/Explanations">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion/Explanations</a>'s only exception mentioned is for talk pages needed for encyclopedic purposes) --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 03:25, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well doesn't the "contain discussion useful for creating a legitimate article at that page" clause cover the ED talk page? I was under the impression that discussion was going on to (in theory) help create an acceptable Wikipedia article.

<p>The question posed by badlydrawnjeff, while typically accusatory and naturally defending the ED website, as he has done repeatedly, was fine, but reposting the question made by a trolling account when he made his two attempts to post on my page, was unnecessary.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMONGO&amp;diff=88062485&amp;oldid=88060998" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMONGO&amp;diff=88062485&amp;oldid=88060998" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88063188" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=88063188" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Ah, but of course, anytime someone questions badlydrawnjeff's obviously good intentions, they are guilty if a lack of good faith. The talk page was doing nothing to help us make a better encyclopedia...if you wish to let all the ED trolls who haunt wiki use a page in your userpsace to figure out some way to recreate an article about a website that attacks your fellow editors here, be my guest. That reflection will be on you, not me.

If not, at least run the existing image through <a href="http://www.irfanview.com" class="external text" title="http://www.irfanview.com" rel="nofollow">IrfanView</a> or similar (i) to <i>crop</i> it (more than half the image is of a table or floor) and (ii) to make it less jaundiced (unless it really is yellow, of course).

<dd>I'm only miffed by the vague comments than anything else. The book really <i>is</i> yellow, and quite ugly, but I'll see if I can dig up a bookstand or something. I wanted to try and get the idea that it's a large book rather than anything else, so maybe that's not coming across. By the way, you changed "causing" to "exciting" controversy. I've never seen the word used like that before, was that intentional? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:20, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about either (a) scanning the book, or (b) trying a bit harder to stand so that the camera is directly above it? On the verb to go with "controversy": come to think of it, "excite" isn't right and "cause" may well be better. I wanted to suggest that there really wasn't much controversy, if any: via fake letters, etc., Babb and his boys would create a pseudo-controversy. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 15:17, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As you can see, I've cropped the photo (incidentally, thereby making a huge reduction in its size in bytes, I think without any <i>obvious</i> degrading of visual quality). On further reflection: (i) The flash of white page-edges shows that the photo isn't jaundiced. (I'd first wondered whether it was taken in tungsten light while the camera was set up for daylight.) Because of this and because of your comment above, I didn't fiddle with the colors. (ii) Photographing it other than head on may get around the problem of the copyright of the original design (but IANaL). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 00:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think a photo of the book to demonstrate what it looks like would violate anything, and if anyone did quibble, I'd grudgingly remove it, but the cropping is nice. Looks a lot better in the thumbnail, so thanks! --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was wondering if you'd had a chance to see my proposal at that deletion review about the ED talk page? I've proposed that the relevant discussion get moved to a subpage or the talk page of the AfD, similar to how "further discussion" has taken place over the Esperanza pages. I know the talk page of the article is normally the best place, but in this case this could be a viable alternative venue for constructive discussion on how notable ED is and what to do about all this. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It really honestly makes no sense, because no one's going to look to go to the AfD's talk page, and, frankly, the AfD talk page only makes things more confusing in this case. I just have to deal with the fact that people would rather defend lies than improve the encyclopedia and continue with that in mind. Nothing more, nothing less. I honestly cared more about the process and the ability of people who may have been interested in a page in the future than the talk page itself, and once again, the usual suspects stepped right up to the plate. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:51, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was thinking that it would be more a place for people already aware of the issue to provide constructive comments. I was thinking that an out-of-the-way place like that might avoid trolls, but that would be being too optimistic I fear. If you want a general place for anyone to talk about whether the ED article should exist, I agree that the current talk page would be too divisive and attract too many trolls. I would suggest appealing to an admin that you respect (can't remeber if you are one yourself) to allow you to have a copy of the reasonable stuff, especially the links claiming to prove notability, and then build up a case yourself. I too care about process, and have successfully fought this kind of battle, but I don't envy you this one! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:31, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Jeff. My rationale was that there was a consensus, rooted in policy (unlike the keep votes), to delete the article. If we're counting, which we don't, it was 10-7 delete. However, policy trumps 'I like it'. As always, you know where <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> is if you want to confirm whether I acted correctly. I will re-edit the AFD to ensure my rationale is on there.

<dd>Thanks for the re-edit. It's interesting that you say the keep votes weren't based in policy, given the evidence that the subject meets the WP:CORP guideline.

<p>Jeff, since you have indicated, understandably, that you don't intend to respond further to the discussion on my comment at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2006_November_16_1007.html#Talk:Encyclopedia_Dramatica" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 November 16">Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 November 16#Talk:Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>, I'll say this here. I think all of the events surrounding the related ArbCom case at this point make it disruptive to pursue undeletion of this talk page. I think in this case, it would be preferable to let this entire issue die down. The vigor that you've displayed regarding the undeletion discussion just struck me as wrong and possibly more than that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're very much misunderstanding the ArbCom case, not to mention the specifics surrounding it, but there are more problems apparent in that than could possibly be worth getting into right now, so we'll just leave it at that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, you make a good point regarding my assumption of bad faith, and with my subsequent qualification of my good faith. I haven't had any dealings with you in the past, and despite my gut reaction to the discourse on the page, I was wrong to assume bad faith.

<dd>Apology accepted, and judging by our paths since we got here, I doubt we'll run into many (if any) issues in the future.

<p>Hello again. So if there are 5 voters, four of which say it doesn't meet a guideline, and one person shows that it in fact does meet the guideline, at what point are those delete arguments weakened? I'm not sure what the rationale for the close was here. Let me know, I have this page watchlisted. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:07, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because it didn't meet the guideline. The chief guideline for band articles is <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and the band fail <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Tour info would have to be <i>reported in notable and verifiable sources</i> - a myspace page is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, nor is it verifiable. No other source was provided in the AFD discussion to prove the band met <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 13:17, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, if you read WP:V, which I quoted, a band's page can be used as a source if it is uncontroversial and has something to do with the subject's notability. This qualifies, and they met the standard. So I'm not entirely understanding the argument here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:27, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but it's not a reliable source for the fact that they are going on tour. As this was your justification for the article passing the criteria <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, it was not sufficient. Do you understand that a band's myspace page is not a reliable source? Please, again, take it to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> if you don't agree. In this instance, I am pretty confident that nobody will agree with you, and they will, probably, be better able to explain why a myspace page is not enough for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, as I am not succeeding. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 14:34, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I may have to. What defines what's verifiable here, the WP:V policy or some other guideline. I really need to understand what part of "Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about the author(s) of the material, so long as:...it is relevant to their notability" doesn't apply here, though.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it can be used as a source. But it's not a reliable source, and is certainly contentious if you're claiming it's enough for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (note the exclusions listed in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 14:46, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Just wanted to drop you a note saying I appreciate your efforts in having the talk page for the article on ED unprotected. I never saw the original article and much of the fallout from whatever happened seems to have vanished; so all I can do is guess. It must have been quite awful.</p>
<p>I admire your candor and your attitude towards freedom of speech on Wikipedia. Preventing a talk page from recreation is a step I've never before seen on Wikipedia, and certainly hope never to again (preventing discussion of materials critical of Wikipedia isn't one step removed from censorship; it <b>is</b> censorship). I sincerely hope that your efforts don't harm your reputation in any way.</p>

<p>I took the <a href="../../../j/r/e/User_talk%7EJreferee_6e45.html#Thanks_for_the_help.21" title="User talk:Jreferee">shaky rationale</a> for the DVD cover from today's <a href="../../../j/a/w/Image%7EJaws_A.jpg_a3e0.html#Fair_use" title="Image:Jaws A.jpg">featured article</a>, figuring that if it was good enough for a featured article, it should be good enough for the DVD cover.

<p>I'd love to have your input regarding a forked Wikipedia in the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">fair use</a> discussion. It seems unlikely that we're going to talk those pushing towards a free-content Wikipedia off the edge, and we need to figure out a way to compromise.</p>
<p>Your insight regarding the Wheatus photo has been very helpful, but it feels like, just like some of my comments, it's falling on deaf ears. With that said, please let me know what you think. - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStick_Fig_43b2.html" title="User:Stick Fig">Stick Fig</a> 17:32, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think forking is the answer, and, in all seriousness, fair use images aren't <i>that</i> important in the grand scheme of things. The frustrating part is the complete lunacy of some of the fair use hardlinrs who are using policy to direct behavior as opposed to using policy to build a sensible encyclopedia. I'm not sure where to head on this, I have some ideas, though. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:35, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree in that regard. I've had many of my comments ignored and disregarded due to policy-speak, and it's not particularly nice to do so. It just finds us at opposite ends of a spectrum, shouting down to each other, unwilling to budge. Where's the compromise here? Nobody seems to be willing to give up any ground. - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStick_Fig_43b2.html" title="User:Stick Fig">Stick Fig</a> 17:42, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the reasonable compromise is to do each one as a case-by-case basis. If it's believed a fair use image can be replaceable, we discuss it and come to a consensus. Thus, some, like the Wheatus photo or a promo photo of <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._D._Salinger_afb8.html" title="J. D. Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a>, both images that would be deleted under the current criteria, could be discussed based on their <i>actual</i> replaceability as opposed to the blanket, moronic, "it exists thus can be replaced." The <i>logical</i> situation continues to be "fair use, to be replaced when a free alternative is located/presented," but I don't see that happening. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:47, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
