<p>No. I personally do not have access to any of the 250+ books on drinking games you continually refer to, so I personally cannot verify the existence of any of these games. These articles were a proceedual nomination based on the aborted mass nomination at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Circle_of_Death_%28drinking_game%29_40db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Circle of Death (drinking game)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Circle of Death (drinking game)</a>, and the "relist individually" suggestion of at least four different editors.</p>
<p>All those articles were nominated for the same reasons, a lack of verifiable information taken from reliable sources. If someone can go "But wait, it definitely appears <i>here, published on this date by this company</i>" then I will be happy to reconsider my own personal stance on the article, as I have done for a few of them now. However, saying "There's 250 different books on drinking games, its gotta be in there <i>somewhere</i>!", doesn't really cut it for me. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 22:04, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We cancel each other out. No question. I really hate seeing your votes at Afd that cancel mine out or actually double cancel mine out. No consensus can be reached without compromise, just ask members of congress. We need to engage in give and take.

<p>Hi there<br />
Sorry about the Keane articles the other day but I couldn't read your messages at time. I read them and I realized I was wrong about separating the songs because any other band has it (Thanks for that) and because some songs were really stubs, so I revert some of my last changes. I took part of your edit and mix it with more info. About the EC and TITLT singles, I decided to keep both two discs in the same page but making a clear difference between them avoiding future confusions from visitors or another Wikipedians. I 've also added the midi music samples in the repaired list of songs, now separated from the main Keane article and separating unreleased songs from released ones. See you and thanks again:)</p>

<p>Regardless of when an AfD starts, it can be closed at any time to an administrator's descretion. On this AfD we had a concensus to delete (with some speedy votes) and so it was closed early, and the article deleted.

<p>If I had closed purely on votecounting, it would probably have been closed no consensus, with 6 deletes against 4 keeps. The AfD had already been relisted, and had therefore been open 10 days and needed closing. I read through the discussion and came to my 'conclusion' of deleting based on the information given by everybody, including you, and coming to my own desision. I don't really know how to explain the closure of an AfD - I closed it how I did because that seemed the <a href="../../../u/c/s/WP%7EUCS_6cee.html" title="WP:UCS">most sensible</a> thing to do. — <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox">Fire</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox">Fox</a> 13:38, 28 May '06</p>

<dd>I don't mind that you closed it, I am simply curious as to how you came to the delete decision. Since you admit that straight vote counting would have gotten a no consensus, and (at least by my view) not much was offered in terms of a reason to delete, I'm simply wondering what you used as a sensible interpretation. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 13:54, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Try not to insult my intelligence any more than you already have.</p>
<p><i>... but things like "And as for User:Badlydrawnjeff -- jeezus, I do NOT know what his major malfunction is, but insulting my intelligence with obvious nonsense is the surest way to get MY goat. He's badly in need of a clue-by-four regarding basic encyclopedic standards -- such as proving something is true or at least offering some evidence it is -- and his faith-based approach to keeping every sliver of anything is truly annoying" certainly aren't appreciated.</i></p>
<p>Too bad, so sad. Grow up: stop spouting obvious and transparent nonsense -- either because you are hoping no one notices or because you are incapable of doing otherwise -- and I've got no problem with you. You are allegedly a college grad: if you had tried any of your empty rhetorical stunts -- airily proclaiming something to be true with not the slightest shred of evidence and stamping your feet and pouting when called on it -- in any of your papers, the TAs/professors would have bounced them back so fast your head would have spun: it's not going to work here, either. This is a reality-based encyclopedia, not, as you seem to imagine, a faith-based one: Tinkerbell doesn't exist, and closing your eyes and wishing something were so doesn't make it so. As my talk page says, "It's clean-up duty, mopping up after the dishonest, incompetent, and fanatical. Can't imagine why you'd have a problem with that." --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:50, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>June 6, 2006 is National Day of Slayer which invokes the day 6/6/06. The public is promoted to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen to Slayer at full blast in your car.</li>
<li>Listen to Slayer at full blast in your home.</li>
<li>Listen to Slayer at full blast at your place of employment.</li>
<li>Listen to Slayer at full blast in any public place you prefer.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
DO NOT use headphones! The objective of this day is for everyone within earshot to understand that it is the National Day of Slayer. National holidays in America aren't just about celebrating; they're about forcing it upon non-participants.</p>
<p>Taking that participation to a problematic level:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stage a "Slay-out." Don't go to work. Listen to Slayer.</li>
<li>Have a huge block party that clogs up a street in your neighborhood. Blast Slayer albums all evening. Get police cruisers and helicopters on the scene. Finish with a full-scale riot.</li>
<li>Spray paint Slayer logos on churches, synagogues, or cemeteries.</li>
<li>Play Slayer covers with your own band (since 99% of your riffs are stolen from Slayer anyway).</li>
<li>Kill the neighbor's dog and blame it on Slayer.</li>
</ol>

The reason given by the nominator (a 16 year old from Mequon, WI) was that Trinity "does not seem to be notable or exceptional in any way" which is simply just not true. Trinity has a history of just short of 100 years and is one of the six <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combined_Associated_Schools_6ccf.html" title="Combined Associated Schools">Combined Associated Schools</a> of Sydney.

<dl>
<dd><i>If a school article is verifiable and meets one or more of the following criteria, it should be kept:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>It has 3 or more full and complete sentences of verifiable, factual information that is not published solely by the school itself, or already included/better located on a district or city wiki article (ie: phone book information does not count toward the sentence total, that includes city, address, district, or phone number(s)).

<li><i>It has one or more interwiki links (e.g. another version already exists in another language)</i></li>
<li><i>It has one or more PD/GFDL/free pictures</i></li>

<p>Bottom line, the article meets the criteria and should have never been nominated in the first place. I hope this clears things up.

<p>Politicians do it all the time, and without deals there can be no real compromise, but surely, with your background, you know that. I apologize for talking about you in the third person with Calton. I probably should have come to you first, and I especially realized that after more of Calton's rants. Calton's a good contributor, imo, but you two just don't seem to get along. I tried to identify a children's book for you to fix (with no expectation of return), because I read your interests on your userpage, and I'm more than willing to refer endangered articles to you when I find them, so that you may bring them up to article status. If you'd like me to abstain from votes on memes, I'd be willing to do that too. I personally think internet fads aren't worth recording, as they come and go, and due to my age, I've probaby seen quite a few from the early nineties that you haven't. Anyway, I'm willing to stay out of your memes and your music, and I'll even alert you of their impending doom as necessary, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't sabotage some causes that are near and dear to me. I hate advertising, I don't like that huge amounts of minor fictional characters get articles, but most of all, I hate trivia articles. I like reality. I think if we could support each other's agendas, we could make some real progress together. I think one of the main problems is that you believe in documenting pop culture intertextuality, and I do not. As a literary scholar myself, I think stories should largely stand alone, and the greatest ones do. What it boils down to is that I'm willing to help you advance your agenda, if you help me advance mine by not objecting. I think it's a win-win arrangement. Well, think about it, as I am sincere.

<dd>I appreciate your honesty and your coming to me, but doing so would run counter to what I'm trying to build on the side of my music and book articles. I certainly see where you're coming from, but I'm not sure where that would ultimately benefit either of us. You have my word, however, that i'll tread much lighter on these issues you're passionate about and not be completely militant as I tend to be about it. You've earned that muchrespect from me. As for the Calton stuff, water under the bridge. You've proven yourself to be an asset, and that's all that matters.

<p>Jeff, I wish you would reconsider your stance on setting up a wikiproject for memes, I honestly feel it's the best way forward for it, a group of like minded editors are going to be able to better edit the articles, work to existing standards and create their own, and thus determine the answers that seem to elude us. I'm tired of butting heads on this one and I'm going to call it a day. Hand on heart, I agree with you in spirit, I just don't seem to be able to find common ground in the sense of a guideline. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 21:57, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thing was, it was a legitimate speedy; the article never claimed notability. You added the bit about them touring after it was undeleted, and now it wouldn't be a legit speedy. But you were fighting pretty hard for the inclusion of this article even before that. I can tell you're an inclusionist, but you seem to have good research skills and know policy pretty well. And you've been involved in AfD long enough to know that an article like this one doesn't stand a chance of being kept.

<dd>Out of process is a very strong expression. I don't believe I did anything remotely controversial - substantively that is, not procedurally. Sorry about the delete vote - you're right.

<p>Hi Jeff! There's ample precident for using WP:SNOW for closing all manner of processes on Wikipedia - AfD, RfA etc. Indeed, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> has been SNOWBALLed once before on AfD.</p>
<p>I think the point here is that closing the AfD was out of process, but that the process itself was not suitable for the purpose. When a process won't work on what it is being used for, then SNOW is the ideal way of summing up the reasoning for aborting the process without spending valuable bytes explaining.</p>
<p>It's certainly <i>much</i> closer to my thinking in closing the AfD than declaring it a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> would have been. And I'd rather not lie about my thinking just to make it fit with the correct <a href="../../../o/m/g/WP%7EOMGWTFBBQ_36a9.html" title="WP:OMGWTFBBQ">WP:OMGWTFBBQ</a> policy page.

<dd>The precedent is without merit, and, in fact, we have <a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">a policy against binding precedents</a>. Snow is not policy or guideline, and should be avoided as it's often divisive and inflammatory. Please consider using a different rationale if you feel the need to ignore the processes in place.

<dd>I already have. It didn't work, unfortunately. It was kept for historical value, since it's not a policy or guideline. Since there are better reasons to close it, it would be preferable that admins use existing policy to close AfDs instead of divisive essays which have no basis in the workings of WP. You could have done so too, that's all. I'm sorry you're offended by my telling you that your invoking of a divisive essay was wrong and out of process, but it unfortunately was, as Brandt Afds are closed because they're point violations, not due to the nonsense that is WP:SNOW.

<dd>Hi again Jeff. I can't reconsider my reasoning for closing the Brandt AfD as my reasoning <i>was</i> WP:SNOW. Giving another reason now would (a) be rewriting history and (b) be lying. Whether SNOW is official or not or not to be invoked, whether there is precident or not or not to be followed, whether there are other reasons that others may have used or not, it doesn't matter: the fact is, I closed the AfD because the process involved was not fit for the issue at hand, and the shortcut <a href="../../../o/m/g/WP%7EOMGWTFBBQ_36a9.html" title="WP:OMGWTFBBQ">WP:OMGWTFBBQ</a>-wording for that is WP:SNOWBALL. I'm sorry I can't rewrite history, but then again, a glance at the diffs would just show everyone that I had tried to - thereby making doing so pointless in the extreme.

<dd>Yeah, but if I can keep shifting the attention AWAY from WP:IAR and start crafting our policies to better serve what we're typically doing anyway (see the recent change at speedy keep for an example), it's a plus.

<dd>Absolutely. And remember, if it fails that does not make you a bad person. I've seen some bruising RFAs, quite at odds with the "no big deal" approach; if people make peronsla judgments, try not to take it personally. Don't argue, but do post respectful refutations of misapprehensions. If it goes down? Who cares.

<p>Jeff, you might want to make some kind ofd statement re speedy A7. I think it's unlikely you would leave an article which says, in effect, that "Joe Bloggs is a senior at Mudhole Flats High" (i.e. no <i>assertion</i> of notability and no realistic possibility of verification) but I think some people would like to be reassured that if an editor tags an article you would, rather than simply removing the tag, PROD or AfD it, in a janitorial capacity, or fix it so the assertion of notability is plain to see, or userfy it if it's an obvious autobiography. I am confident this is what you would do. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:47, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm having trouble gelling your responses to answers 1 and 6. If you come across something marked for speedy under CSD A7, what would you do with it? If you think it's sufficiently notable to escape speedy deletion, then the original nominator would probably send it to AfD. But AfD has become exceptionally busy, so if you don't delete, the risk is that AfD gets clogged with things that the community would vote to delete anyway. Your thoughts?--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 06:58, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It'd really depend on the situation. i'm obviously not going to delete something thatshows notability, but I'm more than likely going to avoid the A7s as to not anger anyone about it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 10:49, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like you, don't know all the rules to this thing, but you I like. I give up on trying to fix this thing; Pepper is a pioneer in my industry but i just cannot seem to figure this wikipedia thing out between "advertisements", POV (which I thought I cleared up but i guess not), "encyclopedia type" entry. Thanks for your contributions to the page and i'll let the experts update from now on, I'm going back to sternfannetwork. One question though, why was the picture taken down? It's famous in our circles, created by Ric Machin and used in trade publications and literature when she speaks. I even got Ric &amp; the company blessing to the pic. Are only photographs acceptable for individuals?Frank4southmiami 09:51, 30 June 2006 (UTC)frank4southmiami</p>
