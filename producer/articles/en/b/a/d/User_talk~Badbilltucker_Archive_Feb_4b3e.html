Removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process, but the article may still be sent to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for Deletion</a>, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached, or if it matches any of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a>.

<li>There is not now and never is likely to be a project directly relating to Liechtenstein. Also, unfortunately, the quality of the majority of the Liechtenstein articles is not really at all good. By having them assessed and included in the scope of a project, they might receive a bit more attention, particularly if individuals interested in Liechtenstein joined the project. The France project has just recently expanded to include Andorra and Monaco on a similar basis. Eventually, when I get the articles lists together for all these projects, they can also be checked for improvements, vandalism, and other changes. I wish the country were large enough to get its own project, but I really can't see that ever happening, and having an interested project is better than not having one. I hope anyway. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 18:51, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear Badbilltucker, I have just posted a new article: <a href="../../../f/a/u/Fauna_of_Scotland_a0bd.html" title="Fauna of Scotland">Fauna of Scotland</a>. I'd like to think it is a decent amateur effort, but I am not a zoologist and would appreciate input from Wikipedians with zoological credentials. I note the existence of the WikiProject Mammals, but I didn't want to go blundering in.

<dd>Oh, well in that case, since Keesie actually is so vastly much more experienced, I humbly withdraw my totally unfounded and rude suggestion that Keesie is not much more of a newbie than I am. I stand corrected. I had no idea she has the benefit of such long experience on Wikipedia.

<p>There are dozens of other unfounded and rude remarks posted by JJ that await apology. It could be argued that virtually every edit summary of JJ's and every talk page post and every edit on his own talk page counts as violation of some kind of wiki-ethic or a jab at someone. The jury's still out; sometimes it takes longer to repair damage than it does to behave with good faith the first time around. Before you (JJ) accuse me of some nonsense, yet again, remember who blanked their user page of a welcome message, from me, and called it spam. Nice! <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 21:46, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not to put too fine a point on things, but Keesie, I put on my user page that I would take down anthing that was deemed to be clutter or not necessary and yes, the word "spam" was in that list. You chose to assume that I removed your stuff because it was "spam." I removed it because it was, in my estimation, just cluttering up my talk page and I just didn't want it.

<dd>Too true. His repeated violations of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> are such that I think a lot of people will continue to look upon him as a troublemaker, particularly if he continues in his current fashion of falsely accusing people all over wikipedia of acting in ways outside of the rules, when in fact it was his own behavior which has consistently been objectionable. I do think that appropriate apologies are due to several other people in wikipedia and in a lot of places in wikipedia, particularly if the editor in question ever wants to actually earn respect from his fellows. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 22:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sorry for not obeying Keesie and following her directions, nor for seeking her approval and permission to make any edit I have made. And I surely do thank her from the bottom my heart for following me about on Wikipedia and monitoring my every move and accusing me of being other people.

<p>Hi Badbilltucker,</p>
<p>Just a quick note to let you know I removed a template you had added to Adashino Nenbutsu-ji. It's possible that there's a good reason for the template, so of course feel free to add it back. I'd be interested to know the rationale.</p>

<dd>No problem. The temple was established on a site that had been used for disposal (exposed, not buried) of bodies of the dead, and could have Shinto interest, but as a Buddhist temple seemed most natural as a Buddhist stub.

<p>Hi Badbilltucker</p>
<p>The "articles by quality" categories you have created for WikiProject:Iceland do not match the category names called by the template. AFAIK, all such categories should have been named "A-Class ..." etc. with a capital "C". The non-article categories do in fact spell "Class" with a capital C. I hope you don't mind if I replace your set of categories with a new set which will match both the template calls and the category names for similar material.

<p>Hi Badbilltucker,</p>
<p>I've joined the project. I think it is a good idea if the members of this project have a to-do list and start working on the pages all together, no matter what the topic is. The major problem in relgious related problems is lack of enough (dis-interested, less biased) editors. Most of the editors who are interested to work on particular religous articles usually share some common ground. Anyways, Thanks for visiting my RfC. Cheers, --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:47, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here are the concerns I have with Christianity related articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We lack a section/article on the teachings of Jesus and how it greatly influeneced mankind. I have found academic sources for that here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jesus#Teachings_of_Jesus" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jesus#Teachings_of_Jesus" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I was personally amazed at the teachings of Jesus, and academic scholars <i>have written</i> on this and the influence of his message, the radical new ethical elements he introduced, but wikipedia is almost silent on this issue.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Jesus_f6e4.html" title="Historical Jesus">Historical Jesus</a>: Please see this section and the link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Historical_Jesus#Scholarly_debate_on_historicity_of_the_Resurection" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Historical_Jesus#Scholarly_debate_on_historicity_of_the_Resurection" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I think it can be neutralized.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Christianity_2059.html" title="Criticism of Christianity">Criticism of Christianity</a> is biased against Christianity. For example, this information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Golshani#Christianity_and_the_Development_of_Modern_Science" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Golshani#Christianity_and_the_Development_of_Modern_Science" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> could be used in that article. Criticism of Christian Ethics section should at least state how Christian Ethics improved the ethics of humanity. Furthermore, it might be good to separate Christianity as practiced from Christianity as Jesus taught.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Wouldn't most Christians find that last sentence offensive? The religion that isn't getting any attention is Sikhism. For example <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism_and_the_Sikh_Panth_aef3.html" title="Hinduism and the Sikh Panth">Hinduism and the Sikh Panth</a> is a POV screed attempting to prove the right-wing Hindu claim that Sikhism is part of Hinduism, something that Sikhs (rightly) deny. The very title of the article is implying that it is part of Hinduism.

Looks like this user's first 4 edits to the ML article were today, and the 4th edit reverted to the state of the article before his/her first.

<p>I see you tagged <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norse_paganism.html" title="Norse paganism">Norse paganism</a> with the wiki-project neopaganism tag. I don't know how appropriate this is, because at least in the sphere of articles I edit, we keep modern religions and revivals separate from the historical pagan religions. There was actually quite a bit of discussion about this quite awhile back and that was the consensus. So for example, all of the religions listed at <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_neopaganism.html" title="Germanic neopaganism">Germanic neopaganism</a> are neopagan, as are most of them at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polytheistic_reconstructionism.html" title="Polytheistic reconstructionism">Polytheistic reconstructionism</a>. (Both of these articles are basically the portals leading to all of their sub entries, of which there are many.)

<p>Sorry it's taken a bit to get back to you. First off, note that the user I posted under on the discussion page didn't seem to excited about the concept, either. Now, I just see this as becoming a thing that would be abused; as someone who's been on RfC recently, I know how easily a mudslinging festival can be called 'evidence gathering'. To maintain a true image of impartiality, such a review board would have to take a LOT of cases on, and would be under a LOT of pressure to maintain 'integrity'. Basically, I can't imagine it NOT degenerating into a which hunt. It's even worse if it has no authority; then, admins could be 'condemned', but go on editing to the jeers of their critics, which they now would be forced to accept. Not that I'm saying they should have any authority; that would cause all sorts of conflicts with ArbCom. Really, I just see this as another way to focus on people instead of content, which can only slow down work and drive people away in my eyes. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 04:38, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I got your response. I knew it might be a rough idea, but I didn't know that I needed approval from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Religion_dd65.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Religion">Wikipedia:WikiProject Religion</a> itself. Do you think I should removed the pages I created, or try and create the in the same way as their corresponding WikiProject pages? - <a href="../../../q/a/s/User%7EQasamaan_e1fe.html" title="User:Qasamaan">Qasamaan</a> 22:17, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No it's okay. You know what? For now, I think I might deactivate the template and restore the WikiProject Judaism one. I, in fact, only turned it into a hidden note, and I can easily reverse the process. I won't really like to receive complaints, so for now I have to do it. - <a href="../../../q/a/s/User%7EQasamaan_e1fe.html" title="User:Qasamaan">Qasamaan</a> 22:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Badbilltucker</p>
<p>I just noticed that you've placed a WP:Finland banner on <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanian_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Scanian (linguistics)">Scanian (linguistics)</a>. Sorry but you lost me there. Scanian is spoken in southern Sweden in what was eastern Denmark until 300 years ago (I've deliberately avoided placing a WP:Denmark banner there since it will probably provoke somebody no matter that the oldest Danish record is in Scanian). But Finland ??? Charles X Gustav considered deporting the Scanians to <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingria.html" title="Ingria">Ingria</a> but it was never carried out. Were you thinking about something else?

<p>Hey. I know almost nothing about dog breeds, but Kuhmoisten Sanomat seems to be the local newspaper in <a href="../../../k/u/h/Kuhmoinen.html" title="Kuhmoinen">Kuhmoinen</a>, a (very small) municipality in Finland. Therefore, obtaining a copy of the issue does not seem very possible. The referenced article translates as "A family with dogs enjoys being close to nature" or similar, so I don't know if it contains any real information about this dog breed. However, the author of the article is <a href="http://www.kuhmoistensanomat.fi/henkilokunta.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kuhmoistensanomat.fi/henkilokunta.html" rel="nofollow">listed</a> on the newspaper's official website, with an e-mail address. She might be able to help out, in English too. The Finnish name of the dog seems to be "Tamaskankoira". It's listed on <a href="../../../../fi/l/u/e/Luettelo_suomalaisista_kotiel%C3%A4inroduista.html" class="extiw" title="fi:Luettelo_suomalaisista_kotieläinroduista">fi:Luettelo suomalaisista kotieläinroduista</a> ("list of Finnish dog breeds"), but does not have an article on the Finnish Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 22:22, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am thinking about starting a project to organise aviculture pages on the wiki. I find that sometimes a section is started on a bird species page, only to be deleted or drastically reduced by ornithologists.

<p>Hi Badbill, first of all let me commend you for your tremendous work with the WikiProjects, I've been amazed at your brilliant work - you've quickly become one of my heroes. This work has really helped take the load away from <a href="../../../w/v/w/WP%7EWVWP_b15b.html" title="WP:WVWP">WP:WVWP</a> over to <a href="../../../c/o/u/WP%7ECOUNCIL_bae4.html" title="WP:COUNCIL">WP:COUNCIL</a>, where it really belongs. I also always enjoy your light hearted style. I won't post a barnstar just now, though, since I'm asking a favour:</p>
<p>I wanted to get your thoughts on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Work_via_Wikiprojects_d82a.html#New_discussion" title="Wikipedia talk:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Work via Wikiprojects">the new direction for WVWP</a> that you seem to support.

<p>Hello. I've noticed that you do a lot of stuff with maintaining and organizing Wikiprojects. I'm trying to inform all wikiprojects that might be affected by a proposed merge about the proposed merge, and was wondering if I could solicit your help in that endevor?</p>
<p>Back in December I proposed a merger for three fair use templates, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Template%7EGame-cover_ebcf.html" title="Template:Game-cover">Template:Game-cover</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/a/Template%7EBoardgamecover_03d5.html" title="Template:Boardgamecover">Template:Boardgamecover</a>, and <a href="../../../r/p/g/Template%7ERPG-artwork_434b.html" title="Template:RPG-artwork">Template:RPG-artwork</a>. I made an effort to publicise the merge on the villiage pump and various places that deal with fair use templates. After a lot of support on <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">tfd</a> and a lack of opposition elsewhere I attempted the merge on January 15. Post-merge I've had two objections, one of which said that I "should have brought up the merge with the various projects that manage those covers" (which I thought I was doing when I informed <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fair_use_d046.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fair use">WikiProject Fair use</a>). The merge has been reverted by the person who said I should have brought up the merge in more places. Today I went around and informed:</p>

<p>There are attempts by several users to get rid of WikiProject Dravidian Civilizations. These users are deleting both the <i>Dravidian topics template</i> and the <i>WikiProject Dravidian Civilizations template</i> from related articles. There have been numerous personal attacks on me, my ethnicity, my heritage, and more. There are also other attacks on a couple of our members.<br />
<br />
I have had problems with the previous users on a similar issue:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> - banned</li>
<li>Asian2duracell - blocked twice</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
When <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> was banned, Asian2duracell took his place in attacks against me. And when Asian2duracell was banned and became inactive, <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> and a new set of trouble makers popped up and took his place.<br />
<br />
The following trouble makers listed above have been backed and supported by the users below, who seem to have been around Wikipedia for a while:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> - staunch supporter of Sarvagnya</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakasuprman</a> - has had a long history of trouble making and supporting trouble makers. He even posts the names he's been called on his page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bakasuprman#Names" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bakasuprman#Names" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I have just recently reported several suspected attack accounts against me engaged in sock puppeting, and vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser#Multiple_Attack_Accounts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser#Multiple_Attack_Accounts" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br />
I understand that you have a lot to do. However, if you are interested, here are a couple of action packed drama sites:</p>
<ul>

<p>I am the main author of the article and I agree with most of your comments about it. See <a href="../../../s/a/t/Talk%7ESathya_Sai_Baba_movement_Comments_4878.html" title="Talk:Sathya Sai Baba movement/Comments">Talk:Sathya Sai Baba movement/Comments</a>. Thanks. I can provide more references, though I will probably be unable to do so because <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Sathya_Sai_Baba_2_Proposed_decision_f967.html#Andries_banned" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sathya Sai Baba 2/Proposed decision">I expect that I will get banned indefinitely by the arbcom</a>, because of anti-Sathya Sai Baba "activist editing". It will be clear that I completely disagree with this because everybody can see that the article <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_movement_d8e7.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba movement">Sathya Sai Baba movement</a> is not the product of an anti-Sathya Sai Baba activist.

<dd>Can you please re-consider your assement of the article as a start class? I think it deserves a C class now. I made some significant improvements though I think that the article still suffers from the following problems
<dl>
<dd>1. Undercited, though 28 inline reference is much better than a start class. Most of the references are of excellent quality, though some are from a devotee compendium (Brian Steel's book).</dd>
<dd>2. Presence of stub sections. I admit that this is a weakness but not enough to warrant a start class.</dd>
<dd>3. Stylistically not very good. This is not my strongest point, but I think I made some important improvements, such as making longer paragraphs. Rewording of several consecutive paragraphs that start with "He.. ".</dd>
<dd>4. Structuring should be better. I am thinking about it how to do it.</dd>
<dd>5. The article possibly still contains a few personal interpretations of the teachings, though I removed several statements possibly containg personal interpretations/original research for which I could not find citations in the literature</dd>
</dl>

<p>Since Wikiproject:Biography has been a little rudderless in the last few weeks, I've been trying to step up and help where I can. I really think the project needs to have a collaboration council or coordinating committee or something along those lines so it doesn't depend too much on one person. But before taking any drastic action :) I wanted to get a good discussion going with as many participants as possible, so I've started one on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Biography_4c37.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Biography">project talk page</a>.
