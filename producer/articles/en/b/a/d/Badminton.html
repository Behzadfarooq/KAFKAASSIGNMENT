<p><b>Badminton</b> is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sports.html#Racquet_.28or_racket.29_sports" title="List of sports">racket sport</a> played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. Players score points by striking a <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuttlecock.html" title="Shuttlecock">shuttlecock</a> with their rackets so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may only be struck once by each side before it passes over the net.</p>
<p>The shuttlecock is a feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently from the balls used in most racket sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drag_%28physics%29.html" title="Drag (physics)">drag</a>, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Because shuttlecock flight is strongly affected by wind, competitive badminton is always played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game.</p>
<p>Badminton is an <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_sports.html" title="Olympic sports">Olympic sport</a> with five competitive disciplines: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles, in which each pair is a man and a woman. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, strength, and speed. It is also a technical sport, requiring good <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinesiology.html" title="Kinesiology">hand-eye coordination</a> and the development of sophisticated racket skills.</p>

<p>Badminton was known in ancient times; an early form of sport played in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a> and <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Badminton came from a game called <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battledore_and_shuttlecock.html" title="Battledore and shuttlecock">battledore and shuttlecock</a>, in which two players hit a feathered shuttlecock back and forth with tiny rackets. The game was called "<a href="../../../p/o/o/Poona.html" title="Poona">Poona</a>" in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> during the 18th Century, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> Officers stationed there took the Indian version back to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> in the 1860's. The new sport was definitively launched in 1873 at the <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton_House_10ab.html" title="Badminton House">Badminton House</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucestershire.html" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> owned by the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Beaufort_c837.html" title="Duke of Beaufort">Duke of Beaufort</a>. During that time, the game was referred to as "The Game of Badminton," and, the game's official name became Badminton.<sup id="_ref-USM_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USM" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Until 1887 the sport was played in England under the rules that prevailed in India. The Bath Badminton Club standardized the rules and made the game applicable to English ideas. The basic regulations were drawn up in 1887.<sup id="_ref-USM_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USM" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, in 1893, the Badminton Association of England published the first set of rules according to these regulations, similar to that of today, and officially launched badminton in a house called "Dunbar" at 6 Waverley Grove, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, England on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a> of that year.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> They also started the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_England_Open_Badminton_Championships_22bf.html" title="All England Open Badminton Championships">All England Open Badminton Championships</a>, the first badminton competition in the world, in 1899.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton_World_Federation_49d8.html" title="Badminton World Federation">Badminton World Federation</a> (BWF) was established in 1934 with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, England, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> as its founding members.

Badminton court, isometric view</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are almost always marked for both singles and doubles play, although the laws permit a court to be marked for singles only. The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but the doubles service court is shorter than the singles service court.</p>
<p>The full width of the court is 6.1 metres, and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18 metres. The full length of the court is 13.4 metres. The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98 metres from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.78 metres from the back boundary.</p>
<p>The net is 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 inch) high at the edges and 1.524 metres (5 ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles side lines, even when singles is played.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there is no mention in the Laws of a minimum height for the ceiling above the court. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Equipment laws">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Equipment laws</span></h3>
<p>The Laws specify which equipment may be used. In particular, the Laws restrict the design and size of rackets and shuttlecocks. The Laws also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>3.1&#160;</dt>
<dd>To test a shuttlecock, use a full underhand stroke which makes contact with the shuttlecock over the back boundary line. The shuttlecock shall be hit at an upward angle and in a direction parallel to the side lines.</dd>
<dt>3.2&#160;</dt>
<dd>A shuttlecock of the correct speed will land not less than 530 mm and not more than 990 mm short of the other back boundary line....</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Scoring system and service">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scoring system and service</span></h3>
<p>The scoring system changed in May 2006. For more information, see <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scoring_System_Development_of_Badminton_d57f.html" title="Scoring System Development of Badminton">Scoring System Development of Badminton</a>.</p>
<p><a name="The_basics" id="The_basics"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: The basics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The basics</span></h4>
<p>Each game is played up to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally (this differs from the old system, where players could only win a point on their serve). A match is the best of three games.</p>
<p>At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite <i>service courts</i> (see <a href="#Playing_court_dimensions" title="">court dimensions</a>). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar to <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a>, except that a badminton serve must be hit from below the waist in underhand form (upwards), the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, and in tennis the players stand outside their service courts.</p>
<p>In singles, the server stands in his right service court when his score is even, and in his left service court when his score is odd.</p>
<p>In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he changes service courts so that he serves to each opponent in turn. When the serving side loses a rally, the serve passes to their opponents (unlike the old system, there is no "second serve"). If their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally.</p>
<p>A consequence of this system is that, each time a side regain the service, the server will be the player who did <i>not</i> serve last time.</p>
<p><a name="Details" id="Details"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Details">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Details</span></h4>
<p>If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two point lead (such as 24-22), up to a maximum of 30 points (30-29 is a winning score).</p>
<p>At the start of a match a coin is tossed. The winners of the coin toss may choose whether to serve or receive first, or they may choose which end of the court they wish to occupy. Their opponents make the remaining choice. In less formal settings, the coin toss is often replaced by hitting a shuttlecock into the air: whichever side it points to serves first.</p>
<p>In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading pair's score reaches 11 points.</p>
<p>The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not unsight the opposing server or receiver.</p>
<p><a name="Faults" id="Faults"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Faults">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Faults</span></h3>
<p>Players win a rally by striking the shuttlecock onto the floor within the boundaries of their opponents' court. Players also win a rally if their opponents commit a fault. The most common fault in badminton is when the players fail to return the shuttlecock so that it passes over the net and lands inside their opponents' court, but there are also other ways that players may be faulted. The following information lists some of the more common faults.</p>
<p>Several faults pertain specifically to service. A serving player shall be faulted if he strikes the shuttlecock from above his waist (defined as his lowest rib), or if his racket is not pointing downwards at the moment of impact. This particular law changed in 2006: previously, the server's racket had to be pointing downwards to the extent that the racket head was below the hand holding the racket; now, any angle below the horizontal is acceptable.</p>
<p>Neither the server nor the receiver may lift a foot until the shuttlecock has been struck by the server. The server must also initially hit the base (cork) of the shuttlecock, although he may afterwards also hit the feathers as part of the same stroke. This law was introduced to ban an extremely effective service style known as the <i>S-serve</i> or <i>Sidek serve</i>, which allowed the server to make the shuttlecock spin chaotically in flight.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes back over the net; but during a single stroke movement, a player may contact a shuttlecock twice (this happens in some sliced shots). A player may not, however, hit the shuttlecock once and then hit it with a new movement, nor may he carry and sling the shuttlecock on his racket.</p>
<p>It is a fault if the shuttlecock hits the ceiling.</p>
<p><a name="Lets" id="Lets"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Lets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lets</span></h3>
<p>If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur due to some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on court (having been hit there by players on an adjacent court).</p>
<p>If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet if the receiver makes any attempt to return the shuttlecock, he shall be judged to have been ready.</p>
<p>There is no let if the shuttlecock hits the tape (even on service).</p>

<p>Badminton <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racquet.html" title="Racquet">rackets</a> are light, with top quality rackets weighing between about 70 and 100 grams (without strings). <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> They are composed of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_fiber_composite.html" title="Carbon fiber composite">carbon fibre composite</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphite_reinforced_plastic.html" title="Graphite reinforced plastic">graphite reinforced plastic</a>), which may be augmented by a variety of materials. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_fiber.html" title="Carbon fiber">Carbon fibre</a> has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_energy.html" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, rackets were made of light metals such as aluminium. Earlier still, rackets were made of wood. Cheap rackets are still often made of metal, but wooden rackets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, due to their excessive weight and cost.</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of racket designs, although the racket size and shape are limited by the Laws. Different rackets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an isometric head shape is increasingly common in new rackets.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Strings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strings</span></h3>
<p>Badminton strings are thin, with high performing strings in the range of about 0.65 to 0.73 millimetres thickness. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 18 to 36 <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound-force.html" title="Pound-force">lbf</a> (80 to 130 <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton.html" title="Newton">newtons</a>). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 18 and 25 lbf. Professionals string between about 25 and 36 lbf.</p>
<p>It is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension stringbed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player:<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> the faster and more accurately he can swing his racket, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment. Playing at high string tensions can cause injury, depending on the player's ability: few amateur players can safely play above 30 lbf, and for most players even 25 lbf is too high.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Grip">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Grip</span></h3>
<p>The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of his racket handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.</p>
<p>Players may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyurethane.html" title="Polyurethane">PU</a> synthetic grips or toweling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, or sweatbands may be used, or the player may choose another grip material or change his grip more frequently.</p>
<p>There are two main types of grip: <i>replacement</i> grips and <i>overgrips</i>. Replacement grips are thicker, and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Toweling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.</p>

For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes. Players should also ensure that they learn safe footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges.</p>

<p>Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either <i>forehand</i> or <i>backhand</i> (except for the high serve, which is only ever played as a forehand). A player's forehand side is the same side as his playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is his right side and the backhand side is his left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rearcourt, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a <i>round-the-head</i> forehand overhead (a forehand "on the backhand side") rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn his back to his opponents, restricting his view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The <i>backhand clear</i> is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court. For the same reason, <i>backhand smashes</i> tend to be weak.</p>
<p>The choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, and whether it is above net height: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. <b>In the forecourt</b>, a high shuttlecock will be met with a <i>net kill</i>, hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. <b>In the midcourt</b>, a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful <i>smash</i>, also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic <i>jump smashes</i>, where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. <b>In the rearcourt</b>, players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This <i>overhead</i> hitting allows them to play smashes, <i>clears</i> (hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents' court), and dropshots (hitting the shuttlecock so that it falls softly downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.</p>
<p><b>When the shuttlecock is well below net height</b>, players have no choice but to hit upwards. <i>Lifts</i>, where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents' court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, his only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt this is called a <i>netshot</i>; in the midcourt or rearcourt, it is often called a <i>push</i> or <i>block</i>.</p>
<p><b>When the shuttlecock is near to net height</b>, players can hit <i>drives</i>, which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rearcourt. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.</p>
<p><b>When defending against a smash</b>, players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes, but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides, because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body.</p>
<p><b>The service</b> presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a>, the serve is restricted by <a href="#Laws_of_the_game" title="">the Laws</a> so that it must be hit upwards. The server can choose a <i>low serve</i> into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat <i>drive serve</i>. Lifted serves may be either <i>high serves</i>, where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or <i>flick serves</i>, where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.</p>
<p>Once players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either he is tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or he is forced to delay his movement until he actually sees the shuttle's direction. "Deception" in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, he will often lose the point immediately because he cannot change his direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay his movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player will move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.</p>
<p><i>Slicing</i> and using a <i>shortened hitting action</i> are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racket face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel much slower than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt <i>sliced dropshot</i> will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create <i>spinning netshots</i> (also called <i>tumbling netshots</i>), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilising; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning netshot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning netshots are especially important for high level singles players.</p>
<p>The lightness of modern rackets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold his racket ready for a netshot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift. This makes the opponent's task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when he has no time for a big arm swing. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as <i>finger power</i>. Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a 10 cm racket swing.</p>
<p>It is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rearcourt (for example, dropshots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as netshots).</p>
<p>Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use <i>double motion</i>, where they make an initial racket movement in one direction before withdrawing the racket to hit in another direction. This is typically used to suggest a crosscourt angle but then play the stroke straight, or vice-versa. <i>Triple motion</i> is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a <i>racket head fake</i>, where the initial motion is continued but the racket is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction, but does not require as much time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Strategy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategy</span></h2>
<p>To win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a netshot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the netshot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.</p>
<p>Deception is also important. Expert players make the preparation for many different strokes look identical, and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change his body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Doubles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Doubles</span></h3>
<p>Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, hitting downwards as much as possible. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rearcourt, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rearcourt attacker plays a dropshot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes.</p>
<p>At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves almost never appear in professional games. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.</p>
<p>At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles is the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Singles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Singles</span></h3>
<p>The singles court is narrower than the doubles court, but the same length. Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with dropshots and netshots. Smashing is less prominent in singles than in doubles because players are rarely in the ideal position to execute a smash, and smashing often leaves the smasher vulnerable if the smash is returned.</p>
<p>In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Flick serves are less common, and drive serves are rare.</p>
<p>At high levels of play, singles demands extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional maneuvering, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Mixed doubles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mixed doubles</span></h3>
<p>In mixed doubles, both pairs try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are substantially stronger, and can therefore produce more powerful smashes. As a result, mixed doubles requires greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the rearcourt, and will happily do so if required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front.</p>

The competitions take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudirman_Cup_b8a5.html" title="Sudirman Cup">Sudirman Cup</a>, a mixed team event held once every two years, began in 1989. It is divided into seven groups based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament, a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men's doubles and singles, women's doubles and singles, and mixed doubles). Like <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">soccer</a>, it features a promotion and relegation system in every group.</p>
<p>Individual competition in badminton was a demonstration event in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_Summer_Olympics_d29a.html" title="1972 Summer Olympics">1972</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_Summer_Olympics_e1dd.html" title="1988 Summer Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a>. It became a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Olympic_Games_b216.html" title="Summer Olympic Games">Summer Olympics</a> sport at the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_Summer_Olympics_aeba.html" title="1992 Summer Olympics">Barcelona Olympics</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton_at_the_1992_Summer_Olympics_3f98.html" title="Badminton at the 1992 Summer Olympics">1992</a>. The 32 highest ranked badminton players in the world participate in the competition, and each country submitting three players to take part. In the <a href="../../../b/w/f/BWF_World_Championships_79c2.html" title="BWF World Championships">BWF World Championships</a>, only the highest ranked 64 players in the world, and a maximum of three from each country, can participate in any category.</p>
<p>All these tournaments, along with the BWF World Junior Championships, are level one tournaments.</p>
<p>At the start of 2007, the BWF also introduce a new tournament structure: the <a href="../../../b/w/f/BWF_Super_Series_0840.html" title="BWF Super Series">BWF Super Series</a>. This level two tournament will stage twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Final held at the year end.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Level three tournaments will consist of Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix. Top players can collect the world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments. These include the regional competitions in Asia (<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Badminton_Championships_9e66.html" title="Asian Badminton Championships">Asian Badminton Championships</a>) and Europe (<a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Badminton_Championships_a982.html" title="European Badminton Championships">European Badminton Championships</a>), which produce the world's best players as well as the Pan America Badminton Championships.</p>
<p>The level four tournaments, known as International Challenge, International Series and Future Series, encourages participation by junior players.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>The most powerful stroke in badminton is the smash, which is hit steeply downwards into the opponents' midcourt. The maximum speed of a smashed shuttlecock exceeds that of any other racket sport projectile. The recordings of this speed measure the initial speed of the shuttlecock immediately after it has left the player's racket.</p>
<p>Men's doubles player <a href="../../../f/u/_/Fu_Haifeng_a06e.html" title="Fu Haifeng">Fu Haifeng</a> of China set the official world smash record of 332 km/h (206 mph) on June 3, 2005 in the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudirman_Cup_b8a5.html" title="Sudirman Cup">Sudirman Cup</a>. The fastest smash recorded in the singles competition was 298 km/h (185 mph) by <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Jonassen_6905.html" title="Kenneth Jonassen">Kenneth Jonassen</a> of Denmark.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Comparisons with other racket sports">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Comparisons with other racket sports</span></h2>
<p>Badminton is frequently compared to <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a>. The following is a list of uncontentious comparisons:</p>
<ul>
<li>In tennis, the ball may bounce once before the player hits it; in badminton, the rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the floor.</li>
<li>In tennis, the serve is dominant to the extent that the server is expected to win most of his service games; a <i>break</i> of service, where the server loses the game, is of major importance in a match. In badminton, however, the serving side and receiving side have approximately equal opportunity to win the rally.</li>
<li>In tennis, the server is allowed two attempts to make a correct serve; in badminton, the server is allowed only one attempt.</li>
<li>In tennis, a let is played on service if the ball hits the net tape; in badminton, there is no let on service.</li>
<li>The tennis court is larger than the badminton court.</li>
<li>Tennis rackets are much heavier than badminton rackets, which may weigh as little as 75 grams. Tennis balls are also heavier than shuttlecocks.</li>
<li>The fastest recorded tennis stroke is <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Roddick_b34a.html" title="Andy Roddick">Andy Roddick</a>'s 153 mph serve;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[16]</a></sup> the fastest recorded badminton stroke is <a href="../../../f/u/_/Fu_Haifeng_a06e.html" title="Fu Haifeng">Fu Haifeng</a>'s 206 mph smash.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[17]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Comparisons of speed and athletic requirements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Comparisons of speed and athletic requirements</span></h3>
<p>Statistics such as the 206 mph smash speed, below, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racket sport.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup> Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racket sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve. Badminton's claim as the fastest racket sport might also be based on reaction time requirements, but arguably <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_tennis.html" title="Table tennis">table tennis</a> requires even faster reaction times.</p>
<p>There is a strong case for arguing that badminton is more physically demanding than tennis, but such comparisons are difficult to make objectively due to the differing demands of the games. Some informal studies suggest that badminton players require much greater aerobic stamina than tennis players, but this has not been the subject of rigorous research.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>A more balanced approach might suggest the following comparisons, although these also are subject to dispute:</p>
<ul>
<li>Badminton, especially singles, requires substantially greater aerobic stamina than tennis; the level of aerobic stamina required by badminton singles is similar to <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squash_%28sport%29.html" title="Squash (sport)">squash</a> singles, although squash may have slightly higher aerobic requirements.</li>
<li>Tennis requires greater upper body strength than badminton.</li>
<li>Badminton requires greater leg strength than tennis, and badminton men's doubles probably requires greater leg strength than any other racket sport due to the demands of performing multiple consecutive jumping smashes.</li>
<li>Badminton requires much greater explosive athleticism than tennis and somewhat greater than squash, with players required to jump for height or distance.</li>
<li>Badminton requires significantly faster reaction times than either tennis or squash, although table tennis may require even faster reaction times. The fastest reactions in badminton are required in men's doubles, when returning a powerful smash.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Comparisons of technique">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Comparisons of technique</span></h3>
<p>Badminton and tennis techniques differ substantially. The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton rackets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racket swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than 10cm. For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racket swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.</p>
<p>It is often asserted that power in badminton strokes comes mainly from the wrist. This is a misconception and may be criticised for two reasons. First, it is strictly speaking a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category_error.html" title="Category error">category error</a>: the wrist is a joint, not a muscle; its movement is controlled by the forearm muscles. Second, wrist movements are weak when compared to forearm or upper arm movements. Badminton <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biomechanics.html" title="Biomechanics">biomechanics</a> have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation, and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[20]</a></sup> Modern coaching resources such as the <i>Badminton England Technique DVD</i> reflect these ideas by emphasising forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Distinctive characteristics of the shuttlecock">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Distinctive characteristics of the shuttlecock</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuttlecock.html" title="Shuttlecock">shuttlecock</a> differs greatly from the balls used in most other <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racket_sport.html" title="Racket sport">racket sports</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Aerodynamic_drag_and_stability" id="Aerodynamic_drag_and_stability"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Aerodynamic drag and stability">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aerodynamic drag and stability</span></h4>
<p>The feathers impart substantial drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance. The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable: regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork-first, and remain in the cork-first orientation.</p>
<p>One consequence of the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires considerable skill to hit it the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racket sports. The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted (<i>lobbed</i>) shuttlecock: the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parabola.html" title="Parabola">parabola</a> of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises. With very high serves, the shuttlecock may even fall vertically.</p>
<p><a name="Spin" id="Spin"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Edit section: Spin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spin</span></h4>
<p>Balls may be spun to alter their bounce (for example, topspin and backspin in tennis), and players may slice the ball (strike it with an angled racket face) to produce such spin; but, since the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, this does not apply to badminton.</p>
<p>Slicing the shuttlecock so that it spins, however, does have applications, and some are peculiar to badminton. (See <a href="#Basic_Strokes" title="">Basic strokes</a> for an explanation of technical terms.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction from the direction suggested by the player's racket or body movement. This is used to deceive opponents.</li>
<li>Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly curved path (as seen from above), and the deceleration imparted by the spin causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path. This can be used to create dropshots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass the net.</li>
<li>When playing a netshot, slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a <i>spinning netshot</i> or <i>tumbling netshot</i>. The opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the way that its feathers overlap, a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry. The spin is in an anticlockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock. This natural spin affects certain strokes: a tumbling netshot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left, rather than from left to right.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
