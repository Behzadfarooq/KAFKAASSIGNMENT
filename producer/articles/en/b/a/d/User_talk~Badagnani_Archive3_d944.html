<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadagnani_Archive3_d944.html" title="Edit section: Wolfberry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wolfberry</span></h2>
<p>--Paul144 17:17, 1 July 2006 (UTC) -- I have added a number of points to the Discussion page. Thanks for leading me there.</p>
<p>--Paul144 15:13, 1 July 2006 (UTC) -- Thanks for your editing of the wolfberry file. I call the berries "oblong". Good teamwork, with appreciation.</p>
<p>28-Jun-06 I have a significant amount of new information provided in a book just published on the wolfberry, and have been trying to update the Wikipedia file. You seem to be deleting each entry I make. So I would like to know what I can do to assure you my information is objective, accurate and worthy of being published on Wikipedia. paul144, a PhD scientist.</p>
<p>29-Jun-06 "Restore deleted text" is the message left by you after today's attempt to improve the wolfberry file. I avoided any changes in Chinese as you requested.</p>
<p>Here are point-by-point comments on why I made changes.</p>
<p>1. Wolfberry is also another name for the western snowberry, Symphoricarpos occidentalis.</p>
<pre>
   Goji is also short for Gojira (Godzilla), a popular film series in Japan. 
</pre>
<p>Neither of these statements is useful but rather misleading and over-weighted in importance by a) the traditional name of "wolfberry" for Lycium barbarum and b) the vernacular use in English of goji for gouqizi.</p>
<p>2. Wolfberry is also known pharmacologically as Lycii Fructus (lycium fruit). In Japan it is known as kuko (クコ), in Korea it is known as gugija.</p>
<p>There is no need to "pharmacologically" define wolfberry as Lycii fructus. That is an unofficial designation. Most pharmacologists studying wolfberry use its common name or L. barbarum.</p>
<p>My references say that the Japanese name is kukoshi and Korean is kuguchi. These make sense based on the Chinese origin and similarities in derivation.</p>
<p>3. The name Tibetan Goji berry is in common use in the health food market for berries from this plant that are claimed to have been grown in the Himalaya region. The etymological origin of "goji" is unclear but it is likely a simplified spelling of gǒuqǐ.</p>
<p>The Tibetan myth needs to be dispelled as there is no credible fact behind it. The origin of "goji" is easy as it comes from the Mandarin "gouqizi".</p>
<p>4. The round, red berries are very tender and must be shaken from the vine rather than picked in order to avoid spoiling. The fruits are preserved by slowly drying them in the shade.</p>
<p>I know wolfberry farmers in China who state that the berries are carefully picked by hand. It would be an extremely slow process to rely on shaking to retrieve the berries, although this may be done sometimes after cool nights in late harvest when it is faster to get berries into the baskets.</p>
<p>The berries are dried for shipping usually in the sun and sometimes in barns.</p>
<p>These are examples of updates needed for accuracy in this definition. I am being collegial going through this explanation with you but you are not cooperating or helping with edits of your own, as requested on the Wikipedia dispute pages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Resolving_disputes" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Resolving_disputes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Resolving_disputes</a></p>
<p>Please either explain yourself or leave my edits as they are. I have invested months of research on this berry, have revised the wolfberry file many times this week -- all reversed by you with little or no comment -- and would like to make a useful contribution that currently is being frustrated by your deletions without explanation.</p>
<p>Paul144</p>
<p>--Paul144 23:02, 30 June 2006 (UTC)I have added a section today on the nutritional content of wolfberries under the <b>Medicinal Use</b> subheading. Please have a look at it and let me know if clarification, further editing, etc. are needed. Thanks.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing incorrect or inappropriate about the statement that (e.g.) an oboe behaves like a conical pipe. The statement that it has an approximately conical bore is correct, but less precise and less meaningful. Compare for example this statement from Nederveen's book <i>Acoustical Aspects of Woodwind Instruments</i>: "Finally there exist conical flutes, open at both ends, which are blown at the widest end of the cone. This type of instrument will appear to behave in almost the same way as the cylindrical tube of the same length." Note, for instance, that Nederveen does not seem to think he is required to use the word "bore", and that he talks about what sort of tube such a flute <i>behaves like</i> -- in contrast to what shape the flute <i>is</i>. -- <a href="../../../r/s/h/User%7ERsholmes_de0b.html" title="User:Rsholmes">Rsholmes</a> 00:31, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi, i noticed that you have contributed a lot to korean musical instruments and culture articles. at <a href="../../../k/o/r/Portal%7EKorea_abaf.html" title="Portal:Korea">Portal:Korea</a>, i've put up an photo of <i>madang nori</i>, a type of pungmul performance. would you be interested in writing a brief caption for the portal? it would be fantastic if you could also beef up &amp; cross-link the articles i listed as a caption place-holder, possibly even creating a madang nori article. i'd be very grateful if you could just fix the caption at <a href="../../../k/o/r/Portal%7EKorea_Selected_picture_3c7c.html" title="Portal:Korea/Selected picture">Portal:Korea/Selected picture</a> though. thanks. Appleby 05:25, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>thank you very much for your help. if you don't want to actually write the caption there, i'll get around to it soon with the info you provided. Appleby 16:30, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>what do you think of the current caption? i've kept it brief to minimize the chances of saying something stupid&#160;:-) Appleby 17:14, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>thanks for your additional comments. my vague understanding of samul nori was more of a sit-down performance, not really involving the streamer hats and dancing, but what do i know. please feel free to go ahead &amp; correct the current version any time if not accurate. thanks again!

<p>It's my pleasure. Actually for transliterating Hangul, the rules are a little different with the widely-used <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean_2b44.html" title="Revised Romanization of Korean">Revised Romanization of Korean</a> and the older and not as used <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCune-Reischauer_8368.html" title="McCune-Reischauer">McCune-Reischauer</a> transliteration method. With the MR method, the "ㅊ" consonant is transliterated as "ch' " (apostrophe for aspiration) while the RR does it "ch" (the aspiration remains, but it's been cut out for RR). The "j" sound is usually used for "ㅈ" consonants, but there a lots of little exceptions (it's really a bit confusing actually), but this is the basic jist of it. Happy wiki-ing&#160;:) -<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkurix_1622.html" title="User:Merkurix">Merkurix</a> 18:11, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Correction noted; you are correct. There is a hyphenation after the second syllable, in which case the second syllable begins with 'k'. This is according to Minjung's Korean-English dictionary 5th edition. -<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkurix_1622.html" title="User:Merkurix">Merkurix</a> 18:18, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi again. The "ㅈ" consonant can be either "ch" or "j" depending on which syllable it is. If it is the first syllable of a word, (according to the MR rules), it would then be TLed into "ch" (but only if it is the first syllable). Otherwise, it's TLed as "j". <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkurix_1622.html" title="User:Merkurix">Merkurix</a> 18:28, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let's discuss a bit more the idea that Homer Simpson's <i>d'oh</i> ryhymes with <i>phở</i>. You said in your Edit Summary that Homer produces an [o] sound whereas &lt;phở&gt; has the same sound as the &lt;u&gt; in &lt;but&gt;, that is the sound of [ʌ]. Actually, I don't think this is correct. The &lt;ở&gt; represents [ɤ] which is like an [o] sound but with unrounded lips. In IPA terms, [ɤ] is a close-mid, back, unrounded vowel, whereas [ʌ] is an open-mid, back, unrounded vowel. Homer's <i>d'oh</i> has the additional value in that its sound follows the tone contour of the "dipping-rising" of the vowel in &lt;phở&gt;. What's your take on this? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Interlingua_69c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Interlingua">email</a></sup> 23:37, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, but I had to change your initial statement again, because it just isn't accurate. Although the low notes are often the most prominent (from the audience's perspective), and the da caccia does indeed them easier to play and blend with the rest of the orchestra, the middle and upper registers are important, too. The middle and upper register intonation on the da caccia is much improved over the standard tenor oboe, also the response. That's why I think it's more correct to say that the whole instrument is "technically more secure", not just the low register, and I say this from practical experience. --<a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrodersen_b5b3.html" title="User:Cbrodersen">Cbrodersen</a> 15:15, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but in response to <i>your</i> response, I stand by my statement that the whole instrument is "technically more secure", not just the low register. As for the curvature, it could be argued that the curve actually makes the instrument <i>harder</i> to play (I tend to struggle with holding it, just like the guy shown in the photo). What probably accounts for the better response and intonation is (believe it or not) the large flared bell. The taille with its narrower bell is, in comparison, rather stuffy, and this is what makes it less effective in the orchestra. BTW, the text needs to be corrected to show that the two original da caccias are in two different museums (Stockholm and Copenhagen). I was going on memory from over thirty years ago, and it was my mistake. I'm not sure why the correction didn't take effect. Thanks. --<a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrodersen_b5b3.html" title="User:Cbrodersen">Cbrodersen</a> 15:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Did you get all of the info off of Sea Gypsies? I couldn't tell by a quick glance. I was putting this together for the merge discussion, when you merged. So here it is.</p>
<ul>
<li>The term<b>Sea Gypsies</b> in SE Asia can refer to the semi-nomadic boat people of the Malayic language group which live on the West Coast of Thailand from Ranong Province up to the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mergui_Archipelago_a0be.html" title="Mergui Archipelago">Mergui Archipelago</a> of Myanmar (Burma). It can also be used to include other peoples of some similar habits such as the Riau Orang Laut and the Bajau as far east as the Phillipines. (Orang is the Malay word for "man" or "people".) <b>Selung</b> or <b>Salone</b> or '<b>Chalome</b> is the Burmese name for the <i>sea gypsies</i>. In Malay while <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orang_Laut_529e.html" title="Orang Laut">Orang Laut</a> (sea people) might seem to be the term for the <i>sea gypsies</i>, it is not, rather it refers specifically to an unrelated group in the <a href="../../../r/i/a/Riau_Islands_f8a0.html" title="Riau Islands">Riau Islands</a> of Indonesia, or more broadly to "numerous tribes and status groups inhabiting the islands and estuaries in the Riau-Lingga Archipelagos, the Pulau Tujuh Islands, the Batam Archipelago, and the coasts and offshore islands of eastern Sumatra and southern Malay Peninsula."<a href="http://www.bartelby.net/67/837.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartelby.net/67/837.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Other Malay terms for these <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orang_Laut_529e.html" title="Orang Laut">Orang Laut</a> were Celates or Orang Selat (straits people). In Thailand the <i>sea gypsies</i> are often called Chao Ley (people of the sea) or Chao nam (people of the water). Acculturated <i>sea gypsies</i> are called Thai Mai (new Thais).</li>
</ul>
<p>Moken (sometimes spelled Mawken or Morgan) is one of the four subdivisions of a proto-Malay (Austronesian) population: Moken (Mawken), Moklen (Moklem), Orang Sireh (Betel-leaf people) and Orang Lanta. The last, the Orang Lanta are a hybridized group formed when the Malay people settled the Lanta islands where the proto-Malay Orang Sireh had been living. The Moken are the least linguistically and ethnically dilute. The Moklen have had a heavy Thai and Mon-Khmer influence. The Urak Lawoi (Urak Lawoy) although sometimes included with the Moken are actually a Malay people (lighter skinned) speaking a Para-Malay dialect (as opposed to a proto-Malay dialect) who have acquired some of the characteristics of the Selung.<a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=urk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=urk" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><a href="http://www.iucn.org/themes/ceesp/WAMIP/Urak%20Lawoi%20pamphlet.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iucn.org/themes/ceesp/WAMIP/Urak%20Lawoi%20pamphlet.doc" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> The Urak Lawoi have also been heavily influenced by Thai. Two other peoples to the east in Malaysia, the Duano' (Orang Kuala) and the Orang Seletar are sometimes included as <i>sea gypies</i>. But the Duano' speak a Para-Malay language and the proto-Malay language of the Orang Seletar is not closely related to Moken or Moklen, nor is their material culture.

<p>Hey, there, thanks for your contributions to the jessie mae hemphill article.

Also, the historian who wrote in an encyclopedia that she was born in 1933 and researched that for a passport (David Evans) says that for the headstone and funeral program it will say 1923, due to new information just learned. However, we are a secondary source, so until I find a published primary source to point to that info instead of my independent research conversation, I will leave it as is, since the 1933 is the most well researched date that's published (written by the same historian). I'm sure that there will be published sources showing the 1923 date later and then we can update it since it's brand new info.

<p>Working on another detail I hope to nail down very soon regarding the Behind the Magnolia Curtain sessions. Trying to make sure I didn't overstate David Evans' involvement in putting the little drum corps together. He helped get them there but I'm just double-checking who put the little drum corps together.

<p>Hi, Badagnani. Good question about Kan Ishii's music, and it stumps me. A quick search turns up pretty much nothing... It seems like I heard the <i>Symphonia Ainu</i> years and years ago. As I recall, it was fairly pleasant late-romantic nationalism with a Japanese/Ainu tinge. Unfortunately, a search of Amazon, both US and Japan turns up no recordings of this work. Japanese Amazon has a few CDs of his music, including this one: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00028G4MS/250-0523213-4133852?v=glance&amp;n=561956&amp;s=classical" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00028G4MS/250-0523213-4133852?v=glance&amp;n=561956&amp;s=classical" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>He wrote the soundtrack to the sci-fi film <i><a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorath.html" title="Gorath">Gorath</a></i>: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00005EKMM/250-0523213-4133852?v=glance&amp;n=561956&amp;s=gateway" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00005EKMM/250-0523213-4133852?v=glance&amp;n=561956&amp;s=gateway" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> but that appears to be out of print even in Japan... There have been rumors that the Japanese-language version of this film may be released on DVD in the states eventually.</p>
<p>The local library has three arrangements of Japanese folk songs by him: <a href="http://catalog2.lapl.org/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?resultsScreen+4986+1+4+0" class="external autonumber" title="http://catalog2.lapl.org/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?resultsScreen+4986+1+4+0" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Again, it seems like I heard one of these back in my days as a theory/composition student, decades ago, but I can't find a recording out there now.

<p>I'm fine with changing all references of yellow liquor to Huangjiu, because like yo said, not all huangjiu is yellow. Most chinese wines and "brewed-out" as a clear colourless liquid, but addition of chinese medicines can alter the colour. I've also found out recently that caramel colouring is often used the change the tone of otherwise clear chinese wines. Huangjiu is used as an umbrella term for all fermented wines with colours ranging from clear to dark reddish-brown. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 05:32, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, red starter is also used as well as caramel, but I'm not sure how modern a technique the latter (or former) actually is. According to <a href="http://www.sxwo.com/chinese/process/yuanmingqing.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sxwo.com/chinese/process/yuanmingqing.htm" rel="nofollow">this site</a> carmel (糖色) is added as the "dry" huangjiu is filtred (the first diagram, near the bottom). Red starter (红曲) is added in the "sweet" huangjiu prior and during the wine fortification (second diagram, near the middle). <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 05:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

The species lists I was using all had them, so it was easy to add them. Also I'm more inclined to add them for genera where it will be a long time (if ever!) before the individual species get their own pages; for a geuns where species mostly have their own page, then the authority is on that and needn't be duplicated on the genus page - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 01:08, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, my fault. Kokang should be listed under "Chinese". I think we should also add languages unrecognised by the government, like Rohingya (widely considered a variant of Bengali), and Chinese dialects like Hokkien. Also, we should mention the inaccuracy of government classification. According to a Burmese exile publication <i>The New Era Journal</i> (<i>Kyit Pyaing</i>), there are 67 races, with many clans of ethnic groups listed separately. --<a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHintha_01a1.html" title="User:Hintha">Hintha</a> 03:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, when adding mr to the articles, I usually just go by the table at <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCune-Reischauer_8368.html" title="McCune-Reischauer">McCune-Reischauer</a>, since the "real" romanizations are pretty much impossible to figure out and unagreed upon.

Going by a google search, I'd probably actually change the article's title to <a href="../../../t/a/e/Taegum.html" title="Taegum">Taegum</a> and the mr to <a href="../../../t/a/e/Taeg%C5%ADm.html" title="Taegŭm">Taegŭm</a>, since those seem to be the most widely used romanizations in an English language context. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 10:09, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cyanobacteria is plural, and cyanobacterium singular. Given that the name is referring to the vegetable that is being cooked, "Fat choy is a colony of cyanobacteria" is probably the most correct. Although that sounds kind of strange in the context of the sentence. The way it is worded now is pretty much correct, although a single cyanobacterium wouldn't be considered fat choy, because you couldn't really eat it. Millifolium</p>

<p>Hi Badagnani - I re-worded it as "healthful" is a US neologism, not or only very rarely used in other forms of English (see e.g. <a href="http://www.dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=36263&amp;dict=CALD" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=36263&amp;dict=CALD" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, <a href="http://www.antimoon.com/forum/2004/4557.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antimoon.com/forum/2004/4557.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>), so not very appropriate on an Indian English page - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 22:54, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Checked up in the OED; somewhat to my surprise, it does actually have a long English pedigree (first used by Wyclif in 1382!), yet despite this it remains a very rarely used word at least in modern UK English.

<p>You misinterpret my comment. In many ways my intention was to be a "check" on the chemical accuracy of what James says. I agree that a lot of what James makes sense, in spirit. A lot of it. I wouldn't have sent that reference to him recently if I didn't believe it made sense. I have agreed with him multiple times that uranium trioxide does have the vapor pressure the article says it does, which is consistent. And it make sense thermodynamically that UO3(g) would be the most stable of the gaseous oxides, which is bound to be formed during combustion. On the other hand, hobbling all that together doesn't make the statement that "UO3 is a gas formed form the combustion of uraninum" a valid statement, and James is known to be pushing a POV, which I do detest. I think I've done more to encourage conversation on that talk page than even James has in the last few months (my interpretation, open for debate). (Although I think it would be better if he went by the arguement that suspended liquid/solids in air is what's being breathed in.)</p>
<p>But to be honest, it's just not a productive use of my time any more. I'm tired of the back and forth of fragemented material and his trying to put together an arguement. It's too much like original research. I'm tired of his "the article doesn't say that UO3 is not the gas so it must be UO3" arguments. He needs to provide a clear source.
