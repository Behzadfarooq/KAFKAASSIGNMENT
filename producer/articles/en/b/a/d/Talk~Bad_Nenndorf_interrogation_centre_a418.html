<p>Some contributors of the German and English page do not read the sources adequately. In no one of the sources (Guardien nor Die Zeit) the internment camp of Bad Nenndorf was named concentration camp. This is absolutely wrong and POV. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlV_6a40.html" title="User:KarlV">KarlV</a> 14:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>KarlV, I am not sure what your particular concerns are. You have claimed inaccuracy and POV, and have chosen to frame your concern in terms that could be interpreted as a personal attack on fellow editors, but you have given no justification for your claims. This and your 3RR violation make you less likely to be taken seriously.</dd>
<dd>As for the content of your edit, I can only emphasise once again that the prison at Bad Nenndorf meets all the formal criteria of a concentration camp, even if the sources do not use that particular word: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Concentration_camp</a></dd>

<dd>First of all I think that I am complying with the formal criteria of the article <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internment_camp.html" title="Internment camp">Internment camp</a>. And your mentioned article is, instead of that I have mentioned without good sources (see e.g. definition). Secondly, what is that, there are good sources, no one of them is talking about <i>concentration camps</i> but because of a definition, which IMHO seems to be POV, you want to tell me, that, even the sources do not use that particular word, it meets formal criterias? Criterias which are not proved? So, you want to tell me, that we do not need sources? Third - no, I do not want to bring in an error in this article, but, there was a German User (who was now suspended because of vandalism, plese be so kind an inform yourself), who wants that the British Internment camp is called concentration camp, which is simply wrong (see the sources and the formal criteria of the article internment camp). See what happened with the German article and the User. So I want to bring an error out of this artcle and nothing else.

<dd>From the very article you referenced: "The term concentration camp lost its original relatively innocent meaning after Nazi concentration camps were discovered, and has ever since been understood to refer to a place of mistreatment, starvation, forced labour, and murder. The expression since then has only been used in this extremely pejorative sense; no government or organization has used it to describe its own facilities, using instead terms such as internment camp, resettlement camp, detention facility, etc." As mistreatment, starvation etc. took place at this location, it very well fits the definition of concentration camp. Also, it gives the reason that official sources would not use that term, (no government will use it, even if it is correct). This is quite clear. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia should use the most common term the sources use, and I only see "internment" in the sources listed. Does anyone have a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source</a> that calls Bad Nenndorf a "concentration" camp? <a href="../../../h/g/b/User%7EHGB_8569.html" title="User:HGB">HGB</a> 21:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, no government calls anything a concentration camp, even when it fits the definition. Its too much a charged word. Should we bow to their cowardice and POV? What I'm saying here, is that we shouldn't be replicating the bias of sources. That does no good for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"As one minister of the day wrote, as few people as possible should be aware that British authorities had treated prisoners "in a manner reminiscent of the German concentration camps"". Now that is a direct quote from one of the sources, and although the facts are hedged upon, calling it a concentration camp is exactly what that minister did. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are plenty of camps explicitly called "concentration camps" but no one, so far as I can find in any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, actually calls Bad Nenndorf a "concentration" camp. This link you mention which only says Bad Nenndorf is "reminiscent of the German concentration camps", it's really pushing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> to try to label it as such, and it's not in Wikipedia's scope to engage in novel research to rename things other than what they're commonly called. I suggest this quote you mention (if it qualifies as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>) be quoted in the text, but the heading should be what everyone commonly calls it, "internment" camp. <a href="../../../h/g/b/User%7EHGB_8569.html" title="User:HGB">HGB</a> 21:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>that's from one of the sources already listed, not anything I just made up or is unreliable. It isn't OR to call something what it is. matching something with its definition is not OR either.

<dd>The more I look at this, and I was trying to find a compromise way of even using this quote calling it "reminiscent" of German concentrations camps, it's just unusable. The only person even making a comparison is some vague unnamed "minister of the day". And yes, it is OR to rename something from it's common usage to something no one else explicitly calls it. I'm changing it back to "internment" unless someone can find something better to back up the "concentration" camp label. And since you're an admin who stepped in to block another editor on this very issue, you probably shouldn't be involving yourself in the debate and making reverts yourself like you did to me.

<dd>Yep, you're right, it was Samsara not you. I had the two of you confused, I apologize. Admins are discouraged from blocking other editors on pages in which they are editing so it would have been better had s/he found a neutral admin who hadn't been involved here to block the editor violating 3rr. Samsara may want to take note of that for future reference. <a href="../../../h/g/b/User%7EHGB_8569.html" title="User:HGB">HGB</a> 05:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In such clear cut cases of 3RR such as that it is perfectly acceptable for any admin to block. Stopping an edit war is a completely different thing than actually edit warring, and while the difference can be subtle, there is a difference. Just because one is a previous contributor, doesn't mean one can't stop an edit war. That block was not controversial in the least and the wording being reverted was not originally inserted by Samsara, rather it was the choice of another editor. If the call on #3RR had been dicey or the page protected, that would be a different story. However, this is not the place to discuss blocking policy. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 05:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At any rate, it's free advice for Samsara (and you as well since you're an admin) to take it or leave it, no need to further discuss. <a href="../../../h/g/b/User%7EHGB_8569.html" title="User:HGB">HGB</a> 06:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>My feeling is still that what the sources <i>call</i> it is irrelevant (in fact, you're onto a definite loser there as most of the sources are in German); more relevant is what was going on there, and what is the appropriate way to refer to the activities. As such, I propose to call it interrogation camp, since that was the original purpose of the facility, even if it was subsequently deviated from (in that known innocents were "interrogated" - what for, one cannot imagine). In fact, I would question calling it a "camp", since it has nothing camp-like. Camp sounds makeshift, but this was not even in a purpose-built building. More of an interrogation centre, perhaps.</s> - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 22:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just one problem: I've looked up the original coverage in <i>The Times</i> of 1948 and at no point does it call it a "torture camp". The term is extremely POV and purely the invention of the Guardian. The article itself is also very unsatisfactory. It's obvious that the Guardian didn't bother looking at the contemporary coverage - if it did, it's well disguised. The case wasn't some new scandal which nobody had ever heard about before the Guardian wrote its report, as there was extensive coverage in the press over a period of several months in 1948 (and probably 1947, when the scandal appears to have broken). Very little that the Guardian printed in 2005 seems to be new info; much of it came out in the 1948 courts martial and is in <i>The Times</i> reports, in a far less sensationalist form. Since my local library has access to <i>The Times</i> digital archives, I'll rewrite the article to reflect what was said at the time, rather that just relying on the Guardian's rather exaggerated account. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well the Guardian didn't invent the torture, the evidince of that was found in the 1947 report.

The <i>Times</i> reports show that a lot of the evidence was regarded as unreliable by the tribunals - notably, the tribunals didn't corroborate the claims of torture, though they did convict one of the officers on neglect charges. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 18:49, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What the tribunals found is irrelevant when the sources cite witnesses including named victims. There was torture. The sources agree on that. Read the NDR references.

<dd>I think you've missed my point. The investigation certainly found evidence of torture - I'm absolutely not denying this. The point is that we shouldn't take every <i>allegation</i> of torture as being confirmed, and the reports from the courts-martial do strongly suggest that many of the allegations weren't regarded as reliable. This isn't to say that abuse never happened, merely that not everything that was claimed to have happened was judged to have happened. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 22:37, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>ChrisO, there is no consensus for the edits you made at that removed sourced information.

<p>I've rewritten and expanded the article, drawing on a number of contemporary sources. These include a book, <i>Camp 020</i> (Public Records Office, 2000) and contemporary news reports from <i>The Times</i>.

<dd>That's okay.

<dd>Understand that. I can't speak for Burke's peerage, as I don't know him or his motivations or for anyone else. I can however say that Samsara and I were just trying to get the mess straigtened out, and don't normally touch these topics. If an incorrect fact was left in due to something either of us did, it was an error that was missed. As you can see, this all exploded in the last couple of days, making sorting it out difficult. Looking for nefarious reasons on our part is really silly, especially when he was just trying to be nice to a new user who needed help with English, and I was just trying to stop and eidt war. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 06:55, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What mystery? He was being nice and merging the articles because newuser I Like Burke's Peerage asked him to. Neither him nor I have ever edited any articles relating to this before, He was trying to help anewuser and cleaned up the English a bit, but probably didn't have time to go over everything with a fine toothed comb. I was sucked in later trying to stop the edit war. There is no mystery in this, there is no political agenda either. Go over our past contribs if you don't beleive it. Burke's peerage put it in, and others tried to help his no so great English. That's it. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 06:45, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I certainly didn't remove it, in fact I cited the <i>Zeit</i> article on a different point (namely that conditions in other detention camps improved after the Bad Nenndorf case was exposed). As for political agendas, I do have to wonder why Burke's Peerage was so keen to label the camp a "torture camp" when none of the contemporary sources describe it that way - it's a blatantly POV description and highly inaccurate as well. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Trusworthy. The DGB supports the "Bad Nenndorf ist bunt" (Bad Nenndorf is coloured [ie. not fashist]) organisation that calls for a counter rally to be held on July 29, 2006, to fence off the ever more frequent Neo-Nazi rallies, and the one planned on the same date in particular. It gives some background info too. Google cache only though. The <a href="http://www.heisenhof.info/fileadmin/Medien/Downloads/bad_nenndorf_29_7_06.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.heisenhof.info/fileadmin/Medien/Downloads/bad_nenndorf_29_7_06.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF version</a> can be downloaded at the "Bündnis für Toleranz und Demokratie" (alliance for tolerance and democracy) in nearby Dörverden. The <a href="http://www.heisenhof.info/31.0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.heisenhof.info/31.0.html" rel="nofollow">imprint</a> lists all notable institution of the city as supporters: city council, all parties, the unions, parish etc. Should be trustworthy enough as the wording of the central text blocks coincide.</li>
<li>The page tells that Neo-Nazis plan to exploit the news regading the internment camp. "Den Neonazis geht es jedoch nicht darum, rechtswidrige Praktiken der Besatzungsbehörden aufzudecken. Vielmehr geht es um eine historische Umwertung des von Deutschland verlorenen Angriffskrieges. Die Rechtsradikalen sprechen nur von den deutschen Opfern." (The Neo-Nazis are not intent on uncovering the occupation forces' unlawful practices. They rather wish for a historical reassessment of the war of aggression incited by Germany. The right wing extremists only speak about the German victims)</li>

<dd>Well, like I was saying, we really need something that reports <i>after</i> the event, as the unreliable coverage suggests that several different groups were involved. It would be good to mention what groups were present. If no major news sources reported the event, one might question its notability; in any case, one might reasonably conjecture the event passed without incident, otherwise it would certainly have been reported by the big dailies and on TV. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 18:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "<i>unreliable coverage</i>" is Germany's (actually Europe's) largest <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Confederation_of_Trade_Unions_2989.html" title="German Confederation of Trade Unions">Confederation of trade unions</a> (DGB) and the local newspaper, the latter being reliable enough for uncontended issues. Both report of two groups: The Nazis and their opponents, nothing doubtful here. The White House spokesman didn't comment on the Bad Nenndorf rally, only local sources did, as could be expected - so what? "<i>one might reasonably conjecture the event passed without incident</i>": correct - so what? Nobody alleged that, and the rally isn't newsworthy in this context for any incidents, but for it's motivation: Exploiting the issues brought up by the Guardian. The DGB deals with that adequately. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 20:39, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
