The HSCA acoustically-determined the location of the grassy knoll assassin when<br />
the HSCA had an 11-22-63 Dallas police motorcycle escort radio tape scientifically analyzed and<br />
compared to an HSCA shooting recreation recorded in 1978. The HSCA never tested the "badge man"<br />
location because the "badge man" was not discovered until 1982.</p>

<li>Thanks for the photos. Seems like wiki-software does not display them as clear and crisp as they actually are. In your opinion, IF badgeman was a real assassin who appears to have just fired a shot, do you think that bullet hit JFK? <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.117.9.html" title="User:205.188.117.9">205.188.117.9</a> 20:18, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "badge man" assassin's shot, fired within a micro-second of the HSCA-determined assassin's shot, did not strike President Kennedy. (since the president was facing nearly in profile to the "badge man," if a "badge man" fired bullet had hit the president in the right side of his head, the bullet, most-likely, would have exited on the left half of the president's head). There is evidence of where the "badge man" missed shot went to. On 11-22-63, within an hour of the assassination, Jean Hill, who was very close to the president at 313, stated on tv that some shots were fired from the grassy knoll. Jean Hill further testified to the Warren Commission that on 11-22-63 she was told by one of the "agents" who questioned her and Mary Moorman that a second "agent" -who Hill testified the first agent told her this second "agent" had been stationed in Dealey Plaza- saw a bullet strike close to her feet in the ground and that bullet kicked up debris. (officially, there were no "agents" documented to be stationed in/near Dealey Plaza at any time, even though several other witnesses are documented to have encountered "agent(s)" within Dealey Plaza within 25 minutes of the assassination) The trajectory line of a shot fired from "badge man" just missing President Kennedy from Z-310 to 314, leads directly at the immediate ground surrounding Jean Hill. Additionally, there is <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/garr/grandjury/Hicks/html/Hicks_0001a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/garr/grandjury/Hicks/html/Hicks_0001a.htm" rel="nofollow">1968 documented grand jury testimony</a> from a Dealey Plaza witness that he observed a gunman fire from within the open trunk of a car parked with its trunk up close to the picket fence line.</li>

<li>Thanks, Gamaleel, for your "lone nut" Warren Commission apologist opinion. Obviously your (liberally over-emotional) opinion is only a non-neutral opinion, and, just as transparent, you have not kept yourself current with (and/or, you are living in denial about) the research since 1982 (over 23+ years), nor have you, apparently, read, and/or you have not comprehended, the acoustics dictabelt tape research from 2001 onward that further supports the second, grassy knoll/picket fence-determined assassin. Here are external links, freely available for all to read and make his/her own determination, to the up-to-date acoustics dictabelt research from 2001 to present that scientifically determines to better than a 95% probability, and further supports the second, grassy/knoll picket fence assassin that was also determined scientifically by the HSCA to a 95% probability:</li>

<p>I am tempted to add a sentence saying that the purported badge man could not have been "the" assasin since the retaining wall would have blocked him from the President for that fatal shot. I know some will claim that is POV, but I've been to Dealey Plaza and I can tell you that that shot is impossible.</p>
<p>Here is a proposed sentence: <i>Visitors to Dealey Plaza will quickly realize however that any person standing in the location of "badge man" could not have fired a fatal shot at President Kennedy, since the retaining wall would block their line of sight. This is so even if the person stands on the bumber of a car</i>.<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 21:03, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not true, Ramsquire. As with most "lone nut" apologists, Ramsquire is not knowledgeable of, and/or, he "forgot" to mention something.... he "forgot" to mention that it has, in fact, been scientifically proven that in the Moorman polaroid #5 the line-of-sight from Mary Moorman to the "badge man" head top proves that the "badge man" head top is above the ground some 8', therefore, as seen in the Moorman #5 polaroid the "badge man" feet if just 0.5' northwest of the picket fence line were elevated above the car parking lot ground (given an average human male height of 5'10"). Because it has been scientifically determined that the "badge man" head top was elevated above the ground some 8', that, of course, then did make it entirely possible for a "badge man" fired bullet to pass above the upper corner of the cement retaining wall. The "badge man" assassin's shot, fired within a micro-second of the HSCA-determined assassin's shot, did not strike President Kennedy. (since the president was facing nearly in profile to the "badge man," if a "badge man" fired bullet had hit the president in the right side of his head, the bullet, most-likely, would have exited on the left half of the president's head). There is evidence of where the "badge man" missed shot went to. On 11-22-63, within an hour of the assassination, Jean Hill, who was very close to the president at 313, stated on tv that some shots were fired from the grassy knoll.
