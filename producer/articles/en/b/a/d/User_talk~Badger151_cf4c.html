<p>Why are informative reference links to this, and similar articles deleted? I've also added some information to these pages, but funnily enough they have been kept. The site links I added were informative, relevant websites. Hardly free speech. I shan't bother contributing to Wikipedia anymore as you've soured the experience for me.

<dd>I saw your note on my talk page when I logged on, regarding the link you added to the Numberplates website. The reason that I removed this link is because, as far as I'm able to determine, Numberplates is a commercial site, and Wikipedia isn't about commercial links. See <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> for more - that page explains it all much better than I could. I see that you contribution to the text of an article is still present, and I hope you'll stay and continue to contribute.</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for your message. Numberplates.com is not a commercial site at all, which can be easily determined by spending thirty seconds on the site. It's the largest source of information on number plates on the internet, and therefore a relevant and important source. Acjs86 09:24, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I did look at the website - both before I deleted the link, and again now. Perhaps I was unlucky in my choice of links, but I found license plates for sale, a book for sale, the ability to sign up to receive notice if a particulalr plate number becomes available. So, it looks like a commercial site to me. I also see from your latest message that you consider Numberplates to be "the largest source of information on number plates on the internet", but the site only seems to apply to plates associated with the United Kingdom, which undermines this argument. Ultimately, however, I think that far more energy is being spent on this than it calls for: if you think it belongs, add it again, or discuss it on that page's talk page.

<p>I saw your comment concerning the Providence hurricane barrier. I don't know when it was constructed, but I believe it was a result of the flooding due to the 1938 hurricane. If you wish, you could add such a notation within the article. In fact, if you know something about Providence, I would appreciate your help given that no one else is working on the article. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 21:49, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I looked at some of the images at <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_apparatus.html" title="Fire apparatus">fire engine</a>, and it seems that most of them are already tagged as {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}, and were uploaded by <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Precision_53a8.html" title="User:Nick Precision">Nick Precision</a>. He seems to have been inactive for almost a year now (although he made a handful of edits in 2005), but as a courtesy, I would leave a note on his talk page telling him that you are moving them over to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">commons</a>. Then, tag the images for deletion here, once it's already on commons.</p>
<p>I think it would a good idea to make an account on Commons with the same username as the one you have on Wikipedia, and as you said, download the images to your computer, and re-upload them. To be thorough, add a little note that it was originally uploaded to en: (which stands for English Wikipedia) and quote the original licensing info that was on Wikipedia. Just cut-and-paste the contents of the image description.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to do about images that have not been tagged correctly. Technically speaking, these should be marked as such. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_with_unknown_copyright_status_6afb.html" title="Category:Images with unknown copyright status">Category:Images with unknown copyright status</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_with_unknown_source_b9fa.html" title="Category:Images with unknown source">Category:Images with unknown source</a> for details.</p>
<p>You might also want to look at examples of what other users have done.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>it seems to be a little more complicated:&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>"non-ambulance automobile": the H-MICU can be an ambulance or a simple car (I just noticed I forgot this point);</li>
<li>"fly-cars cost much less than ambulances": the H-MICU cost more than an ambulance</li>
<li>"they can be staffed by a single person": the H-MICU is always staffed by three persons</li>
<li>"A fly-car can be a resource conserver for an EMS agency": the aim is not to preserve ressources, but to bring adequate materials and people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some elements about H-MICUs:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first ones were ambulances, with a physician, a nurse and an ambulance-man;</li>
<li>they are often called as reinforcement when there is already an ambulance; they thus evolved to simple cars with only the material and the three people, but there are still full ambulance H-MICUs;</li>
<li>a simple ambulance, or even an helicopter, which is reinforced by a medical staff becomes an H-MICU.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the fly-car has some of the aspects of the H-MICU, but they are not equivalent.</p>

<p>Well, there are a few rules we all have to abide by, but they're similar to those for writing a paper in high school or college: we have to avoid plagiarism, and we have to have substance to what we write. I see that another user noted that you used copied-and-pasted text from a school's website - doing so is typically copyright infringement, and can have legal repercussions, which is why it's not allowed. I also saw your page on <i>Lost'</i>s Widmore Corporation, which merely mentioned that the corporation was mentioned on the show - if you tell us what the corporation does (are they an automobile assembly company? a law firm? an international shipping company?) and why they're important on <i>Lost</i>, that would be valuable - I, for one, don't know the answers to those questions.

<dd>The simplest way to stick with one account might be to just abandon the unwanted account by no longer using it. Since many people frown on having more than one account, you may want to indicate that you used to use the now dormant account, and provide a link to it - that way no one can accuse you of trying to hide what's considered a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">sockpuppet</a> account. To actually close out an account or merge two accounts would require an administrator.</dd>
<dd>For the RfC, it looks like you've completed step one succesfully, but you also will need to place a message on the appropriate RfC page - this is similar to posting a notice on a community bulliten board. If you go to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and scroll down about half way, there is a list of categories - I'm guessing you'll want "History and Geography." To the right of each entry in the list you can click on "add entry" to add your request. Other editors follow these lists, and this is how you'll reach a broader audience.</dd>
<dd>In your request, you'll want to include a link to the appropriate section of the article's talk page, so other editors can find it easily. This is done by taking the article's name, adding a # sign, and then listing the section title. For instance, typing</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
[[Wikipedia:Requests for comment#Request comment on articles]] 
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>will generate a link looking like this: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html#Request_comment_on_articles" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment#Request comment on articles</a></dd>
<dd>and will take you to the RfC page, but instead of droping you at the top, it will drop you off at the "Request comment on articles" section. Hope this helps --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 00:39, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Almost - the list kind of goes backwards, with newer items on the top. This way, people looking for new entries don't have to scroll down. Also, try to present a more neutral description of the dispute. If you read the other enteries, you'll see that people typicaly try not to indicate which side of a conflict they support. You'll also want to make your link not just to the Armenia talk page, but to the appropriate section of the talkpage - where you announced that you're requesting the RfC. You'll need to use the <i>#</i> sign, as I described above.</dd>

<p>Hey there. As far as I know, a middle name or initial is never mentioned for <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milo_Minderbinder_687b.html" title="Milo Minderbinder">Milo Minderbinder</a>. On other sites, I generally use minderbinder as a username, or milo if that's not available. When I signed up, it wouldn't let me, so I added the H. Why H? Because it's the same middle initial as Jesus H. Christ. (by the way, it stands for Harold) Incidentally, in the years of using "minderbinder" as a username, I think you're the first person to ever recognize the origin.

<p>On the WikiProject Countries talk page, you had either explictly declared a general interest in the project, or had participated at a discussion that appears related to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Countries_c1c1.html#Location_Maps_for_European_countries" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries">Location Maps for European countries</a>.<br />
New maps had been created by David Liuzzo, and are available for the countries of the <i>European continent</i>, and for countries of the <i>European Union</i> exist in two versions. From <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> till <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">January 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, a poll had tried to find a consensus for usage of 'old' or of which and where 'new' version maps. At its closing, 25 people had spoken in favor of either of the two presented usages of new versions but neither version had reached a consensus (12 and 13), and 18 had preferred old maps.<br />
As this outcome cannot justify reverting of new maps that had become used for some countries, seconds before <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> a survey started that will be closed at <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:59:59. It should establish whether the new style maps may be applied as soon as some might become available for countries outside the European continent (or such to depend on future discussions), and also which new version should be applied for which countries.<br />
Please note that since <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> all new maps became updated by David Liuzzo (including a world locator, enlarged cut-out for small countries) and as of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> the restricted licence that had jeopardized their availability on Wikimedia Commons, became more free. The subsections on the talk page that had shown David Liuzzo's original maps, now show his most recent design.<br />

<p>Hi Badger,</p>
<p>I'm afraid i must disagree with some of your last edit round changing back International to American English - The rest of the article ISN'T written in US english - i know because i think i wrote or re-wrote about 75% (or more!) of it. When that person made the ammends last time, i realised there were a few inconsistencies, so i moved it all to international english to avoid future confusion. This is in line with Wikipedia guidelines, where unless the topic is written about a US subject, it should be in international english (or at least consistent throughout). I think it's a stupid idea to go through and re-write my contributions to US englishj, and as they form the bulk of the article, i'm going to revert your english changes</p>
<p>As ever, feel free to comment on my talk page!</p>
<p>Owain</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain.davies_53bf.html" title="User:Owain.davies">Owain.davies</a> 07:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, Owain - I do agree that there has been a slow creep over the past several months in the style of English used on the Ambulance page, however, I think that if you reflect, and take a look at the page history, you will find that:
<ol>
<li>from the begining, the page has been written in US English. Arm<i>or</i> appeared before arm<i>our</i>, <i>-ize</i> has consistently appeared, but I have rarely found <i>-ise</i>, <i>truck</i> appears instead of <i>lorry</i>, &amp;c.</li>
<li>If you take a look at the page as it existed at the time of your first edit:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ambulance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97307568" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ambulance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97307568" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> you will see that, where there are differences between US and UK English, most of the page uses US conventions.
<ul>
<li>All of "History" was written in US English (I know because I wrote it, and I wrote it that way in keeping with the rest of the page).</li>
<li>"Design and construction" is in US English: note the use of the word <i>gasoline</i>, not <i>petrol</i>.</li>
<li>"Appearance and markings": note the word <i>favor</i>, not <i>favour</i>.</li>
<li>"Private ambulance companies": I don't see much that falls specifically into only one variant of the language, but I do see that perhaps half of the section is about US phenomena, and I see the mention of a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commercial_driver%27s_license.html" title="Commercial driver's license">Commercial driver's license</a>, which according to the Wikipedia page is a US phenomenon (I gather that UK’s PCV license is somewhat equivalent, but the point remains that the US term is used).</li>
<li>"Military ambulances" has something of a split personality, using <i>armor</i> but <i>armoured</i> - if you look back through the history, however, you will see that the US spelling appeared in the article first.</li>
<li>What follows is the discussion of services in different countries - sections you quite appropriately removed and spun into their own pages. Looking at them nevertheless, I see that the US section (whose height takes up 2 and 1/2 screens on my monitor - almost twice as much as any other country’s) appears to be written in US English - I note the use of <i>color</i> rather than <i>colour</i>. France's section doesn't appear to use anything that isn't used by both variants of the language, though I admit that my knowledge of the intricacies of the differences has its limits. The section on the UK is written in UK English: I note the use of <i>recognised</i> rather than <i>recognized</i>. The section on Germany uses <i>therefore</i>, with the <i>e</i> at the end - I honestly don't remember which style this falls into, though I think it is US. Norway's section uses <i>organizations</i>, which I also take to be US spelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There appears to be some confusion regarding the type of English to be used on Wikipedia, so I cut and paste from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContributing_FAQ_f2da.html#General" title="Wikipedia:Contributing FAQ">Wikipedia:Contributing FAQ#General</a> (you'll have to scroll down to section 3.10)
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Should I use American English or British English? - People contribute to the English language Wikipedia in every possible variety and dialect of formal written English. The English language Wikipedia particularly welcomes contributions from editors whose first language is neither American English nor Commonwealth English. Still, it is generally good form to keep usage consistent within a given article. The official policy is to <b>use British (AKA "Commonwealth") spelling <i>when writing about British (or Commonwealth) topics,</i></b> and American for topics relating to the United States. <b>General topics can use any one of the variants, but should generally strive to be consistent within an article.</b> See Wikipedia's Manual of Style for a more detailed explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
(Emphasis is mine)</li>
<li>I also note:
<blockquote>
<p>Disputes over style issues - In June 2005, the Arbitration Committee ruled that, when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change. For example, with respect to British spelling as opposed to American spelling, it would only be acceptable to change from American spelling to British spelling if the article concerned a British topic. Revert warring over optional styles is unacceptable; if the article uses colour rather than color, it would be wrong to switch simply to change styles, although editors should ensure that articles are internally consistent. If it has been stable in a given style, do not change it without some style-independent reason. If in doubt, defer to the style used by the first major contributor.</p>
</blockquote>
which you may find at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Disputes_over_style_issues" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Disputes over style issues</a> The first major contribution was probably that made by <a href="../../../c/d/a/User%7ECdang_4713.html" title="User:Cdang">User:Cdang</a> in several edits between 19 August 2004 and 30 Septermber of the same year; Cdang added much of the section on French EMS, which as I have already said, is difficult to assign to any one type of English. The first moderately sized addition that chooses between UK and US English that I can find is User:Mathknight's addition of "Military ambulances" on 13 January 2005; Mathknight clearly and consistently uses <i>armor</i>, not <i>armour</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because of this, I have consistently used US English, as far as my understanding of it allows: I wrote the entire "History" section in US English, The work I did on "Design and construction" was written the same way, as was the work I did on “Appearance and markings,” (which you expanded on quite nicely, as I believe I commented at the time – as I look in more detail, though, I note that you overlooked the presence of <i>colored</i> in that section, not to mention the style of the bulk of the rest of the article, and used UK spellings in your additions. As this added a sizeable block to the article, this may be why you thought of the article as being largely UK English.)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you look at the edits that I have done on the Ambulance article, I believe that you will find that, where I have changed between one style of English and another, I have done so only for consistancy, and generally only as I came across the discrepincies; I made the last series of edits upon first discovering that some sections had drifted, and later in determining that many of them had done so.</dd>

<dd>I also wish to point out that in your haste to attend to UK English, you undid <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">User:GunnarRene</a>'s edit of 27 March, and my edit regarding civilian vehicles, which is necessary if the reference to Dean King's book is to be valid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I <i>must</i> object to your statement that you wrote or rewrote 75% of the article. You have added about as much as I have, and I know that I haven’t written half of that article. I find your proposal otherwise to be highly insulting.</dd>
<dd>Yours very sincerely, --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 05:16, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Offence of course not meant, I was in a slightly bad mood at the time... I still maintain that I think it should be in International English given that the majority of the article was written to be that way (and admittedly a general personal bias to things being written in international). I've changed a couple of the disputed parts to agreeable international (such as fixed wing aircraft) as this is the type of language I prefer to use in any case, as it's less ambiguous. Seems like a good compromise?</p>
<p>Keep up the good work. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain.davies_53bf.html" title="User:Owain.davies">Owain.davies</a> 20:57, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Owain. I'm sorry it's taken me some time to get back to you. I gather that it is important to you that the ambulance page be written in UK English, in spite of the history of the page and the policies of Wikipedia. Your actions in following this desire have caused and will continue to cause me minor inconveniences, and I am left with something of the feeling that you hijacked the page in changing it over to UK English, but I will not engage in an edit war with you over this. There are some users who do take the versions of English very seriously, though (too seriously, in my opinion), so in the hopes of enabling you to avoid future difficulties, I hope you will allow me to offer some advice. Please do review the Wikipedia policies on the use of UK and US English. I think you will find them to be as I have described above, which is different than what you proposed on my talk page. Please also be careful to consider the entire page when determining which style of English it is in.

<dd>Thanks Badger, after your last comment i did review this, and as i said, i'm happy to not convert it over to UK English (although if i inadvertently write something in UK english in a new section, please accept my apologies - it's very hard to change!) What i have tried to do it bring the whole article in to International English (neither US nor UK), so that it makes sense to users from any country. On that basis, i've left things like armor alone, but changed airplane/aeroplane to fixed wing aircraft - hopefully neutral. Many thanks for your wise counsel. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain.davies_53bf.html" title="User:Owain.davies">Owain.davies</a> 05:41, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
