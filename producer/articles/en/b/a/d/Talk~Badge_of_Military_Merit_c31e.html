The Badge of Military is a completely separate decoration from the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_Heart_4dee.html" title="Purple Heart">Purple Heart</a> and is considered as such by the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_Heraldry_49ff.html" title="Institute of Heraldry">Institute of Heraldry</a>.

<p>Did I misunderstand something. There were 3 original badges given, but only one (Brown's) still exists? But there is a modern looking photo of Churchills' badge. It begs the question of what happened to Churchill's badge that Brown's is now the only one existing? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gloryroad (<a href="../../../g/l/o/User_talk%7EGloryroad_b0b7.html" title="User talk:Gloryroad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gloryroad_0876.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gloryroad">contribs</a>) 22:41, August 6, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>That's a good question. According to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/7977/geobook.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/7977/geobook.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, "Elijah Churchill was decorated by Gen. Washington at New Winsdor Contonement at Vale's Gate along with two other men with the Military Badge of Merit. Found in Museum at Vale's Gate New Windsor." There is a lot of confusion about this badge. I believe the actual total of badges given was 6. (see above link) My ancestor, Louis Alexander Lizotte/Lezott/Lezotte, also received this award, but it is not found in any history books. Yet my distant cousin, when he was doing research in order to qualify for membership in the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sons_of_the_American_Revolution_5939.html" title="Sons of the American Revolution">Sons of the American Revolution</a>, discovered the badge and accompanying certificate for Lezotte, which I believe reside in a Connecticut museum. I don't have access to my genealogy info at the moment, so I'll need to check back and make sure that's accurate. Unfortunately, this falls under <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">"original research"</a>, but I'll see if I can find anything else on the badge in published sources. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatr67_a209.html" title="User:Katr67">Katr67</a> 18:25, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am the writer who edited this page numerous times today noting that there was more than just three soldiers that obtained this award, etc. Many genealogists have copies of their ancestor's discharges showing the Badge of Merit. It is a shame that better research was not done before it was put forth that only three soldiers received this original award. Many sources only repeat this same erroneous story. This ignores the recognition of many fine soldiers. It is also a shame that the Badge of Honorary Distinction award was completely ignored by historians.</dd>

<dd>I have studied more about the rules of Wikipedia and have tried to edit this page better on my second attempt. I feel that it is very important to correct the record about the origin of the Badge of Military Merit. Based on existing and published (not original!) research (George Washington Papers), the Badge of Military Merit was one of three original badges, or awards, and NOT the first award in the singular sense. Like the other two Honarary Badges, all three are obsolete badges. I have added my sources in the discussion page (where I found the others). I hope this was correct.</dd>

<p>My ancestor's discharge was also signed by Moses Hazen! In fact, I have examined all the orderly books for this regiment. Most of these original books are in the original manuscript collection at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania and have examined them. I have been studying this Regiment for almost 10 years now.

<p>I really don't like the way the article starts out stating the award was for Valor. The term is clearly sourced (comes from an SAR article), but I don't think the SAR is right. Nothing in Washington's order mentions valor. The military has different awards for Valor, Bravery, Courage, Heroism, Merit, etc. The SAR appears to have wanted to tie their overview of badges throughout history with a theme and Valor sounded good. It opens the door to inaccuracy. Armycaptain 00:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry I had to revert the recent edits, but looking over the edits, there was some good stuff there but there were three major problems, those being:</p>
<p>1) Virtually all of the material was unsourced and in one case stated that historians have actually not been able to verify it.</p>
<p>2) The text contained several personal opinions, in constrast to the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> policy</p>
<p>3) The rewrites destroyed the existing syntax and took out most of the links to other articles.</p>
<p>Given these serious problems, I suggest working on a rewrite on a temp page and then moving over confirmed pieces without blanking or destroying the existing text. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 18:46, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Researchers have not been able to locate or account for the above-mentioned "book of merit."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Without a doubt, Washington chose to publically single out these three men for their unusual gallant conduct on the battlefield as an example to others. However, Washington never meant for this award to be awarded exclusively to only three non-commissioned officers of the Connecticut Line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And such was not the case. Many <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_discharge.html" title="Military discharge">Honorable Discharges</a> of soldiers released at the end of the war show that Washington expanded this Badge of Merit to honor soldiers for their faithful service. This is in accordance to his original <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1782.html" title="1782">1782</a> order to award the Merit for "extraordinary fidelty and essential service." Regimental or Brigade commanders would endorse their names directly following the statement of award on the discharges. These discharge certificates were then submitted to Washington as "incentestable proof" of the award recipients' eligibility. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microfilm.html" title="Microfilm">Microfilmed</a> images of these discharges bearing Washington's signature can be found in the individual records of soldiers at the National Archives.</dd>

<p>I figured I could add some talk here while you work on the article, Katr67. I OPPOSE you stating their were only two badges created on August 7, 1782: the Honorary Distinction and the Military Merit. The Honorary Distinction badges can be broken down to two slightly different badges, but different nonetheless. These Honorary badges may not be the focus of this article, but they should not be referenced incorrectly.

<dd>Through my emulation of others using caps on the word "oppose", I unwknowingly shouted at you. I reviewed the links you provided. Whether the Badges of Distinction are somehow similar or ancestral to the overseas service bar is immaterial to this article, but a good lead for another linked article about Badges of Honorary Distinction. Washington's General Order is clear. There were three separate awards that fell into two classes of awards. To prevent misleading the reader it must be corrected. Also, it appears that we have now lost our sources for our statement that other veteran's received the Badge of Merit. However, your writing is still accurate and effective. I assume there is some rule in Wikipedia that allows making this statement without having to source the discharges of individual soldier discharges. Did this arise from the Discussion Page? <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmycaptain_445d.html" title="User:Armycaptain">Armycaptain</a> 12:36, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, found a record of an officer showing that officers received the badge of merit: William Heath Sr. Discharged June 6, 1783 “The above William Heath has been honored with a Badge of Merit for four years faithful service. His apointment as Ensigh of a company in the first Regiment of the Second Brigade and in the Eighth Division of Militia in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. His appointment as Captain of a Company in the Second Regiment of the Second Brigade and Tenth Division of the Militia of the Commonwealt of Massachusetts.” <a href="http://www.rootsandrelatives.net/getperson.php?personID=I1463&amp;tree=1" class="external free" title="http://www.rootsandrelatives.net/getperson.php?personID=I1463&amp;tree=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.rootsandrelatives.net/getperson.php?personID=I1463&amp;tree=1</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmycaptain_445d.html" title="User:Armycaptain">Armycaptain</a> 12:43, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you remove the extra period after source #3? Thanks. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmycaptain_445d.html" title="User:Armycaptain">Armycaptain</a> 12:49, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with you about the number of badges. It is clear that there a two awards, one of which has two levels of recognition. The U.S. Army and the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sons_of_the_American_Revolution_5939.html" title="Sons of the American Revolution">Sons of the American Revolution</a> seem to agree. Other editors need to get involved at this point. The sources are still on the temp page. If you mean the period after the third source on that page, I'm not done filling out the citation templates for those sources--they are not ready to be placed on the main page. I did not place them on the main article page yet because the idea that there were more soldiers who received the award is controversial and I wanted to get input from other editors. Also, individual genealogy websites are rife with inaccuracies and wishful thinking and I wanted to find out if the wikicommunity considered these <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. I figured it would be OK to mention that something called the "Badge of Merit" was awarded and this was evident on various discharge papers on microfilm. I went out on a limb and did not link to any particular evidence--our friends at NARA can probably vouch for that info. I wanted to say something to the effect that the idea of more than three BOMMs being awarded was controversial, but I haven't found any evidence to that effect yet, besides a conversation with my coworker who had had a similar discussion with some people at NARA, etc. I'm taking a break from this article. I've tried to explain, and give you links to various wikipolicies, that we try not to just add info to articles willy-nilly, but do what you will, I'll let the other editors work with you. Thanks. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatr67_a209.html" title="User:Katr67">Katr67</a> 14:57, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for all your help. Except for the # of badges, I have concurred with your contributions. Some of my questions are not criticisms, but merely trying to learn the Wikipedia process. And these questions come after reviewing the links you have provided. As the Wikipedia guideline on Good Faith notes; remember that you are dealing with newcomers and try not to get frustrated.</p>
<p>There are two periods after the following source on the main page: Fitzpatrick,John C., ed. The Writings of Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745-1799. 39 vols. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1931-1944; reprint, New York: Greenwood Press, 1970..Armycaptain 18:11, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mel Johnson, I am sorry but your edits must be reverted! Your additions appear to be your opinions and not based on the sources that you cite. The sources that you cite are actually sources for previous versions and do do not back-up your statements. Find secondary sources that state this award for "unremarkable service" and "like a Good Conduct Medal" before adding this to the article. Also, you provide no documentation about the "dissension among scholars" about the New Hampshire badge. I am sorry if I offend you if you new to Wikipedia. Please review other articles featured in Wikipedia to learn how to make additions.</p>
