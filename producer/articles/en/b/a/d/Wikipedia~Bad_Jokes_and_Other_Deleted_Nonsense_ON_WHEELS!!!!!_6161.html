Paterson drugged Gates and left him in the desert, to were he fought of a wild bear before being took in by a wandering tribe. He became ther cheif and led them into war against many rival tribes. Gates was crowned king of all arabia. But was forced to join the U.S army, he went to war in vietnam. While on partrol his troop was ambushed and killed, he was took in to capitvity. There he was beaten into an inch of his life. A second more and Gates would be dead, there he found the dark side of the force and in a blind rage killed all present. Shocked at what he did, he left into the moutains in northern china so nothing like that would happen again. There he met King Xi Chun, who told gates of his destiny to be very poweful. Gates took this for foolishness and killed Chun there and then. Then he relised, he would make a machine that would one day be in every household so that he could become very rich.

<p>Plastic Figure Fighting is a new age version (originating at the beginning of 2000) of action figure fighting for teens, typically ages 13-17. It involves two or more plastic action figures competing against one-another for the glory of holding a title belt. This game resembles professional wrestling very much in the way moves are executed and the match types. A great deal of imagination must be used when playing this game. This game has achieved tremendous popularity in Eastern Kentucky as groups of teens get together and have actually been known to have parties. As of March 2006, the number of teens playing this sport has been estimated at over 5500.</p>

<p>Quiet Study Activities when originally founded contained but a few suggestions that had been tried and tested during school hours. The school from which the website originated cannot be named for legal purposes. In the first days of the websites life it contained the ever popular paper activities and had a few vocal activities described and illustrated on it. Now however because of the increasing popularity and interest in the site many different activities, games, lists, links, superheroes and music have been added. The site is continually growing in order to satisfy the continuing demand.</p>

<p>this rare case of flying rodent, comes from the out back lands on Mongolia, it lives in high trees watching young children play.</p>
<p>it feeds on young ethnic women that suffer from facial tumours, they tend to live short lives, however they have quite a good sense of humour. it likes to tickle itself and others around.. But don’t be fooled! it will end up masturbating over your self. This for of sperm can be quite acidic and burn through skin if not protected.</p>
<p>They are seen to be moderately randy, they tend to make up to 200 babies in the three to four years of there life. Most of these are eaten by the second father of the off spring.</p>
<p>In the winters then tend to burrow under ground to hide from predators, such as the jiigawog foul. This nasty animal tends to kill them slowly and painfully over about six days of digesting them in there stomach.</p>

<p>The basic premise of the paradox rests on two assumed unbreakable rules:</p>
<p>1) That cats always land on their feet when dropped from above a certain height.</p>
<p>2) That buttered toast always lands buttered side down when dropped. <a name="The_Paradox" id="The_Paradox"></a></p>

<p>Accordingly, if a piece of buttered toast were attached to the back of a cat with its buttered side facing upwards then the cat would be unable to land on its feet without the toast landing buttered side up and visa versa. Seeing as this violates the two above assumptions, the only ‘logical’ solution is that the cat\toast combination hoovers above the ground attempting to fulfill both ‘laws’.</p>

<p>Somali pirates are the sexy scavengers that patrol the waterways off the coast off Somalia. These aquatic wayfarers patrol the sea in search of boats to board and booty to seize.</p>
<p>These modern day Robin Hood's use a grenade launcher instead of a bow and arrow. One could say that by not distributing their booty to the poor, they technically differ in that aspect as well.</p>
<p><b>Bravery</b> - One thing we know for certain is that the Somali pirate is a fearless creature. This is evidenced each time they board a life raft with their paddles (and grenade launchers) and attempt to attack US Navy battleships.</p>

The banana is also one of the smartest fruits on the market, having a great knowledge in algebra and american history, it is been lead to belive that the banana may to be too smart for our time. The reason we mass grow and eat banana's is so that they cannot group up in large numbers and form a revolution, overthrowing our government and sending our society as we know it into turmoil. The banana has been traced back to the cause of many species becoming extinct. Many predators try to attack the banana thinking it is only an inatimate object.Once the predator comes close enough, the banana has been known to use it's skills in ninjitsu and quick the animal with one swift blow to the head.</p>

<p>I had high hopes for this "Wikipedia", boy was I wrong. It seems to be a place where "SHOCK JOCK" editor rippers, raggers and other scum gather to be able to do their worst. To call an ALLOWED patent "nonsense" without further comment IS hit and run vandalism and is as DING DING as it gets. The WORLDS CONSENSUS is that AN ALLOWED PATENT IS REAL, stupids. Hey PATENT HATERS and TECHNOPHOBES... I SPIT INTO YOUR ROTTING FACES! GOT THAT? PIGS. I know you want to stop it but there is NOTHING you can do about stopping the PATENT though is there HMMMM? You Tried but failed didn't you? Go ahead and slither out from under your rock and try again cowards... YOU WILL FAIL AGAIN! SCUM, and if you infringe YOU WILL BE SUED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW. And be advised, the patent itself is COPYRIGHED as well. Independent Oprability is here! Whether it bothers YOU or not. It does NOT bother me! Get the picture? As there is NOTHING you can do about that, is there? Your plan has already failed, whether you are ELF or whatever! YOU HAVE LOST THE FIGHT! GIVE IT UP ALREADY! You can burn all the SUVs you like BUT YOU CAN'T BURN A PATENT RIGHT HA! Got anything else to say... I'm LISTENING and LAUGHING!</p>

<p>Despite many setbacks, technical difficulties and derisive comments from small children, the two intrepid pioneers managed to secure a competition ironing board (with Morphy Richards Surfline iron) first to a specially modified <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirtsurfer.html" title="Dirtsurfer">Dirtsurfer</a> inline mountain board, then to the rear frame of a Mk. I Predator Kite Buggy. Both rigs were powered by a 7.2m Mk 1 Blade traction kite.</p>
<p>Despite a shaky start, an impressive combined toeside crosswind traverse and precision knife-edge crease on a difficult fleecy V-neck jumper was eventually achieved by Howarth followed closely by a tandem piggyback O'Prey-Howarth buggy ironing combination. When asked, the duo replied they were exhilirated by the day's achievements but were not yet considering an entry into the Transat Des Sables Trans-Sahara Kite Buggy challenge.</p>

<p>English fonts are generally able to be portrayed and read upside down and backwards. With a few exceptions -- "c", "i", "k", and "v" are notable examples -- most letters have what I'd call rotodromic pairings.</p>
<p>The Upside Down "font" is intended to be read left to right, but only as if the monitor is rotated 180 degrees. The character set is primarily lowercase.</p>
<p>The standard English alphabet:</p>
<pre>
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
</pre>
<p>Can be represented as:</p>
<pre>
zhm^nfsjbdouwl&gt;|r!y6tap&gt;qe
</pre>
<p>Note that the "k" is comprised of the "&gt;" and the "|" character. Some characters require a bit of imagination to "see", such as the j/r pairings. While this is a simple substitution, it is intended to be reasonably legible if held "upside down".</p>
<p>this is an example of the upside down font.:</p>

<p>The History of the Moldovan language, goes a very long way back. First there was the Moldovan language, a language <b>unlike</b> Romanian from all points of view and so different from Romanian that Romanians needed about 3 to 4 translators just to understand a simple Moldovan sentence. In fact, Romanians didn't even speak a language. They were all mute, and used sign language to communicate. Then slowly, those sneaky Romanians gathered at night next to Moldovan villages and listened carefully to what the Moldovans were saying. They kept on doing this, night after night for about five years until slowly they learned the language. But even then they didn't quite master it properly and thus it was to be called Romanian.</p>

<p>There is <b>no</b> controversy over the Moldovan language. Everyone knows that it is soo different from Romanian, that it can be clearly said that Moldovan is closer to Chinese then to Romanian. Anyone who dares to contradict this opinion which has been reflected in the works of universally known scholars such as Vasily Stati, Stati Vasily and V.

<dd>The Moldovan ortograhpy is very different from the Romanian one. That is because the languages are so different. Moldovan is written only in Cyrillic. Romanian, unlike Moldovan, cause it is so different from it, is written in that horrible Latin alphabet, which no true Moldovans would ever use( cause it's so horrible). Moldovans and Romanians are very different people and cannot understand each other, partly because of this unreconciable orthography.</dd>

<dd>Alas, those aren't the words of any official organ of the UN, but of a document <i>submitted</i> to the UN Commission on Human Rights by the "International League for the Rights and Liberation of Peoples, a non-governmental organization in special consultative status." I don't know what "special consultative status means" precisely. By the way, the document writes "6-7 years", not "67 years". Let's be careful in our use of documents. After all, much of the denial of Ottoman atrocities is based on misquoted documents.... --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:46, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nothing to say? My father used to say "Even if you find money on the road, always count first". This is what happens when you POV fork, not reading everything in the article except for sentences that will be helpful to your POV. So it isn't a UN statement after all, eh?

<dd>What means something, then? Turkey denies all atrocities committed by the Young Turk government (why, I have no idea) - we could, I suppose say that the "International League for the Rights and Liberation of Peoples" and the <a href="http://www.greekembassy.org/press/newsflash/2001/May/nflash0521c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.greekembassy.org/press/newsflash/2001/May/nflash0521c.html" rel="nofollow">Greek government</a> say that the numbers were 350,000. That is normally how things should be done, per <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.

<p>What evidence is there that this "beylik" was called itself an Empire then - we know that the 1870 Japanese Empire was called that because the article explicitly says that it called itself an Empire from the <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meiji_Restoration_4cc3.html" title="Meiji Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a>, which was only the current Japanese islands ;-) --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 21:37, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hugo Chavez can declare himself emperor and Venezuela his empire, it means nothing to the rest of the world. Imperial Japan is that which occupied most of SE Asia; Ottoman Empire is that which conquered all of Eastern Mediterrenea. If they didn't do those, they wouldn't be regarded as empires today.

<p>You're right kagan, an Empire by definition is multi-ethnic, but as this fact is mentioned in the Byzantine and Roman Empires, it should be mentioned in the Ottoman. Don't forget that the concept of being Ottoman, i.e. a Turk, depended on religion, not on ethnicity. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:50, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"<b>Politically</b>, it covers the period from the enforced establishment of prefectures in place of feudal domains (廃藩置県; Hai-han Chi-ken) in July 14, 1871, through the expansion of Japan from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, up until the formal surrender in September 2, 1945, when the Instrument of Surrender was signed.

<p>I think we're entering a weird area, considering that Imperialism (Empire building) is the acquiring control over foreign entities - Japan must be an exception to this rule however, as according to <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566679/Japan.html" class="external text" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566679/Japan.html" rel="nofollow">Encarta</a>: <i>An emperor has ruled in Japan since about the 7th century</i> and according to <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/ja/Japan.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/ja/Japan.html" rel="nofollow">Columbia</a>, <i>The divine design of the empire - supposedly founded in 660 B.C. by the emperor Jimmu, a lineal descendant of the sun goddess and ancestor of the present emperor - was held as official dogma until 1945.</i> So perhaps their perception of an "empire" is different to that in the West. This discussion is relevant in some way to is it necessary, or accurate to describe the Ottoman Empire as a non ethnically homogenous Turkish Empire. While it may be unnecessary, does it hurt? --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 23:41, 25 March 2006 (UTC)Ē</p>

<dd>As I said before Hugo Chavez can declare himself emperor and Venezuela his empire but that means nothing to the rest of the world. Legally recognized Empire of Japan is multi-ethnic and so is every single recognized empire in history. Adding that piece to the sentence is redundant, therefore should be removed for the improvement of the article. It is not about whether it hurts or not. Anyway, I am leaving.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 23:48, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Kagan. I like it too. Could someone shorten the code. pleeeeease?</dd>
<dd>For the Japan point, I don't understand what you mean. The official name was legalised in 1936 and the same name still exists, when now the Empire is trully homoethnic. Also, Byzantine Empire was homoethnic at some points of its history wasn't it? And, really, what is the problem of including "multiethnic" to the Ottoman Empire article? I wouldn't care if it were added in all multiethnic ones for clarification. Why do you object? Wasn't it multiethnic? I think that is good. :-) <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver"><font style="background: #777;"> </font><font style="background: #888;" color="white">N</font><font style="background: #999;" color="white">i</font><font style="background: #aaa;" color="white">k</font><font style="background: #bbb;" color="white">o</font><font style="background: #ccc;" color="white"><b>S</b></font><font style="background: #bbb;" color="white"><b>il</b></font><font style="background: #aaa;" color="white"><b>v</b></font><font style="background: #999;" color="white"><b>e</b></font><font style="background: #888;" color="white"><b>r</b></font><font style="background: #777"> </font></a> <sup><font size="-2"><a href="../../../n/i/k/User_talk%7ENikoSilver_3667.html" title="User talk:NikoSilver">(T)</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_NikoSilver_2661.html" title="Special:Emailuser/NikoSilver">@</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NikoSilver_1a4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/NikoSilver">(C)</a></font></sup> 23:46, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>We can take cats, because, as recent, Top Secret studies have shown that all <u>life</u> started with cat-like beings. This happened when, in a parallel universe, an accident resulted is a universal jump. The "cats" arrived in our universe and, finding they could not get back, started life. Now, according to wives tales from earth (the big computer), cats have nine lives. That is where "life" comes in, now for "everything". Everything can be explained as infinity. An <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Improbability_Drive_5f6d.html" title="Infinite Improbability Drive">Infinite Improbability Drive</a> runs at infinite improbability, which is 2<sup>276,709</sup>:1. If we take the "2", and subtract that from the nine lives that cats have, we get <u>seven</u>, our first number. Now, to get six, we take the number of dimensions known to <u>earthlings</u>. They know six: 1, 2, and 3 are the three "space" dimensions; 4 is time; 5 is hyperspace; and six is the dimension where the "mice" are from.

<p>A Brief History of America- During the Civil war the South had stunning victories of the war. They would traditionally do the cha cha after their great King Louis III. He liked to dance all night long. After the mighty battle of Startemy, King Park was crowned for his heroic feat of killing over 2000 coldiers with his bare hands. This battle had more deaths than any battle or war in the past or present put together.There wer over 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Buhmillion deaths. There wer so many that the children of the people who fought in the war had to eat their own fathers to keep the field from overcrowding with gravestones. King Park in his infenite kingdom accidently killed himself when he looked down the hole of a canon that was loaded and ordered his soldier to fire the cannon to check if it was loaded. His son King blackie was then crowned. Blackie was a foolish ruler who made all the kings horses and all the kings men try to put humpty dumpty back together again. He even climbed a beanstalk (which he grew from beans who he bought from jack) and stole a magic chicken who made golden lasagnas. His generals were angry at him and had his head ripped off while they took a chainsaw and started ripping out his heart. His empire was divided among his generals who then challenged each other and a great war was started called World War I. America won the war and stayed the most powerful country. When Korea, a rogue, snuck up on it and backstabbed it with his lvl 87 dagger called chromaggrius. Korea took over the empire and a King called called Park ruled the world. The world then stayed peacerful until all the countries ganged up on Korea, but Korea used its Vanish Powder and backstabbed them all slowly. After all the other countries were killed this proved that all koreans were superior.</p>

<p><b>Waffle Wednesday</b> is a cultural ceremony of the waffle, celebrated throughout Southern Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area. Originally, the holiday was to be celebrated as an annual tradition, in order to release it's creator's from the shackles of frozen pastries. The idea was to increase the consumption and awareness of <b>Home Made Waffles</b>.</p>
<p>It's origin's date is unknown -mainly because no one bothered to write it down- but experts speculate that Waffle Wednesday dates back to March of 2005 in Barrie, Ontario. Here three highschool students -whose names are lost with the ancient books of their time period- realized that they had never eaten home made waffles. The students then decided to create a holiday where anyone who wished could have them. A day had to be decided on, and due to the convenient alliteration, Waffle Wednesday was born.</p>
<p>Since it's origin Waffle Wednesday has changed in many ways, with two chhanges that have made a large impact. First of all, what was originally planned to be an annual holiday has evolved to become a weekly ritual for many families. Many people celebrate every Wednesday at the breakfast table, while still staying true to their roots for the March ceremonies. Second, today Waffle Wednesday is more widespread than ever; it is celebrated all over by families, soccer teams and schools all over Southern Ontario.</p>

<p><b>There's a new terrorist threat in this country, ladies and gentlemen.</b> It's called <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Dollar_26f8.html" title="Liberty Dollar">NORFED</a>, and it wants to steal your hard-earned American dollars and suck your blood out through your eye sockets. As degerate and drug addled as he was, the rock and roll singer <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a> knew about this threat, thirty or so years before it manifested itself as NORFED. "Five to one, baby. One in five. No one here gets out alive," he sang, obviously referring to NORFED's practice of selling silver for several times its real value. If he isn't the black leather-clad reincarnation of <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nostradamus.html" title="Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a>, well, I'll eat my hat.</p>
<p>I have been accused by Kurt Weber, an admitted NORFED sympathizer and possible subscriber to <i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier_of_Fortune_a9b5.html" title="Soldier of Fortune">Soldier of Fortune</a></i>, of "going way too far." Well, I don't think you can go too far when it comes to the Truth, and <b>I have only begun to go too far.</b> I try to be a <b>uniter, not a divider</b>, but sometimes you have to <b>stay the course</b> and make a stand against the <b>Evildoers</b> who will not rest until every man, woman, and child in this great land is encumbered and weighed down by piles of filthy lucre. The reason for this is very simple. If your pockets are full of heavy metal, the terrorists will not have to weigh you down before throwing you into the river. Never has silver been used as <b>weapons</b> whose <b>mass</b> cause such <b>destruction.</b></p>
<p>We have grown accustomed to terrorists being foreign men with brown skin who wear colorful, cloth headgear. We need to recognize a new kind of threat: the so-called Patriot. The Patriot can be seen in Western states like Idaho that have a soft spot for the right-wing lunatic fringe. These cannibalistic monsters can be seen wandering between the tables at gun shows, spattered with the blood of innocent infants, decked out in aviator sunglasses, beards, and secondhand army fatigues, spontaneously ejaculating at the thought of raping innocent women while hopped up on reefer. They stockpile guns and hoard silver for the End-Times while plotting their own mass suicides as a means of bringing about the end of the world.</p>
<p>Even the acclaimed director Stanley Kubrick knew about the kind of mostrous, subversive threat posed by NORFED and the so-called "Patriots" who support it, and wrote this into the film <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Strangelove_67b2.html" title="Dr. Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a>: "I can no longer sit back and allow NORFED infiltration, NORFED indoctrination, NORFED subversion and the international Liberty Dollar conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids." This issue requires that I take a firm stand against the domestic terrorists who would metaphorically beat and sodomize the American people. I will draw a line in the sand and sing out proudly that <b>this aggression will not stand!</b> Claim your Freedom, America, and reject the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Dollar_26f8.html" title="Liberty Dollar">Liberty Dollar</a>!</p>

<p>Jagannatha Harinama Party (JHP) is a group of traveling Hare Krishna monks founded in 1996 in Croatia. JHP consist mainly of monks from various Hare Krishna temples in Croatia and an occasional member from a different country (Sweden, Slovenia, Germany...). The group's main goal was to travel through the country and perform traditional devotional songs on the city streets and market squares. JHP features qualified musicians with specific style that mixes traditional Indian Bengali tunes with local melodies resulting in lively compositions that invoke festive mood when performed. The group was very successful especially during the summer season, traveling from the norther part of Croatian coast (Umag, Porec, Rovinj, Pula) all the way down to the far south of Dalmatian coast (Makarska, Dubrovnik), visiting all the major islands on the way down (Krk, Cres, Rab, Hvar, Brac). Since most of the Croatian tourist places and major cities don't have any standard street performers, JHP group was welcomed as a refreshing addition to everyday life. While restaurants, cafe bars and night clubs offer but a mediocre entertainment for any tourist that visits Croatia, JHP with their attractive setup, lights, lyrics display, colorful traditional outfits and dancing girls, offer superior entertainment to any open minded person who happened to be there. They usually appear on the market square around 8pm and start their performance before 9pm finishing at around 11pm. The number of audience varies from 100 to 400 people, curiously watching Hare Krishna monks joyfully singing various devotional tunes out of which the famous Hare Krishna mantra can be heard mostly. The group maintains themselves by accepting donations from their audiences as well as selling books, sacred ornaments and CDs. They usually find their lodging places under the stars, somewhere out on the local beaches or camping sites but in the winter season they stay at the local temples or at the house of some congregational member and volunteer.</p>
<p>In the mid 1999 the group moved to Los Angeles, USA and it is still performing there, especially for the famous annual Halloween Harinama in Hollywood where they get hundreds of people dancing while they play their famous festive tunes and chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
<p>They desire is to eventually come back to Croatia and continue their touring the same way they did in the nineties, but they leave that decision up to Krishna, God.</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Not because of the nomination, though. I'm not going to userfy as the final editor suggested since it really doesn't seem at all likely that the editor would want it: they asked for its deletion after all. If they <i>do</i> want it, they can let me know of course. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:25, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thw WACEC was an organization founded by the modest, honorable, loyal, spectacular User:1028 to prevent a violent attack against Wikipedia by <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Chuck E. Cheese</a>.User:1028 posted an article on Tuesday to warn the Wikipedians about the possibility of this attack. However, Chuck E. Cheese incognito said to User:1028, "Please stop adding the Charles Edward Cheese article. It is nonsense." User:1028 was a little suspicious about this, so he pretended to be Pres. G.W. Bush to see if Chuck would listen to authority. Chuck E. replied to him that it ws obvious that User:1028 was not Bush. That moment, User:1028 discovered something remarkable:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.He had to have been on the Charles Edward Cheese article to have insulted it.</li>
<li>2.He treated it as nonsense because it was harsh on Chuck E. Cheese.</li>
</ul>
<p>Judging by these two facts, User:1028 discovered that the Wikipedia member was Chuck E. Cheese, and deleting the article that put him in a bad light was only part one of his evil plan to take over the universe! He didn't want any internet sites from stopping him in his universal conquest. The moment he realized that, he formed the WACEC along with two other members in fear that Chuck E. Cheese would be deleting other articles also. Thw WACEC waited eagerly for the Cheese master's response. It was, "The article you posted yesterday is indeed nonsense, since many of the purported actions that Mr. Cheese took are completely impossible. Your statements on my talk page that I am the subject of the article make it even more clear that you are posting nonsense. No one can stop me in my universal conquest now. HAHAHA!" thw WACEC decided to fight back and inform him of why the things he did are too possible. The letter consisted of,</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it impossible to lose a basketball game?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to be born in a log cabin?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to have your parents get killed by crazy rednecks?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to dump a rat into boiling toxic uranium?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to start a pizza place?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to attack someone because you think they're a stranger?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to have diarrhea on your walls?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to make $50?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to invade the Czech Republic?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to win an employee of the month election by a narrow margin?</li>
<li>Is it impossible to demand a recount?</li>
</ul>
<p>The WACEC has not heard a response from him in two days. Members were celebrating, but User:1028 was still doubtful that he would surrender so quickly, just to make sure, he sent a truse on the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.Chuck E. Cheese is a real person.</li>
<li>2.The Charles Edward Cheese article gets to stay.</li>
<li>3.He must donate $1,000,000 to the WACEC(Wikipedians Against Chuck E. Cheese) Fondation</li>
</ul>
<p>The WACEC is still awaiting his response.</p>
