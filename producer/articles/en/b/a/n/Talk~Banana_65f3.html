<p>I've read somewhere that the banana tree is not a tree per se, but rather an herb. Any truth to this? <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKent_Wang_61ca.html" title="User:Kent Wang">Kent Wang</a> 22:28, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC) I have also heard this and think it should be made clearer in the article that it is indeed a herb. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenfeed9_656f.html" title="User:Chickenfeed9">Chickenfeed9</a> 15:20, 2 November 2006 (UTC) something I'm wondering about, can a plant change it's identity from a herb to a woody plant? I live in Ohio and there when I plant annual herbs (for example, basil) they die in a year. But in Florida (where my uncle also grows basil) many herbs - who would in Ohio be annuals - grow all year round. Instead of being herbs, they look more like small trees. Anybody know anything more about this? Pasque 16:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>many species eat bananas, including humans. Why only mention one group - and if anything the stereotype banana-eater is probably the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimpanzee.html" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a> rather than monkeys.

<p>As a teacher of biology some years ago in a British port which imported and stored bananas, I was never short of specimens of insects and spiders (including tarantulas) brought to school for identification by the children of workers on the docksides and in the banana stores. Too common an occurrence to be considered all THAT newsworthy by the local daily newspaper. It had to be a pretty big spider to get a mention!</p>
<p>Not a myth. Merely a fact.</p>

<p>This has been moved here from so users know why it was removed. Original text in the <i>legends</i> section of the article was</p>

<p>Obviously the above text can be improved to explain why it remains only a legend, the chimps statement etc, but it was deleted entirely-</p>

<dd>Then you entirely missed the point about it being in the <i>legends</i> section of the article, and clearly using the word <i>legend</i> in the statement. In future you may want to consider either changing information for clarity (add an extra statement saying it is not true, for readers that didn't notice it was in the <i>legends</i> section of the article), or alternatively, correcting it (for example by changing chimps to earlier hominid species etc.) rather than deleting it entirely.

<dd>Then your editing would be inconsistent, as there is only one other source reference in the Legends section of the banana article, but you did not delete those others.

<p>The Cavendish isn't going to go extinct: the Gros Michel hasn't gone extinct, and is still grown by small plantations and hobbyists. The danger is that like the Gros Michel, it might become unsuitable for large-scale production if effective methods of combatting Race 4 aren't found. This could impact the US and Europe consumer, as the Cavendish is very well suited to growing in Central America and Africa, and the fruit is hardy enough to survive shipping.</p>

<p>It has been a long-held belief among people that I know that bananas always have five sides. I can't seem to find any information about this anywhere online - is this a characteristic of the current mass-consumption bananas, or is it just another urban legend?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that might be right, they do have "flats", if not "sides". I'm not sure if they always have 5, but it wouldn't suprise me, especially if the flower from which the fruit grows had 5 petals. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 02:06, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just another urban legend. Bananas, like all <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monocot.html" title="Monocot">monocots</a>, have tripartite flower and fruit parts; a quick look at a few bananas does show a vaguely 3-ridged shape, and the black flower scar at the end is triangular.

<p>I am working on combining “Banana pests and diseases” with “Extinction”, but it might take a few days to clarify a couple of things, after which time the whole thing should be less wordy.

<li>I have merged these two together, but still need to add in genetics, in-vitro production (When does a banana tree look like a bean sprout?&#160;:), and nematodes. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 20:48, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Nice editing job, but I notice that you removed the paragraph explaining that 'Cavendish' only makes up about 10% of world production, and that its 'extinction' would only affect world trade, not production for local consumption. Any particular reason? Assuming it's true, I think that this fact contributes a lot to the 'extinction' discussion, and would be worth reinstating. (Overall, the combination of the facts that bananas are such a huge crop and staple starch for so many people, and the fact that the viability of a leading variety is under threat, is quite alarming until you understand that the 'extinction' panic only relates to the export trade.) Robert Sinton 21:50, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Good point and yes it needs to be added back in, although maybe in a wider context. Most ppl in the tropics relay upon green cooking bananas (well that’s way too broad of a statement as well); however, the Cavendish is still the main desert (yellow) banana world wide. I am going to try to put the whole thing together into some logical wording in the next couple of days. Really the bigger discussion is the genetics, almost every banana verity we have today is a clone to some degree of a plant that some farmer found thousand of years ago, and this is the Achilles heal of the domesticated banana. So the extinction issue goes far beyond just the Cavendish.</li>
</ul>
<p>So to understand the whole thing, as I see it, you need some simple basic discussion of genetics, the process of crossing a domesticated banana variety with one of its wild cousins, and where things are headed at this time. Until you have that you leave room for both doomsayers and others who claim nothing is really amiss -the truth appears to be somewhere in-between the two. Hope my answer helps more then hurts.</p>
<p>In a month or two I hope to be back down at FHIA (Honduran Foundation of Agricultural Research) and bring some of their researchers to the discussion. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 01:05, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am going to cut the following text from Banana:</p>
<p><i>However unlike other fruits, bananas have only recently been used to prepare juice and squashes. Despite an 85% water content, it has historically been difficult to extract juice from the fruit because when compressed, a banana simply turns to pulp. In 2004, scientists at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), India, patented a technique for extracting juice by treating banana pulp in a reaction vessel for four to six hours [1].</i></p>
<p>The 85% water is clearly wrong, and appears to be a typo from the story; “ <i>Despite an 85 per cent water content</i>” and “ <i>The technique extracts about 85 per cent of the fruit's juice while the solid leftover</i>” both appear in the text, and apparently the 85 was used twice, when it should say something like “75% water “ instead. Also the other citations talk about a two day process involving adding an enzyme to break down the pulp. Overall the article cited here varies in a number of ways from other sources.</p>
<p>The obvious answer would be to rewrite the text to better cover the process; however, so far no one has shown any real world interest in the process, and so it still stands as just a successful lab experiment, and hence not worth noting in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 16:20, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states that serotonin is unsuitable for smoking (due to high melting point); the issue is not trying to smoke serotonin, it's to smoke the tryptophan to let the brain create serotonin.

If it's not worth finding out, then perhaps remove the paragraph because there is no reason to state the melting point of serotonin in this article at all! 144.13.213.211 01:15, 12 April 2006 (UTC) [Anonymous Science Student]</p>

If eating 10000 kJ of a product (or 300 g if it is a low-calorie product) doesn't provide you with much more than 100% of the RDA, I don't include it, unless the article text makes specific claims.

<p>Somebody keeps posting the totally inaccurate claim that the word <i>banana</i> is derived from the Arabic <i>banan</i>, meaning <i>finger</i>. In fact, the word is of West African origin. There's no scholarly debate about this whatsoever. Any source you check (for instance, this one <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/banana" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/banana" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) will explain that to you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't weigh in one way or the other, but I wouldn't consider an online dictionary to be a very authoritative scholarly reference. In fact I tried doing some websearches and found that there are indeed some published scholarly claims that the word banana is derived from the Arabic "banan" (for example <a href="http://www.2004.botanyconference.org/engine/search/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=276" class="external text" title="http://www.2004.botanyconference.org/engine/search/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=276" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Etymological myth? Arabocentrism? I have no idea but note also that the two etymologies are not necessarily mutually exclusive; Africa and Arabia are in close proximity and both African and Arabic words for "banana" could be derived from the same ancient root (and since cultivated bananas probably originated in Asia rather than Africa, it's possible that the etymology is neither African nor Arabic). At the very least, the text of the article should reflect any scholarly uncertainty or disagreement that exists. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My Chambers dictionary says West Africa through Portuguses or Spanish, Arabic looks like a red herring based on a word similarity. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 16:32, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My Shorter Oxford Dictionary states that the work derives from the Spanish and Portugese, in turn from the Mande, a large group of peoples from West Africa.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've removed the latest claim of an Arabic origin of the word. This may very well be true, but I have not been able to confirm it in the literature, and have found several references (none as reliable as I would like, or I would cite them) that the word has an African origin. Both sides should probably be represented, but citations for the claims are necessary for both claims. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 18:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually it's 15% which is small by no means. In any case, I thof ink you might be missing the point. Remember that banana's are a staple food crop and a very important one to many people. We can presume that it's far more likely someone from many developing countries will be able to eat 200g banana then even 25g of oranges...

<p>This article states that "from a strict economic perspective only Costa Rica, Honduras, and Panama were actual "banana republics", countries with economies dominated by the banana trade."</p>
<p>I respectfully disagree about Panama being a country who's economy was dominated by the banana trade. Panama's economy has historically been service oriented and most GDP is produced in the Panama City - Colón corridor (essentially, the areas which are near the Panama canal).</p>
<p>Bananas in Panama were only grown in westernmost Panama (Westernmost Bocas del Toro on the Caribbean and westernmost Chiriquí on the Pacific side), with very little incidence for the rest of the country (Bocas del Toro historically was a region which was dominated by the banana trade, but Chiriquí certainly was not).</p>
<p>I request that the reference to Panama as a country whose economy was/is dominated by the banana trade be struck off.</p>

<p>India introduced banana to the world. Alexander the Great discovers the taste of the banana in the Indian valleys in 327 BC . In 650 AD, Islamic conquerors brought the banana back to Palestine. The Arabic merchants finally spread the bananas all over Africa. Only in 1502 the Portuguese start the first banana plantation in the Caribbean and in central America.</p>
<p>The banana has been cultivated in India for at least 4,000 years. Banana has been recorded in many hindu scripts. Likewise, China’s historians mention banana cultivation as early as 200 A.D. However, the spread of bananas to Africa was much more important. They probably arrived in Madagascar, and then made their way to the mainland. This influx of bananas to Africa led to further spread by vegetative propagation. In Africa, as well as in India, several mutations occurred, producing different varieties of banana. From Africa, the banana made its way to the Canary Islands. Several of the varieties from the Canary Islands were brought to Central America and the Caribbean with explorers and Spanish missionaries.</p>
<p>The banana began its history as a world-wide commodity only in the past century and a half. While bananas were brought to the Americas early in explorations and by missionaries, it was not until the mid-1800s that they were really introduced to the United States, and then only as an exotic desert. From there, the banana’s popularity grew and became a staple fruit with many uses beyond desert. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.107.0.73_142d.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.107.0.73">131.107.0.73</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/1/User_talk%7E131.107.0.73.html" title="User talk:131.107.0.73">talk</a>) 22:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC).</small>64.184.29.114 23:02, 5 April 2007 (UTC)me...who else??64.184.29.114 23:02, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
