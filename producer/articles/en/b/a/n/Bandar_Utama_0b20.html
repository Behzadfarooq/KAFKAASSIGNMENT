<p>As of 2004 it is estimated that there are 59,040 people residing in Bandar Utama. The primary residents appear to be <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_race.html" title="Chinese race">Chinese</a>, followed by <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_people.html" title="Malay people">Malay</a>. However, there were nearby <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatter.html" title="Squatter">squatter</a> settlements of <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_immigrant.html" title="Illegal immigrant">illegal immigrants</a> in the neighbouring Kayu Ara village which is enclosed by Bandar Utama and <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damansara_Utama_27b6.html" title="Damansara Utama">Damansara Utama</a>. They have now mostly been relocated to nearby low-cost flats and their squatter houses demolished to make way for legal developments.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandar_Utama_0b20.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Until 1991, the area of Bandar Utama consisted of nothing more than <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_oil.html" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a> estates. In the early 1990s, development began in Bandar Utama under See Hoy Chan Holdings Sdn. Bhd., and an attempt to modernise the area was made, with the opening of a <a href="../../../t/v/3/TV3_%28Malaysia%29_1236.html" title="TV3 (Malaysia)">TV3</a> station in Bandar Utama, as well as the 1 Utama Shopping Centre, which became increasingly well known after the Jaya Jusco chain of department stores shifted their outlet in <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuala_Lumpur_b5d7.html" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>/<a href="../../../s/e/l/Selangor.html" title="Selangor">Selangor</a> from their old quarters in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Taman_Tun_Dr_Ismail_d0ae.html" title="Taman Tun Dr Ismail">Taman Tun Dr Ismail</a>, Kuala Lumpur to Bandar Utama in 1995.</p>
<p>With the opening of schools in 1997 and 1998, as well as the establishment of Kolej Bandar Utama, a tertiary institution, Bandar Utama began to grow. As of 2004, construction of the residential areas of BU7, BU10 and BU6(comprised of 2 1/2 storey houses) has been completed. These are newer sections of Bandar Utama compared to the older sections, BU1 till BU4, which were completed in phases beginning from 1991 till 1996.</p>
<p><a name="Geography" id="Geography"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandar_Utama_0b20.html" title="Edit section: Geography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
<p>Bandar Utama is roughly 1000 acres (4 km²) in size, and is divided into 12 sections ranging from BU1 to BU12. These sections are served by roads, e.g. Jalan BU2/5 where "Jalan" is a Malay word meaning road, BU2 is the section and 5 is the road number. Houses on one side of the road are numbered evenly, and the other side are numbered oddly, so one side of a road will consist of houses 2, 4, 6, 8 and so forth while the opposite will have houses numbered 1, 3, 5, 7 and so on.</p>
<p>A bridge over the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Klang_Valley_Expressway_beae.html" title="North Klang Valley Expressway">North Klang Valley Expressway</a> (NKVE) joins the two parts of Bandar Utama, sections BU1 till BU10 and BU11 with BU12, which are separated by the NKVE.</p>
<p>To go to Bandar Utama, via the northbound route of NKVE, you should see the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> building on your left, right after the toll plaza. Continue straight, all the way down until you see an intersection on your left leading to <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damansara_Jaya_e74e.html" title="Damansara Jaya">Damansara Jaya</a>. Make a U-turn here and continue. Just before you see the toll booth again, go up the ramp on your left. At the traffic light you can opt to turn left to go to BU11/BU12 or to turn right to head to the BU1 till BU10.</p>
<p>If coming from the Lebuhraya Damansara Puchong (LDP; in English, the <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damansara-Puchong_Expressway_c4c8.html" title="Damansara-Puchong Expressway">Damansara-Puchong Expressway</a>), look out for <a href="../../../t/a/m/Taman_Tun_Dr_Ismail_d0ae.html" title="Taman Tun Dr Ismail">Taman Tun Dr Ismail</a> on your left. When you see the intersection leading to it on your left, turn right instead towards the 1 Utama shopping centre, and Bandar Utama. If coming from the opposite direction, look out for the pink facade of One Utama on your left and turn left at the appropriate intersection.</p>

<p>For <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christians</a>, there are no active churches in Bandar Utama as of 2004. Most <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_Movement_2d1b.html" title="Charismatic Movement">Charismatics</a> opt for Grace Assembly or Damansara Utama Methodist Church, both of which are located in Taman SEA (SEA Park). <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Roman Catholics</a> tend to worship at the Church of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Ignatius_38c4.html" title="St. Ignatius">St. Ignatius</a>, near <i>Kampung Cempaka</i> (Cempaka Village) or Kristus Aman, located in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Taman_Tun_Dr_Ismail_d0ae.html" title="Taman Tun Dr Ismail">Taman Tun Dr Ismail</a>.</p>
<p>There is a <i>surau</i> (prayer hall) for <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslims</a> around BU3 and BU4, and the squatter village of Kayu Ara has a <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandar_Utama_0b20.html" title="Edit section: Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>
<p>There are three primary schools (not inclusive of 2 vernacular primary schools) and four secondary schools in Bandar Utama. The first primary school was opened near BU12 in 1998, but as of 2004 has began to languish due to the opening of primary schools on the other side of Bandar Utama.</p>
<p>The first secondary school (SMK Bandar Utama) was also opened around the same time. The school has enjoyed an increase in media coverage particularly due to their performance in the annual The Star National Best School Newspaper Competition; in which the 2003 class of 4 Adil won runner-up. This includes a recent Student Exchange Programme held between Peicai Secondary School, Singapore and SMK Bandar Utama which had gained the approval from the Ministry Of Education with the aim to foster stronger relations between the schools in our neighbouring country. This programme had also been highlighted in stuff@school pullout of The Star newspaper.</p>
<p>There is a propensity for some parents to school their children outside Bandar Utama, particularly for those living on the BU11/BU12 side, who tend to send their children to the Tropicana primary or secondary schools in Sunway Damansara, or the highly reputed primary and secondary schools at <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damansara_Utama_27b6.html" title="Damansara Utama">Damansara Utama</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damansara_Jaya_e74e.html" title="Damansara Jaya">Damansara Jaya</a>.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="../../../s/m/k/SMK_Damansara_Jaya_89e8.html" title="SMK Damansara Jaya">SMK Damansara Jaya</a> not only excels academically, it has also built a strong name for itself in co-curricular activities. A very prominent product of SMK Damansara Jaya is its debate team which, to date, has won eight national inter-school debating titles in the last seven years. These tournaments include the prestigious national Tan Sri Datuk Wira Abdul Rahman Arshad Cup (2001 and 2003), Taylor’s College Annual Inter-School Debate competition (2000, 2002, 2005, 2006) and HELP University College’s Tan Sri Paduka Dr Saleha Debate Cup (2004 and 2006).</p>
<p>There is also the <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolej_Damansara_Utama_3a8d.html" title="Kolej Damansara Utama">Kolej Damansara Utama</a> (KBU), a private tertiary institution.</p>

<p>There is a community centre that was recently built (circa 2004-2005), that is situated between BU6 and BU3. This community centre contains a community hall, a football (<a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a>) field, and a few badminton courts. It was built as a trade-off for not building low-cost houses.</p>

<p>Residents of Bandar Utama tend to shop at the 1 Utama shopping mall, the largest in <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damansara.html" title="Damansara">Damansara</a>. 1 Utama is located at the far end of the BU1 till BU10 side (right along the <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damansara-Puchong_Expressway_c4c8.html" title="Damansara-Puchong Expressway">Damansara-Puchong Expressway</a>), and quite a distance from BU11 and BU12. It is tenanted by almost every international brand, and includes homegrown brands such as <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Food_3d44.html" title="Giant Food">Giant</a> supermarket and some very large <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cineplex.html" title="Cineplex">cineplex</a>. A significant number of international tourists also shop at 1 Utama. It has been well patronised since its opening in 1995, allowing it to more than double its size since then. As of 2004 it spans more than 5 million square feet, making it one of the largest malls in Malaysia. Construction is under way to further extend its size.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/e/n/Centrepoint.html" title="Centrepoint">Centrepoint</a>, a much smaller commercial complex is also frequented by those who do not feel like travelling to the far end of Bandar Utama. It is located in the heart of the neighbourhood, and is much more cosy than One Utama. It thrives in particular on officeworkers in a hurry having their lunch breaks, as well as students from the three secondary schools within walking distance of it, who dislike the food provided by the school canteens for lunch. It is also right next to a <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a> drive-through franchise.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> outlet, the Ikano <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Centre_3388.html" title="Power Centre">Power Centre</a>, the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curve.html" title="Curve">Curve</a> mall and the largest <a href="../../../i/k/e/Ikea.html" title="Ikea">Ikea</a> outlet in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> have opened in the adjacent township of <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutiara_Damansara_fd36.html" title="Mutiara Damansara">Mutiara Damansara</a>. This has provided ever more choice to the residents of Bandar Utama. There are also free bus services from the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curve.html" title="Curve">Curve</a> to <a href="../../../b/u/k/Bukit_Bintang_c393.html" title="Bukit Bintang">Bintang Walk</a>, and from 1 Utama to <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Hartamas_43d0.html" title="Sri Hartamas">Sri Hartamas</a>.</p>
<p>Covered parking in 1 Utama is <a href="../../../r/m/_/RM_2622.html" title="RM">RM</a>1 for the 1st 6 hours, and costs RM 2.00 for the consecutive hours. Recently the administration of 1Utama's parking lots added a convenient Toucn n Go service to the parking system, and it costs RM1.10 for the first 6 hours, and RM2.20 for the consecutive hours, basically being 10% more than paying by cash. There is also a Preferred Parking zone located at the new wing on Level 3, charging slightly more. The open air parking is at a flat rate of RM1 per entry. They have reinstated a free pass-through for the car park if you are parking or passing through the car park for less than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Centrepoint recently introduced parking fees effective 1st April 2006. On weekdays, the first hour is free of charge. The second and third hours are charged at 50sen each, and the following hours at RM1 each. There is no charge for entry after 6pm on weekdays, and all day for weekends and public holidays. You do not need to validate your parking ticket if you are exiting within the free parking timeframe allocated.</p>
<p>There are frequent bus transfers to and from the <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelana_Jaya_9e53.html" title="Kelana Jaya">Kelana Jaya</a> <a href="../../../l/r/t/LRT_5b3e.html" title="LRT">LRT</a> <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_station.html" title="Railway station">station</a> at 30 minute intervals at the New Wing bus stop. There are also RapidKL busses serving the area.</p>
<p>The ramp heading downwards from the NKVE flyover (connecting both sides of Bandar Utama) to Tropicana and the Damansara NKVE toll has since been closed for construction work. To get to the toll booth, you will have to now take the KL-bound exit and make a U-Turn at the Damansara Jaya exit, keeping in mind not to go on the flyover passing over the nearest U-Turn.</p>
