<p>Bantustan was never an official term for the homelands, it was a term created by the policy's opponents in order to point out how ridiculous the claim of their independant truly was. In this regard the use of the term Bantustan with the "-stan" reminds the reader of the various Soviet satellites, which though nominally independant USSR countries, were quite obviously and blatantly Russian puppets, and so the reality that the Homelands were merely puppet states of the Apartheid govt is revealed to the reader. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 00:39, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is ridiculous. Some people may compare it to Israel, but some of the same people also compare Israel to Nazism, it is uterly unencyclopedic.

<dd>You and Humus seriously misunderstand the point of this section. We aren't in the business of determining whether the "Bantustan" tag is justified - all we're doing is documenting how it's been used. That is encyclopedic <b>by definition</b>. Presenting a POV as fact could be considered propangandistic. <i>Describing</i> a particular POV neutrally isn't. In fact, doing this is explicitly required by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that the term "Bantustan" is used in relation to Israel is indisputable, <i>whether or not you agree with it being justifiable</i>. Google returns over 72,000 results on the two terms, Google Books finds 91 books using the terms (including an entire book called "Bantustan Gaza" from 1985) and Google News retrieves 16 press articles using the terms in the last month alone. The use of the term is certainly controversial but the fact that it has been widely used in the first place cannot reasonably be disputed. If you are deleting a neutral statement of fact because you dislike the subject matter, that's of course a violation of the NPOV policy. Don't do it. And frankly, as an administrator Humus should know better. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 12:23, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are not arguing that the comparison hasn't been made, or even that it isn't common. We are arguing that the section is completly unencyclopedic and needlessly inflammatory. It would be one thing to make the case that the presentation of the accusation that "Israel is enacting a policy of forced segregation" is widely believed to the point that it is notable enough for an encylopedia, however it is an entirely different thing to take a word completely out of its context and apply it Israel's policies. The comparison that Palestinian refugee camps are equivalent to Nazi death camps is at the very least as common a comparison. Including a section in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> article about its comparison to Israel's policies is also very similar to the section in this article. It is obvious that none of the aformentioned examples belong in anancyclopedia.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 07:42, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sure you'd object if, for instance, a holocaust denier deleted any referenced material on the holocaust because he disagreed with it.

<dd>No, it's a warning against engaging in POV-driven deletions - it's something I've seen more than enough of in the many Balkans-related articles I've edited. It's your personal POV that the comparison is unfair and unjustified. It's other people's personal POV that the comparison is fair and accurate. We aren't in the business of ruling in favour of one POV or the other. <i>But we should at least mention the claim</i>, given that it's one that's been made by many different mainstream sources. You don't have to agree with the claim to acknowledge that it exists. If it exists, which it does, and it's widespread enough to be noteworthy, which it is, it should be mentioned. None of this implies acceptance or agreement of the claim. This article doesn't even <i>discuss</i> the rights or wrongs of the claim (and nor should it) - it merely notes that it exists and directs the reader to a more detailed article. You claim that your objection only relates to the comparison with Israel's policies, which is discussed in a single paragraph.

<dd>I believe I made it clear what I meant by unencyclopedic, and it clearly had nothing to do with my pov. When someone compares Israel's policies to the holocaust what they mean is that Israel is systematically and deliberatly killing Palestinains, Although I do not think that they are doing that, if the belief was widespread enough, it would be encyclopedic to say "Many individuals and organizations have accused Israel of engaging in an campaign of systemetic killings of innocent Palestinians". However, It would not be encyclopedic to state "Many individuals and organizations have accused Israel of launching a holocaust against the Palestinains". The reason is because "holocaust" is used for a specific context and to take it outside that context and emotively apply it to the policies of another nation is extremely inflammatory and unnecessary. Similarly when someone states that a Palestinain state would be another Bantustan, they are really accusing Israel of creating a non-economically viable state which in reality is still heavily dependent on Israel, so it would be encyclopedic to state "Many individuals and organizations have accused Israel of purposely creating a Palestinian state that in reality is not independent or economically viable", but to take the word "Bantustan" which very specifically refers to an aspect of the old White South African regime and apply it to the policies of Israel conjures up emotive memories of Apartheid. That is what I mean by unencyclopedic.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 21:15, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid that's completely irrelevant to the subject of the article. It's not about the status of a Palestinian state - it's about the origins, history and usage of the term "Bantustan". The last section of the article is intended to document that the term has been adopted for a variety of non-South African purposes <i>because</i> it now has so many negatives attached to it. That's an interesting phenomenon, both politically and philologically, which is why it's worth documenting in the first place. You might be interested to know that 40 years ago Bantustans weren't seen in such a negative light outside of SA - I found a contemporary report of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moshe_Dayan_197d.html" title="Moshe Dayan">Moshe Dayan</a> citing the Bantustan model as an approach that Israel could use for the West Bank. ("Problems of victory divide Israelis", <i>The Times</i>, London, 15 June 1967.) I don't think any politician anywhere in the world would dare to make such a comparison in a positive sense now! -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:36, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry but I just do not follow your reasoning of why my argument was "irrelevant", you are suggesting that because the negative connotations did not always exist for "Bantustan", it is acceptable to apply the word to present circumstances? I would say that the level of negative connotation did not always exists for "concentration camps" or "holocaust", however when one conjures up the imagery of these words, they are not doing so in the context of when they were not loaded words, they are using them to remind the listener of negative circumstances.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 01:38, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Irrelevant argument again. The section <b>does not present any arguments for or against the usage</b>. It merely <b>notes that the usage exists</b>. WP:RS would only be relevant in this context if someone denied that the term "Bantustan" has ever been used in the context of Israel. You believe that the Bantustan comparison is unfair. Fine - I agree. But the article doesn't discuss the <i>merits</i> of the way that the term is used - pro or con - and nor should it; the arguments for or against are simply not relevant to an article on <i>usage</i>. Please take your arguments, pro and con, to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> or <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>, rather than trying to insert them into this article. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 02:18, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a> has objected to the statement that outside of SA, the term "has most often been used in relation to the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>". Here's a quick way of verifying that. Googling for the term "Bantustan" returns 162,000 results. "Bantustan -"South Africa"" produces 87,800 results. "Bantustan israel OR israeli" produces 73,800 results. "bantustan "south africa" israel OR israeli" produces 31,200 results. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 50% of all references to "Bantustan" found by Google relate to South Africa</li>
<li>About 20% of all references to "Bantustan" relate to both South Africa and Israel</li>
<li>About 40% of all references to "Bantustan" relate to Israel alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think on that basis it's safe to say that the most common use in a non-South African context relates to Israel. Again, you might not agree with this being fair, but as a fact it's easily provable. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:01, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's ignore the fact that Google usage can often be irrelevant to Wikipedia (since Google tends to find mostly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unreliable sources</a>), and focus on the more important issue. What you are saying is that you did some <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, based on some Google searches, and came to the conclusion that the term was "most often" and "frequently" used in relation to Israel. That's an interesting "previously unpublished theory, data, statement, concept, argument, or idea"; it may even be true. However, it is a classic example of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which is forbidden by Wikipedia policy. Please find some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> source which makes this claim or argument, as we can't go about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifying</a> this with the footnote "According to some Google searches done by Wikipedia editor ChrisO". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 14:07, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've missed an important point. The output of a database such as Google (or any other database for that matter) <i>isn't</i> original research on my part.

<dd>No, <i>you</i> have missed the point. You've used a dubious tool to do some research, and based on that research come up with a previously unpublished idea, that the term "bantustan" is used "most often" in relation to Israel.

<dd>Chris, it's definitely OR to say "most often" and "frequently," because without a source, it's a Wikipedia editor's opinion based on looking at one search engine. You would need to find an authoritative source who actually made that claim, and then quote him or her. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:10, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll accept your point on "most often", for the sake of agreement - I don't think it's worth splitting hairs over it. However, I do think we need to note - somewhere, somehow - that the comparison has <i>often</i> been made. Leaving the "often" out implies that the term has been used equally often with regard to Canada, Yugoslavia, Hawaii etc. which doesn't appear to be the case. As it happens, I should be able to do a Lexis-Nexis check tomorrow to get some firmer data and hopefully some authoritative quotes. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 20:28, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again "Often" would be OR since you have not provided an actual source that states the comparison "has often been made", you may say it is common sense because of the google search, but that would be almost as bad as me suggesting it is common sense that it is not because I have never heard anyone say it.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 20:39, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So now we have several instances of non-SA, non-Israeli mentions of bantustan supported by one reference each, compared to 73,000 mentions wrt Israel, but only two of those are referenced here. I think we have policies about not giving equal weight to beliefs of large numbers vs one or two people. Obviously the intent is to insinuate that Israel is just like Canada in this respect. So I will delete all the non-Israel ones unless someone can show that they sufficiently numerically significant to satisfy the "appropriate weight" rule. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourtildas_846b.html" title="User:Fourtildas">Fourtildas</a> 06:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
