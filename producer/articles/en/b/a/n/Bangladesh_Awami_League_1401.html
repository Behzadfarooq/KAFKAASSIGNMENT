<p>The "All Pakistan Awami Muslim League" was formed as a breakaway faction of the "<a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_League_a76d.html" title="Muslim League">All Pakistan Muslim League</a>" in 1949. The word "Muslim" was dropped in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>. Two parties of the same name were created in <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, one in the then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> by <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maulana_Bhashani_6972.html" title="Maulana Bhashani">Maulana Abdul Hameed Khan Bhashani</a> with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as one of its three initial assistant general secretaries; and the other in the <a href="../../../n/w/f/NWFP_ad6b.html" title="NWFP">Northwest Frontier Province</a> of the then <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Pakistan_22a4.html" title="West Pakistan">West Pakistan</a> by Peer Manki Shareef sometime soon after. In February 1950, both were merged, creating the "All Pakistan Awami Muslim League" with <a href="../../../h/u/s/Huseyn_Shaheed_Suhrawardy_ee7a.html" title="Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy">Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy</a> as its leader. As the years went by, the Awami League became associated with the oppressed <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangla.html" title="Bangla">Bangla</a>-speaking majority of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Pakistan_505e.html" title="East Pakistan">East Pakistan</a>. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was elected party president in 1966, and the AL gained much popularity through the famous 6 point movement.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_point_movement.html" title="Six point movement">6-point demands</a>, proposed by Mujib, were widely accepted by the East Pakistani populace, as it proposed greater autonomy for the provinces of Pakistan. After the so-called Agartala Conspiracy Case and subsequent fall of the Ayub Khan regime in Pakistan, Awami League and their leader Sheikh Mujib reached the peak of their popularity among the East Pakistani Bengali population. In the elections of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, Awami League won 167 of 169 East Pakistan seats in the National Assembly but none of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Pakistan_22a4.html" title="West Pakistan">West Pakistan</a>'s 138 seats. It also won 288 of the 300 provincial assembly seats in East Pakistan.<a href="http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A140&amp;Pg=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A140&amp;Pg=2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://ghazali.net/book1/body_chapter_5.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ghazali.net/book1/body_chapter_5.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This win gave the Awami League a healthy majority in the 313-seat National Assembly, and placed it in a position to establish a government without coalition partners. This led directly to the events of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Liberation_War_b476.html" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a>. The AL leaders, exiled in India, successfully led the war against the Pakistani Army throughout 1971.</p>

<p>The party came to power after independence in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> under Mujib, and the party name was changed into "Awami League". However, the party was disturbed by internal corruption and failed to some extent to repair the nation's wounds from the independence war. As Bangladesh continued exporting <a href="../../../j/u/t/Jute.html" title="Jute">jute</a> to Egypt violating US economic sanctions, the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Nixon</a> government barred food-grain imports that Bangladesh had already paid for from reaching the country. As a result, the famine of 1974 was inevitable. 28,000 people died, and support for Mujib declined dramatically.</p>

<p>In January 1975, Mujib declared a state of emergency and later assumed the presidency, after the Awami League-dominated parliament made the presidency an executive post. He renamed the League the "Bangladesh Farmers and Workers Awami League <i>(Bangladesh Krishok Sramik Awami League, BAKSAL)</i>, and banned all other parties. BAKSAL became the strong arm of what had turned into a dictatorship. Many opposition political workers, mostly revolutionary communist elements, were jailed after three Members of Parliament were killed by the communist insurgency. The crackdown on opposition was aided by the elite paramilitary force <i>Rakkhi Bahini</i>.</p>

<p>These negative developments led to a widespread dissatisfaction among the people and even inside the Army. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">15 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> some junior members of the armed forces in <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>, led by Major Faruk Rahman and Major Rashid, assassinated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and all his family members. Within months, four more of its top leaders, <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Nazrul_Islam_d839.html" title="Syed Nazrul Islam">Syed Nazrul Islam</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/j/Tajuddin_Ahmed_8348.html" title="Tajuddin Ahmed">Tajuddin Ahmed</a>, captain <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Mansur_Ali_5d96.html" title="Muhammad Mansur Ali">Muhammad Mansur Ali</a> and <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._H._M._Qamaruzzaman_0fb8.html" title="A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman">A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman</a> were killed inside the <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka_Central_Jail_417e.html" title="Dhaka Central Jail">Dhaka Central Jail</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. Only <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheikh_Hasina_6006.html" title="Sheikh Hasina">Sheikh Hasina</a> and Sheikh Rehana, two daughters of Mujib, survived the massacre, as they were in West Germany as a part of a cultural exchange program. They later took political asylum in the UK. Sheikh Rehana, the younger sister, chose to remain in the UK permanently while Sheikh Hasina moved to <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and lived in self-exile. Her stays abroad helped her gain important political friends in the West and in India that proved to be a valuable asset for the party in future.</p>
<p>After 1975, the party remained split in to several rival factions, and fared poorly in the 1979 parliamentary elections held under a military government. In 1981, Sheikh Hasina returned after the largest party faction, "Bangladesh Awami League," elected her its president, and proceeded to take over the party leadership and unite the factions. However, as she was underage at the time, she could not take part in the 1981 presidential elections that followed the assassination of the then President <a href="../../../z/i/a/Ziaur_Rahman_70b2.html" title="Ziaur Rahman">Ziaur Rahman</a>. Throughout the following nine years of military rule by General <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hossain_Mohammad_Ershad_b3c8.html" title="Hossain Mohammad Ershad">Ershad</a>, AL participated in some polls and boycotted most, nearly all of which were allegedly rigged.</p>
<p>Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party in the parliament in the elections in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, following the uprising against Ershad. It made major electoral gains in 1994 as its candidates won mayoral elections in the two largest cities of the country: capital Dhaka and commercial capital <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chittagong.html" title="Chittagong">Chittagong</a>. Demanding electoral reforms, the party resigned from the parliament in 1995, boycotted the February 1996 parliamentary polls, and subsequently won 146 out of 300 seats in June 1996 parliamentary polls. Supported by a few smaller parties, Awami League formed a "Government of National Unity," and elected a non-partisan person, retired Chief Justice, <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Bangladesh_ba8e.html" title="President of Bangladesh">President</a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahabuddin_Ahmed_46a9.html" title="Shahabuddin Ahmed">Shahabuddin Ahmed</a> to be the head of state.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Awami_League_1401.html" title="Edit section: 1996 - 2001">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1996 - 2001</span></h3>
<p>AL's second term in office had mixed achievements. Apart from sustaining economic stability during the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_economic_crisis.html" title="Asian economic crisis">Asian economic crisis</a>, the government successfully settled Bangladesh's long standing dispute with India over sharing the water of the river <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges_River_7af6.html" title="Ganges River">Ganga</a> (also known as <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padma.html" title="Padma">Padma</a>) in late 1996, and signed a peace treaty with tribal rebels in 1997. In 1998, Bangladesh faced one of the worst floods ever, and the government handled the crisis satisfactorily. It also had significant achievements in containing inflation, and peacefully neutralising a long-running leftist insurgency in south-western districts dating back to the first AL government's time. However, rampant corruption allegations against party office bearers and ministers as well as detereorating law and order situation troubled the government. Its pro-poor policies achieved wide micro-econimic development but that left the country's wealthy business class dissatisfied. AL's last months in office were marred by sporadic bombing by alleged Islamist militants. Hasina herself escaped several attempts on her life, in one of which cases two <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-tank_mine.html" title="Anti-tank mine">anti-tank mines</a> were planted under her helipad in <a href="../../../g/o/p/Gopalganj_District_%28Bangladesh%29_0941.html" title="Gopalganj District (Bangladesh)">Gopalganj district</a>. In July 2001, the second AL government stepped down becoming the first elected government in Bangladesh to serve a full term in office.</p>
<p>In the elections held in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October.html" title="October">October</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> election, the party won 40% of the votes, up from 36% in 1996 and 33% in 1991. However, they only won elections in 62 out of 300 parliamentary seats, as the BNP and its allies won two-thirds majority in the parliament with 46% votes. Since then, the AL has been vigorously pursuing a campaign to bring about reforms in the electoral laws that it views as prone to corruption.</p>

<p>In its second term in opposition since 1991, the party suffered <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> of several key members. Popular young leader Ahsanullah Master, a Member of Parliament from Gazipur, was killed in 2004. This was followed by a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade.html" title="Grenade">grenade</a> attack on Hasina during a public meeting on August 21, 2004, resulting in the death of 21 party supporters, including party women's secretary Ivy Rahman. Finally, the party's electoral secretary, ex finance minister, and veteran diplomat Shah A.M.S. Kibria, a Member of Parliament from Hobiganj, was killed in a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade.html" title="Grenade">grenade</a> attack in <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylhet.html" title="Sylhet">Sylhet</a> later that year.</p>
<p>In June 2005, the Awami League won an important victory when the AL-nominated incumbent mayor <a href="../../../a/2E/b/A.B.M._Mohiuddin_Chowdhury_740d.html" title="A.B.M. Mohiuddin Chowdhury">A.B.M. Mohiuddin Chowdhury</a> won the important <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor.html" title="Mayor">mayoral</a> election in Chittagong by a huge margin. This election was seen as a showdown between the Awami League and the BNP. However, the killing of party leaders continued. In December 2005, the AL-supported Mayor of Sylhet narrowly escaped the third attempt on his life as a grenade thrown on him failed to explode.</p>
<p>In September <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, several of the party's top leaders including Saber Hossain Choudhury MP and <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asaduzzaman_Nur_3185.html" title="Asaduzzaman Nur">Asaduzzaman Nur</a> MP were hospitalised after being critically injured in police beating while demonstrating in support of electoral-law reforms.</p>
<p>In late October and throughout November 2006, the Awami League-led alliance observed a series of nationwide demonstrations and blockade programs centering around the selection of the leader of the interim caretaker administration that would oversee the 2007 elections, and controversies that arose during this time. 26 political activists of different political parties died in violence and police firing during this period.</p>

<p>It is widely expected that Hasina's son and Mujib's grandson <a href="../../../s/a/j/Sajeeb_Wazed_9fd5.html" title="Sajeeb Wazed">Sajeeb Wazed</a> (Joy), currently a student in the US, would succeed Hasina as party chief in the near future. Although he is yet to formally join the party, his increasingly frequent visits to Bangladesh, attendance at party programs, and growing popularity among party workers all indicate a repetition of the South Asian political culture of family succession, despite his being married to a non-Muslim white US citizen and his long stay abroad. In October 2006, Belgium-based political analysts of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Crisis_Group_214e.html" title="International Crisis Group">International Crisis Group</a> termed him a reluctant successor who is unlikely to take over soon. <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/library/documents/asia/south_asia/121_bangladesh_today.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crisisgroup.org/library/documents/asia/south_asia/121_bangladesh_today.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Though most of the top AL leaders are in their late sixties now, there is a pretty even distribution of age groups among the party hierarchy. AL's younger genre of leaders include KM Obaidul Kader, Saber Hossain Choudhury, <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asaduzzaman_Nur_3185.html" title="Asaduzzaman Nur">Asaduzzaman Nur</a>, Mohammad Nasim, and Sohel Taj: all of whom are in their thirties and forties.</p>

<p>After the 2001 elections the Awami League formed a left-leaning alliance of 14 parties with whom it intends to form an electoral coalition for participating in future parliamentary polls, expected in January 2007. However, there is a genuine possibility that the AL may boycott the polls unless their demand for reforming the electoral rules are met.</p>
<p>An electoral analysis conducted by a private research institution owned by an ex-MP of the ruling BNP based on field level surveys was published in leading Bangladeshi newspapers including <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Star_%28Bangladesh%29_584e.html" title="The Daily Star (Bangladesh)">The Daily Star (Bangladesh)</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prothom_Alo_7858.html" title="Prothom Alo">Prothom Alo</a> in October 2006. It showed that the AL had 23% public support at that point against BNP's 16% while more than half the electorate of the country were undecided. The study predicted 180 seats for the AL and 80 for BNP in the next general election due to be held in 2007.<a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/election2007/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/election2007/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Awami League protested the elections which it says would be rigged<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. After the elections were indefinitely postponed in January 2007 in the face of AL led protests and international pressure, the newly installed interim government pledged to implement electoral reform in line with the party's demands.</p>
