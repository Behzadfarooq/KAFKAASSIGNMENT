	    <p>I see there's a bit of disagreement about which Roger Taylor played on the record. I'm no fan of chode chugger chode Duran Duran, but the discography at the Queen drummer's website <a href="http://queen-fip.com/rt_site/c_back/cb_idx.htm" class="external text" title="http://queen-fip.com/rt_site/c_back/cb_idx.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> looks pretty comprehensive to me (it includes, for example, "Billy Squier Emotions In Motion. B[acking] v[ocals]'s on title track. 1982"), and it doesn't mention Band Aid. It looks like it was Duran Duran's Roger Taylor to me. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<dd>Yeah... I've got the Do They Know It's Christmas 12" on my lap, with a big photo of everyone, and one of those outline maps telling you who everyone is. Seriously... It's the Duran Duran fella.

<p>82.182.142.94 said: I have no idea how to edit the chart-thing up there, but everything after Bono's "Well tonight..." is obviously pulled out of someones ***. This is the original version I'm talking about. Please.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I don't know. The list of who sings what in the 1984 line-up looks fine to me. You should have a look at the video. The guys singing after Bono perfectly look like the Status Quo or Style Council or Heaven 17 blokes to me. Or are you referring to someone else? --DoubleDee</dd>

<p>Hey guys! I need your help here: I'm trying to spot all of the participants to the original band aid, not only those who actually sang (I guess the list is complete), but those who left a message in the 12" version... can you help me??? Thanks, Elli</p>
<pre>
OK. Well, this is Bono here, the singer, with U2 wishing you a Happy Christmas and a Merry New Year. Is that right?

Hello, this is Paul McCartney. Sorry, I can't be with you. Hahaha....

Hi, this is Simon from Duran Duran. I'd like to say... I'd like to wish you Happy Christmas.

I'm Paul Weller from the Style Council. I wish you all Happy Christmas.

Hello, this is Midge Ure from Ultravox. I nearly forgot there's so many beautiful groups here today.
Uh... just have a good Christmas and enjoy yourself.

Hello, hello, this is Paul McCartney. Feed the world.... Hello, this is Paul McCartney. Hello, this is Paul McCartney.
Feed the world.... Sorry, I can't be with you....

This is Jon Moss from Culture Club saying feed the world. There are 11 million people starving in one country.
Doesn't it make you think? 

This is Holly Johnson from Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Feed the world. Hahahahahaha....
I can't get the laugh right, but... yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hello, this is Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet. Happy Christmas everyone.

This is John Tailor from Duran Duran. Happy Christmas everybody too.

Hello, I'm Siobhan. Happy Christmas.

Hello, I'm Sarah from Bananarama. Happy Christmas.

And from me too, Karen.

Hello, this is Glenn Gregory from Heaven 17 wishing everybody a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Hello there, this is Stuart Adamson. This is Tony Butler. This is Mark Brzezcki. This is Bruce Watson from Big Country.
Feed the people. Stay alive.

This is Johnny Fingers from Boomtown Rats and I'd like to wish everyone a Happy Christmas.

This is David Bowie. It's Christmas 1984. And there are more starving folk on our planet than ever before.
Please give a thought for them this season and do whatever you can, however small, to help them live. Have a peaceful New Year.

This record was recorded on the 25th of November 1984. It's now 8 a.m. in the morning of the 26th.
We've been here 24 hours and I think it's time we went home.
So from me, Bob Geldof and Midge, we'd say good morning to you all and a million thanks to everyone on the record.
Have a lovely Christmas. Bye.

<p>hi,</p>
<p>i felt impelled to post - hope i dont waffle too much.</p>
<p>i have followed the band aid 20 saga from the outset when the nation began pushing for a re-release, and i eagerly watched the media coverage of the recording day and then counted down to the release. i heard the first airplay on radio one and although i got shivers down my spine, i will admit that i initially felt a sense of disappointment as the kick was not the same as the original- except for bono's line which left me lost for words. however, over time i have come to love this as much as the original, and even appreciated the 2nd release for the first time. i think the cause is so important.</p>
<p>but, my overriding feeling hit me just 20 minutes ago when i saw the video of band aid 20 for the first time. i remember watching the video footage 20 years ago at school and seeing boys cry real tears, that hit hard...............when the current video showed excerpted footage and the expressions on stars faces i sat back, realised and sobbed.</p>
<p>thankyou for bringing this back to our attention - well done and god bless you all</p>
<p>Bob Geldof and Midge Ure are extraordinary men</p>
<p>Love Sam xxx</p>

<p>From the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The name "Band Aid" was chosen because it had a double meaning. ...such a gesture is like putting a BAND-AID (a brand of sticking plaster/adhesive bandage) on a gaping wound...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is accurate and verifiable, in the sense that members of Band Aid said something like this? I ask because it is my understanding that the word Band-Aid, (as a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genericized_trademark.html" title="Genericized trademark">genericized trademark</a>), isn't used outside of American English. Savatar 04:34, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I was wondering about this as well, I'm English, and ... well ... the phrase "band aid" is simply not used here. The term over here is "plaster" so... yeah.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm going to delete that bit. People can add it again if they have any link to verify this, I'm going to assume it's not true though, seeing as the term is not used this side of the Atlantic. LupusCanis 10:09, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since I last looked at this article the language has become more casual and chatty. It's more style than substance: e.g. the exchange between Bone and Damon Albarn - are these actual citable quotes?

<li><b>Oppose</b> - Likewise, a disambiguation link should be enough for Band Aid, as Band-Aid really has a much more common usage. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirbelwind_a23d.html" title="User:Wirbelwind">Wirbelwind<small>ヴィルヴェルヴィント</small></a> (<a href="../../../w/i/r/User_talk%7EWirbelwind_25ad.html" title="User talk:Wirbelwind">talk</a>) 01:11, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - <a href="../../../b/a/n/Band_Aid_f624.html" title="Band Aid">Band Aid</a> should probably redirect to the article about the bandage brand, but being the dab page is fine. Being the band is not. Also, while many unambiguous pages do have parenthesised specifiers, that's too bad and should be fixed.
