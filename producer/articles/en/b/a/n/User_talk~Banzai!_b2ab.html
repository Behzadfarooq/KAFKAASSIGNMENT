<dd>Hey, what do you say to renaming the whole section something like "Outside views of Hezbollah," with a short intro about differences of opinion between e.g. Europe/Middle East and North America (and elsewhere as appropriate), and then shuffle everything else into subsections "As terrorist" and "As legitimate"?

<p>Banzai, I understand your concern, you have to give us SOMETHING here, someone deleted Islamist organizations and put up a completely innocent Shi'a Islamic hyperlink that says nothing about the mysogonistic behaviour of Shiite Islamic factions. I'm not allowed to use Jihadi, terrorist, fundamentalist, I mean the list goes on and on. Somewhere beyond POV there has to be a sense of truth to this article and ignoring it is just unethical. If you would like to reword this, fine, but I have over 4 speeches by him calling for death to israel and death to america - who calls for this and gets away with it??? That's not npov, that's just ignoring the facts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The transcripts of the speeches you've linked to have significant omissions that distort Nasrallah’s intent—though at least your sources are conscientious enough to include the ellipses at all—and it’s misleading to characterize him as calling for the death of Israel and of America, for example, when he has always (in the sources I've seen) clarified his intent as to call for the downfall of their governments, respectively, and not their civilian populations. Similarly, you can’t just call a group “terrorist” without introducing severe POV concerns, and that’s especially true of an organization like Hezbollah with an active civilian wing and an expressed aversion to civilian casualties. Finally, where have you gotten the idea that Hezbollah specifically adheres to what you call Shiite Islam’s "misogynistic behaviour"? <span style="font-size: small;">&#160;—<i>Banzai!</i> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> @ 21:32, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</span></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Clarifying intent or justifying the downfall of a government does NOT mean that they do not call for the downfall of a government</b> Secondly, rhetoric and actions have to be congruent for any official policy to be understood. For example, Hezbollah says that they were created to end the occupation of Lebanon, but Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000. The area of Shabah Farms was <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annexed.html" title="Annexed">annexed</a> from Syria as part of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_heights.html" title="Golan heights">Golan heights</a> and that's a fact. Third they are financed by an openly holocaust denying anti-semetic regime that calls for it's death daily and fourth, Hezbollah's Al Manar Television openly incites death of Jews and Israel using Jihadist principles continuously - that's 24-7. The fact that you do not take the time to view their television is not my reference problem, that's ignorance on the part of anyone who does not view their programming. By doing this, you are conciously remaining ignorant in order to hold on to a belief that Hezbollah is just playing patty-cakes in Hezbollah land.</dd>

<dd>Like the PLO, Islamic Jihad, and all the other Terrorist organizations in the region, Hezbollah is a political pawn created and funded by Muslim governments to terrorize Israelis, brainwash Lebanese, and die in the name of Allah. Hezbollah is just one front. They are a self-proclaimed enemy of the United States, Britain and Israel. In the interests of one's country - and in my opinion, the world at large - American, British or Israeli governments have a moral obligation to their own countries to attack, divide or conquer anyone that finances or harbors them.Labaneh 15:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Dude, I've watched Al-Manar TV, and I've seen Nasrallah speak. You have to view his rhetoric in the context of his intended audience. Your so-called sources smearing Al-Manar as pure, unbridled evil remind me of Hollywood advertising: Ebert says "This [...] is [...] a [...] good [...] movie." Give me a break.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>And on another note, PLO are terrorists? Who are you calling ignorant? Do you vote Likud? Israel Beytenu? Does it make you happy to see Israel turned into a suicide bomber, of late?

<p>I have to hear his holocaust-denying, Jew-and-Israel Hating, Pro-Jihad-Self-Martyrdom-loving and hate-based speaches in the context that he is upset at Israeli occupation of Syrian land? Fine, put it in context, but don't ignore it. Israelis are not suicide bombers - we don't send our children to become martyrs, we send them unhappily to defeat self-proclaimed enemies that stockpile tens-of-thousands of missiles on our boarders. We started this war reluctantly so that we can live on without the fear of this front getting so armed that we can't go outside....and you know something...some of us dont want to go and those of us that don't get a few months in prison, a slap on the wrist and they move on with their lives.

<dd>I'm a <a href="../../../n/y/c/NYC_a37a.html" title="NYC">New Yorker</a>, actually, but I’ve had wonderful times in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and I’ve seen awe-inspiring architecture and urban planning in Beirut; I could tell you mouth-watering tales of debauchery from the latter. And I'm sorry to hear you're content to secure Israel's short-term security at the expense of its long-term prospects for survival, as a generation of young Lebanese who were lukewarm towards Hezbollah, at best, and who had nothing against Israel to begin with—indeed, who were so enthusiastic last year in expressing their appreciation for the United States, your longtime ally—are now turning against us (Israel and America both) for your policy of what amounts to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_punishment.html" title="Collective punishment">collective punishment</a>. I’m sorry you didn’t realize that a people under attack would begin supporting the only organization fighting back in their defense, even if that organization is a Shi’a militia. I’m sorry for your bloodthirsty <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawk.html" title="Hawk">hawkishness</a>, because your mentors in the Knesset (or possibly just Olmert alone) who share your views have started down a path that ensures I’ll never be safe from terrorist attacks when I visit that region again.

<dd>BTW, with increasing democratization, Hizballah (and Hamas) have had to moderate their positions in order to maintain public appeal; in fact, Hamas was on the verge of an agreement with Fatah to form a coalition government—until Israel moved its military back into Gaza and the West Bank, reminding Hamas why it’s a militant group to begin with. From the above, I’m not sure whether you’re aware of this. That’s simple ignorance, which is nothing to be ashamed of, and easily cured.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But insofar as the lesson, I can’t be sure whether you, personally, will <i>ever</i> learn. Left alone, Hizballah and Hamas move slowly to moderate positions, making coexistence possible. What causes them to radicalize is, first, unjust imprisonments without trial in Israeli prisons, and second, Israeli bombs. Your failure to learn this lesson could be fatal to you and me both. <span style="font-size: small;">&#160;—<i>Banzai!</i> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> @ 00:11, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</span></dd>

We had to build a 20 foot wall to stop <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_bombings.html" title="Suicide bombings">suicide bombings</a> from killing civilians - do we need to build the same on the Lebanese front? There is a JIHADIST war in this world and by your comments I think you see it too. The difference between you and I is I believe we have to actively fight it, and you think ignoring it and benevolence will lead to benevolence in kind. So be it, we differ in opinions, but that doesn't stop Hezbollah from being a Jihadist organization with a political platform of anhilliating me in Jerusalem and you in New York.</dd>

<p>Recently as a note to an edit in the <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> article you wrote: <i>Why is some bot reverting my edits? (was: "Reinsert 'even among Israel and its traditional Western allies,' so as not to encourage the reader to imagine it's the usual suspects, i.e. Syria and Iran))</i>. I reverted your edit using Vandalproof software because you cut referenced factual content but did not replace it elsewhere within the article. I see you have kept the material but made it more NPOV.

<dd>Yeah, that's great, but several editors and I have been working together on the article for a few days now and we're all pretty familiar with its contents. The material I cut was redundant, almost word-for-word, with a paragraph in a later section of the article. When I cut it the second time, I moved it to the summary of that section, so now it's in the article twice. Which if you ask me is of questionable value—but, given the work I did on the summary, hopefully <i>slightly</i> more useful than it sounds.
