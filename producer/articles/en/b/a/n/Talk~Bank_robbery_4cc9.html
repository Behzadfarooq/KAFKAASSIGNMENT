<p>I think that this page should mention that not all banks in all countries have armed security guards. I know that at least here in Canada, security guards aren't allowed to carry guns or other weapons. <a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlea110_ef5e.html" title="User:Flea110">Flea110</a> 20:20, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not agree that takeover robberies are the most dangerous type of robbery. In takeover robberies, the robbers are usually professionals or have planned their robbery, whereas a one-man robbery may be spontaneous and violent.</p>

    Why is the article for such a worldwide subject so U.S.-centric?

This article is plain silly. Having done bank robberies and done prison time for it.. I will advise you to put away the DOJ handbooks and crime reports as they are fiction. The entire criminal justice system is fable ridden as far as bank robberies go. Like for instance a common occurrence. A guy gets nabbed for a bank job. He has done say one or two others, told his girl and she snitches him off. When he talks to the feds, because he isn't serious, but really scared, he tells them "I have done 3." and they say "we have film of you doing 12." they show him the film, it's not him... they don't care. He pleads and gets a lesser sentence as long as he lets them clean up their books. As for methods the MOST dangerous robberies are cowboy jobs where the robber runs into the bank and tries to take it over after it has been opened. This is dangerous due to the uncertainity of what can occur combined the personality or state of mind that it takes to do this. Imagine... You run into a room of say 8 people screaming with a gun... Statistically someone is eventually going to snap and do something unexpected. These are the situations where cocaine cowboys start shooting.</p>
<pre>
   There are the following types of robberies:
    1. Note jobs.  Guy walks in and hands a note for cash.  If he is smart he goes to a commercial till.  If he is not he goes to a regular.  They rarely are armed.  They often serialize this.  They average a grand.  Might hit 20 or 30k with a good commercial till.  Can you say drug addicts and the like.  Usually loners, sometimes they might have a driver.
    2. Cowboys.  They either run in and announce themselves or slide in.  Either way they will brandish or display a firearm.  They will hit more than one till, but will strike so quickly they miss the majority of the money there. They are the fools who put everyone at risk and usually are on such a rush, the money is almost secondary.  They can pull a hundred k but will average between 30 to 60k.  Sometimes they work in groupsd, sometimes not.
    3. Takeovers.  The feds classify cowboys as takeovers simply because they announce their presence.  A true takeover is where all parties in the bank are accounted for and secured prior to the money being taken.  Takeovers come in a variety of methods.  There are several methods out there that regardless of the security steps taken by a bank are tough to defeat. The bank is stuck in a no win. They have to seem open and friendly, not armoured vaults.  Takeovers with a brain will always hit the vault.  The fiction and urban myth spread by movies like point break are just that.  If the bank is controlled-take over completely, there is no 3 or 5 mninute timelimit.  15 minutes is not uncommon.    This will almost alway be crews that do this.  Watch HEAT.  It is flawed, but on many levels the most realisitic movie ever made on the subject.  The job that goes bad is a cowboy job... not a takeover... why? They did not secure the bank.  As I am not trying to write how to notes, but just correct some errors, I will leave it at that.  A takeover should net between 150k to 500k.
    The real threats to the modern day bank robber are not DNA, Cameras, SWAT teams or the like, but rather misinformation spread by the media and people who can't keep their mouths shut.
    If you want to grasp bank robbery, methods and results, look at the architecture of the banks in question.  Everything one needs to know is right there in front of you.

<p>The phrase "which was a very large sum of money at the time" strikes me as rather ambiguous and unencyclopedic. It also ignores the fact that 162 grand is still a pretty decent chunk of money. All that said, I'm going to go ahead and replace this phrase with another one which specifies the amount in 2006 dollars. 69.94.199.146 02:12, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
