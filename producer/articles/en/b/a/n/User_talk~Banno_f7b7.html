<p>Thanks for your email - read with interest. With a few outside reviewers on the article, it might help a bit.</p>
<p>One concern in disputes is that outsiders can sometimes be unaware what's bona fide good content and what isnt, especially in specialized topics like this. So I've set up <a href="../../../p/h/i/Talk%7EPhilosophy_Workshop_10e8.html" title="Talk:Philosophy/Workshop">Talk:Philosophy/Workshop</a> as a way to ask editors for input on selected key questiosn that to me seem to be at the heart of the debate. Hopefully this will rapidly speed up the process.</p>
<p>Although I notice you have stepped away from the topic, please do feel free to comment, and to encourage this approach, if you think it has value. keep in touch on it. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 00:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually (DB here) just having seen Peter's message on his talk page, and just having found vandalism on another Philosophy page, I wonder if it really is worth it. We are simply outnumbered and overrun. And it seems to be getting worse. There is no support whatever in the hierarchy of WP for the view that those with professional training have any more value than 'anyone' (as in 'anyone can write an encyclopedia'). Apart from you Banno, you've been very understanding. But this is getting me very low. Time for another Wiki break, and I'm sure I cannot stand a certain person being unblocked and coming back. Really can't face it. Talk to you later. <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> 18:03, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agree with all of you. I have encountered the serious sort of problem that you speak of in relation to another Wiki article (where, in manner of speaking, the inmates have well and truly taken over the asylum) upon a very significant scientific issue dealing with both an "intellectual construct" (which they have misrepresented), and its practical, in the world ramifications (which they have also skewed to such an extent that it has no relation to the real practice of real scientists). It seems to me that there is a very significant difference between:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(a) the concept that "all votes are equal" and the assertion that, in science, "all voters are equally informed",</dd>
<dd>(b) [from (a)] the concept that "everybody is entitled to their opinion", to the assertion that, simply due to no other criterion than they possess life, any given individual has the right to "express their opinion", which becomes further extended into an argument that all individuals <b>must</b> have an opinion, and from this, that in any knowledge-seeking enterprise, the "opinions" of every "stakeholder" must be sought, regardless of:
<dl>
<dd>(i) whether they have an "opinion" at all (and, thus, forcing those who posses no "opinion" at the time they are questioned into to expressing a view that might not have been otherwise entertained); and</dd>
<dd>(ii) whether they have any experience and/or factual knowledge (i.e., rather than superstitions or beliefs),</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>relating to the matter in question.</dd>
<dd>(c) the concept that "science is a co-operative enterprise" and the assertion that "science is democratic" and, from this, the assertion that the view of the majority (or the plurality) must, in virtue of the weight of numbers, be correct (when, in fact it could be that, at a particular moment, only one person has the "correct view"),</dd>
<dd>(d) an <i>essentially contested concept</i> and a <i>hotly disputed concept</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fact that I have not "signed" this comment may also be taken as a significant index of the drama that I encountered in my previous episodes of dealing with these sorts of people. In this matter, to use an architectural metaphor, derived from Gothic architecture, I strongly support your enterprise; but rather than being a central pillar, I choose to do it from the outside, as a "flying buttress".

<dd>You say in another message "No, there is no support for the view that some sort of priority be given to experts; indeed, quite the opposite is part of the "Core" of the project. Even as an admin I can't protect pages from obvious idiocy. That's not going to change. For some reason I keep coming back {this is the start of my fifth year as an editor}, as do you. Why have you been here as long as you have? " Silly! As an admin you can <i>easily</i> protect pages from obvious idiocy by blocking obvious idiots. It is normally easy to spot these from just a few sentences of their 'work' (I spotted Ludvikus as a major source of potential trouble the instant I saw his new introduction. And do you not support the view that some sort of priority should be given to those who are not obviously incompetent editors, or who have shown good faith for a long period of editing. Indeed, you implicitly support this principle when you made those comments to Ludvikus a few days back (on the lines of Mel and I have been here a long time and have supported the article through thick and thin).</dd>

<dd>So why can't this change? Just block the f---ers. I like the idea of a template by the way. The question is what to put in it. Let me think about that.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I had thought of putting myself up for admin, as I am one of the longest-serving editors here. But presumably there is a sort of question-set that would weed out people such as myself?

<dd>OK I can clearly see that I am not administrative material. Patience greater than zero is an essential quality. And I can't see that it really matters, anyway.

<p>Noticed your point on Dean's Philosophylaughingstock page. While it's true that the orthodox view of knowledge is JTB, the fallibilists hold the view that knowledge may be false.

<dd>We will just have to respectfully differ on this. My understanding is that if you know it, it is true. If you thought you knew it, and it turns out that you were wrong, then you never knew it; you only believed it.

<dd>Lucidish: If by "fallibilism" you're referring to Peirce's approach, then he didn't say that knowledge might turn out to be false; he said that beliefs needn't be certain — that certainty is generally impossible, and that we're better off accepting that rather than trying to achieve knowledge (rather than trying to banish doubt). Popper, who's sometimes also dubbed a fallibilist, held broadly similar views, but again didn't say that <i>knowledge</i> could be false.</dd>

<dd>Mel &amp; Dean: I had no specific thinker in mind, I was thinking back to the presentation of "Fallibilism" in my old epistemology textbook ("Knowledge Puzzles" by Stephen Cade Hetherington, Boulder:Westview Press, p107). In it, Hetherington says: "<i>(1) A given belief of yours is fallibly justified = df. (i) Your belief is justified... (ii) A belief's being justified in the way referred to in (i) is compatible with its being false. (2) At least some of your justification is fallibilist, as defined in (1).</i>" He continues: "FJ thus captures a 'loose' approach to justification. Having fallibilist justification is compatible with believing falsehoods; to have fallibilist justification for a belief does not entail the belief's being true. By FJ(1), therefore, such justification is not perfect. A fallibilist is being generous, trying to make justification more accessible for imperfect beings -- such as you and me." Whether one agrees with this view or not (and indeed, it has some fairly obvious objections) it at least can be found in respectable sources. (Though it doesn't matter much, I should add that I find this account the most cogent of the alternatives; but it would take a book to explain why.) <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">{ Ben S.

<dl>
<dd>(I'm now thinking of changing my name to Pearl.) The quotation doesn't mention knowledge; no-one denies that it's possible to <i>believe</i> something that's false. The fallibilist is offering fallible justification as an alternative to knowledge (which she – mistakenly, I'd argue – takes to be infallible justification). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 17:31, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Strictly speaking (here talking to Banno, but anyone else can listen) the second claim that "If someone claims to believe something, he or she is claiming that it is the truth." is not unreasonable. If I say "I believe that p" and p is not true, then I still speak truly, if I do believe. But if I say "p is true", I speak falsely. For logicians, that is all that matters. <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> 17:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While it's true that the quotation does not strictly speak of knowledge, the quotes are presented in the context of giving one possible account of knowledge by way of discussing the nature of justification. The implication would indeed seem to be illogical, but only if we maintain the JTB account of knowledge, which we might at some point decide to do without.

<p>The best place for this sort of discussion is probably a forum. My own view, after Austin, was expressed here<a href="http://forums.philosophyforums.com/thread/23691/5" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.philosophyforums.com/thread/23691/5" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (Post #104):</p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On reading your reply, it seems to me that I haven't made my point quite clearly enough.</p>
<p>First, I agree with you that the set of things that we know form a subset of the set of things we believe. But I want to be clear that saying "I believe..." is quite a different act to saying "I know...", and that the difference is not just one of degree of certainty.</p>
<p>Consider "I was certain that my numbers would come up in Lotto last night - but they didn't". This is a well-formed sentence, the sort of thing a gambler might say. She was certain, but unfortunately mistaken. This is quite different from "I knew my numbers would come up in Lotto last night - but they didn't". This latter sentence is ill-formed. Because her numbers didn't come up, she could not know that they would. The difference is that one can be certain, and yet be wrong; but one cannot know, and yet be wrong. The difference needs emphasis, I think. The difference between "I know that..." and "I believe that ..." is one of kind, not of degree.</p>
<p>Consider another example, said by a student, on recievieng a paper back: "I was absolutely certain the answer was 'Timbuktu' - but I was wrong" compared with "I knew the answer was 'Timbuktu' - but I was wrong". Something quite different is happening in the second sentence to the first. To repeat, to say "I know that ..." is to perform a wholly different act to saying that "I believe that...".</p>
<p>The simplest way to bespeak the difference is to say that in order to know something, it must be true; but that one can be certain and yet still be mistaken . But this leads to confusion. A better way to put it might be to say that "I know that..." contains an assurance on the part of the speaker of the truth of the utterance - that the speaker is giving their word that the subject is true. The sentences "I assure you that my numbers would come up - but I am wrong" and " I assure your that the answer is 'Timbuktu' - but I am wrong" are ill-formed in much the same way as "I knew that my numbers would come up - but I was wrong" and " I knew that the answer is 'Timbuktu' - but I was wrong".</p>
<p>(notice that I'm using "assure", not "assured". One can make a false assurance.)</p>
<p>It is worth also drawing attention to the personalisation that takes place in saying that one knows something. "It is true that..." does not say who it is true for - with good reason, since if it is true, it is supposedly true for everyone. This is quite different from "I know that..."; such a sentence must identify who it is that is claiming to know, because we need to be able to identify the person or people giving the assurance.</p>
<p>You are right that some people, such as your neighbour, will say "I know..." more readily than others. But we know he is often wrong. It's not that "Know" is ambiguous, but that these folk are too ready to give their assurance</p>

<p>Banno, do you want to rethink the 'list of isms'. Of course, there are some silly ones ("cosmothetic idealism"). But some isms correspond to divisions that are relevant across the whole history of philosophy. 1. Rationalism vs Empiricism, which begins with Parmenides and continues until today. 2. Nominalism vs Realism, which begins with Aristotle, becomes <i>the</i> central question of the Middle Ages via Porphyry and Boethius, and is still alive today, very much so. 3. Idealism vs Realism, and understanding of which is essential to any understanding of the Early Modern period. Possibly Scepticism.</p>
<p>They are not so much 'isms' (perhaps it was my fault for phrasing it that way. What is needed is a short list of the basic positions in which philosophers have been divided since the beginning of time. Yes? <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> 17:26, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a make-or-break issue for me, and in any case I have no intention of editing the article directly. I see your point, and by all emans you might try it; but I think the result will eventually be a very long list of "isms" - as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> said, "Every body talkin' 'bout this 'ism, that 'ism, 'ism, 'ism, 'ism" - Give peace a chance. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 20:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In reply to your question: you say that you have been asked to write an RFC for Ludvikus, but feel there is sufficient evidence of disruptive editing that might warrant skipping RFC and going directly for a community ban.</p>
<p>Before anything, understand I am not going to advise what you should or shouldn't do, or feel. I'm staying neutral on the article. However the question you ask is one of community practices and policies, and that I can give a summary of.</p>
<p>A ban is the end result of a strongly unfavourable <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFArb_d611.html" title="WP:RFArb">Request for Arbitration</a> to ArbCom, the Arbitration Committee. I don't think you will get that for the following reasons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>ArbCom is a final resort, not the first resort. There is no evidence that community discussion would fail, or mediation fail, at this time.</li>
<li>ArbCom tries to give minimal rulings - the minimum needed to prevent harm which is occurring. The likely outcome is as follows: A person who is grossly and wilfully violating on a grand scale, may get banned. Otherwise time-limited (1 week to a few months) or topic-limited restrictions ("topic X and all articles on closely-related subjects") are the norm. However these are quite effective at encouraging compliant editing, if agreed, since the block time for breaches usually increase with each breach.</li>
<li>You haven't documented the case yet with DIFFs sufficient to prove fault. (I have no doubt that diffs of any bad conduct can be gathered, but it hasn't happened so far.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>My suggestion is that if you feel the conduct of any editor is so persistent and unreasonable/unsupportable, despite explanations, then consider reporting it as vandalism. If you are not sure how best to handle a situation, RFC the situation, putting a section on the article's talk page titled "RFC" and describing the case with DIFF evidence, for comments.</p>
<p>In either case write on the talk page to anyone affected, a summary of what you do and why, so it is clear due explanation and summary is given. Recap everything succinctly and clearly with sample DIFFs of each misconduct alleged. This will be good background if it needs to go further, both as a summary and as evidence you explained it properly at least once, and it continued.</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.

<p>I think the 'ecitor' problem may very well get resolved. Meanwhile, in view of the clear problem we have had regarding what is an appropriate source, is it worth having a short discussion about how we interpret the meaning of the terms above? They originated from history, which aims to describe actual events. But of course there are no actual live events of that kind in philosophy (unless we are talking about lives of the philosophers). So we do need a clear interpretation for the Philosophy project. Let me know. <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> 09:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Banno, Wikipedia requires us to assume good faith. So I assume it about you. Please assume it about me. I notice that practically all the people involved in the Editors' War with me, are also doing philosophyon your page. At the same time you are taking the disciplinary action against us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't you think there might be a conflict of interests here?</li>
<li>Also, don't you think the philosophizing should done on the appropriate page wgere we could all benefit?</li>
<li>Also, don't you think a "club" forms in this way. By the way, Dbuckner used the term first. And I notice that you suggest one should be formed (look above) - to rid Philosophy of the rotten apples, so to speak - your precise thought are expressed above - please re-read them. Can you tell if you have formed such a "cabal" already (as you use the word above). In my mind I believe you have. And people naturally do such things. Can you find it in your heart to step forward and do the right thing? I think, from having quickly read the philosophizing that's going on here, on your page, it's clear that Mel is the philosopher here, and I do not have the benefit of sharing these thoughts.</li>
<li>I also notice the use of "f**k" on your page against me. That I think is <b>disruptive conduct</b>, in and by, itself. It is the same thing as slapping me in the face. It is aggression. And you clearly do not mind it. But I do, very much so. You cannot slap a man in the face and at the same time call him disruptive - I'm surprised you do not see that.</li>
<li>From reading your page, it's clear that Mel is your friend, to whom you are loyal. And it is he who used the Britol Stool Chart, and Dbuckner came back with it again, on the Philosophy page.</li>
<li>Do you understand my point? Can you please step forward and do the right things. Let us not forget that Philosophy is about ethics, morality, justice, fair treatment.</li>
<li>What do I have to loose here? You think it's my ego, as you pointed out. But what about the possibility of a disappointment in my fello man? I truly want to know that that you are a man of good will. So please do not only look into the logic of things. Please look at your emotions, feelings, and all those things we, in Analytic philosophy, are trained to put aside. But actions, as well as thought, are not solely determined in such a cold, impartial way. Look at our behavior, here, in cyberspace. Is it not clear to you that you have effectively formed a private club in which I cannot get admitance? And that I have been already stigmatized by you as a Wikipedia disruptive person? As someone who is not capable of doing philosophy, As someone who is insane, a Madman? And now I cannot get into this private club? How is it that you do not see this - which to me is so obvious by reading the discussion that has been going on here - <i>behind closed doors</i>? Mel has still not apologized tome. You guys use the words, fuck, shit, dick, against me, but when I use the word Philosopher King you think it's disruptive. But just look over carefully at your talk page. In accordance with Plato's <i>Republic</i> (approximately) it seems to me that you are the Soldier, Mel is the King, Dbuckner is the Worker, and poor Ben is the slave. But I cannot get into you private club.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you get my drift?</p>

<p>Hi. I'm a relatively new contributer to Wikipedia, and recently stumbled across an article that interested me about the Revolutionary War. I looked up more sources on the subject and posted them, along with the facts stated in those sources.

<p>Hi there...thanks for the kind words, and the soup link, which I enjoyed immensely. In my time here, I have looked at:</p>
<ol>
<li>9/11 conspiracy theories, where loonies conjecture that the twin towers were zapped by space beams</li>
<li>Passive smoking, where scientific evidence is misrepresented to support partisan lobby interests, and my reference to <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Scruton_a9c5.html" title="Roger Scruton">Roger Scruton</a> was summarily removed</li>
<li>Time travel, which is subjected to a torrent of personal opinings on the possibility/practicality etc. of the subject</li>
<li>Christopher Langan, an 'independent researcher' who would appear to be using Wikipedia to publicise himself and his 'theory'</li>
<li>Philosophy, which seems to be the subject of a dispute over what exactly I cannot tell.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am too terrified at the moment to go too near my own subject, mathematical logic, lest my heart give out on me. My little adventure on <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclusive_disjunction.html" title="Exclusive disjunction">exclusive disjunction</a> (now unfortunately called '<a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclusive_or.html" title="Exclusive or">exclusive or</a>' put me quite off that idea for now. And if votes have to be taken to determine whether the article on a straightforward logical connective will be called by its colloquial or technical name (and the colloquial is chosen), I shudder to contemplate the status of more complex articles...</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there's a certain inescapable allure which Wikipedia holds...it's like watching a riot...so I just flip through articles, following one to the next, and do what I can to restore a bit of sanity where I feel I am able. It's always good to know of other rational people floating around, and I admire the tenacity of those who can ride the waves of lunacy and actually build articles — a process to which I should like to contribute a bit more once I have built a solid intuition for the way things work. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 10:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>How can I possibly respond to "among other things"? Could, you Banno, answer such a criticism? I have no idea what Mel wants from me. All I've gotten from him is the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Stool_Chart_3b60.html" title="Bristol Stool Chart">Bristol Stool Chart</a>.

<dd>I've re-arranged this so that the thread is a bit clearer. What Mel had done was to re-direct on article to anther; this had nothing to do with me. It gives a very nice indication of Ludvikus' inability to understand the basics of Wikipedia. Indeed, he gives the impression of not understanding <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_zone.html" title="Time zone">Time zones</a>! It also includes a few insulting remarks of his, and shows how he writes in a fashion designed to elicit a reaction, to draw attention to himself rather than to improve the Wiki.

<p>I hope this is not a silly question, but I'd like to get your thoughts here. In regards to the current dispute in Philosophy about an editor, what about using a content fork as a device to handle a conflict impasse? By temporarily separating two or more disparate and contentious pov's, both parties do their own work without interferring with each other.</p>

<dd>I have commented on the talk that this is a wider issue. But as a question, Banno, why can't just one of the admins block him temporarily? That seems to have some sort of effect. I've noticed that he doesn't edit the article anymore (disruption to talk page only). Here's an idea: we have a moderator, chosen by consensus (or a group of moderators). If it is felt that some editor is not being constructive, he gets a warning, then he gets a block for a week or whatever. The moderator has no power to block, that has to be done by an uninvolved admin. Why on earth can't we do something like that, and stay within policy? <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> 08:19, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wrote a whole load of things here this morning. Not exactly bad tempered, but irritable. I reacted rather badly to your suggestion that it was the editors' fault, particularly after I checked the exact chronology of events, and particularly when looking at the advice we actually received from admins (which was conflicting, and does not match what you said last night on my talk page). On reflection I have just deleted these remarks, as it's not fair to you when you did in fact implement the block - and thanks for that, of course. However, when things settle down, we should discuss them. It's important for us to know how to deal with this again. (If there is an 'us' - I fear this affair has put off an awful lot of people). <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> 10:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Banno, I'm writing because somebody at I.P. 64.230.16.82 has taken to vandalizing my user page, and I'm not sure how to proceed. (You can see the my last edit of my own page, versus his/her latest vandalism, here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABuck_Mulligan&amp;diff=112010848&amp;oldid=106167420" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABuck_Mulligan&amp;diff=112010848&amp;oldid=106167420" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABuck_Mulligan&amp;diff=112010848&amp;oldid=106167420</a>) Anyway, I guess the whole business started when I left a message on his/her user talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:64.230.16.82" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:64.230.16.82" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:64.230.16.82</a>) asking whoever he/she is not to vandalize Wikipedia pages. Probably a stupid thing for me to have done, but I figured there wasn't any harm in it at the time. So: what can I do about this? Is it possible to lock my user page? I'm coming to you for help because I've noticed your name in the "talk" section of the Wittgenstein page, and I don't know anyone else in an admin position to ask about this. Seems like a pretty serious problem to me, though, and it'd be nice to see it resolved sooner than later. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuck_Mulligan_06cf.html" title="User:Buck Mulligan">Buck Mulligan</a> 05:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Banno. I'm sorry to say that the same user-page vandalism is happening with I.P. 64.230.16.82, and he's being very persistent (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Buck_Mulligan&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Buck_Mulligan&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Buck_Mulligan&amp;action=history</a>).
