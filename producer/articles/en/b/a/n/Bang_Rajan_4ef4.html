<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bang_Rajan_4ef4.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/6/1767.html" title="1767">1767</a>, Burmese armies entered Siam. While Burmese accounts credit the invasion as having a deliberate and predetermined ambition - credited to the King Mang Ra - other sources and analysts of the period, most notably <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damrong_Rajanubhab_512b.html" title="Damrong Rajanubhab">Prince Damrong</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, consider this to be historical revisionism and believe that the Burmese did not initially invade with the intention of permanent conquest or with any designs on Ayutthaya itself. Typically, Burmese forces raided nearby territory, fleeing when encountering a force of any size.</p>
<p>The Burmese forces encountered little competent resistance from the Siamese and advanced close to the capital, but refused to attack due to uncertainty regarding the strength of the forces they would have to face. There was much raiding of the surrounding country and, in addition to the general policy which required the submission of the Siamese, they began to demand the unmarried daughters of families as well, a policy which provoked the Siamese people into resistance.</p>
<p>The beginning of resistance and the first notable appearance of Bang Rajan occurred when a group of Siamese from various villages - notably Sibuathong, Krap and Pho Thale - led by Nai Thaen, Nai Choti, Nai In, Nai Muang, Nai Dok and Nai Thong Kaeo lured a group of Burmese raiders into a forest with the promise of young women and then turned upon them, killing the entire group of twenty. After this they retreated to Bang Rajan where, we are also told, most of the population of the villages of Muang Wiset Chaichan, Muang Sing and Muang San had fled.</p>
<p>Bang Rajan is recorded as being ideally situated: <i>"A place where foodstuffs were plentiful...a village on high ground and...it was difficult for the enemy to get at."</i></p>
<p>In addition to its ideal situation geographically and its position as a focus of those fleeing the Burmese, Bang Rajan had at this early point approximately 400 fighting men who elected five leaders amongst themselves and worked on the erection of fortifications. There was also a Buddhist priest, Thammachot, who had been invited into the village monastery where he was held in great veneration by the inhabitants, who believed him to have great knowledge and power with regard to spells, charms and other incantations.</p>
<p>The Burmese leaders camped at Muang Wiset Chaichan, were aware of the slaughter of their men by the Siamese who had fled to Bang Rajan and sent a small force of about a 100 men to capture them. The Burmese were taken by surprise when they were attacked while resting and were almost entirely wiped out by the force led by Nai Thaen, who had been elected leader of Bang Rachan.</p>
<p>News of this victory spread quickly across the country and resulted in many more people coming out of hiding to join the resistance movement, swelling the ranks camped within Bang Rajan to 1,000 fighting men. This <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur.html" title="Amateur">amateur</a> force was well organized along the lines of a professional military unit but, were considerably disadvantaged by their lack of equipment, especially firearms, although this was countered to an extent by their great faith in the presence of the priest Thammachot and his various magic spells and talismans.</p>
<p>Well aware that he was facing heavy resistance, the Burmese leader at Wiset Chaichanw requested reinforcements before sending another force against the village. He had underestimated them, as they managed to rout a second army of about 500 as well as a third force, again greater in numbers and under a new leader.</p>
<p>A pivotal event occurred during the fourth attack on the village by a force of 1,000 Burmese under Surin Chokhong. This force was not immediately defeated by the Siamese villagers but their commander was killed and after much fighting the villagers retreated. At this point the carelessness of the Burmese appeared once again as they lowered their guard to begin preparing food and caring for the corpse of their commander. Seeing this, the villagers quickly returned to the field and the surprised Burmese force was truly routed and lost most of its manpower due to the determined pursuit by the Siamese villagers. While victorious again, the leader of Bang Rajan, Nai Thaen, was shot in the knee - an event which would have grave consequences for the resistance as it meant he was no longer capable of fighting or leading from the front.</p>
<p>The aftermath of this fourth battle saw both sides receive reinforcements, with Bang Rajan selecting a new leader to replace Nai Thaen - a fighter named Nai Chan who was famed for his ferocity and <i>"bristling moustache"</i>. The fortunes of Bang Rajan remained good under Nai Chan, who saw their forces increase and achieve ever greater levels of organization, and their reputation grow to such extent that the Burmese came to fear them and the raiders had great trouble recruiting troops to send against the village.</p>
<p>After seven attacks and seven defeats, an eighth force, under a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mon_people.html" title="Mon people">Mon</a> commander who had lived in Siam, volunteered to take an army and promised to defeat Bang Rajan. What set this commander apart from the previous <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Burmese</a> leaders was his knowledge of the land and the Siamese and his lack of arrogance - he did not underestimate the villagers and adjusted his tactics to disadvantage them. He progressed slowly towards the village by building a series of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forts.html" title="Forts">forts</a> along the route and, when faced with the villagers, refused to fight except from within these <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortifications.html" title="Fortifications">fortifications</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of artillery was now crippling for the villagers, as they could not destroy the forts built by the Burmese and suffered great casualties from <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> assaults upon the forts. One of the Siamese leaders - Nai Thong Men - became drunk and furious and, upon a <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_buffalo.html" title="Water buffalo">water buffalo</a>, took a force of men and attacked the Burmese in what remains one of the iconic tales and images from the legend of the village. He was killed and his men routed - the first time the Burmese had defeated the villagers.</p>
<p>Bang Rajan sent for help from <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayutthaya.html" title="Ayutthaya">Ayutthaya</a> in the form of cannons they could use against the forts, but the capital displayed a diffidence typical of its strategy throughout the war and refused the request. However, one man, Phraya Rattanathibet, was sent to help them forge their own weapons. Unfortunately for the village, the guns they cast were cracked and useless. Soon after this, Nai Then died of the wound to his knee and the other great leaders, Nai Chan and Khun San died of wounds taken while trying to take the Burmese forts.</p>
<p>The village was by now dispirited and hopeless, and faced a siege by the Burmese in the form of cannon fire, siege towers and tunnelling under the village walls. Eventually the village was overrun despite resistance to the end - five months after the first act of resistance and the only notable act of successful opposition by a Siamese force in a war characterised by the failure of Ayutthuya, its professional armies and its Generals.</p>
