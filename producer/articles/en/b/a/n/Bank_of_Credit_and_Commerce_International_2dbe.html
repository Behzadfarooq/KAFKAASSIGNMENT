<p>The <b>Bank of Credit and Commerce International</b> (<b>BCCI</b>) was a major international <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank.html" title="Bank">bank</a> founded in <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in 1972. At its peak, it operated in 78 countries, had over 400 branches, and claimed assets of $25 billion.</p>
<p>BCCI became the focus in 1991 of the world's worst financial scandal and what was called a "$20-billion-plus heist" (Beaty &amp; Gwynne 1993). It was found by regulators in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> to be involved in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_laundering.html" title="Money laundering">money laundering</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bribery.html" title="Bribery">bribery</a>, support of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a><sup id="_ref-terrorism_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-terrorism" title="">[1]</a></sup>, arms trafficking, the sale of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_technology.html" title="Nuclear technology">nuclear technologies</a>, the commission and facilitation of <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_evasion.html" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a>, <a href="../../../s/m/u/Smuggling.html" title="Smuggling">smuggling</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_immigration.html" title="Illegal immigration">illegal immigration</a>, and the illicit purchases of banks and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_estate.html" title="Real estate">real estate</a>. The bank was found to be worthless, with at least $13 billion unaccounted for.</p>
<p>Investigators in the U.S. and the UK revealed that BCCI had been "set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions". Its affairs are extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup>; BCCI organized its own intelligence network, diplomatic corps, and shipping &amp; trading companies.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquidator_%28law%29.html" title="Liquidator (law)">liquidators</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deloitte_%26_Touche_583e.html" title="Deloitte &amp; Touche">Deloitte &amp; Touche</a>, filed a lawsuit against <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price_Waterhouse_b955.html" title="Price Waterhouse">Price Waterhouse</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_%26_Young_117d.html" title="Ernst &amp; Young">Ernst &amp; Young</a>, the bank's auditors, which was settled for $175 million in 1998. A further lawsuit against the emir of <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Dhabi_b84d.html" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>, a major shareholder, was launched in 1999 for around $400 million. BCCI creditors also instituted a $1 billion suit against the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_England_ea3c.html" title="Bank of England">Bank of England</a> as a regulatory body. After a nine-year struggle due to the Bank's statutory immunity, the case went to trial in January 2004. However in November 2005 liquidators Deloitte dropped any action against the Bank of England as it was no longer considered in the best interests of the creditors after a High Court ruling.</p>

<p>BCCI's founder, <a href="../../../a/g/h/Agha_Hasan_Abedi_2279.html" title="Agha Hasan Abedi">Agha Hasan Abedi</a>, started the bank in <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in 1972. Abedi had previously set up the United Bank of Pakistan in 1959. Following the nationalization of United Bank in 1971 he sought to create a new supranational banking entity. BCCI was created with capital from <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheikh_Zayed_bin_Sultan_Al_Nahayan_3949.html" title="Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan">Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan</a>, emir of <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Dhabi_b84d.html" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_Emirates_edab.html" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_America_3960.html" title="Bank of America">Bank of America</a> (25%) and, allegedly, the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>. It is claimed that the CIA were seeking a funding route for the <a href="../../../m/u/j/Mujahideen.html#afghan_mujahideen" title="Mujahideen">Afghan Mujahideen</a>, similar to the Investors Overseas Service and the <a href="../../../n/u/g/Nugan_Hand_Bank_d797.html" title="Nugan Hand Bank">Nugan Hand Bank</a> in the 1970s. However, the vast majority of BCCI's assets were initially from Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>BCCI expanded rapidly in the 1970s, pursuing asset growth over profits, seeking high net-worth individuals and regular large deposits. The company itself divided into BCCI Holdings with the bank under that split into BCCI S.A (<a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>) and BCCI Overseas (<a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Cayman_2165.html" title="Grand Cayman">Grand Cayman</a>). BCCI also acquired parallel banks through acquisitions: buying the Banque de Commerce et Placements (BCP) of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> in 1976, and creating KIFCO (<a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> International Finance Company), Credit &amp; Finance Corporation Ltd, and a series of Cayman-based companies held together as ICIC (International Credit and Investment Company Overseas, International Credit and Commerce [Overseas], etc.). Overall, BCCI expanded from 19 branches in five countries in 1973 to 27 branches in 1974, to 108 branches in 1976, with assets growing from $200 million to $1.6 billion. This growth caused extensive underlying capital problems. By 1977, BCCI was in sufficiently dire financial straits that the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">Guardian</a></i> later wrote that at this time "BCCI, founded in 1975, was almost certainly insolvent by 1977"<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> - it was using cash from deposits to fund operating expenses, rather than making investments, taking on the attributes of a <a href="../../../p/o/n/Ponzi_scheme.html" title="Ponzi scheme">Ponzi scheme</a>. Nevertheless BCCI continued to expand, moving into the African markets in 1979, and Asia in the early 1980s. They were among the first foreign banks awarded a license to operate in the Chinese <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Economic_Zone_9f43.html" title="Special Economic Zone">Special Economic Zone</a> <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shenzhen.html" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a>. Some of China's largest state banks were depositors in BCCI's Shenzhen branch.</p>
<p>By 1980, BCCI was reported to have assets of over $4 billion with over 150 branches in 46 countries. <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_America_3960.html" title="Bank of America">Bank of America</a> was "bewildered"<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> with BCCI and reduced its holding in 1980, and the company came to be held by a number of groups, with ICIC owning 70%. By 1989, ICIC's shareholding was reduced to 11% with Abu Dhabi groups holding almost 40%, however large numbers of shares were held by BCCI nominees. The internal structure of the bank was unusual. There was rigid compartmentalization and there were 248 managers and general managers and only two people above them, Abedi and the CEO Swaleh Naqvi. <a href="../../../f/_/l/F_Lee_Bailey_a17b.html" title="F Lee Bailey">F Lee Bailey</a> and Florida state prosecutor Richard Gerstein were the directors of CenTrust Federal Savings Bank, a failed satellite of the BCCI.</p>
<p>BCCI had an uncommon annual auditing system: Price Waterhouse were the accountants for BCCI Overseas while Ernst &amp; Young audited BCCI and BCCI Holdings (London and Luxembourg). Other companies such as KIFCO and ICIC were audited by neither. In October 1985, the Bank of England and the Central Bank of Luxembourg ordered BCCI to change to a single accountant, alarmed at reported BCCI losses on the commodity and financial markets. Price Waterhouse became the sole accountants in 1987.</p>
<p>In 1988, BCCI was implicated in a drug money laundering scheme based in Tampa, Florida, the C-Chase case. The BCCI was called the CIA’s money laundering facility. BCCI pleaded guilty in 1990 but only on the grounds of <i><a href="../../../r/e/s/Respondeat_superior.html" title="Respondeat superior">respondeat superior</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1990, a Price Waterhouse audit of BCCI revealed an unaccountable loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. The bank approached <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheikh_Zayed_7455.html" title="Sheikh Zayed">Sheikh Zayed</a>, who made good the loss in exchange for an increased shareholding of 78%. Much of BCCI's documentation was then also transferred to Abu Dhabi.</p>

</div>
<p>The Sandstorm report, parts of which were leaked to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">The Sunday Times</a>, included details of how the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Nidal_1481.html" title="Abu Nidal">Abu Nidal</a> terrorist group had held accounts at BCCI's <a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloane_Street_66ee.html" title="Sloane Street">Sloane Street</a> branch, near <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrods.html" title="Harrods">Harrods</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. Britain's internal security service, <a href="../../../m/i/5/MI5_b0c3.html" title="MI5">MI5</a>, had signed up two sources inside the branch to hand over copies of all documents relating to Abu Nidal's accounts. One source was the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syrian</a>-born branch manager, Ghassan Qassem, the second a young British employee.</p>
<p>The Abu Nidal link man for the BCCI accounts was an Arab based in Iraq named Samir Najmeddin or Najmedeen. Throughout the 80s, BCCI had set up millions of dollars worth of letters of credit for Najmeddin, largely for arms deals with Iraq. Qassem later swore in an <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affidavit.html" title="Affidavit">affidavit</a> that Najmeddin was often accompanied by an American, whom Qassem subsequently identified as the financier <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Rich_4023.html" title="Marc Rich">Marc Rich</a>. Rich was later indicted in the U.S. for <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_evasion.html" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racketeering.html" title="Racketeering">racketeering</a> in an apparently unrelated case, fled the country, and received a controversial pardon from <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20.html" title="January 20">January 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>
<p>Qassem also told reporters that he had once escorted Abu Nidal, who was allegedly using the name Shakir Farhan, around town to buy a tie, without realizing who he was. This revelation led in 1991 to one of the <i><a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Evening_Standard_1890.html" title="London Evening Standard">London Evening Standard</a>'s</i> best-known front-page headlines: "I Took Abu Nidal Shopping."</p>

Around a million investors were affected. Amongst the customers of the bank at this time was Garrards and Mappin &amp; Webb, the jewellers responsible for maintaining the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_jewels.html" title="Crown jewels">crown jewels</a> and makers of the trophy for the <a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Cup_8b3b.html" title="America's Cup">America's Cup</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, United States Senators <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Brown_9631.html" title="Hank Brown">Hank Brown</a> co-authored a report on BCCI which was delivered to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations_ed14.html" title="U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations">Committee on Foreign Relations</a>. The BCCI scandal was one of a number of crimes and disasters that influenced thinking leading to the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Interest_Disclosure_Act_add0.html" title="Public Interest Disclosure Act">Public Interest Disclosure Act</a> of 1998. The report found that former <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense_6e16.html" title="United States Secretary of Defense">Defense Secretary</a> <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Clifford_161f.html" title="Clark Clifford">Clark Clifford</a> and his business partner <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Altman_1b34.html" title="Robert A.

Clifford and Altman testified to the committee that they had never observed any suspicious activity. The federal government brought indictments against Clifford and Altman and proposed barring them from banking for life, but did not pursue Clifford due to his age and deteriorating health. Altman, however, was indicted and ultimately tried in New York by the office of District Attorney <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Morgenthau_f671.html" title="Robert Morgenthau">Robert Morgenthau</a>. Despite a failure to convict in the New York trial, Altman nevertheless agreed to be banned from banking under threat of prosecution by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The British government also set up an independent inquiry, chaired by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Bingham%2C_Baron_Bingham_of_Cornhill_0ab2.html" title="Tom Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill">Lord Justice Bingham</a>, in 1992. Its House of Commons Paper, <i>Inquiry into the Supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International</i> was published in October of that year. Following the report, the bank's liquidators launched the <i>Three Rivers vs. Bank of England</i> case, on behalf of thousands of BCCI creditors who are suing the Bank of England for its failure to properly oversee the bank. The BCCI creditors sought £850m in damages, claiming that the Bank of England was guilty of misfeance in public office. The case collapsed in November 2005, with the Bank of England seeking to re-claim legal bills. The cost of the case to the creditors could be as high as £100m.
