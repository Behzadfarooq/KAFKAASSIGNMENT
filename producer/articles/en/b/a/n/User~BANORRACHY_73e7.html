<p>BANORRACHY, also known as Bano, Bany, or even Bunny is a first class human being, if you can even begin to describe him as such. His super human attributes set him apart from anyone else. Bano is well known for his gaming prowess, especially when it comes to quick reactions (which many attribute to his half Asian heritage). Aside from gaming, Bany is a very social individual, making friends at every step of his life. Though he is young, Bany has acquired something of a following. He may not like to admit it, but there do in fact exist people that worship him. Perhaps this is because of how skilled he is when it comes to video games, maybe it's how friendly he is, or perhaps it is his boyish good looks. Bunny is a very handsome and extraordinarily cute young man. It is far from uncommon to find women swarming around him, often swooning at his very presence. His gentleman like behavior, intelligent speech, and unique voice are overwhelming for girls. All around, BANORRACHY is something of an idol in his day. Through such publicly known "clans" such as The League, Bano will forever be remembered and loved.</p>

<p>Arriving on store shelves September of 2004, Half Life 2 was the next generations must have computer game. After winning countless awards, honors, and other forms of recognition, the original Half Life paved the way to this spectacular sequel. BANORRACHY, of course, would be taking part in this revolutionary game. Along with Half Life 2, the source (game engine) modification of Counter Strike would be included in the game. Creating a Steam (Game Manager) account and installing his game, Bano (STEAM_0:1:5139509) continued to play through Half Life 2, then proceeded to play Counter Strike: Source (CS:S). Remembering playing Counter Strike 1.5 from his earlier days weekly with his friends in middle and high school, CS:S was a game Bany would not miss out on. Well aware of the competition surrounding this game, Bano was determined to train himself to become the best.</p>
<p>Adding [WAR] clan to his list of favorite servers, BANORRACHY was known to socialize with this group staying up to the late hours of 1am playing. Preventing his entrance into the clan was his refuting to join the [WAR] mIRC chat channel to talk to Str3tch. One day after school, Bany was shocked to find that the [WAR] clan server was no more. In place of it was a server controlled by the [uTi] (United Team Intelligence) clan. Unaware of who these people were, Bano proceeded to play in this server of the same IP address (for with his 56k internet connection, this server provided him with a steady low ping). After a few weeks in the [uTi] server and talking to some of the members, the leader of [uTi], Sandman, told BANORRACHY that he would love to have him in the clan, but his high latency was an issue. After some debate, however, Bano was let into the clan. It would soon be discovered that [uTi] clan was nothing more than a division of the [WAR] clan due to leadership versus payment issues. Of course, server payer Sandman and his friend Sandthrower won the battle, and the server changed its name. Playing happily in [uTi] clan, BANORRACHY and his clanmates competed on the OGL (Online Gaming League) ladder. Failing to win very many matches, Sandman was utterly disappointed. Training under YamahaBOB, Sandman's son, [uTi] picked up a few stronger players. Father-son conflict was soon to arise, and YamahaBOB decided to join the army. Dyslexic father Sandman took BANORRACHY privately into the server after kicking everyone and locking it down to request that he take charge of the clan in his son's absence.</p>
<p>Thrilled but weary, Bany took this offer and proceeded to take care of the [uTi] clan. Friend from school, Mark was brought into the clan and the team continued to happily enjoy the server maintained by Bano and under his leadership. Sandman, who would frequently play in the public server he paid for, began to complain to Bano about people killing him (he suspected people of hacking). Bano took it under himself to install anti-cheat programs and modifications to the server to prevent this (including the recently released official VALVe anti-cheat client) and appease Sandman. Still not satisfied, Sandman accused Bano's friend Mark of hacking. He ordered Marksticked to be removed from the clan immediately. BANORRACHY would not stand to see his good friend treated this way. Due to Sandman's oppression and this recent accusation (which Bano knew not to be true for Marksticked would frequently play at his house), Hesitant to let down YamahaBOB, BANORRACHY decided it was time to move on.</p>
<p>Breaking away from the [uTi] clan, Bano, Mark, Shizz, and a few other more "serious" members tagged up [ ] to show their lack of support for [uTi]. Shizz, who had offered to pay for a new server, and BANORRACHY started the offshoot clan [BmW] (Bitches Moan and Wail), who's name was assistedby Bano's friend Nick. Recruiting new members and competing successfully with players such as Tron and Leon Trotsky, [BmW] thrived in competitive success even making it to rank two on the OGL ladder before dropping out. The bond and friendship that grew between the members of the clan thrived as well. From the [uTi] clan that had diminished to an empty server, new members were recruited, most notable of which was Sonic, who's humor, friendly nature, and entertaining game play got him recognition.</p>
<p>The clan broke down starting in January of 2006 when female gamer Little Neko made an appearance one evening. Playing all night, BANORRACHY would soon find himself happily and helplessly at the side of Neko. Making a two person team with undeniable chemistry that could not be easily defeated, Bano and Neko would receive harassment from the other clan members due to Neko's actions and Bano's constant attention to her. Sadden by this potential parting, Bany was happy to find that his clan was behind him more than he knew. [BmW] lived on.</p>
<p>After a few months went by, BANORRACHY had a vision to create a community of gamers; after all the clan had already split into two divisions ([BmW] and&#160;:BmW:). However, having such a rash statement as the one given in the clan name, Bano felt that it would not be too family friendly to try to build a community under such a name. Graphic Artist and recent clan member BatskyStarman suggested a name of "The League" which was hesitantly embraced. The League, most certainly one of the strongest bonded group of individuals played on their server and talked to each other to the wee hours of the morning (5 and 7 am in many cases). Together they played in countless other games such as Battlefield 2. A while later, after being reacquainted with Tron, The League decided to enter into CAL (Cyberathlete Amateur League)for season 6 of the Open division. The clan soon found themselves somewhat over their heads in this intense competition. They ended the season with 4 wins and 4 losses; but what was worse was the fact that the stress caused by this undertaking caused some of the more prominent members to take a leave for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<p>Picking up new members, The League looked to strive in season 7 (though the team was made of completely new players), but unfortunately conflict and players deciding to quit the game completely put a damper on this. Name changers "Taste of Lead" lost their leader, and their friendly members (who live close to Bano) joined The League. Today, The League is back to its roots of being a very closely bonded clan with members who simply like to have fun. They look to continue to play together for the years to come. BANORRACHY joined CAL Intermediate team, The Price, led by Tron; however, his heart remains with his roots. Forever will he play as, and together with, The League.</p>

<p>When Bano met Rogue, they fell instantly into a massive gaming fest. Rogue was saying nigs in my fro. Bano yelled WALLS and Rogue yelled NIGS IN MY FRO</p>
<p>This is a diagram of what actualy will happen when Rogue uses walls</p>

<p>When Rogue wanted to kill Adept (Who is now mentioned) he started to use Jedi-Mind-Tricks on Bany to turn Bany to the Rogue side. Rogue however could not prevail when Bany defended himself with Jedi-Throw and people-Trick, Rogue was distrusted by many people until The League was formed. When the The League was formed, Rogue was CAL-Terribad and slowly improved, proving to Bany that he is worth his trust. Bany lived happily with the The League and won match after match because of his Jedi-trixs. Bano woke up in the morning eating Trix-for kids- not worrying about Rogue because he lags out and leaves scrims, but then Rogue came back after a one week absense on the checklist. Rogue came back without the nigs in his fro and without the nerd pants, now wearing tight pants that make all the blood flow to his heart because he has heart disease.</p>

<p>When Bano met Special eD, hes like omg you are such a retard (special really trying his best in real life just flat out sucked). but Special changed Bano's life when special did one thing right. Now special can almost be trusted. Until he messes up again (which is most likely soon so special better try his best). Special has a hard time keeping up with bano but the jews in his fro hold him back &lt;----Comment taken from Smokeits420 (John) *permission given to Speciel eD because he was trying*</p>

<p>When Bano met Adept, his life changed. His life was not full of Rogue anymore! Rogue was like, OMFG I will kill Adept for stealing my only friend. Bano became a meat shield later that day by stoping 2 headshots by Rogue's AWP and his atepmt to One-deag(deagle) us.</p>
<p>Rogue then went back to his new house in Richmond.</p>

<p>John is The Leagues, unofficial scrimmer 1337 master of WC3, BF2, BF2142 and Starcraft, it was obvious from the start John would be the black sheep. Constantly having to defend himself from his EMO-ly confused brother "Chris" who constantly nagged him, John felt no need to advance his pwnage in CS:S. John now mostly plays BF2 and BF2142 with Batsky Starman and his clan because he doesnt like Scrimming or Matches. John is a a supplier of music files for Bano as well as an html wizzard so he had to add the Legal notes on Bano's pictures.</p>
