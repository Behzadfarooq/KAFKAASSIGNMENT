Issues as I see them: "Culture" section right now seems like the arts. That's not all there is to culture ... should include food, clothing, ceremonies etc, in adition some art forms like fine arts and dance are absent.</p>

"Most of the Awami League leaders fled and set up a government-in-exile in Calcutta, declaring Bangladesh an independent state" -- the declaration of independence was made earlier, and from within Bangladesh (either by Mujib or Zia, but doesn't matter in this case). --<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 23:46, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you said "exile is super well-known" - I beg to differ. What is "super well known"? Perhaps you are suggesting that those who know <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> know the fact. But we should not forget that this article will be read by thousands who know almost nothing about Bangladesh or Kolkata, especially when the article will appear in the main page as FA. In fact, I doubt whether a sizable portion of population of Kolkata or Bangladesh, especially the younger population, know the fact. From my experience, I came to know the fact quite late, may be just 5 to 6 years back, and that also while reading the fiction <i>Purbo-Paschim</i> by <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunil_Gangopadhyay_2fc7.html" title="Sunil Gangopadhyay">Sunil Gangopadhyay</a>. I do not disagree that the "declared" part can be removed if you find it unable to digest. I myself knew otherwise, i.e. independence was declared from inside East Pakistan. And that is why the reference from Britannica was given (that Britannica is dependable is super well-known). I am sorry if I sounded too harsh in this message, I could not help as I was quite astonished to see modification of a <b>substantiated</b> fact by such a nice and veteran Wikipedian like you.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 06:07, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for clarification of the whole issue, The Awami League leaders declared a government in exile in Boiddonath_tola of Meherpur district (now called Mujibnogor) on april 17. They had some sort of declaration of formation of the govt in exile or so. The declaration of independence, on the other hand, was from either Sheikh Mujib (over a EPR radio transmitter, transmitted and monitored near Dhaka on the night of 25th march (ref: Pakistan army major Siddique Salik, "Witness to surrender"), or by M A Hannan, an awami league leader in Chittagong, using the chittagong radio station transmitter (transmitted on 26th march, but not publicized, listeners from chittagong, my parents and others from that time, told me that they never heard this transmission), or by Major Zia on 27th march, transmitted using the Kalurghat transmitter on March 27. This xmission was relayed by Indian and other transmitter, and became the most famous and publicized declaration.</dd>

<dd>But in any case, this is a very minute point, I apperciate the great work by both <a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> and <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> in advancing Bangladesh and Bengal related articles, and hope that, with your continued efforts, the Bangladesh page will soon become a Featured article.

<dd>My point was, the "substantiated" claim you are making is debated. Is this is a issue that we want a huge paragraph on? Zia claims this (5 references), Mujib claims this (7 references), and brittanica says this (1, maybe more reference)? If you insist on keeping britannica for "that" statement (otherwise its fine as a general reference or other non debated issues), I will insist of having other claims proportionately represented. Also, as you can see from Ragib's discussion, both Mujib's and Zia's claims are much more detailed, whereas britannica is making a airy claim without reference, dates, peoples involved, nothing! "super well known" is perhaps the wrong word, obviously the information is important (which is why it is there), but it is clearly in a different class from "Income of Bangladeshis is usd 440" or something. I don't mean we can't have a reference, just that we don't need one for a totally non debated statement (the exile part).--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 20:32, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi! Of course it is unnecessary to debate on such a minute issue, given the size of the article is still increasing. The present form is quite ok. Basically, your apparent innuendo- "If the point of that sentence is the exiled government in Kolkata, lets just keep that part " was what prompted me to write again&#160;! In any case, the government in exile is siginificant enough to retain, while this debated "declaration" (which most probably Britannica got wrong&#160;!) can be done without. BTW, when are you people planning to pit it for FAC? It's a very nice article! --<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 09:10, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This things change a lot (hopefully for the better) and so it is appropriate to give the reader a sense of how old the data is and also serving as a reminder to update the figures few years down the road. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 08:01, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The picture used to show where Bangladesh is located in the world map isn't very accurate (or too 'zoomed out'). It doesn't clearly show the exact 'shape' of the borders of the country - comparing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:LocationBangladesh.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:LocationBangladesh.png" rel="nofollow">it</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Map_Bangladesh_RoadRail.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Map_Bangladesh_RoadRail.png" rel="nofollow">the actual map</a> makes it obvious. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheehan_8b29.html" title="User:Sheehan">Sheehan</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESheehan_0322.html" title="User talk:Sheehan">Talk</a>) 06:25, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But this is the world map ubiqutously used in wikipedia. If it's wrong then this must be a fundamental change. We must make sure the deformation is not due to some cartographic conventions before taking a decision.--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 17:47, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the deformed shape of the borders were pretty much expected, given the fact that Bangladesh is so small compared to the neighboring countries. I traced the origin of these country location pics and the original world map picture used to make them has this problem too. If the map was made just a little larger this deformation wouldn't affect the borders so drastically.</dd>
<dd>It'd be nice if I could find the program used to generate these pics, but I couldn't (the user who made them is currently inactive too). <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheehan_8b29.html" title="User:Sheehan">Sheehan</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESheehan_0322.html" title="User talk:Sheehan">Talk</a>) 04:46, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Immigration and trafficking</span></h2>
<p>I think exactly one issue in peer review has not been handled, the immigration thing. IMO, we should have exactly 1 line in demographics mentioning human trafficking, illegal immigration issue with Myanmar and India (infact, the issue with Myanmar is more crucial from BD's pov). Something in the line of, "Human traficking has been a continual problem and Bangldesh has some illegal immigration related issues with Myanmar and India." (references).</p>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a>, have you studied the Rohingya issue carefully enough to decide that the issue with India is more important (to Bangladesh)? If not, how can we escape the conclusion that there is POV going on here? Also, as I mentioned before, if it has not been important enough for mention in India so far, its hard to avoid the conclusion that this article is then a place for less important issues involving India. I think the attention given to it is enough.--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 15:41, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hahahahhaha....the importance you give to the "Rohingya" issue is your own POV, and possibly the POV of Bangladeshi society - neither of which should be a factor on Wikipedia. As I previously said, the number of '<b>Bangladeshis</b> (not Indians, as you wish you keep asking why Indians don't give it sufficient mention) illegally in India is speculated by sources in India and elsewhere to be close to 15 million. How do you make the conclusion that I ever claimed that the India issue was "more important" than Rohingya, when I didn't even mention the latter. Try to avoid "dear" and other forms of sarcasm in the future - I might not laugh the next time. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 20:57, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Minor point</span></h2>
<p>The word "ill-governed" in "Economy" is probably not appropriate. First, the word itself is quite South Asia-ish—is it in regular usage in British English? Second, the placement of the word is potentially debatable, especially from the government side of view, as it is not a referenced word! I think it would be better to replace it!
