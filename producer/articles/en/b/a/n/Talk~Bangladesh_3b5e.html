<p>The Government section is unclear who is head of government. The first paragraph states "The President.. is largely ceremonial.. real power held by Prime Minister."" The second paragraph states "prime minister is ceremonially appointed by the president." Which is it? --Ralph</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you are aware of how <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_democracy.html" title="Parliamentary democracy">parliamentary democracies</a> work, you'd know the answer already. In such systems, the president has a ceremonial post, with no real executive power. However, the president appoints the prime minister. This is actually a formality, as the president merely approves the person nominated by the majority party. Hope this helps. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 18:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the explanation. May I suggest updating the article instead of this discussion. I'm familiar with parliamentary systems but found the government section unclear. I'll be glad to try myself buy others I'm sure are more qualified. --Ralphyoung 03:42, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>related...boat or shat gombuj mosque (if we must chose)? I would say boat, just because its so quintessential. and we already have 2 other pics on structures--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 02:50, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you have to make a choice, the boat image, I think, should be there. You can replace the shat gombuj mosque, though in that case, the boat image would be placed in a rather inappropriate location. The satelite image is so nice, but still, can it be removed from the economy section? Another point, what is the difficulty in adding one or 2 pics beside the "notes", <i>a la</i> <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>? --<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 05:10, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm fine with the idea.--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 06:27, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are some cosmetic changes that I think will make the article a little bit nicer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving some pics to the left (like <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>)</li>
<li>Reducing the size of the pic in the subdivisions section to make it 'fit' (~200px would be fine)</li>
<li>Moving the templates like 'sisterlinks', 'indic text' and 'portal' to the Notes section</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think about them? Are they worth implementing? I could make these changes myself but I think there has to be some general agreement in favour of this (moving pics left goes against the MOS AFAIK). Also, we <i>could</i> move one or two pics to the notes section.

<p>This article states that Bangladesh is ranked 3rd according to highest muslim population. It also sates that Bangladesh has a lower Muslim population than India, which is right.

<p>I am not sure why BBC and Voice of America gets mentioned and linked in the article and yet none from Bangladesh at all. We are talking about Bangladesh here aren't we&#160;? Although bangla services of BBC &amp; VOA are popular here, but the audience of Bangladesh Betar would comfotably outnumber BBC &amp; VOA combined. Bangladesh Betar broadcasts almost 24 hours (except for a few hours I think), while the other 2 broadcasts only a few hours in total. As for TV, very few Bangladeshis watch BBC or CNN or VOA. Almost all of them, the overwhelming majority, watch local TV channels -- either the state-owned BTV (which also broadcasts terrestrially apart from being available from cable operators and thereby reaches anybody with a TV set even without a cable connection)or other private channels. Some people may watch some Indian Hindi channels for entertainment programmes, but surely not BBC or VOA [who don't have a Bengali Service for TV] , since a tiny minority here understands English. BBC or VOA don't deserve a mention here, unless actual BD media outlets are also mentioned and linked substantially. If that's not possible, please delete BBC &amp; VOA. --69.71.132.241 05:12, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think BBC and VOA are irrelevant in any way. Generally, most people in Bangladesh, in tea-stalls or otherwise, listen to BBC's nightly programmes almost every day. During various events and movement, the Government media is usually not trusted. So, people listen a lot to these two services, and their news programmes have a big impact.</dd>

<p>I have a suggestion. Why not list the world records of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. But, I need suggestion about it. Would be listed in the page of Bangladesh or would it be listed in a separate page titled "World Records of Bangladesh"? e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>The longest sea beach (Cox's Bazar)</li>
<li>The largest river delta</li>
<li>Most corrupted country (Transparency International Survey)</li>
<li>The Happiest country (2005 World Happiness Survey), etc.</li>

<p>These things can be discusses too.</p>

<dd>We can't really use the "world records" in this article. First of all, Bangladesh is now a featured article, with standard sections as specified for country articles. we shouldn't add needless sections which would only demote this article from featured article status. Next, some of the things you mentioned are not correct. Cox's Bazaar is not the longest sea beach, according to the <a href="../../../c/o/x/Talk%7ECox%27s_Bazar_District_df24.html" title="Talk:Cox's Bazar District">Talk:Cox's Bazar District</a> . The largest river delta is not only in Bangladesh, it includes parts of west bengal too. Most corrupt country nomination is quite disputed (though referenced a lot). Finally, this type of lists are not really encyclopedic, and are more suitable for newspapers rather than encyclopedias.

<dd>We should mention the Transparency International studies. Bangladesh has topped it 5 or 6 times. It is a reputable study. If you have credentialed rebuttals, you can add those too.

<dd>I don't think anybody's against adding it.

<p>My father had mentioned that the 3 million number came from a speech of Bangabandhu in which there was some discrepancy as to whether it was 300,000 or 3,000,000. Anyway, according to calculations, if it was 3 million, the Pak army would have to have massacred around 11,111 civilians per day for the 9-month period.

<p>The sentence "The exact origin of the word Bangla or Bengal is unknown" is misleading and erroneous .The word "Bengal" is derived from the root Sanskrit word "Banga" or Vanga . This being the case how can you say that the origin of the word " bengal" is unknown. I am not under any impression that Vyas named everything. But it is very much clear that the place name "Vanga" existed from the times of Vyasa. -<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBharatveer_2e1b.html" title="User:Bharatveer">Bharatveer</a> 04:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Vanga", another way to pronounce "Banga". Fine... Aurthoshastra mentions it. So? Does that imply "origin"? That wikipedia mentions "India", does it make it the "origin" of the word? --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 04:11, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Its not just another way of pronouncing "Banga" . The origin of the word is of ancient antiquity.You cannot just have a sentence saying that the exact origins are unknown .Your example of India and wikipedia looks quite childish . It would have been true if Wikipedia was older than the word India.I feel that the mention of the Sankrit epics is causing "inflammatory" feelings in my 'south asian' friends. So I will add a "citation needed" tag for that sentence for time being.<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBharatveer_2e1b.html" title="User:Bharatveer">Bharatveer</a> 04:23, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And aha!, the library of congress mentions the origin of the word from the local dravidian tribes: "Historians believe that Bengal, the area comprising present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, was settled in about 1000 B.C. by Dravidian-speaking peoples who were later known as the Bang.

<dd>This is not about which region it came from .This is about including budhist icon which was an important part of the History of bengal from which bangladesh was formed. The exclusion would have been justified if History of bangladesh started from 1947.But since the article claims ancient origins, this budha icon should be prefectly OK.<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBharatveer_2e1b.html" title="User:Bharatveer">Bharatveer</a> 04:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Funny argument, indeed. No body is raising any question about the significance of the Buddhist culture. However, there are perfectly relevant images of Buddha statues from the region, and therefore a statue not related to the Buddhist culture of Bangladesh is irrelevant here. You are missing the whole point about the statue. sure why you are so obsessed with particular statue. I'm perfectly ok with adding images of the ruins of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahasthangarh.html" title="Mahasthangarh">Mahasthangarh</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Sompur_Bihar_3666.html" title="Sompur Bihar">Sompur Bihar</a> or Mainamati, which are quite relevant.

<dd>Now you are being unreasonable. There is definitely a limit to number of images stuffed into an article ... let alone a featured article. I strongly disagree your particular obsession with this image, which is NOT related to the region now known as Bangladesh. Also, stop saying the falsehood that anyone is questioning the importance of Buddhist Culture (which is actually an integral part of Bangladeshi history). What Shmitra and I protested was about the image, which is misleading and confusing as it is not from the region. Show me why an image from an unrelated region should be added here while a perfectly relevant image is there.

<p>I have seen the articles on Dhaka and Bangladesh. Why do people call this country impoverished? Its the 31st highest GDP in the world! And look at the article on Dhaka, look at the pics- Bashondhara City is great! This country is not poor!</p>
<p>First of all, Bangladesh's GDP is more like 56th in the world. There's more to countries than just the one or two areas, and even in those one or two areas you have massive disparity between the rich and the poor. Poor health care, high infant mortality death rate, low life expectency. Around 40 - 50% of people below the poverty line. It most certainly is poor. As the article states, efforts have been made to improve literacy and the GDP real growth rate is over 5% (I think) but it still as a LONG way to go. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedpeguyuk_4f20.html" title="User:Hedpeguyuk">hedpeguyuk</a> 16 July 2006, 14:05 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it's a poor country indeed, but there is a very strong tendency among some people to portray Bangladesh as "one of the poorest countries" in the world, which is absolutely untrue. Bangladeshis enjoy a much better health, transport and educational status than at least 50/60 countries in the world. And despite widespread corruption, the country has achieved a commendable growth rate in the last 15 years. Please stop using this cliche: "Bangladesh is one of the poorest...", we are indeed one of the emerging tigers and all we need to do is start believing in ourselves... <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazimostak_669f.html" title="User:Kazimostak">Kazimostak</a> 03 February 2007.</p>

<p>This article makes Pakistan look like some kind of colonialist power, Pakistan itself was a victim of colonialism, yet by reading this article you would think otherwise. If you read this and the Bangladesh liberation war article it mentions 3 million bengalis killed, thats laughable, Even Germany with Gas Chambers, SS, Concentration camps, and the Gestapo killed 6 million Jews over 6 years, Yet according to this Pakistan acomplished this feat of 3 million in just 9 months. This would mean Pakistan killed 333333.333 Bengalis a month, or rather 84000 people a week, or 12000 people a day!!!</p>
<p>From what I know Bangladesh at the time of independence had a larger population than west Pakistan, Pakistan went from being the second largest country in south asia after India, to the third largest after India and Bangladesh, Similarly it went from being the second largest economy in south asia after India to the third largest in South Asia.Today, Pakistan is again the second largest in population and economy, one must give credit to pakistan for its resilience.</p>
<p>Here is more online nonsense from gendercide with this 3 million figure</p>
<p>If the rate of killing for all of Pakistan is annualized over the years the Yahya martial law regime was in power (March 1969 to December 1971), then this one regime was more lethal than that of the Soviet Union, China under the communists, or Japan under the military (even through World War II).

<p>According to this piece of nonsense, Pakistan was more deadly an 'occupying power' than the Imperial Japanese Empire. The fact that East Pakistan chose to be a part of Pakistan on its own free will can be conviently forgotten,</p>
<p>I have no problems with Bengalis trying to justify thier independence, but to make hollow claims of 3 million dead, that too a figure that the corrupt government of Bangladesh uses, and please dont quote Yayha Khan, he was persian royalty and a relative of the <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_393b.html" title="Aga Khan">Aga Khan</a> who only knew about cakes, biscuits, and polo, not much else.</p>

<p>Is it a crime in Bangladesh to question the Bengali holocaust?</p>
<p>As for textbooks in Pakistan there have been complaints from some quarters about 'historic revisionism'. I do not deny for one instance that some Bengalis were killed, But I certainly do not think the 3 million figure is accurate or anywhere near that number of fatalities. The Yahya Khan comment 'kill three million' made for good propaganda nothing else.</p>
<p>I think your mis-interpreted my comment earlier, There is an unbelievable ammount of propaganda against Pakistan since its very inception, Some include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jinnah was an agent of the western imperialists</li>
<li>Pakistan was formed on the belief that Muslims and Non-Muslims could not co-exist</li>
<li>Pakistan invaded kashmir</li>
<li>Pakistan is an aggressor state</li>
<li>Pakistan supported the Taliban</li>
<li>Pakistan is an American police man in the region</li>
<li>Pakistan did 9/11</li>
<li>Pakistan did the mumbai train bombings</li>
<li>Pakistan gave north korea and Iran nuclear weapons</li>

<dd>If you have problems with these type of propaganda, make these comments in the relevant talk pages or blogs or wherever you face them ... rather than making irrelevant comments here. For fatalities, please write an academic paper refuting R.J. Rummel's findings ... if written properly with adequate references, it might be a great publication in political science journals.

<dd>Seagal, I believe you need to read neutral sources, I believe you are reading propaganda. Your above points and your comments on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Talk%7EKargil_War_1a33.html" title="Talk:Kargil War">Talk:Kargil War</a> prove something of the sort. While I agree with you on some points, I need to point you out to these: <i>Pakistan was formed on the belief that Muslims and Non-Muslims could not co-exist</i>. If it wasn't formed on that basis then what was the need to kick all Hindus and Sikhs out of regions they were living in for millenia and kill those that remained? Why was it formed then? <i>Pakistan invaded kashmir</i>, Hari Singh gave the state to India, after which Pakistan invaded it causing the 1947 war. <i>Pakistan supported the Taliban</i>, I'm sure they weren't supporting the Soviets during their invasion of Afghanistan. <i>Pakistan is an American police man in the region</i>, when no other Middle Eastern country is properly helping, Musharraf is working with the Americans, I wouldn't call it a police man but it is certainly helping America, if that's a bad thing caused by propaganda then so be it. <i>Pakistan did the mumbai train bombings</i>, I'm not saying the government called for it, but it was traced back to the ISI. <i>Pakistan attacked the indian parliament</i> same as last sentence. <i>Pakistan gave north korea and Iran nuclear weapons</i>, AQK could've helped, not the Pakistani state but important Pakistani people. <i>Pakistan killed 3 million Bengalis</i>, are you aware that the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocides_in_History_9d2c.html" title="Genocides in History">Genocides in History</a> page labels this incident a genocide?

<p>I was trying to emphasize that there is alot of propaganda against Pakistan for over half a century, even in the recent Test Match in the UK, Pakistan was falsely accused of ball-tampering.</p>
<p>That aside I do not wish to start anykind of flame war here, but R.J Rummels work has already been refuted, I cite the works of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarmila_Bose_894a.html" title="Sarmila Bose">Sarmila Bose</a>, Thus there is no need for me to refute R.J Rummel for that little Indian woman <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarmila_Bose_894a.html" title="Sarmila Bose">Sarmila Bose</a> has already done so.<a href="../../../s/_/s/User%7ES_Seagal_9bcf.html" title="User:S Seagal">S Seagal</a> 07:35, 28 October 2006 (UTC)S Seagal</p>

<p>I'm not sure I see it that way Ragib, Nayanika Mookherjee is the mouthpiece of the Indian and Bangali government, his work was commissioned by a government therefore one can question its partiality.</p>
<p>Besides R.J. Rummel's work is much more heavily criticized than that of Sarmila Bose, not just from Pakistanis but the world over.

User S Seagal should at least get his facts right - the article says "several hundred thousand to three million", does not claim 3 million as a firm figure. Actually the sources say three hundred thousand, and I will change the article to that. As for quoting genecides, about 1 million were killed in Rwunda in 100 days, mostly with machetes and knives. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 08:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly, this article is providing the the information that there is such a claim. Moreover, if you go through the references provided, you will see that more than one international newspaper has reported more than a million deaths half way through the conflict, thus 3 million is simply not a claim coming from Bangladesh (whether its correct or not is not the point, it is significantly well known enough to deserve mention).--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 19:50, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Though quite irrelevant to the current topic, I amazed by Seagal's assertion that Pakistan's formation had nothing to do with coexistence of religions.

<dd>It was never my intention to start a flame war or anything of the sort and I hope that all those reading and contributing maintain a respectable level of cordiality, like i mentioned before such issues as controverial as this must be tackled in a dis-passionate, and open manner. Mr Ragib seems to be have been upset by my earlier comments, and if i upset him or his sentiments or Bengali sentiments that was never my intention, That being said I really can not see any wrong in Pakistan whatsoever, its a country that has been trying to defend itself from aggression for over half a century and is only trying to exist, One can not blame all the ills of South Asia on Pakistan, thats just not fair. Its time that Pakistan's neighobours accept that Pakistan is the country in which millions and millions of Indian muslims and Afghan muslims have chosen to live and settle and they should respect that. Certainly there has been some demographic movement of Muslims into Pakistan and non-Muslims from Pakistan during the partition but needless to say the influx of muslims into Pakistan was greater than the outflow of non-Muslims from Pakistan. As someone with Indian Muslim origins I support the right of Pakistan to exist, I also feel that I have a moral duty towards it and the more I see people trying to bash it the more zealously I will defend it. I make no apology for my belief in the Pakistan concept. Thank You <a href="../../../s/_/s/User%7ES_Seagal_9bcf.html" title="User:S Seagal">S Seagal</a> 00:14, 29 October 2006 (UTC)S Seagal</dd>

<dd>If you are claiming that this wikipedia article is trying to subvert Pakistan's existence, then that is really a untenable notion. Our job here is to write an encyclopedic entry about BANGLADESH (you seem to have nothing to say abt Bangladesh on the talk page of this article), and represent significant views. By the way, nobody said you should be apologetic abt the concept of Pakistan. Pakistan is a sovereign nation. For that reason alone, it should proudly assert its belief in the two nation theory it was based on. these is no reason whatsoever to hide it.--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 00:32, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just clarifying a few points. I don't have any problem with Pakistan's right to exist, I think the idea of a reunited India as fairly impossible. When Seagal disputed that Pakistan was built for religious regions. He says <i>Its time that Pakistan's neighobours accept that Pakistan is the country in which millions and millions of Indian muslims and Afghan muslims have chosen to live and settle and they should respect that. Certainly there has been some demographic movement of Muslims into Pakistan and non-Muslims from Pakistan during the partition but needless to say the influx of muslims into Pakistan was greater than the outflow of non-Muslims from Pakistan.</i> The key word here is <i>chosen</i>, whether the influx of Muslims into Pakistan was greater than the outflor of non-Muslims from Pakistan, the Muslims moving into Pakistan chose to do so and the Non-Muslims moving out of Pakistan either did it or died. I know that many lives (Muslim and Non-Muslim) were lost and I wish it weren't so, I wish everyone continued following Gandhi's ideals into independence, anyway my point is one cannot compare the effects of the partition on Hindus in Pakistan to the effects of the partition on Muslims out of India. In an <b>individual</b> sense, there was no difference, in a broader sense one community was presented with choice and one community was presented with none. Anyway, I'm happy with the decision of some Muslims to remain in India. If <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Pathan_b760.html" title="Irfan Pathan">Irfan Pathan</a> performs tonight India's pretty much won. By the way, your claims of propaganda in the ball tampering issue are quite baseless. Now, people who are reading this would notice that I have gone way off topic and have not mentioned Bangladesh once in this comment, so I hope this comment is the closure of the broader propaganda discussion.

<dd>I think most of the world cares in all honesty, The fact that this 'genocide' was not investigated or taken to the international court of justice or the Hague in itself disproves the strongest advocates of this 'genocide'. Like I mentioned before I cite the works of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarmila_Bose_894a.html" title="Sarmila Bose">Sarmila Bose</a> to refute the 3 million dead Bengali genocide.

<p><b>: I followed this sometimes interesting sometimes irritating chain of discussion with much interest.</b> Mr. S Seagal, although was quite right to doubt the 3 million figure (of martyrs), he frequently crossed the limit. One of his frequent comments was: Yes, I agree that some Bangladeshis died..." this comment is outragious, because even one life of Bangladeshi (or anybody) is valuable, you cannot kill 10 people and say: it's only 10, it could have been 100! The single unalterable fact remains is that: pakistani junta carried out a brutal genocide in Bangladesh and more significantly, they have not yet apologised for that. We demand an apology, not lame excuses. He also routinely rejected facts like socio-economic oppression to the Bengali people by the pakistani junta. But I also defy some other people like Idleguy (an Indian, naturally!) who tried to use this opportunity to bash Pakistan. We are talking Bangladesh here! We are not a playground for either pakistan or india to level their old scoresheet!

<p>I know Musharraf publicly apologised for the war in 2002(?) in Dhaka,but the history is not much mentioned in public/private Pakistani schools. Not all Pakistanis should be held accountable for,but similar to how Germany accepted the killing of thousands of innocent minorities,Pakistan should officially accept our darkest history and not commit furthur atrocities that we are against othe rprovinces like SIndh and Balouchistan.</p>

<p>I changed this sentence: Bangladesh enjoys the distinction of having two female politicians leading national politics, however, the country continues to suffer from extensive corruption,[17] disorder and political violence. To these two sentences: Bangladesh enjoys the distinction of having two female politicians leading national politics. The country continues to suffer from extensive corruption,[17] disorder and political violence.</p>
<p>I felt that the first version suggests that having women as leading national politicians would suggest a lack of corruption, but we really don't have any evidence for that. So, I just broke the sentence into to seperate sentences. Not a big change, really, but I felt that this makes things a bit better.
