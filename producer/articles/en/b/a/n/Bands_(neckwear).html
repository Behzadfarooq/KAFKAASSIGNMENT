<p>In the early sixteenth century "bands" referred to the shirt neck-band under a ruff. For the rest of the century, when ruffs were still worn, and in the seventeenth century, bands referred to all the variations of these neckwear. All bands or collars arose from a standing neck-band of varying heights. They were tied at the throat with band-strings ending in tiny <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tassel.html" title="Tassel">tassels</a> or crochet-covered balls.</p>

<p>Bands were adopted in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> for legal, official, ecclesiastical and academical use in the mid-seventeenth century. They varied from those worn by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priests.html" title="Priests">priests</a> (very long, of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambric.html" title="Cambric">cambric</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> or <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linen.html" title="Linen">linen</a>, and reaching over the chest), to the much shorter ecclesiastical bands of black gauze with white <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hem.html" title="Hem">hem</a> showing on the outside. Both were developments of the seventeenth century lay collar.<sup id="_ref-hargreaves_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hargreaves" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Bands varied from small white turn-down collars and ruffs to point <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lace.html" title="Lace">lace</a> bands, depending upon fashion, until the mid-seventeenth century, when plain white bands came to be the invariable neck-wear of all <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judges.html" title="Judges">judges</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serjeant-at-law.html" title="Serjeant-at-law">serjeants</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barristers.html" title="Barristers">barristers</a>, students and clerical and academical men.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The bands are two strips of bleached <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">holland</a><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup> or similar material, falling down the front from the collar. Plain linen 'falling bands', developed from the falling collar, replaced the ruff about 1640.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup> By 1650 they were universal. Originally in the form of a wide collar, tied with a lace in front, by the 1680s they had diminished to the traditional form of two rectangles of linen tied at the throat.</p>
<p>Bands did not become academically significant until they were abandoned as an ordinary lay fashion after the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> in 1660. They became identified as specifically applicable to clerical, legal and academic individuals in the early eighteenth century, when they became longer and narrower in form.</p>
<p>From the eighteenth century judges and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Counsel_3fe5.html" title="Queen's Counsel">Queen's Counsel</a> took to wearing lace jabots instead of bands at courts and leveés. Bands are now worn by judges, Queen's Counsel, (utter) barristers, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitors.html" title="Solicitors">solicitors</a>, court officials, certain public officials, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> officials and less frequently also by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduand.html" title="Graduand">graduands</a>, at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. These also form part of the full dress of Queen's Counsel, <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_judges.html" title="Circuit judges">circuit judges</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Chief_Justice_0c75.html" title="Lord Chief Justice">Lord Chief Justice</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/u/Mourning.html" title="Mourning">Mourning</a> bands, which have a double pleat running down the middle of each wing or tongue, are still used by barristers. Clergy may also wear bands, which may be of black material, which are also known as <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> bands.</p>
<p>By the end of the seventeenth century Queen's Counsel wore richly laced <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cravat.html" title="Cravat">cravats</a>. From the later part of the eighteenth century they wore bands instead of the cravat as undress.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup> In the eighteenth century a lace fall was often used as an alternative to the bands by judges in full dress.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Both falling and standing bands were usually white, lace or lace-edged cambric or <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk.html" title="Silk">silk</a>, but both might be plain.<sup id="_ref-cunnington_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cunnington" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The standing bands, a semi-circular collar, the curved edge standing up round the back of the head. While the straight horizontal edges in front met under the chin and were tied by band-strings, the collar occasionally was worn turned down. It was supported on a wire frame attached to the neck of the doublet behind. The starched collar rested on this. It was usually of linen, but also lawn<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[12]</a></sup> and lace.<sup id="_ref-cunnington_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cunnington" title="">[3]</a></sup> They were popular for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>The soft, unstiffened collar draped over the shoulders of the doublet were called falling-bands. Till the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">Civil War</a> barristers wore falling bands, also known as a <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabat.html" title="Rabat">rabat</a>, with about six tabs arranged one upon the other, and having the appearance of ruffs rather than bands. They differed from the bands of the clergy of that period in that they were not poked as the latter were. Lawyers took to modern bands about the middle of the seventeenth century.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[13]</a></sup> They continued in ecclesiastical use well into the nineteenth century in the smaller, linen strip or tab form- short-bands. These were retained by <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> ministers, academics, lawyers, and <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-conformist.html" title="Non-conformist">non-conformist</a> ministers till comparatively recently.</p>
<p>Bands were adopted early in the eighteenth century, by parish clerks and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissenting.html" title="Dissenting">dissenting</a> ministers, as well as by clergymen of the established church. The bands were fairly wide, set close together. The outer white edge is the hemmed linen fabric which, being turned over onto itself three times, is opaque.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The falling bands, worn 1540s to 1670s, could take three forms. Firstly, a small turned-down collar from a high neck-band, with an inverted v-or pyramidal-shaped spread under the chin and tied by band-strings sometimes visible but usually concealed.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup> They were plain, or lace edged. These were popular 1590 to 1605, especially in military or <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">puritan</a> circles, reappearing 1620-50, when they were usually larger. Secondly, they could take the form of a wide collar, spreading horizontally from side to side across the shoulder, with the band-strings as formerly. These were popular 1630s to 1640s. Thirdly, a deep collar or bib, square-cut, spreading down the chest, the front borders meeting edge to edge flat, or with an inverted box-pleat. The corners were square or frequently rounded after 1660. Broad lace borders were usual. With the band-strings as formerly, these were popular 1640s to 1670s.<sup id="_ref-cunnington_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cunnington" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bands_%28neckwear%29.html" title="Edit section: From bands to the modern necktie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">From bands to the modern necktie</span></h2>
<p>The cravat or neckcloth was popular 1665-1730.<sup id="_ref-cunnington_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cunnington" title="">[3]</a></sup> It was a large square or triangle of either linen, lawn, silk or <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslin.html" title="Muslin">muslin</a>,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[16]</a></sup> often starched, with the ends usually bordered with lace, or decorated with tasselled beads, and tied loosely beneath the chin. Formal cravats were always plain white, otherwise they could be coloured or patterned.</p>
<p>Tying the cravat in a bow was popular c.1665. Fastening with a cravat-string was popular c.1671. By 1680-90 the cravat was worn falling over a stiffened ornamental cravat-string. 1695-1700 saw the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steinkirk.html" title="Steinkirk">Steinkirk</a> style, with the front ends twisted and the terminals either passed through a buttonhole or attached with a brooch to one side of the coat. The cravat was popular till the 1740s, and with the elderly thereafter.</p>
<p>In the 1840s several types of cravat were in use, the most traditional being a large bow with pointed ends. The variety of neckwear became very much greater in the 1890s. The <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarf.html" title="Scarf">scarf</a>, formerly known as the kerchief, was also worn. In the 1890s <a href="../../../n/e/c/Neckties.html" title="Neckties">neckties</a> became popular, commonly in a butterfly- or batswing-shape bow.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[17]</a></sup> By the 1850s separate, starched, collars were standard, these reaching 3" in height by the 1890s.</p>
<p>Until about 1950, apart from short-sleeved, open-necked sports wear, day shirts always had a long sleeve with cuffs, closed by links or buttons, and with a neck-band with separate collar fastened by studs, or an attached collar. The attached collar is now dominant. The result is that bands are rarely used by graduates, who prefer the contemporary down turn collar and neck tie.</p>

<li id="_note-5"><b><a href="#_ref-5" title="">^</a></b> The falling collar, which had the collar turned down on the shoulders, was developed in the early seventeenth century. This largely replaced the ruff, although that continued well into the seventeenth century. Towards the end of the sixteenth century the ruff was sometimes worn open in front rather than completely encircling the neck. Both types of ruff retained the deep projecting starched frill of several separately goffered folds of linen or muslin, and supporting standard, which arose in the sixteenth century.</li>
<li id="_note-6"><b><a href="#_ref-6" title="">^</a></b> In a practice reminiscent of <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford university</a>, where certain senior officers wear bands with white bow ties, the wearing of both bands and jabot by Queen's Counsel is rather unnecessary. The bow tie was developed from the cravat, introduced in the mid-seventeenth century. This was an alternative to the fall lace or jabot, and was of linen or muslin, with broad edges of lace. It varied from the tied lace cravat with long flowing ends, to an elaborate folded and lightly starched linen or cambric necktie of lace, used in the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century. These eventually became the modern necktie. It makes no sense to wear both types of neckwear, the bands and bow tie. The jabot itself was an atrophied form of the starched and elaborate ruff, which developed over a period of fifty years from the lace edged and frilled exposed linen <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemise.html" title="Chemise">chemise</a>. It is not an especially modern error which sees bands and necktie worn together. In 1770 non-doctors and <a href="../../../d/m/u/DMus_9ee5.html" title="DMus">DMus</a> at Oxford were required to wear (very small) bands and cravat, and all others excepting DMus, bands alone.</li>
