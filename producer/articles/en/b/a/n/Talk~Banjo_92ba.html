<p>Life is too short to engage in an editing war over "claw-hammer" or "clawhammer." That being said, the rationale given is that it should be spelled "claw-hammer" because otherwise people will think it's pronounced "cla-whammer". It's hard for me to believe that spelling should be changed in order to cater to those who can't read or pronounce.<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETribe_ec7a.html" title="User:Tribe">Tribe</a> 17:09, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The rationale that it's "never" spelled "claw-hammer" is clearly false, as I have seen it spelled that way many times. This is an encyclopedia, and as such is meant to provide information to those who aren't familiar with the banjo, its types of play or the vagaries of English spelling. "Clawhammer" is indisputably one way to spell it; its orthography also indisputably derives from "claw hammer". To place a dash between the two words and form "claw-hammer", then later to remove it, is a normal English practice, as in "aero-plane", which became "aeroplane" (and later "airplane"), but there is no corresponding confusion in the pronunciation of these forms of the word. It's hard for me to believe that confusion is PREFERABLE to clarification. Seems lots of other people--educated in the grammar of English, and also banjo players like me--have no problem with "claw-hammer", so what's the big deal? <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 17:27, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True...to say "I have never seen it spelled" the way you use it is incorrect....because I've seen you use it that way. But aside from you, I've never seen it spelled that way. Contrary to your protestations, there has never been any confusion....until now. The "big deal" is that you have decided to impose a spelling that the vast majority of banjo players do not use....and the sole reason is that you confused the pronunciation when you were a child.<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETribe_ec7a.html" title="User:Tribe">Tribe</a> 17:50, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't write the article, and I didn't put it in originally as "claw-hammer", that was someone else--but clearly someone else who had seen it spelled that way. I'm surprised you haven't. I've seen it spelled all three ways, and if it were clear what the pronunciation were, whatever way it was spelled, it would be no big deal to me. However, I have taught English for the last three years (and played banjo for close to twenty) and I can assure you that EVERY nine or ten year old is confused by "clawhammer", along with all the non-native English speakers on the planet. I don't guess it hurts to have it both ways, though. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 02:38, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the risk of reopening old wounds I find I can't agree with <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a>'s argument. Google results for "clawhammer" outnumber "claw-hammer" <i>sixty</i> to one. English is a dumb language filled with unintuitive special cases that must be learned individually, and this is no exception. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceKarma_ddee.html" title="User:IceKarma">IceKarma</a> 15:30, 2005 Apr 14 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh please! Look at "<a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminum.html" title="Aluminum">Aluminum</a>" if you think one way is the be-all and end-all of English. Google can survey, AT BEST, the past ten years. Any books or articles from twenty-five or thirty years ago, and the term "claw-hammer" will outnumber "clawhammer" sixty to one, but these won't be on Google. English is not set in stone, and to be young and stupid is not a virtue. There's plenty of room to learn it both ways. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 15:40, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sweeney added the <b>bass string</b>, or is credited with doing so. Assuming a total of five strings, the bass string is the <i>fourth</i> string up from the floor counting upwards (redundancy intended); not the 5th string, which is commonly called the "<b>drone string</b>."</p>
<p>I have repeatedly read and heard it said that Sweeney added the drone; this seems rather doubtful, since many or most african-origin examples of banjo-like instruments <i>already</i> had strings that functioned as drones even before spreading beyond Africa. Thus, the Sweeney origin of the 5th string seems doubtful. MWBailey</p>
<p>I am a banjo player myself and I know that Sweeny added the fifth string up from the floor (the drone), before that was added the banjo was mostly used for strumming. <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPiratebob13_dcb2.html" title="User:Piratebob13">Piratebob13</a> 21:28, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Sweeney is generally credited as having added the 5th string, but since it has been more or less proven that he didnt, the argument goes that, well, OK, then maybe he added a 4th string. Since there is still confusion and uncertainty about which string he added (if any), I changed "bass string" to "another string". GeeMo</p>
<p><b>The infamous 5th String...</b></p>
<p>Joel Walker Sweeney of The Sweeney Minstrels, born 1810, was often credited with the invention of the short fifth string. Scholars know that this is not the case. A painting entitled The Old Plantation painted between 1777 and 1800, shows a black gourd banjo player with a banjo having the fifth string peg half-way up the neck. If Sweeney did add a fifth string to the banjo, it was probably the lowest string, or fourth string by today's reckoning. This would parallel the development of the banjo elsewhere, for example in England, where the tendency was to add more of the long strings, with seven and ten strings being common. Sweeney was responsible for the spread of the banjo and probably contracted with a drum maker in Baltimore, William Boucher, to start producing banjos for public sales. These banjos are basically drums with necks attached. A number have survived and a couple of them are in the collections of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. Other makers, like Jacobs of New York, or Morrell who moved his shop to San Francisco during the Gold Rush, helped to supply the growing demand for the instrument in the mid-1840s, as the minstrel shows traveled westward to entertain the the gold diggers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBanjo_92ba.html" title="Edit section: African American template">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">African American template</span></h2>
<p>Although the banjo has origins in African American slave communities, in its modern usage (and for at least the last century) it has been predominantly played by white musicians. It is insignificant enough a part of African American culture that it is never mentioned in <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_music_53ee.html" title="African American music">African American music</a>, much less in the main <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> article. This template is wholly out of place in this article, and I will continue to remove it each time it is added. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 23:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And I will continue to add it. As an African American, I would argue that the fact that it is African American in origin IS significant. It is just another fashion in which the pervasiveness of African American influence is manifested in American music. Neither country music nor bluegrass would be what they are today without the introduction of the banjo and the unique musical stylings of African Americans in the playing of both the banjo <i>and</i> the fiddle.<a href="http://www.birthplaceofcountrymusic.org/index.cgi?CONTEXT=cat&amp;cat=10043" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.birthplaceofcountrymusic.org/index.cgi?CONTEXT=cat&amp;cat=10043" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://utpress.org/a/searchdetails.php?jobno=T00471.01.03" class="external autonumber" title="http://utpress.org/a/searchdetails.php?jobno=T00471.01.03" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The fact that this isn't mentioned in the African American music article is an omission that should be corrected -- and is, IMO, the result of ignorance or inadvertent omission rather than non-notability. Furthermore, the omission of such factual information from one article on Wikipedia is hardly an argument for the continued omission of such information elsewhere, particularly given the gaping holes in the project and widely acknowledged systemic bias vis-a-vis subject matter related to non-whites -- quite the contrary. The fact is most people are completely unaware of the banjo's origins -- all the <i>more</i> reason the template should remain. People commonly associate bluegrass music with only poor, Appalachian whites. However, modern musicologists, cultural anthropologists and others finally are setting the record straight, with numerous articles and monographs devoted to the pervasive influence of African Americans on bluegrass music and the role played by the banjo as an instrument and stylistically as well. There are those who disagree with you on this matter, and you are not permitted to unilaterally make such a determination -- and on such a flimsy premise! You've got to come up with something better than citing the <i>absence</i> of information/knowledge on a topic as a rationale for your continued deletion of the AA template from this article. Ignorance or omission is not an effective -- or even remotely rational/defensible -- argument. And unless and until you do, the template stays.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And just so there's no doubt, I've tweaked the section treating African American music to include information further bolstering the appropriateness of the African American template, as well as the addition of a link to the AA portal, and have added citations to the relevant text (starting a "References" section), including to the opening assertion regarding the AA origin of the instrument. (You will note that I earlier edited the opening <i>back</i> to the more accurate assertion that the banjo is of African-American, rather than African, origin -- and added a reference to Africans in Appalachia for good measure.)<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 07:25, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The key question is not whether the banjo is or is not an African-American (or even an African) contribution to music. The question is how useful the inclusion of this template is. If someone reading this page is interested in learning more about the African ancestry of the banjo, there are links in the article lead, and the template does not provide any. If someone is interested in learning about African American music, there is a link in the lead, which is repeated farther down in the template. If someone wants to learn about the banjo in minstrelsy, again there is a link in the lead. The real effects of the template are to provide direct links from the banjo article to pages such as <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reparations.html" title="Reparations">Reparations</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rastafari_movement.html" title="Rastafari movement">Rastafari movement</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Islam_86de.html" title="Nation of Islam">Nation of Islam</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_nationalism.html" title="Black nationalism">Black nationalism</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/a/NAACP_cd86.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a>, <a href="../../../h/b/c/HBCU_eb84.html" title="HBCU">HBCU</a>, and <a href="../../../a/a/v/AAVE_1b6c.html" title="AAVE">AAVE</a>, to name a few. Is it really a useful addition to have this directly linked from this article? NO! We might just as well link to the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_potato_famine.html" title="Irish potato famine">Irish potato famine</a>, because the banjo today is mainly used in bluegrass music, which has some Irish ancestry, or to the <a href="../../../d/u/p/DuPont_9a74.html" title="DuPont">DuPont</a> company, which originally developed the PET film which is now widely used on banjo heads.
