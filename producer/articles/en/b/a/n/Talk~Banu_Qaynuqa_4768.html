<dd>Why should we all duplicate our effort posting discussions in two articles talk pages when one article essentially includes all of the other, because you can't take the time to follow that polite request to see the discussion on the other page? <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">Wikipedia:Edit_war</a> says it's wrong to revert without discussion, not to duplicate the necessary discussion on all the articles that pertain to it.

I am asking that this version be unprotected and reverted to Itaqallah's version which was obviouly <i>not</i> a product of "edit waring" and which includes the Arabic script, the request for which has been outstanding above for months. Furthermore, I object to the characterization of my attempt to maintain a neutral point of view as an edit war. I have already explained the fact that the version of this article I've been working on addresses several bias problems, at <a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBanu_Nadir_c3a9.html#Continued_reintroduction_of_bias_by_reverts" title="Talk:Banu Nadir">Talk:Banu Nadir#Continued reintroduction of bias by reverts</a>. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 19:13, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Text may well be in the public domain, but that particular website is not usable due to the copyright assertion at the bottom of their page. Please show a non-copyrighted source. And it doesn't matter who orginally inserted it, fighting back and forth about it is edit warring. For legal protection, I had to revert to the last edit that didn't inculde it. If it is public domain fine, but that is a risk we can't take until its proven.

Before you accuse me of edit warring, please have a look at what I've been trying to correct; in particular, would you please direct your attention to the discussion surrounding the opinion of the editor(s) you have supported by protecting the current version of this article, that "all authoritative Muslim historians died several centuries ago"?

<p>Yes I understand that the original is in public domain. However, no article here links to the original, or uses the publication information of the original for a reference. Instead, they all link to jewishencyclopdia.com, which notes in its terms of use, "3.2 You may search, retrieve, display, download, and print content from the Service solely for your personal, internal use, and shall make no other use of the content without the express written permission of JE.com and the copyright owner (or its authorized agent) of such content." My point is that while a reference to the orginal publication information is ok, using the website as the only one is not, as they have made a claim of copyright. Its a technical legal thing and easily fixed if someone digs up the orginal publication information and refers to that instead. (HINT - I just told you how to fix this). <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really don't understand what you are trying to tell me.

The "original publication information" is that it is "originally published between 1901-1906" and thus firmly in the public domain, as I just stated in boldface above. Please explain how I can fix it when the article is still protected. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 21:22, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I agree that the original publication info should be used, the website has no claim of copyright over the text of the article. JE.com's "terms of use" have no legal force vis a vis the text of various articles, over which they are barred by copyright law from claiming any rights. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 20:40, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been researching this issue since I first posted and I understand that now, and that any claim they made on the original text would be hard to defend. However, I'm just trying to make sure we are playing it safe and not even allowing for the possibility of problems especially since this is a resource that we use so much. I can't imagine that finding the original publication info would be hard for those who know where to look. Its a simple solution. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:51, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This came up in discussion with another user concerning the debate around the Banu Qaynuqa's war, which was really the first time Jews and Muslims ever fought, isn't it? If you accept the story about the war escalating from the stripped naked woman in the jewlery store:</p>

<dd><i>Maybe God has a seperate universe somewhere or somewhen else, where the pin broke and her clothes stayed on when she stood up, the Constitution of Medina held, and 1500 years later Jews and Muslims are still strong allies. Don't we all have an obligation to try to get back into to that world?</i></dd>

<p>As an agnostic non-Muslim, non-Jew, I hope that God is the sort that would keep a nice, friendly universe around along with our drama-filled one for strictly experimental purposes, and judges us all by how well we can calm things down.

<p>I've gone through the whole thing and removed unnecessary "the"s. "Banu" is translated into "the sons/daughters of", one of the two plural forms of "bin" (the other form being "Bani"). For the sake of consistency, we'll keep them all as "Banu". My logic: adding another "the" would translate to "the the sons/daughters of". A logical change, yes? An obvious exception to having an additional "the" would be something like "the Banu Qaynuqa tribe", since 'the' in this case refers to the tribe, and reads (grammatically/syntactically) smoothly (....the...tribe...). The same change has been applied previously to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Nadir_mpov_4505.html" title="Banu Nadir/mpov">Banu Nadir/mpov</a>.

<p>Apparently somebody went back in time and interviewed each of the converts as to the reasons behind their individual conversions. Without really saying much more, I'd simply like to get supporting documentation on this, that's all. --<a href="../../../o/s/m/User%7EOsmanja_324f.html" title="User:Osmanja">How's my editing so far?

<p>Pecher, and with all due respect...do you honestly believe that you or anyone has the authority to factually ascertain the motivations behind the conversion of some of the tribe's members, or for that matter even any motivations of Muhammad or anyone else? The burden of proof is on the person making the claim...so at the risk of starting another revert/edit-war, I still maintain that this assertion is highly dubious. Make the reversion if you must...just prove it...is that too much to ask? --<a href="../../../o/s/m/User%7EOsmanja_324f.html" title="User:Osmanja">How's my editing so far?

<dd>All the academic English sources I know spell the names of tribes with the definite article. in all cases. You may want to argue that they are all wrong, but Wikipedia is not the best place to do so. The same logic applies to your doubts of the work of Weinsinck and Paret. Both are famous orientalists published by a highly respected source; opinions of individual wikipedians are, sadly, not important as far as the articles are concerned. This is part of the job of historians (and other scholars) to arrive at conclusions using their reasoning. We cannot go back in time to see whether the Big Bang actually happened; it is through their reasoning that the physicists have arrived at the conclusion that the Big Bang occurred.

<dd>Assuming good faith, I'd like to get an idea who you are (you forgot your name in your signature). Further, I thought terms like "orientalists" and such had been wiped clean by post-post-modernist academics...which actually helps explain why Wiki is not really regarded as a bonafied academic resource. My goal is to be a part of the process towards reaching that...and I honestly don't believe Wiki or its readers are served by holding on to outdated epistemes. With all due respect, it's exactly this kind of attitude that discourages real academics from continuing to be a part of this process...this constant bickering and losing track of the big picture of this project we know as Wiki: improving Wiki (specifically) and general academia for all seekers of knowledge. Just my 2.5 cents...but I'm sure life will move on for all of us. --<a href="../../../o/s/m/User%7EOsmanja_324f.html" title="User:Osmanja">How's my editing so far?

<dd>I think if it is even accepted that some Jews decided to stay in Medina just to protect their property, then we need to have a source that would also state that they were hypocrites i.e. they did not convert to Muslims with their hearts but for materialistic reasons. --SaadSaleem 02:55, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wensinck says: "The Banu Kaynuka a did not, however, emigrate to the last man. A few members of the tribe embraced Islam, perhaps more from opportunism than from conviction, and these could remain at Medina. lbn Hishãm /lbn Ishaq gives a list of 30 Kaynuka adversaries of the Prophet (351 f.). This may refer to the time before the expulsion, but five or six of the names in the list reappear in Waqidi’s report on Ibn Ubayy’s funeral (in 9/631) among those hypocrites “from Banu Kaynuka and others” who pressed forward to the bier."</p>
<p>retaining their belongings may have been one incentive, but the oppurtunism that Wensinck points to can connote various things (some of which more apparent than retaining possessions), which is why i suggest we stick to that wording instead of original deductions. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 07:07, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article claims with reference to Ibn Ishaq that "Traditional Muslim sources view these episodes as a violation of the Constitution of Medina." However, Ibn Ishaq says something entirely different: "Asim b. Umar b. Qatada said that the B. Qaynuqa were the first of the Jews to break their agreement with the apostle and to go to war, between Badr and Uhud..." A claim made by one non-notable man (a grandson of a companion of Muhammad) is extrapolated to all traditional Muslim sources. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 20:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I was pretty explicit. Per Ibn Ishaq, Asim ibn Umar ibn Qatada says that the Banu Qaynuqa were the first to go to war with Muhammad. The article transforms this into "Traditional Muslim sources view these episodes as a violation of the Constitution of Medina." The gap between Asim and <i>all</i> traditional Muslim sources is enourmous. Whether the story originates entirely with him (it doesn't) is irrelevant, because according to the source given, this is Asim's own, personal view. I don't find it inconceivable that Muslim sources claim the Qaynuqa violated the Constitution of Medina. However, this is not supported by the cited source. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 22:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>&lt;reset&gt;</small>1) the narrative of Asim mentions the breaking of the agreement (i.e. the Constitution of Medina) by Qaynuqa; 2) can we conclude that it is Asim's personal view? certainly not according to Ibn Ishaq, who merely <i>attributes</i> the statement to Asim. 3) Asim's statement has been represented in Ibn Ishaq and Tabari. of course, they may not endorse Asim's statement (esp. in the case of Tabari); however, as i pointed out earlier, almost all of the narrative relating to these events is seemingly based upon the words of Asim b. Umar b. Qatada, including the interecession of Ibn Ubayy and Muhammad's reported irritation (which has been cited to Guillame's translation and assumedly Stillman's translation of the same passage). assuming that you want the attribution to "traditional Muslim sources" scaled down to Asim himself (correct me if i'm wrong on that assumption), would you also agree to employ the same attribution to other aspects of the narratives resting upon the words of Asim? in the meantime, i will look through other Islamic works of sira which should be sufficient as representation of "traditional Muslim sources." <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beit Or also added: "<i>Donner argues that Muhammad turned against the Qaynuqa because as artisans and traders, the latter were in close contact with Meccan merchants against whom Muhammad had already commenced hostilities</i>".

<dd>The Constitution of Medina was a later document. Ibn Hisham's version of it is not accurate. There is no consensus among historians as to when it was written.

<p>Arrow740 reverted my edits and re-added "...Meccan merchants against whom Muhammad had already commenced hostilities". If this is indeed Donner's view, then I'll find plently of scholars who outright disagree with him. It is well-established that the Quraysh began persecuting Muslims, tortured them, trying to exterminate them, attacked Medina etc. Muhammad didn't "commence hositilities" with the Quraysh as Donner would have us believe.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 15:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Commenced hostilities" is not the same as "was the first to commence hostilities"; it does not furthermore imply aggression, even though it was certainly Muhammad who started war against the Quraysh by raiding their caravans. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 18:44, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>"Modern historians, however, do not find credence in these narratives" - makes perfect sense. it means that they do not find the narratives to be credible, or that they don't accept them as accurate. furthermore, and it goes without saying, what it replaced was totally misleading.

<dl>
<dd>"To find credence" makes no sense in English; one should say "to give/attach credence". The more important issue, though, is that it's not what historians mean. They do not necessarily discount these stories as later inventions; they only point out that the reason for Muhammad's attack on the Qaynuqa was not a silly episode with the shopkeeper, but something more substantial. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 19:28, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>the sources (barring Peters who seems to simply say the surrounding events are unknown) deny that this particular episode was the catalyst. the underlying theme of the report however points to Jewish opposition/disruption, which is what Wensinck (and i assume others) affirms. thus, though the specific report may not be considered credible, the general reason remains the same. the current version implies that some other reason was at hand. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 19:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Itaqallah, you have completely misconstrued the cited works. It's difficult to attach a common theme to the writings of cited historians except that they reject the shopkeeper story as the true casue of the expulsion of the Qaynuqa. Jewish "disruption", as you have put it, is your own, personal view. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 19:45, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Wensick quite clearly states that the Jews had adopted a contentious attitude towards Muhammad. the report i refer to is the one of the goldsmith. it is far more appropriate to focus on what the scholars say about the narrative (i.e. they don't accept that specific event as the cause of expulsion) than address Muhammad's "true reason" for attacking Qaynuqa. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 19:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The whole point of the cited analyses is to present different views on what this true reason was. Just rejecting the goldsmith story is not enough: a historian must suggest something else in its stead. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a>
<dl>
<dd>the analyses are not what is disputed, it is how they are characterised. the sentence implies the academic assignment of an alternative motivation for the attack (which is not entirely accurate), as opposed to a rejection of the specific scenario related by some of the sources. Wensinck for one finds no other motive than what is generally given by the original sources i.e. the Qaynuqans' opposition. replacing "true reasons for" with 'exact scenario surrounding' (or circumstances instead of scenario) would fix this somewhat. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 20:23, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Proabivouac, your revision contains the same error of implying an alternative motivation for Muhammad. i see nothing wrong with my proposed alternative: when scholars are unsure of the cicumstances surrounding Muhammad's attack on Qaynuqa, that's exactly what we say. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:31, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Stating that Muhammad may have had a motive, different from the one accepted by traditional Muslim biogrpahies is not an error, but a reasonable and cited opinion. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 15:45, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>it may be so, but a number of the sources provided in the article do not suggest this at all, such as Wensinck. the general motive remains the same; that is, the Qaynuqans were perceived as contentious. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:54, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>the historians reject the significance of these specific events (not necessarily the historicity) in Muhammad's attack on Medina, if i understand your argument correctly. thus, "these events", by which we mean the Jewish goldsmith events and others like it, do not contribute to the "exact circumstances surrounding Muhammad's attack on Medina." i see nothing misleading there. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 16:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"<i>Historians primarily question the motive, not these events preceding the attack</i>" - this is yet another example of an ill-informed edit summary. historians say nothing about the motive. what Peters says sums it up, that the "precise circumstances of the alleged violation of the Constitution of Medina" are simply unspecified and as such unknown. perhaps Arrow should actually read the text which he continues to revert. it is the circumstances the historians dispute, the motive remains the same. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:16, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is another example of a poorly-written jibe. My edit summary was perfectly well-informed, I know just why I reverted. Your analysis that Peters "sums it up" is your opinion, nothing more. "... the motive remains the same." Obviously, the motive cannot change. What is in dispute is the opinion of historians on the historicity of the "justifications" for the expulsion and the motives for the expulsion. What is most relevant here is that they primarily dispute the motives for the expulsion found in the hagiography. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 02:19, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>try reading the passages again. they say nothing about Muhammad's motives. the motive is the same, as Wensinck correctly relates. the Qaynuqans et. al posed an active threat, and so were fought against. the exact circumstances, meaning the actual events leading up to the invasion, is what is disputed - as shown by Peters and Wensinck. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 02:25, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bless sins, your partial quote reads: "...Muhammad regarded that as casus belli, and collected a force to beseige the clan. There were doubtless some negotiations..." Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be on Google books, so I cannot check the context. It would be nice if, as on Banu Qurayza, you would share the entire passage. Judging from this excerpt alone, I do not believe it is justified to rephrase this as, "It was certain, according to Watt, that the siege must have been preceded by some sort of negotiations." While it's true that "doubtless" has the same "literal" import as "It is certain," in practice the latter is far stronger than the former, which in context suggests <i>inference</i> rather then <i>verified truth.</i><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 22:12, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then we can replace "it is certain" with "doubtless". this may seem to be a bad excuse, but I'm out of touch with the main library (not all libraries have Watt) I use, right now for a number of personal and physical reasons. This is why I didn't immediately provide you the "al-Halabi" quote supporting Maududi. this'll have to wait. But if you can't find it on google books how will the entire passage help? <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 23:57, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It might throw some light upon the intended strength or basis for his inference. "There were doubtless some negotiations, as might be expected to occur before an attack," would be useless, while "There were doubtless some negotiations, as so-and-so was sent to their compound a week prior," would be quite substantial and deserving of a more specific treatment.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 00:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh I see what you mean. But in any case, the quote would not be useless. Watt opines there there were negotiations. His opinions are no less scholarly than those alredy presented by Beit Or and others.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 03:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are at least two problems with Watt's passage as it is currently used. First, it is not fully clear whether negotiations, according to Watt, <i>preceded</i> the siege. Secondly, if they did, then Watt may have referred to the dialogue between Muhammad and the Jews in the market place, which is quoted in the article verbatim from Ibn Ishaq. In this case, the reference to Watt is a redundancy. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 12:33, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Good points. We need the whole passage quoted here.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 08:06, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The words "In the Muslim tradition" are absolutely necessary in the sentence about Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy being chracterized as a hypocrite. A <i><a href="../../../m/u/n/Munafiq.html" title="Munafiq">munafiq</a></i> is a Muslim term; it makes no sense outside the Muslim tradition. Watt may not say so outright, but he clearly implies that, and Stillman, for example, does add these words. Scholars do not qualify every statement by saying it's only true from the Muslim viewpoint. For example, EoI and many other works on Islam call Muhammad "the Prophet"; however, it would be totally wrong to infer that scholars indeed believe Muhammad was a prophet. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 16:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
