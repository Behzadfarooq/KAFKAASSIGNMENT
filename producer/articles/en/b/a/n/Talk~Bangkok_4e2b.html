<p>HELLO TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES TO DISCUSS ABOUT BANGKOK, I'm a Bangkokian and a very proud one i must say. I have been do a heck load of editing, a HUGE heckload of editing on the Bangkok website. I need everyones help to give me really accurate information and continue to edit this page until it reaches an equilibrium with the readers and editors. Sometimes I have sketchy info thats in the top of my head and is distorted, please help me correct. Also, for the wikipedia guys, I have no idea how ot upload pics so u better find pics for my grand city. PLease, itd be really nice, pics of the skyline, like a really nice one, i suggest www.skyscrapercity.com and go to the Thai forum and talk to the guys for their copyright. Other pictures can come from say, the clubs of Bangkok, Vertigo, Sirocco, Bed Supperclub. We're the biggest party city behind London and New York so you should get clubs up there. Another thing is the tourism, why is there nothing. We've been on the top 10 tourist cities for like 50 years in a row so more tourist information. I've gotten you guys started. I would also like to thank the wikipedia editors for creating a gorgeous article about current events. GUYS, my fellow Bangkokians, KON KRUNG thung lai (CITY PPL), u need to get cracking n help me edit my city. We're getting hampered by Tokyo and Hong Kong n Singapore. Its a lot of work, i've gotten u guys started. START EDITTING.</p>

<p>To call pawnshops, that fence stolen goods, "Chinese run" is a primitive form of relative Orientalism: it attempts to re-present the homegrown crime as somehow from abroad, from an "orient", here China. The fact is that sinoThai are Thai in the modern sense, not "Chinese" unto the next generation, and no more likely to be crooks than Tai people.<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinoza1111_b2f9.html" title="User:Spinoza1111">Spinoza1111</a> 06:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would love it if someone can write some more info on the people of Bangkok, including numbers, but also proportion of nationalities. Etc. And anything else that would be interesting. The article seems incomplete without it. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrophil_1c40.html" title="User:Astrophil">Astrophil</a></p>
<p>It's hard to say exactly how much Bangkok is getting more populous. It all has to do with mobility. Some people are moving out to nearby provinces aided by a boom in car registrations, but generally not too far beyond city limits, as traffic is crushing. (This is not Tokyo with excellent public transport) Then again, tons of multi-story (30 stories is not uncommon!) condos have been under construction and are being built near transportation areas, especially now since urban rail is getting popular. Most likely, the 2000 census was an undercount, as there are countless homes/shacks with little more than concrete paths to them, locals a house away have no idea how to get to the other house, and a census here would be a daunting task indeed, thai people are resourceful though, with the new mega-apartments and condos and megamalls, more shantytowns are being replaced with proper housing, making counts a bit easier. I highly doubt the figures for 2549 (2006) that Bangkok has simply 5.672 million, especially since the 2000 census counted 6.355 million, and Bangkok is getting denser all the time, but let's not get too carried away, maybe 7-7.5 million seems about correct. (not including nearby provinces). Including suburbs, 9-10 million is about right.</p>

<p>I know that "amphoe" is used to describe administrative subdivisions of provinces, but I think "keht" is the more commonly used name for subdivisions of Bangkok. - <a href="../../../e/r/z/User%7EErzengel_d7cd.html" title="User:Erzengel">erzengel</a> - 1423 UTC - 23 Apr 2003</p>

<p>I think that the second Thai version of the name at the top of the article, technically, should also have the symbol <b>ฯ</b> at the end as it is still a shortened form (but often the symbol is missing in both these shortened names). I will check this when possible.

<p>Officially, the symbol <b>ฯ</b> is to be used only with the first one. Although the second name was a shortenned one, it is considered correct without the symbol. - from a Thai</p>

<dd>Agreed, it's hardly of major significance to most residents, who are likely more concerned about the homelessness and illegal immigrant worker situation and probably consider it a good thing. Traffic and the stalling over infrastructure, especially mass transit and the airport, are far more important than that, but it gets about three lines. NPOV is also questionable, it reads like something put out by the BSA themselves. Maybe we need to delete it entirely or reduce it to a brief mention, after all this is rife all over Asia and not just Bangkok. --<a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegalizeit_8ac8.html" title="User:Legalizeit">Legalizeit</a> 08:05, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Might I be so bold as to suggest something with the two new Bangkok photos that are being added and removed at an alarming rate. I think that we can find many more pictures of Bangkok and there is undoubtably reason to have many more pictures of the city available, but there must be a limit to the number within the article. If the new pictures could be uploaded to Wikipedia commons then we should put a Commons link on the article going to all of the pictures that we may want. I do think the two pictures in question are great pictures, but there is no copyright information on either of them. As it stands they are likely to be deleted quite soon. It'd be great if the person who uploaded them could put them on Commons with copyright information and then we'll link to that gallery from this article.

<p>Dear BKK topic editors,</p>
<p>Based on Astanhope's suggestion, I present Bangkok City Photo Guide for your consideration for inclusion in the Bangkok article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bangkok City Photo Guide <a href="http://www.cityphotoguide.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cityphotoguide.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reasons why I think a link to this site will add value to the article.</p>
<p>1. It provides unique content about Bangkok organized by area and category to help visitors and locals navigate the city.</p>
<p>2. It empowers local businesses of all sizes with free internet presence.</p>
<p>3. It provides realistic views of Bangkok's tourist destinations.</p>
<p>4. It includes satellite maps (where available) and/or street maps in every listing.</p>
<p>5. It contains minimal and unintrusive advertisements.</p>
<p>6. It is an ongoing project, which will continue to grow and include other areas of city.</p>
<p><br />
I apologize for rushing in with a link directly in the article and await your decision.</p>

<li>Mark - I asked Cityphoto to do precisely this on the Talk page and he did so eagerly. The question/conversation revolves around the link. It should be here for the sake of the conversation.

<p>IMHO we don't need any external photo links - there is wikimedia commons with many free photos of Bangkok.

<p>I see this has been raised twice before on the talk page, but with no resolution. We currently have three different population figures (in the lead, infobox and Demographics section)- the different numbers seem to be for province v.BMA, and 1990 v. 2000 census. Obviously we should be using the newer figure, but does anyone have a preference for province or BMA? <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_Flower_b54b.html" title="User talk:Henry Flower"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 10:09, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've always prefered the metropolitan area as it reflects more accurately the population of the city and its suburbs. A province boundary is often arbitrary not relevent to the natural boundary of a city. For example, my home town of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> has a metro area population of ~3,600,000 but the actual 'City of Melbourne' has a population of around 50,000.

<p>I'm living in Bangkok since 2004 and I have this to add about its population:</p>
<p>15,000,000-18,000,000 people live here, but very few are registered as Bangkok citizens (because it's hard to change your home address in Thailand).</p>
<p>During elections and big holidays Bangkok gets more or less empty because everyone goes home to their home towns/villages (you have to vote in the town you're registered).</p>
<p>I suggest the info box should say ~15,000,000</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've standardised the numbers on the last official figure, from the 2000 census. I've removed the 2005 estimate (from a random, unofficial website) from the infobox. I've no idea what the reference to a 2004 census was meant to mean- the Thai statistical office doesn't mention one in 2004, and I very much doubt they'd have two in four years. If there's a reputable source for a more recent estimated figure, for the whole metropolitan area, or for unregistered residents, then they should be added, but wild guesses should <i>not</i>. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_Flower_b54b.html" title="User talk:Henry Flower"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 15:22, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a Thai speaker/reader I would like to add the following comments. If people agree with me maybe we should change the main pages too, but I'll start with just these comments.</p>
<p>When transcribing from Thai script to English you lose a load of information - just like when converting a color movie to black and white. This "lost information", along with poor English skills, has led to countless errors in transcribed Thai (the Thais call the transcribed text karaoke).</p>
<p>1) "Krungthep" should be Grungtep - There are no K-sounds or H-sounds in the Thai script</p>
<p>2) "Koh" should be Goh, as in Goh Pa Ngan (the island with the full moon parties), Goh Chaang (the elephant island).</p>
<p>3) Singha beer should be Sing Beer</p>
<p>4) The Prime Minster's name is Taksin Shinawat - not Thaksin ShinawaTRA.</p>
<p>In general the letters K,V,L,R,S are used incorrectly because the corresponding Thai chars have different meanings depending on their context.</p>

<p>/ On the subject of Thai language I have lived here 14 years and I'll tell you that there is most definately a K sound in the Thai language. Grung Thep is correct and Goh is correct ( Goh as in Got ) but the words Krap and Kha are most definately used with a K sound and not a G sound. I have just clarified this in a room full of Thais ( 30 in all ) and they all say the same. I do agree that the sound is very close to both the G and K sounds for almost all words that we might spell with a K. The province / town of Kanchanaburi is said with a G sound too, but he tone is so slight that is generally comes across as a K sound more than a G sound. /</p>

<p>How are we determining the list of "Sister Cities"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The wikipedia <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_twinning.html" title="Town twinning">Town twinning</a> article doesn't identify the 'authoritative' source. <a href="http://www.sister-cities.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.sister-cities.org/" rel="nofollow">Sister Cities International</a> web site doesn't show these same "sister cities". Likewise, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_twin_towns_and_sister_cities.html" title="List of twin towns and sister cities">List of twin towns and sister cities</a> doesn't include anything between <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> (which, of course, may be an oversight).</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Was the "sister cities" section meant to be a casual association list (which, to me, would be content of questionable value), or</li>
<li>Do "sister cities" come from a formal source/list of 'twins' (and if so, what is that authority/reference)? - <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaimoss_7ce5.html" title="User:Thaimoss">Thaimoss</a> 14:56, 23 December 2006</li>

<p>An excellent article overall - far more thorough than many other articles I've seen on cities. The history section is quite short, though. I gather, from this short section, that perhaps there isn't much to be said, but at the very least, some years would be good. When did it "begin as a small trading center and port community"? <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 14:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The city's wealth of cultural sites makes it one of the world's most popular tourist destinations." Is there any evidence for this? Many tourists come to Bangkok, but most don't stay more than a few days: they head to the beaches or the islands. BKK is too hot, too smelly, and the traffic is hideous. Those that stay are more interested in the nightlife and cheap shopping. There are some interesting cultural sites (Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun), but you can visit most of them within a couple of days days.Widmerpool 14:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
