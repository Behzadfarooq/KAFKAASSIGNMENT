<p>The list of schools is getting unwieldy, and is in danger of getting too comprehensive. Bandung is a city of 5 million plus people, and there are hundreds of schools in the city. Any suggestions on how to best present the information? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulius.kusuma_e7e3.html" title="User:Julius.kusuma">Julius.kusuma</a> 12:59, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A whole bunch of external links just isn't encyclopedic or particularly informative; the service Wikipedia can provide is to briefly describe only the most important universities. I'd say the list of high schools can be removed entirely and replaced with a general description of high schools in the city. I like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>'s Education section, for an example of how to do it. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc"><small>CDC</small></a> <a href="../../../c/d/c/User_talk%7ECdc_878d.html" title="User talk:Cdc"><small>(talk)</small></a> 18:18, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>When talking about education in Bandung, I guess it is good to talk about the formal and non formal one. There are a lot of non formal education in Bandung.

<p>hi i have several question about the history of the bandung first in our bandungnese believe (in a book from Mr. S. Kunto - BANDOENG TEMPO DOELOE), it is stated that the build of bandung was by the order of the governor general, to move the capital of the two kabupaten to the spot near the main road (a road to connect places in java so the dutch were more prepared for britis invasion in java). if you go to asia africa street you'll see a monument of the place where the governor general strike his staff to the ground to spot the place for the alun-alun of bandung (but the bupati move the alun-alun several meter west because of some kind "fengshui" calculation). and about the mayor, from the book, it is stated that the first mayor is the third one in wikipedia list.</p>
<p>can anyone tell me which is the right one? because majority of bandungnese (including the government) believe what inside the book! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 202.69.101.171 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.69.101.171_4cba.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.69.101.171">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>the list of mayor: there's a grave in this city that states someone else as <b>THE</b> guy who founded the city. SO, basically, not even the city's resident knows. Best to look into dutch/VOC logs.</dd>

<dd>the downtown area (alun-alun) was moved to it's present site to align with the Tangkuban Parahu line from north to south.

<p>Hi, I'm just joining in to help Bandung article being untagged from a confusing article. There are some unnecessary information in the article. For example, the list of majors and mottos. If this article is read by the citizen of Bandung, then it would be useful. However, for the English speaking person, who wants to know about the city, I think this is absolutely useless. There is no need to know who are former city majors. It is enough to put the current major and motto in the city infobox, at the beginning of the article. Thus, I suggest to eliminate them. --- Urang bandung 07:04, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Deleted. Below I put the list of majors &amp; mottos, in the case that somebody objects about deleting these information. --- Urang bandung 14:22, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<pre>
== Motto ==
The motto of Bandung usually changes with the changing of its mayor. It is not a rule of law but the trend seems to be that way. It is usually in a form of acronym. 

Later, as the city is flooded with influx of newcomers from other parts of Indonesia, its motto is in sundanese "''Bandung Heurin ku Tangtung''" which means Bandung full of people. Reflecting the indigenous people's dislike of newcomers who brings their own tradition.

"''Gemah Ripah Wibawa Mukti''", as shown in the coat-of-arms of Bandung, means "rich soil prosperous people".

Recently, the mayor of Bandung, Dada Rosada, has publicized a new motto "''Bermartabat''", which is an acronym from Bersih (clean), Makmur (prosperous), Taat (religious obedience), Bersahabat (friendly). The motto itself translates as "Dignified"

== Law and government ==
The City of Bandung is divided into 26 subdistricts (''kecamatan''): [[Sukasari]], [[Cidadap]], [[Coblong]], [[Cibeunying Kaler]], [[Cibeunying Kidul]], [[Sukajadi]], [[Cicendo]], [[Andir]], [[Bandung Kulon]], [[Babakan Ciparay]], [[Astana Anyar]], [[Bojongloa Kaler]], [[Bojongloa Kidul]], [[Bandung Kidul]], [[Regol]], [[Lengkong]], [[Sumur Bandung]], [[Bandung Wetan]], [[Kiara Condong]], [[Batununggal]], [[Cicadas]], [[Margacinta]], [[Rancasari]], [[Arcamanik]], [[Ujungberung]], and [[Cibiru]].

The chronological list of the Mayor of Bandung:
* [[E.A. Maurenbrecher]] (1906-1907)
* [[R.E. Krijboom]] (1907-1908)
* [[J.A. van Der Ent]] (1909-1910)
* [[J.J. Verwijk]] (1910-1912)
* [[C.C.B. van Vlenier]] (1912-1913) 
* [[B. van Bijveld]] (1913-1920)
* [[B. Coops]] (1920-1921)
* [[S.A. Reitsma]] (1921-1928)
* [[B. Coops]] (1928-1934)
* [[J.E.A. van Volsogen Kuhr]] (1934-1936)
* [[J.M. Wesselink]] (1936-1942)
* [[N. Beets]] (1942-1945)
* [[R.A. Atmadinata]] (1945-1946)
* [[R. Siamsurizal]]
* [[Ukar Bratakusumah]] (1946-1949)
* [[R. Enoch]] (1949-1956)
* [[R. Priatna Kusumah]] (1956-1966)
* [[R. Didi Jukardi]] (1966-1968)
* [[Hidayat Sukarmadijaya]] (1968-1971)
* [[Otje Djundjunan]] (1971-1976)
* [[Ucu Junaedi]] (1976-1978)
* [[Husein Wangsaatmaja]] (1978-1983)
* [[Ateng Wahyudi]] (1983-1993)
* [[Wahyu Hamidjaja]] (1993-1998)
* [[Aa Tarmana]] (1998-2004)
* [[Dada Rosada]] (2004-)

AA Tarmana was the favourite in the 2004 mayoral election (elected by the state parliament, not direct election by the people), but overnight it was overturned when Dada Rosada was suddenly elected instead. {{citationneeded}}

Ever since the mayor Dada Rosada came into power, Bandung has grown ever more islamic than ever, with the renovation of [[Bandung Great Mosque|the great mosque]] which basically consumes the downtown city square, and the implementation of strict no prostitution state law (''perda'') which the mayor vows to clean up all prostitutes from the city. The cleanup effort is to be completed in November 2006, with the completion of a ''Madrasah'' (islamic school) in the prostitution localization of Saritem Street. Recently, nightly sweeps of the city arrested women and accused them of prostitution, basically they arrested every women in public places at night. The ones who could not produce any form of identification or a husband to vouch for them will be arrested and charged as prostitutes.

<p>I am trying to improve this page, but somebody has a preference of the unrepresentative Education section. There must be a lot of writing in the section, as Bandung has more prominence in the education. The only two listed schools: St. Aloysius and Bandung Fe Institute, do not represent education in Bandung. What is Fe institue anyway, compared to major universities in the city?? Before I edit the section, could somebody tell me the reason of letting these two schools? Someone else has edited the section with more representative way, but it was reverted back. — <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndon_c50f.html" title="User:Indon">Indon</a> 11:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey Indon, good job on the article. I noticed some of these things
<ul>
<li><i>The most interesting</i> branch of Citarum is the river that flows to the chalk mountain in the Rajamandala area, west of Bandung</li>
<li>It was not so long that Bandung had <i>developed itself into an exclusive Europen resort style with hotels, cafes and shops. Rich plantation owners came during the weekends and so do girls and bussinessmen from the capital, Batavia</i>.</li>
<li><i>Today</i>, alun-alun has changed dramatically into a major shopping complex. In the meantime, the Dutch East Indies government built military barracks, the central government building (Gouvernments Bedrijven, nicknamed Gedung Sate) and other buildings. However, this plan has never been realized as the failure of the Dutch to reclaim Indonesia after the World War II. (As this is an encyclopedia, avoid these things (currently, recently, today and stuff)</li>
<li>In 1955, Bandung was again famous as the venue of the first Asian-African Conference</li>
<li>in Bandung is <i>infamous with its complex, congested and chaotic nature</i>. The city core is practically uprooted, old faces are torn down, lot sizes regrouped, and what was idyllic residence is now bustling chain supermarkets and rich banks</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I could copyedit them, but I'm afraid I don't know much about Bandung, so I'm afraid the real meaning will change if I edit it. So yeah, stuff like that.. Just remember, if you want to point about something which is a thought or things like that, just change the wording and provide citations and everything will be alright.

<p>Dude, this article looks like something out of a travel agent's brochure. It is certainly not a good article. Also, it doesn't seem to tell a complete story of the city with all it's downfall. Like the destruction of the architectural orientation of the alun-alun area (which was brushed off hastily) nor the 60's riots among other things. Many references are merely opinions of the writer (like the taxi references). Thus requiring NPOV tag. This article does not deserve good article nomination. <a href="../../../f/e/u/User%7EFeureau_5e85.html" title="User:Feureau">Feureau</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Can you tell me when was the destruction of the architectural orientation? If you know, then why don't you contribute? This article is never finished, but at some point it has to be graded. Again, could you please put in the article about 60's riot in Bandung? I've never recalled that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've put all references needed and I don't think you'll find this page in a travel agent brochure. If you have any different perspective about the city, please add them. I've put some criticism, e.g. the environmental issues there.</dd>

<p>Responding to your request for feedback:</p>
<p>It doesn't read like a travel agents brochure - "the traffic is infamous" - hardly likely to appeal, but it does still show evidence of the editor's opinion. Cut down on comments like "interestingly" - the reader will decide whether it is interesting. Not the worst I've seen by a long shot though. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 15:40, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The part about the travel agent's brochure wasn't meant for the whole article, just parts of it. Also, a GA renomination should be warranted if the article covers a rather more accurate and complete overview of the city. Also, it needs some cleanup to a more wikipedia friendly wording too, don't you think? (i.e. the introduction section) NPOV isn't the only problem</dd>
<dd>You could go load google earth and look at the area of masjid agung bandung, and you can see that it is in the classical city square orientation formation but the new masjid agung constructed pointing mecca is actually overlapping the road and more construction is underway on the city square itself. The direction of the mosque itself screwed the architectural orientation of the square. (which the article correctly claimed that it was to align with mount tangkuban parahu.) I wrote about this but its wording was probably wasn't very good. It's buried in the history somewhere. Someone deleted it I guess.</dd>

I've thought about this carefully, your thing about the 60's is a bit unfair - as the editors are clearly 
born 1985 + and if you have any experience of new order bureaucratic management of knowledge of local history - 
its unlikely that there's anything in the public domain/easy acccess to info about it.  Having lived in another 
part of java myself, I would say local info about issues of that era do not find their way into easily 
accessible for locals info at all - even if it was documented.  Your arts on the conference in the earlier 
sukarno era are more likely covered - by online sources, but real info on the 60's are more likely in basements 
in canberra, leiden and cornell than they are in the public domain in contemporary java :)

<dd>Well, fair or not, it is public knowledge from the 60's riot and why chinese immigrants flock from the villages to this city, and whether there's some info on the basement of some foreign university, it doesn't mean that the data should be omitted. Since it is a quite significant part of the city's history. Unfortunately, not many newspaper archive from indonesian papers been made available like that of the washington post, and this is probably another weakness of wikipedia that some of it's opponents can take advantage of. (not me, Wikipedia is like H2G2 to me) The excuse that the editor is born on 1985+ is also not an acceptable excuse to have some info to be omitted. Since wikipedia by nature can be edited by anyone, the burden of how good an article is does not depend on one editor. So, in summary, I agree that information is not easily obtainable, but it is not impossible to obtain since just like you claimed, it's probably buried in a hard drive somewher at OSU. Or somewhere in Japan.</dd>
<dd>Though don't be discouraged, editors of Bandung, (as with all wiki articles, this is nothing personal, so don't take it personally) for I do live in the city and I want to see this article gets better, and it is already far better than it was, but it wasn't good enough, so keep up the good work, and let's fight for it to be not only a good article, but also a featured article on the front page(!)</dd>

<dd>Feureau, being GA is not being complete. Somebody knowledge might not be the same as others. That's why this encyclopedia is formed, because anybody can edit it. If you have knowledge about a certain event, please put it in the article, instead of putting tags. I noticed you put again cleanup tag, which I don't understand which things that should be cleaned up? Please put here what should be cleaned up. — <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndon_c50f.html" title="User:Indon">Indon</a> 12:24, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have the time to write something worthwile for the time being. (Personal life intervenes) But if I can find the time, I'll write that orientation thing <i>again</i>. The cleanup tag is there so that it notifies people that the article needs cleaning up. I'm not sure why you removed it, especially after you created a new article on the history of the city and then having the history section to be that long. This article definitely needs some cleanup. That history section is just from a quick observation. This is not an exhaustive analysis.</dd>
<dd>I'm putting the cleanup tag back on the page. You've given a great contribution to this article. It's a lot better now from what it used to be. And I love it, but it's really, as you said, a contribution of everyone. That everyone can edit this article. If one editor doesn't know a particular subject, it's not an excuse to omit it nor pushing everyone to edit the article. This is not something that one MUST do. The keyword is contribution. You are allowed to contribute and thus by implication, you also free not to contribute. Just like a charity. One way to contribute is to put them tags on articles.</dd>
<dd>The argument that one should just contribute whatever that is missing of an article instead of just tags is an old wikipedia debate and like it or not, tags are here to stay, and they're here for good reasons. This topic has been an old wikipedia debate and I don't want to be drawn into it <i>again</i>. <a href="../../../f/e/u/User%7EFeureau_5e85.html" title="User:Feureau">Feureau</a> 16:56, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All right, I have a solution to resolve the issue of incomplete Bandung history, i.e. riots in 60s, etc. I've made a <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bandung_1d6f.html" title="History of Bandung">main article of Bandung history</a> (see History section).
