<dd>"In the steam room (called parilka, парилка) there is a wood stove, where the heat comes from. Beside the stove stands a bucket of water that is poured over the heated stones of the stove. Usually across the stove are wooden benches. The banya is less hot than the Finnish sauna, but what it lacks in temperature is compensated by pouring more water over the stones of the stove, creating air moisture."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is this correct? At the banya I go to in Seattle, Banya 5, the "parilka" is the hot dry room that reaches around 200-220°F, while there's a separate steam room. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 08:32, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Looking at the link on the main page, I can guarantee you that the authenticity of this banya is suspect. Just like Chinese food in North America, it is somewhat similar to the real thing, but would not be considered "authentic" by most Russians. I've been to several Banyas in Russia, most notably in the Baikal area of Siberia, and noticed the following similarities: Waynovich, June 2 2006</p>
<p>In most Russian banyas it is customary to have three rooms, the steam room, the washing room, and a entrance room. The entrance room customarily has pegs to hang clothing upon. The washing room has a tap of very hot water which is heated in the stove of the steam chamber. A vessel or tap for cold water is usually located here for mixing the water to accomodate a comfortable washing temperature. The heater is usually composed of three compartments, with a fire box that is fed from the entrance room. Sitting atop this is the rock chamber, which usually has a small hole to throw the water into; the stovepipe continues up through the rock chamber and through the water tank, which is the top-most section of the stove. A tap connects the water tank to the washing room (predbanik)to supply the hot water for washing. The top of the water tank is usually closed to prevent vapour from infiltrating the banya, and water to be thrown on the rocks should be taken from the tank as this will cause superior steam than if cold water were used. If an electric heater is used, the firebox is omited. Most Russians will identify the wood burning stove as a better beanya heater, and studies haev shown that negative ions are produced from wood fired heaters, whilst electic heaters produce positive ions. The steam chamber usually is entered when the stove is hot, but has not yet been splashed with water. Getting a good sweat on before using water is prefered to using steam right away, as the sweat is thought to protect and condition the skin to the steam. Chapkas, felt hats, are used to protect the hair, and a pajubnik, or ass-pad is used to sit upon as the hot dry wood can be very uncomfrotable for bare skin. The chapka also allows the user to tolerate higher temperatures without feeling lightheaded or faint. Chapkas, pajubniks and a felt mitt are commonly sold in sets at shops in Russia, along with aromatherapy scents specially made for inclusion into the steam water. After the first good sweat is induced, it is customary to cool off in the breeze outdoors, or splash with cold water or in a lake or river. The banya is then entered again, and steam is caused by throwing small amounts of water upon the rocks in the heater. It is desirebale to throw small enough amounts on rocks that are sufficiently hot to ensure that steam is fine and water evaporates quickly; otherwise steam will be too cool and have a clammy "feel". The steam should feel like a wave of heat and not be overly moist, this is due to the high temperature of the rocks and the quick evaporation causing very fine particles of vapour that are highly dispersed. Waving the venik will also cause a wave of convective heat to be felt, the reverse of a wind-chill effect, and a common joke of younger banya goers it to gently blow on the person next to them, producing a dry spot of skin that rapidly feels the heat of the surrounding air. The second sweat is commonly the first time venik would be used, but it is not uncommon to wait until the third session. After each sweat, cooling off is repeated, and patrons may take this break to drink beer, tea or other beverages, play games or relax in good company in an antechamber to the steam room. A black banya is much more rudimentary, and is generally considered to be less desirable than the "white" banya described above.</p>
<p>Commercial banyas often have only a steam room, or a steam rooma nd a dry room depending on local custom, or the money the owner of the banya was willing to spend. It is rummored that certain nightclubs in Moscow and St Petersberg have a Banya in them. Russian banyas are generally more of a fun place than Finnish saunas, mostly do to the social-cutlure of the Russian people, who are viewed by-and-large as more expressive than the rather dour Finns.</p>

<p>Banya uses steam, while sauna uses "dry" heat. Big difference! The word "sauna" needs to be removed from the title of this article. 75.3.65.63 16:19, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They are variations of the same theme (and of the same origins) with small variations and national traditions. "Sauna" uses steam also, of course, it would be an oven without it, the degree is up to the user and can be adjusted on -the-fly. The construction, stove, benches, birch "bushes" etc are identical. Sauna also has the same variants that are descripted here as "white" and "black" (savusauna) "Banyas". I'll change the article accordingly <a href="../../../2/1/3/User%7E213.243.182.3.html" title="User:213.243.182.3">213.243.182.3</a> 21:13, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A history of the Russian Banya is probably in order -- origins -- construction. I am thinkning either stone or mud brick. The 'pitch' is the central aspect of teh traditional Russian village home. They were very large -- large enough to sleep on top of in the winter. The Russian Banya's I've visited on my adventures in Russian are constructed like small log cabins. One enters and disrobes. Being naked in Russia in a Banya is normalno "Normal". The modern bahya stoves "Pitches" are made of iron. The have stones on top of them which get very hot -- the stove itself becomes very very hot. A bucket or source of cold water is poured on the stones with a dipper. Breathing deeply, and taking turns hitting each other all over the body with wither birch branches with leaves, or soft green pine brances is ritualized. In tha banya one or a stack of benches are constructed where bathers sit or lay. Bathers also wear traditional felt hats to hold the heat in their body. I have done this quite a few times -- and I felt like a cake in an over! However, the heat subsides with exits and dashes to jump in a cold lake, pond, etc... or to exit and pour buckets of cold water. The modern ovens/stoves in the villages are constructed of iron.</p>
<p><br />
I think that most veteran bania goers will state that the water which is tossed upon the rocks should be hot, as cold water takes too much energy to raise it to steam. This cooling effect may make some banyas seem clammy, which is not at all the intended effect.</p>

<p>Did russians inherit the banya from finno-ugric people&#160;? What are the origins of banya&#160;? It indeed is very similar to finnish sauna and there are lot of finno-ugrians in Russia whom all have saunas/banyas.</p>
