<p>Consumer bankruptcy is a legislative procedure under Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (“the BIA”) (1) complemented by provisions of federal and provincial legislation (2) that allows an insolvent person, who cannot pay his debts and liabilities, and who assigns himself or petitioned by the creditors into bankruptcy, to surrender his property to a trustee in bankruptcy for the purpose of distribution among creditors in accordance with legislative priority of distribution scheme; and upon bankrupt’s compliance with bankruptcy procedures allows a bankrupt to be discharged (excused) from paying all or , chapter of his debts and liabilities. The legislation may be complemented by regulations and Office of Superintendent in Bankruptcy directives (OSB Directive(s)) (the latter provide guidelines to the trustees in bankruptcy on various aspects of the BIA) (3).</p>
<p>The bankruptcy procedure is under reform. The Bill C-55 Bill C-55 is a comprehensive insolvency reform package in Parliament to modernize the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The Bill has received Royal assent and goes through final phase of legislative and regulatory amendments to substitute the current bankruptcy legislation. The current status of Bill C-55 can be found at Office of Superintendent in Bankruptcy website at <a href="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inbsf-osb.nsf/en/h_br01368e.html" class="external free" title="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inbsf-osb.nsf/en/h_br01368e.html" rel="nofollow">http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inbsf-osb.nsf/en/h_br01368e.html</a>.</p>

<p>The bankruptcy process may be divided in three stages:</p>
<p><a name="Initiation_of_the_bankruptcy_process" id="Initiation_of_the_bankruptcy_process"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy_in_Canada_7690.html" title="Edit section: Initiation of the bankruptcy process">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Initiation of the bankruptcy process</span></h3>
<p>At this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>An insolvent person considers the possibility of avoiding bankruptcy by filing a consumer proposal or making independent arrangements with the creditors. Filling a consumer proposal is a serious decision, because an insolvent person may be deemed “bankrupt” if he defaults on consumer proposal. (“consumer proposal”, chapter III);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the consumer proposal is not accepted by the creditors or the consumer proposal is not a viable option, an insolvent person considers consequences of assigning himself into bankruptcy (“consequences of bankruptcy”, chapter I(D)). An insolvent person may either voluntarily assigns himself into bankruptcy or is involuntarily petitioned into bankruptcy by debtor’s creditors (“initiating bankruptcy process”, chapter II);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The legal proceedings and creditor’s attempts to enforce the debts are stayed, no person is allowed to initiate or to continue existing legal actions against the bankrupt nor to enforce existing court orders (other than secured creditors who are allowed to enforce their security) (”stay of proceedings”, chapter II(F))</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bankrupt transfers his property to the trustee in bankruptcy for its further distribution among creditors under the priority of distribution scheme in the BIA ( “vesting of property in trustee”, chapter IV);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bankrupt assists the trustee in bankruptcy in collecting the property for the benefit of the creditors, canceling the fraudulent preferences and transactions and attending meetings of the creditors (“duties of the bankrupt” , chapter IV);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attends mandatory counseling on managing financial affairs after discharge, abides duties and procedures under the BIA (“mandatory counseling”, “duties of the bankrupt”, chapter IV);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Informs creditor on any changes in financial circumstances and acquired assets (“duties of bankrupt”, “treatment of assets and surplus income”, chapter IV);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Transfers part of his surplus income and all property acquired before the discharge to the trustee in bankruptcy for the distribution among creditors (“treatment of assets and surplus income” , chapter IV);</li>

<p>At this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first-time bankrupt is automatically discharged after 9 months if no notice of opposition to discharge is filed either by creditors, official receiver or the trustee in bankruptcy. The first-time bankrupt may apply for the discharge before 9 months period expires;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the second-time or more than two-time bankrupt has the trustee in bankruptcy to apply for order of discharge to the bankruptcy court between 3 months and a year from the date of bankruptcy or where the bankrupt has waived this application, the bankrupt applies himself (“application for discharge order” , chapter V);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Where there is an opposition to discharge, the debtor defends himself by opposing the opposing , party which attempts to persuade the bankruptcy court that one of the facts listed in s.173(1) has occurred (“opposition to discharge”, chapter V);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bankrupt either obtains certificate of discharge from the trustee in bankruptcy in cases of automatic discharge of first-time bankrupts; or order of discharge from the court in other cases. Under s.178(2), the discharge releases the bankrupt from all claims provable in bankruptcy, except the claims listed in s.178(1) of the BIA (“absolute, conditional discharge”, “non-dischargeable debts”, chapter V);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Where conditional discharge is granted, the bankrupt is obliged to comply with the conditions imposed by the bankruptcy court. The failure to comply may result in annulment of the discharge and other punitive consequences. The bankruptcy court may refuse to grant a discharge (“conditional discharge”, chapter V).</li>

<p>The purpose of the bankruptcy process is to introduce a legislative mechanism that would provide a fair and peaceful resolution of financial conflict between debtors and creditors, creditors competing among themselves for recovery of their loans and balance public interest in protecting financial security of creditors on one hand and public interest in allowing an insolvent individual to make a fresh start. Generally, the objectives of the bankruptcy process can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To permit an honest, but unfortunate debtor to obtain a discharge of his debts and to make “fresh start”;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Not only to permit an honest debtor to make a fresh start, but also to rehabilitate such a debtor by counseling bankrupt on managing his financial affairs after discharge in order to prevent subsequent insolvency of the bankrupt;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To promote a sense of commercial responsibility of the bankrupt and to deter bankrupt from subsequent insolvencies by introducing stricter legislative and judicial treatment of second and ensuing bankruptcies;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To permit an investigation of the financial affairs of the bankrupt by a mediator, a trustee in bankruptcy, who is given broad powers to facilitate settlement of the claims by way of consumer proposal, to require compliance with bankruptcy procedures, to set aside fraudulent transactions and preferences among creditors and to adjudicate various matters under the BIA;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To protect the creditors from competing with each other and to secure debtor from excessive pressure from the creditors attempting to collect their debts first by introducing a priority of distribution of bankrupt’s property scheme under which all creditors are treated equally in accordance with the scheme.</li>

<p>For the purposes of the BIA, it is important to be able to distinguish between legal definition of “insolvent person” and one of “bankrupt”. Generally, insolvent person is a person, who cannot pay his debts that may subsequently become bankrupt, either by assigning himself into bankruptcy, been petitioned into bankruptcy by the creditors or been deemed to assign himself into bankruptcy by defaulting on consumer proposal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal Definition of “Insolvent Person” in s.2 of the BIA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The person who is unable to pay his obligation is considered to be insolvent person under the BIA. Under s.2 of the BIA “insolvent person” means a person who is not bankrupt and who resides carries on business or has property in Canada, whose liabilities to creditors provable as claims under this Act amount to one thousand dollars, and</p>
<p>(a) who is for any reason unable to meet his obligations as they generally become due, (b)the aggregate of whose property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient, or, if disposed of at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all his obligations, due and accruing due;</p>
<p>The definition of “insolvent person” is essentially important in two main areas of the BIA. First, only an insolvent person may make an assignment in bankruptcy under s.49 of the BIA and essentially been petitioned into bankruptcy by creditors under s.49 of the BIA (“assignment into bankruptcy”, chapter II(A)). Second, transfer of the property of the insolvent person to a creditor may be attacked as being a fraudulent preference under s.95 of the BIA (“fraudulent preferences”, chapter IV(C) (4)).</p>
<p>b) Legal definition of “bankrupt” in s.2 of the BIA.</p>
<p>Under s.2 of the BIA, an “insolvent person” can become “bankrupt” for the purposes of the BIA in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by a voluntary assignment under s.49 of the BIA (“assignment into bankruptcy”, chapter II(A);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>an application for a bankruptcy order under s.43 of the BIA (“application for a bankruptcy order”, chapter II(B);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>by defaulting on consumer proposal under s.66.3(5) of the BIA (“default on a consumer proposal”, chapter II(C) and chapter III(E)).</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Creditors" id="Creditors"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy_in_Canada_7690.html" title="Edit section: Creditors">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Creditors</span></h3>
<p>a) Priority of Claims</p>
<p>Section.2 of the BIA defines a “creditor” as a person having a claim, unsecured, preferred by virtue of priority under s.136 of the BIA or secured, that can be proved as a claims under s.124 of the Act. The creditors may be divided into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>secured creditors are creditors, whose claims are guaranteed by some security in bankrupt’s property. The secured creditors are on the top of the bankruptcy priority of claims scheme. They still need to prove the claim to the trustee in bankruptcy or in the court, however they can always apply for an order to take possession of their security as soon as they give a reasonable notice of their intention to do so to the bankrupt or the trustee in bankruptcy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>preferred creditors are creditors, whose claims come second under priority of distribution in the BIA by virtue of s.136(1) of the BIA. The priority of claims is justified by necessity to protect vulnerable individuals (employee’s wages, spousal payments, child support), administration of the bankruptcy process (trustee in bankruptcy’s fees, cost of administration of the estate), public purse (municipal taxes) or other public policy rationales (landlord’s rent claims). If property of the bankruptcy estate is insufficient to compensate all preferred creditors, the property is distributed proportionally to the amounts of preferred creditor’s claims (pari passu principle in s.141 of the BIA). The preferred creditors become unsecured creditors for the rest of the uncompensated claim. Secured and preferred creditors must be fully compensated, where a consumer proposal is made to the unsecured creditors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>unsecured creditors are the creditors, whose claims are not guaranteed by some security in bankrupt’s property and do not have priority under s.136(1) of the BIA. If the property of the estate is insufficient to compensate all unsecured claims, the property is distributed proportionally to unsecured creditor’s claims (pari passu principle in s.141 of the BIA).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>deferred creditors the creditors whose wages are deferred for public policy reason, i.e. family bonds to the bankrupt. Their claims can be compensated only after unsecured creditor’s claims are fully repaid. The deferred claims include back wages to bankrupt’s spouses (s.137(2) and back wages to other relatives (s.138).</li>
</ul>
<p>b) Proof of Claims</p>
<p>Every creditor must prove his claim and a creditor who does not prove his claim is not entitled to any distribution of the proceeds from bankrupt’s estate (s.124(1). The claim must be delivered to the trustee in bankruptcy and the trustee in bankruptcy must examine every proof of claim and can request further proof. The trustee may disallow, in whole or in part any claim , right to a priority under the BIA or security. Generally, the test of proving the claim before the trustee in bankruptcy is very low, a claim is proved unless it is too “remote and speculative”. (Re Wiebe). The rationale for such a low test is to discharge as many claims as possible to allow the bankrupt to make a fresh start after the discharge.</p>
<p><a name="Trustee_in_Bankruptcy" id="Trustee_in_Bankruptcy"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy_in_Canada_7690.html" title="Edit section: Trustee in Bankruptcy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trustee in Bankruptcy</span></h3>
<p>A trustee in bankruptcy is an individual or a corporation licensed by the official superintendent to hold in trust and, subsequently, to distribute bankrupt’s property among the creditors in accordance with distribution scheme under the BIA. The bankrupt and all other persons holding bankrupt’s property must transfer the property to trustee. The trustee may also assist individual in preparing and submitting a consumer proposal to creditors. The trustee must arrange mandatory counseling of the bankrupt. The trustee must follow the procedures under the BIA, call creditors meetings and send the , parties required notices of proceedings and documents. The trustee is responsible for preparation of pre-discharge report and may oppose bankrupt’s discharge.</p>
<p>Bankrupts often misunderstand the role of the trustee in bankruptcy in bankruptcy process considering him to be personal representatives and counsels of the bankrupts. In reality, despite the fact that the bankrupt pays for trustee’s services, trustees in bankruptcy are required to act in the interest of the creditors. The major duty of trustee is to arrange bankrupt’s compliance with the procedures under the BIA in order to distribute the estate among creditors, which is not always in the best interest of creditor, who is more interested in excluding as much property from distribution among creditors and been excused from as many debts as possible as a result of discharge order.</p>

<p>The OSB is designed to supervise the administration of all estates and matters to which the BIA applies. The specific duties of the OSG are to grant licenses for the trustees in bankruptcy; to inspect and to investigate bankruptcy estates; review the conduct of the trustees in bankruptcy and the receivers; to examine trustee’s accounts, receipts, disbursements and final statements. The specific powers of the OSB are to intervene in any matter or proceeding in court as if the OSB were a party thereto; and to issue directives providing official interpretation of the bankruptcy process to the trustees in bankruptcy and the receivers.</p>

<p>Under s.183(1) of the GIA the provincial Superior Courts of Justice have “such jurisdiction at law and in equity” as will enable them to exercise bankruptcy process under the BIA. S.183(2) regulates appeals from bankruptcy court decisions unless otherwise provided in the BIA. Under s.188, the decisions of the provincial court are enforceable in the courts of other Canadian provinces and all courts and the officers of all courts must act and cooperate in all bankruptcy matters.</p>
<p>Under s.192 of the BIA, the registrars of the provincial Superior Courts have significant powers in relation to procedural matters, unopposed proceedings and in other matters under the Act.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy_in_Canada_7690.html" title="Edit section: Inspectors">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inspectors</span></h3>
<p>Inspectors are individuals who are usually appointed at the first meeting of the creditors to perform functions described below. No inspector may be appointed if he is a , party to any contested action or proceeding against the estate. No inspector is usually appointed under summary administration procedure, where the value of debtor’s property is under $10,000.</p>
<p>The trustee is required to obtain the permission inspectors before carrying out many of trustee’s responsibilities, such as the sale of property of the estate, the institution or defending of actions relating to the property of the bankrupt, settling any debts owing to the bankrupt and exercising trustee’s discretion in retaining and assigning bankrupt’s contracts. The inspectors must give their approval to the final statement of receipts and disbursements and trustee’s fees.</p>
<p>Inspectors have fiduciary duty to the creditors and should be impartial though acting in creditor’s interest. The should supervise trustee’s compliance with the procedures under the BIA and the Directives and may apply for the removal of the trustee (Re Bryant)</p>

<p>Where a creditor has made a petition for a receiving order , the court may appoint an interim receiver, if it is shown that it is necessary for the protection of the estate of the debtor at any time after filing of a petition.(s.46(1). The court may appoint the trustee in bankruptcy as a receiver of debtor’s property. The receiver can take conservative measures and dispose of perishable property, but the receiver cannot unduly interfere with the bankrupt in the carrying on of debtor’s business, except as is necessary for conservatory measures. The court may appoint a receiver where secured creditor enforces his security (s.47) or in cases of consumer proposal (s.47.1).</p>
<p>In Re Stuart and Sutterby, the court set out the factors, which should be considered in exercising discretion of whether to appoint an interim receiver:</p>
<ul>
<li>No person in control of the property;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Debtor is acting in bad faith and giving preferences to other creditors;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Debtor is fraudulently disposing and concealing his assets;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Allegation of criminal offences are made;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The property is in possession of third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>The receiver must to do what “practicality demands” to preserve the assets (Minister of Indian Affairs v. Curragh) and must not go beyond what is necessary in the circumstances (Re Insolvency of Big Sky Living Inc.).</p>
