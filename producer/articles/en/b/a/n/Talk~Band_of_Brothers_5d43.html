<p>The references in the article are likely incorrect. Alone the implied attachment of Easy Company to 3rd Battalion 506 PIR is quite obviously wrong and makes one question the accuracy of the paragraph. The HBO miniseries was based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book, which was meticulously researched.</p>

<p>Where's Cpt Winters?</p>
<p>Easy Company is attached to the 2nd Battalion, not the 3rd. Or was, rather. And Captain Winters is on the list as Major Winters, his final military ranking. 65.95.232.95 22:27, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All of the above discussion of "attachment" is semantics. In military jargon "attachment" means belonging to one unit but being temporarily assigned to another. Easy Company was an integral part of the 2nd Battalion of the 506th, not "attached". During WWII the Army did not include the term "battalion" when identifying units within a regiment--it was implied. When Winters moved up to command of the 506th's 2nd Battalion, Easy Company was one of the companies he commanded. Buckboard 10:08, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've updated the entry about the mention of Hitler's death on April 11, 1945 at Thalem. It's clear that the date is simply wrong on this scene. Ambrose states that the Landsberg work camp wasn't freed until April 29, 1945. The official documents (After Action Reports) for the regiment don't show them leaving Landsberg until April 30, 1945. The scene in Thalem is framed after the events in Landsberg, and mentions the newly-received orders to advance and take Berchtesgaden, which didn't happen until May 3, 1945 (according to both sources). Actually, I can't find _any_ mention of Thalem at all in either source during April or early May. In addition, this <a href="http://www.kaufering.com/overview.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kaufering.com/overview.html" rel="nofollow">overview of Kaufering camps</a> lists the male camp at Landsberg as being liberated on April 27, 1945. Romalar 05:41, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would question the validity of the error that mentions the sunlight during the takeoff sequence in episode 1. I'd need to check the scene in question and the supposed time but it gets dark very slowly and very late in England in the month of June. Certainly, the sky can appear quite bright to the north-west until after midnight if the weather is good.--<a href="../../../c/_/i/User%7EC_i_wood_3d64.html" title="User:C i wood">Chris Wood</a> 13:59, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, on June 6, the weather was not good because Eisenhower faced the decision to OK the invasion or postpone it for a while. On June 5, it was stormy in the channel, therefore June 6 weather was not any better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's speculation without any proof whatsoever. Additionally, the paratroopers took off and were dropped on June 5th, not June 6th. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 05:32, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another point to note. Britain remained on Double Summer Time BST+2 during the war making sunset an our later than today's summers.

<p>Regarding the previous change to dividing the errors: What was wrong with just "Historical errors"? All the errors listed <i>are</i> historical rather than film mistakes. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 07:21, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The latest edits regarding 11 April 1945 and reintroducing the section on the "possibility" of Lewis Nixon hearing rumors about Hitler's death just isn't plausible. Please reread what I wrote above and the links to the online references. The events as portrayed in the miniseries are contradicted by multiple external historical accounts and facts, and couldn't have happened on 11 April. There is no reason to speculate about rumors of Hitler's death. It seems clear to me that they simply got the date and location of a minor scene wrong.</dd>

<dd>Otherwise, I agree that the section is better as just "Historical errors". Romalar 20:06, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"During the Brecourt Manor Assault on D-day in episode two, Colonel Strayer of 2nd Battalion, 506th tells Richard Winters to eliminate a battery of 88mm cannon. The movie portrays the cannon as 88mm guns. In reality and in the book, the battery were 105mm guns, not 88mm."</p>
<p>I removed this because it is inaccurate. Rewatch the episode, and pay particular attention to the report Richard Winters gives to his commanding officer (Strayer?) after the assault on Brecourt Manor. "They were 105s, sir, not 88s. We disabled them and then pulled out." Romalar 07:57, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good catch. I had assumed that Strayer/Sink/whomever thought they were 88s because the 88s were the most famous German weapon and tolk Winters they were such, despite reality (fog of war). --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 13:51, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Irregardless of Winter's correction, are the guns still not incorrect in that they were 88's, assuming what was said is true? Granted it's not a historical mistake but rather a filmmakers mistake <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.36.125.209 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.36.125.209_ecce.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.36.125.209">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it is accurate. The officer tells Winters that they are 88s. Winters and his men take them out. Winters corrects his commander, as he did in real life. So, it was neither a historical or fillmaker's mistake, but rather a mis-identification that actually happened. Seeing as this was the first time the 101st had seen action AND they'd heard of 88s from those who'd already been in combat, the senior officer assumed they were 88s. By the time of their drop into Holland, all the veterans would recognize an 88 just by the sound. Also, note that the filmmaker did not use guns that looked like 88s at this point (unlike in Foy, when IIRC, it looks like an 88 in the middle of town). --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 22:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To clarify any misunderstanding, Joe Liebgott was manning a machine gun on Brecourt and was setting up a base of fire near the Company's approach to the field, hence receiving very little screen time.

Visit the page for <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easy_Company_81db.html" title="Easy Company">Easy Company</a> for a better list of the real people.

<dd>Actually, technically, the people depicted on the <i>TV show'</i> Band of Brothers are characters who are based on actual soldiers. Even though they're based on real soldiers, the people you see on the TV show are still characters played by actors and the show is scripted. So while based on reality, what you see for the most part on the show are not actual people but characters based on those people. Hence the category. (As an analogy, when Anthony Hopkins played Richard Nixon, "Richard Nixon" would appear listed as a character in that movie, as opposed to the real person "Richard Nixon" who wasn't in the movie.) <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 15:28, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>At the end of Episode 7, Lt Dike is shown a being killed in the attack on Foy. This is not true. After being replaced by Lt Spears, Dike was reassigned to General Taylor's staff.</i> I really cannot recall this to be shown in that episode.

<dd>This comes around 1:01:38 when Lipton is talking about the soldiers who were killed by the sniper. A dead soldier is shown. As he continues to walk, Picante asks if it's "true about Dike", Lipton says yes, and Picante says "Thank god for small mercies." The dialogue suggests that Dike is killed, although it doesn't specifically say this. The "small mercy" might be that he was relieved of command. The dead soldier is either Dike, or Ken Webb from earlier in the episode, but I can't tell. If it is Dike, then obviously he is supposed to be dead; if not then it's uncertain and we might as well assume the historically accurate and remove the "historical error" from this article. --Bp0 02:01, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lt Dike was not killed. Frank Perconte is still alive and living in Joilet, Illinois. I have had many conversations with him, been to his home sat a watched WHY WE FIGHT and had a reall nice time with him. I had him at my son's High School for a History Class on World War 2.</p>
<p>I talked to Frank himself and Lt. Dike was not killed. His statement referred to the fact the Kike was transfered.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact Frank Perconte -- go to the White Pages type in FRANK PERCONTE Joliet Illinois. Believe me -- he will welcome your call. His birthday is next week and he will be 90 years old.</p>

<p>In Major Dick Winters Memoirs “Beyond Band of Brothers” pgs 222-223 he states that it was definitely Easy Company that captured Berchtesgaden and not the 3rd Infantry or the French 2nd Armored, or even the 7th Infantry regiment.<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDRMAKA_9b6b.html" title="User:DRMAKA">DRMAKA</a></p>

<dd>Sadly, he is wrong. When they arrived there were no Allied troops there because they had been pulled out prior to Easy's arrival.

<p>Sadly for you, he is right. Major Winters was a serious officer, not a spineless civilian who has no qualms about lying. Feel free to live in your fantasy world, but I doubt you are going to accuse him of lying like you may. Of course, many accounts would agree with you, but, ironically, most of the other forces apparently never even ENTERED the buildings, thus, they were the first to occupy the Berchtesgarden. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.242.250.36.html" title="User:69.242.250.36">69.242.250.36</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__69.242.250.36_7538.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 69.242.250.36">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Your comment made me laugh. Are you saying that entering the buildings is the determining factor in whether you occupy a location? That sounds ridiculous. Second, do you really think that <i>actual</i> soldiers would not enter the buildings? I mean, would you feel safe if no one ever checked for possible hidden snipers? Remember, we're talking about combat veterans. Now, do you have any evidence that those units never entered the buildings? Winters was a wonderful officer and is a great and noble man, but other units were there first. (Oh, and <i><a href="../../../b/e/r/Berchtesgaden.html" title="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a> is a town in the German Bavarian Alps.</i>, not a building.) --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 14:48, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No one is accusing Maj. Winters of lying. It is possible, however, that he is wrong about his facts. Winters is not the definitive source of historical facts. You don't have to have entered the town yourself in order to know who was there first, and if other accounts reveal that E Company, 506th was not the first into Berchtesgaden, then chances are they probably weren't. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 17:11, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Has anyone ever met a member of Eagle Company? I have. I had dinner and lunch with Frank Perconte. Even sat his house and had a few beers and watched WHY WE FIGHT. At 89 years old he's a spicy old devil. I asked come to my son's school and we shown a few clips of the BAND OF BROTHERS and he answered some questions.

<p>A thing I have noticed is the Uniform of the British in Episode 5. Especially in the joint briefing scene it is clear to see that some (if not all) of the British are wearing the screaming eagle patch, which was clearly an American mark that the British would not have been wearing. Is there a reason for this? I know there are many instances in the show where it is so accurate it seems innacurate (such as the grenade exploding on impact), and if not is it mroe extensive than I have noticed so far? If it is indeed an error it surely deserves a mention! any thoughts?--Noofworm 03:08, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. If it were a mistake to do with the Americans uniforms it would get a mention without a doubt. But since it is the British no one seems to mind. Perhaps you have a point, as it does indeed sound more trivial than the other historical innacuracies listed, but that does not detract from my feeling that, as a British person, it still deserves a mention somewhere. Especially because of its glaring comparison to the otherwise flawless uniforms elsewhere.--Noofworm 17:09, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So you're countering alleged bias with your own bias? Trivia is <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">trivia</a>; other less-notable inaccuracies have been removed. No one's complaining about the omission of an over-loaded <a href="../../../m/1/_/M1_Garand_0589.html" title="M1 Garand">M1 Garand</a> inaccuracy, and that's as American as you can get. Would American inaccuracies be more easily picked up? Probably; the series is based on an American combat unit after all.

<dd>You said yourself that you weren't certain over the inaccuracy, and as of current you haven't provided any references to prove it.

<dd>Not to get too involved with this, but it isn't an inaccuracy. The officer in questions was the BRITISH LIASON OFFICER with the 101st and, as such, would be entitled to wear the patch as he was attached to the 101st.

<dd>The colonel in the mini-series is based on the one from Winters referes to but with a difference - the real officer was no where near as arrogant (see Ambrose's account based on his interview with WInters in the BOB book) and the pistol had never been fired. Winters makes the point that the officer was please to turn it over to WInters as one combat soldier to another and made the point that it had never been fired - and that he was pleased with that. Winters was too and stated he still had the pistol but had never fired it either.--<a href="../../../l/e/p/User%7ELepeu1999_5202.html" title="User:Lepeu1999">Lepeu1999</a> 17:07, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
