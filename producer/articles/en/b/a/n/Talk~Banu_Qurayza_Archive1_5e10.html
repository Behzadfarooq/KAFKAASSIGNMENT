<h2><span class="mw-headline">Totally POV</span></h2>
<p>Sentences like "Muhammad's delight in their death" are very POV.

<p><a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> asked me to take a look at this, but it's a topic I know almost nothing about, so my only comments will be process-oriented.</p>
<p>Irishpunktom: Your "actually you won't agree" is totally uncalled for, and approaches the level of an <i>ad hominem</i> attack. I see nothing that Jayjg has done on this article (or, really, any other article) that indicates bad faith. He and I are not particularly similar in our politics, but our subject-matter interests overlap, so I've found myself working with him on a number of articles. He's generally a pretty cooperative editor. Does he tend, when starting articles, to work from sources close to his own views? Yes. Sure. Almost all of us do: we almost all (except maybe <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a>!) spend more time reading authors we tend to agree with than those we don't. Has he occasionally been reluctant to accept certain citations by people he disagrees with? Yes, occasionally, though those have tended to be unusual citations, e.g. self-published eyewitness accounts, which I am more inclined to credit than he is, but where I can certainly see how they at least rub up against <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia's policy against original research</a>.</p>
<p>There is no rule against editors having political views, and no rule against editors having political views different from one's own. There <i>is</i> a rule against bad-faith edits (but I see no evidence of that: if you think that is happening, you might want to raise the issue explicitly, and possibly start an RfC) and there <i>is</i> a rule against personal attacks (and, on that basis, I suggest you tone down your rhetoric).</p>
<p>In any event, when multiple, conflicting, plausible, contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous sources exist for historical events, the conflicting versions should almost always both be mentioned in the article, each with an indication of its source. If there are arguments why one version should be considered more plausible than the other, that should typically be mentioned, too. The article need not—in this case, I suspect, cannot—present a single version of events as Truth, but it can truthfully present what the conflicting sources each say, and what factors might be reasonably weighed in evaluating those sources. (On the other hand, if there is real consensus among historians that one version is considered authoritative, or if it can be shown that only historians of a particular political affiliation hold with one of the views, that should be covered, as well.) -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:00, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments, Jmabel. As a point of reference, I will simply point out that I have made exactly one edit to this page, which was to NPOV a sentence objected to above, and fix some minor format issues:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banu_Qurayza&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=14488082" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banu_Qurayza&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=14488082" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:38, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's Not a Personal Attack, it's a simple statement based on fact. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> has his agenda to push, which he does frequently, and repeatedly refuses to accept sources that dispute this agenda. This is evident from a large amount of edits he has made. It's also evident that he has been stalking <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jayjg/Archive_7" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jayjg/Archive_7" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (Amoung Others), reverting his edits without care for their content. It's also evident that when he is outnumbered in regard to any edit he calls in <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Montag_3a27.html" title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>, etc. Why are these people, of all the thousands of wikipedian editors, asked for? The obvious answer is that they have the same agenda. At least <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Montag_3a27.html" title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a> is honest about it, his user page stating "<i>I am primarily here to represent the nationalist right wing in Israel</i>".</dd>

<li><i>He ordered that the adult male population of the tribe, some 700-900 individuals, be beheaded. Ibn Ishaq describes the massacre as follows</i> - Thats disputed, and is presented ina POV way, indeed the following quote, that of the Hadith of Bukhari tells a significantly different tale <i>I give the judgment that their <b>warriors</b> should be killed and <b>their</b> children and women should be taken as prisoners</i>. Bukhari's version is much similar to that of other similar events during the reign of Muhammad, and Bukhari, as <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> highlights, "<i>is considered by most [Sunni] Muslims to be the most reliable collection of hadith</i>".</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, but the PBS source, one that is favorable to the Muslim side of the story agrees. Add you r information here and maybe we can find a solution.</p>

<dd>I'm not conteding the PBS article, and I'm sure it was written in good Faith, but the Bukhari and Surat disagree, and clearly disagree, and as <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> points out, Bukhari is the Most important source. This article while featuring both passages does not highlight that Bukhari's version is more authorative, that they were written over 100 years later, and that Bukhari tells a different tale. Bukhari's version of Events is the presents a story that is the same as other similar events, where as Ibn Ishaqs story presents a Horrific story of death and mass salughter, similar to stories from the Book of Joshua, out of step with the Majority of the Sirat and Hadiths. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup></dd>

<dd>Bukhari is considered to by Sunnis to be the most reliable source, which is not the same as it being the "most important" source. Shias consider it unreliable, by the way.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More problems with the article</span></h2>
<p>The article makes use of several contradictory sources and seems to only cite from sources certain passages that support the anti-Muslim pro-Banu Qurayza view. First, I think we need to mention the fact that these sources were written by single authors centuries after the event took place. The hadith of Bukhari may very well be respected among hadith-following Muslims, but its accuracy as a historical source needs to be mentioned. This is just one of the first things I see wrong with the article, I will add more later.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:10, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a> brings up a good point. We are relying on two Sources both written Decades after the Event; Ishaq's Sirat which supports the massacre, and the Bukhari hadiths (I've counted six) which do not. Does any primary source exist?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Possible, Alternative, Version</span></h2>
<p><b>Banu Qurayza</b> (<i>Bani Quraiza</i>) were one of several tribes of Jews who lived in Yathrib (now known as <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>) in the <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century.html" title="7th century">7th century</a>. Little is known about them except for what is mentioned in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> works of <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Ishaq_cd6c.html" title="Ibn Ishaq">Ibn Ishaq</a> (<i>Sirat Rasul Allah</i>) and <a href="../../../b/u/k/Bukhari.html" title="Bukhari">Bukhari</a>'s collection of <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadiths</a>. What is known is that they were involved in a conflict with the Muslims of the area following the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Trench_27af.html" title="Battle of the Trench">Battle of the Trench</a> and were subjected to a severe punishment by the victorious Muslims for thier actions.</p>
<p>According to the Bukhari Hadiths, when <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> took control of the city of <a href="../../../y/a/t/Yathrib.html" title="Yathrib">Yathrib</a> two <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> tribes, the Bani Quraiza and the Bani An-Nadir, refused to pay <a href="../../../j/i/z/Jizyah.html" title="Jizyah">jizyah</a> and took up arms against the new ruler, breaching an earlier Peace Treaty. Their rebellion was put down, and the Bani An-Nadir were exiled. The leaders of the Bani Quraiza however agreed to surrender and signed another peace treaty, and again agreed to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Medina_75b9.html" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../6/2/7/627.html" title="627">627</a> an army from <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> led by <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Sufiyan_ibn_Harb_db2e.html" title="Abu Sufiyan ibn Harb">Abu Sufiyan ibn Harb</a> attacked Medina. Sufiyan had approached the Bani Quraiza and requested an alliance against Medina. The Bani Quraiza refused this alliance, but when the Meccan army was combined they could see that it was huge and well organised and capable of defeating Muhammads Medinian army, and agreed to form an alliance, thus breaching their treaty with Muhammad for a second time.</p>
<p>At the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Trench_27af.html" title="Battle of the Trench">Battle of the Trench</a>, it is believed that the plan was that the Bani Quraiza would open their gates, thus allowing Muhammads army to be attacked at the rear. When the Meccan army was close enough members of the Bani Quraiza attacked some of the army of Medina in an attempt to divert some of them from their positions, away from the front, in lieu of the expected Meccan troops. However owing to the series of trenches dug by Muhammads army, the army from Mecca could not enter and the Bani Quraiza were left almost defenseless.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadiths</a> of Musnad Ahmad maintains the leader of the Meccan Army were actually refused entry into Medina by the Bani Quraiza. Several Bukhari Hadiths dispute this, saying that the Muslims were attacked and that they was an Alliance between the two groups.</p>
<p>When the Meccan Army retreated Muhammad turned his armys attention to the Bani Quraiza and laid siege to their fortress, shortly thereafter (less than a month) the Quraiza surrendered unconditionally. Muhammad appointed Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh to become their judge. Sa'ad, now severly injured, had been a former ally of the Quraiza, and had encouraged them to accept the original Peace Treaty with Muhammad. Since then he had converted to Islam, and following the Quraiza's apparent treachery he had a bitter hatred of them. During the Muslim siege of the Quaraiza fortress he is quoted as reciting "<i>O Allah, seeing that you have appointed war between us and them grant me martyrdom and do not let me die until I have seen my desire upon the Bani Quraiza</i>".</p>
<p>The Judgement ordered by Sa'ad is disputed. There are only two sources, that of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah, the other being Several of Bukhari's Hadiths.</p>
<p>Ibn Ishaqs series of events is the most respected internationally. His view of events is that all the Post-Pubescent Men of the Bani Quraiza were taken out, trenches were dug and the men were killed and buired there. A figure of 700 to 900 Men would have been killed in the biggest massacre of Muhammads reign.</p>
<p>The Surat Rasul Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Then they surrendered, and the apostle confined them in Medina in the quarter of d. al-Harith, a woman of B. al-Najjar. Then the apostle went out to the market of Medina and dug trenches in it. Then he sent for them and struck off their heads in those trenches as they were brought out to him in batches. Among them was the enemy of Allah Huyayy b. Akhtab and Ka`b b. Asad their chief. There were 600 or 700 in all, though some put the figure as high as 800 or 900. As they were being taken out in batches to the apostle they asked Ka`b what he thought would be done with them. He replied, 'Will you never understand? Don't you see that the summoner never stops and those who are taken away do not return? By Allah it is death!' This went on until the apostle made an end of them. Huyayy was brought out wearing a flowered robe in which he had made holes about the size of the finger-tips in every part so that it should not be taken from him as spoil, with his hands bound to his neck by a rope. When he saw the apostle he said, 'By God, I do not blame myself for opposing you, but he who forsakes God will be forsaken.' Then he went to the men and said, 'God's command is right. A book and a decree, and massacre have been written against the Sons of Israel.' Then he sat down and his head was struck off.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bhukari Hadiths, usually considered by Muslims to be the most authentic source of the <i>Sunnah</i>, or practices, of Muhammad says that Sa'ad's ruling was somewhat less severe, and that only the "Warriors" were killed. This would still be a high figure, altough only probably half of the figure give in Ibn Ishaqs chronicle.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a> Volume 4, number 280 (4.280) says;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>When the tribe of Bani Quraiza was ready to accept Sad's judgment, Allah's Apostle sent for Sad who was near to him. Sad came, riding a donkey and when he came near, Allah's Apostle said (to the Ansar), "Stand up for your leader." Then Sad came and sat beside Allah's Apostle who said to him. "These people are ready to accept your judgment." Sad said, "I give the judgment that their warriors should be killed and their children and women should be taken as prisoners." The Prophet then remarked, "O Sad! You have judged amongst them with (or similar to) the judgment of the King Allah." )</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bukhari hadiths 5.148, 5.447, 5.448 and 8.278 all give a similar series of events.</p>
<p>Both Bukhari and Ibn Ishaq's recordings of events came over 150 years after the events have taken place, and so neither can be seen as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">Primary source</a>, however, between them they are the only record of the Jewish tribe of Bani Quraiza. What happened to the entire tribe after that is not clear. If Ibn Ishaqs description is to be correct, then the tribe was essentailly wiped out, if Bukhari's version is true, then the tribe would have been expelled when, following that battle, Muhammad expelled all remaining Jews from Medina. While some women and Children were taken slaves it is known that some feld to Mecca. When Muhammad took over the Khaybar he married the Matriarch of the Bani Quraiza, <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safiyya_bint_Huyayy_694a.html" title="Safiyya bint Huyayy">Safiyya bint Huyayy</a> daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, the chief of Jewish tribe Banu Nadir. It is also known that at least some Tribesman survived, for Ibn Ishaq used Jewish members of the tribe as sources for the Surat Rasul Allah.</p>

<p>I've been reading it further, and it is replete with inaccuracies; many sources confirm that it was adult males who were killed, not just warriors. As for what happened to the women, they were simply distributed as spoils, except for one who was also killed; six of the <i>men</i> were not killed. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:09, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Another factual flaw: it selectively quotes one of the hadith Bukhari saying warriors were killed, and implies that others say the same. However, other hadith do not say the same thing; for example, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 362 simply says he killed the men: <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.362" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.362" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:37, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, it does, and you are right it should be added.

<p>This proposed revision couches itself in seemingly neutral terms while totally turning the history on its head. It is in essence an apologetic. The hadiths are nearly unanimous in that all adult males were killed, and the women given as spoils.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, thats not true, because as pointed out, of all the hadiths in Bukhari to mention the Tribe only one uses the braod "men", while the rest say that it was "warriors". As <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> pointed out, Bukhari is the most authoritive source of Hadith in Islam. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup>
<dl>
<dd>To begin with, I didn't point that out; rather, I pointed out that most (Sunni) Muslims consider it the most reliable. Please quote me correctly, and don't impute words to me that I haven't said. Next, Briangotts is right; the Bukhari says both "men" and "warriors"; however, other hadith, such as Sunab abu-Dawud and Shahih Islam are unanimous that it was all men. It seems that the distinction between "men" and "warriors" is a false dichotomy; all males of fighting age fought, and there is no indication that any adult males (aside from those who converted to Islam) were spared. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:00, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe I Phrased that wrong, but thats what I meant. Of all the sources of Sunnah, Most Muslims Consider Bukhari the most authoritive. I don't know of Shahih Islam.. do you mean Sahih Muslim? If you did you would be wrong, because Sahih Muslim only deals with the subject twice, on one occasion saying the "fighters" were killed, the other saying men. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 20:21, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, meant Shahih Muslim. You're right, one of the hadith there says fighters, I didn't notice that.

<p>As a side note, I find the assertion made above that Ibn Ishaq need not be regarded as a reliable source because Malik referred to him as "a liar", "an impostor" and one "who transmits his stories from the Jews" as laughable. Why does receiving information from Jews render one an unreliable source, while other hadiths, based on information received entirely from Muslims, are considered reliable? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> 18:49, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the Jews of this tribe, who Ibn Ishaq was speaking with - peopl who claim had ceased to exist, would almost certainly tell a tale different than that of the Muslims. Of Course Ibn Ishaq was right to get both sides of the story, and that marks him out as being a great Historian for this era, however, as I have stated that does not make it true. Bukhari and Surat tell two differing tales, and NPOV dictates that both should be presented neutrally. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 19:52, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've fixed some incorrect and pov wording, not to mention false information about Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh which resulted from poor translation. I removed most visible objectionable words. I believe that the page is now stylistically npov, although the structure of the article and information may be lacking or in dispute. If anyone finds more incorrect wording or false information, add it to the talk page. I've noticed a tendency to erase partially true information instead of fixing it when it is relevent.</p>

<dd>I would disagree. The Article as it stands is less about the Banu Qurayza and more a POV attack on the Muslim community of Medina. An example, <i>following Muhammad's arrival in Medina and the Muslim takeover of the city, two other Jewish tribes, the Banu al-Nadir and the Banu Qaynuqah, were expelled from Medina. In order to avoid forced expulsion, the Banu Qurayza sheikh Ka'b ibn Asad signed a peace and defence treaty with the Muslim community.</i> - That is only one sides POV. why were these tribes expelled?

<li>In Yahiya Emericks "A Complete Idiots guide to understanding Islam" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1592572723</a>) it is said that those who did not fight the Muslims were spared, but I can find no Hadith to support this, they all say only the Muslims were spared. It still seems more about the Battle of the Trench than about the Banu Qurayza, IMO.

<p>A. was addressed by my subsequent edit. B. The Bible quotes are marginally relevant (and, contra Jayjg, not original research - they're cited by the Islamic Awareness link), but, considering that there's no actual evidence whether the Bible's judgement was a factor in the decision, I don't think they're especially helpful.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Copyediting, Saffiya bint Huyyay</span></h2>
<p>I copyedited the article to make it flow better. I removed one comment, re Saffiya bint Huyyay, as I couldn't find any confirmation that she had married into the Banu Qurayza, which seemed to be implied by the sentences I removed. All the material I found associated her with the Banu al-Nadir. If someone has a source that I missed, please supply it and we'll restore the deleted sentences.</p>
<p>I added one bit, re Sa'd's desire for revenge upon the Banu Qurayza and whether or not Muhammad knew of it. IF the story re the desire for revenge is true, and not just a later embroidery (or IF any of this is true), then either Muhammad know of Sa'd's changed sentiments, or he didn't. If he did, then it seems somewhat cold-hearted of Muhammad to let the Banu Qurayza choose Sa'd as a judge without telling them of Sa'd's change of heart. If Muhammad didn't know, then it could be argued that by letting the Banu Qurayza choose Sa'd, he was intending to show mercy. If Sa'd surprised him by choosing death, Muhammad could have thought that this was the will of God, thwarting his own intentions, and submitted.</p>
<p>I just wanted to put the alternatives out there. I hope this doesn't revive the edit war, which seems mostly to have died down. Please note that I am trying to be fair, not to exculpate Muhammad. I find the whole story disgusting and distressing.</p>
<p>It just struck me ... if the Saudi Arabian government were ever to allow archaeological investigations in Medina, we could dig up the marketplace, see if there were any trenches and bones, and count the bones. Not that I think it will ever be allowed. Hmmm. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:58, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Striver added a link to a website titled "The Jews asked for it", as a reference for a late-19th-century English bio of Muhammad. I deleted the reference as inflammatory, and the Muir quote as a secondary source.

<p>Your edits seem reasonable to me. My main concern with format at this point is that the intruduction is far to long. The introduction should be a sentence or two giving the reader an understanding of what this article will talk about, and then the rest of the information there should be in the main body of the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:41, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I rewrote intro and introduced sections. I also removed the two hadith from the narrative, which was otherwise all Ibn Ishaq. I didn't think they added anything of note. The reference to Guillaume's version of Ibn Ishaq in English should be added, but I'll do it later, when I haven't been up all night. I think this version reads smoothly now.

<dd>On Safiya bint Huyayy: her previous husbands were Kinana ibn al-Rabi'a, and prior to that Sallam ibn Mishkam, who had divorced her. I found a site saying that the latter had been of Banu Qurayza, but apparently it was wrong - other sources agree that both were of Banu an-Nadir. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 20:12, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On that subject, the sources I can find online say that Qurayza was with Aws against Qaynuqa and Nadir, while a book I've been reading says (more plausibly) that Qurayza and Nadir were with Aws against Qaynuqa.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question about Third Jewish Tribe in Medina</span></h2>
<p>I noticed in the Medina article that there were three Jewish tribes in Medina - Banu Qainuka'a, Banu al-Nadhir, and Banu Qurayza. From this article, I take it that both al-Nadhir and Qurayza broke the Constitution of Medina and allied with the Meccans. But what about Banu Qainuka'a? Do the hadiths make any mention of them breaking the treaty?

<p>WTF is this? Is it supposed to be a quote from Ibn Ishaq? If so, the entire thing should be italicized. The next line reads "Ibn Ishaq says" so it appears not to be a quote. If it's not a direct quote from ibn Ishaq it is shamefully unencyclopedic (and morally outrageous) and there is absolutely no place in the article for the outrageous claim that the Banu Qurayza brought their extermination on themselves. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 21:25, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We had huge edit wars over this article, achieved a consensus, and it held for months. An anon arrived to replace summaries with straight quotes from Ibn Ishaq (not marked as quotes, not paragraphed, unreadable), and removed all the comments re the difficulty of interpreting the sources.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Muslim apologetics</span></h2>
<p>Chaerani (did I get the spelling right) again inserted the theory that the Jews were just being treated according to "Jewish law". At least this time he gave a source, a Muslim scholar.</p>
<p>I removed that from the body of the article (I think we should hew close to the sources, and not insert much later apologia) but I'm wondering if we might not add a further section to the article, in which the various Muslim theories and apologia are listed. Chaerani's work would be relevant there.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, the theories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ibn Ishaq is untrustworthy and the claims for massacre are dubious.</li>
<li>The Jews were punished according to Jewish law.</li>
<li>Muhammad can't be blamed, as the killing was ordered by another man.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any others? Perhaps this would take some of the pressure off the article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:26, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi zora! thanks for your response. firstly, i'm a she not a he&#160;;&gt; secondly, I'm OK if the apologetics perspective is removed from Ibn Ishaq's section, let's make that section focused on Ibn Ishaq's sources. However, I think a new separate section focusing and listing the muslim apologetics arguments should be inserted, so that the article presents their point of view too. My addenda can be put there. Moreover, I think it's also important to put on the fact that there is already precedent with regards of treatment of the other two jewish tribe in Medina, where those tribes are exiled rather than beheaded, which implies that Banu Qurayza's case is an isolated case (this does not mean i condone the treatment of Banu Qurayza, i am just trying to be NPOV). I suppose, as you too suggested, this would relief the pressure off the article. thanks! <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaerani_50c7.html" title="User:Chaerani">Meutia Chaerani</a> 01:37, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Constitution of Medina</span></h2>
<p>Irishpunktom, that's a good question. I leafed through the books that I have and find that all of them accept the Constitution as early, but only one author goes into the question of the exact date at any length, and that's Watt. He devotes seven pages in <i>Muhammad at Medina</i> to the document, and comes to the conclusion that all the PARTS of it are early, but that it is very likely a conglomeration of agreements drawn up at different times, starting before Badr and finishing after the Qurayza were killed. Watt also comments in other places that there were likely informal, unwritten treaties in place before anything was written down. He says we don't really know if the Qurayza had concluded an agreement with the Muslims before the massacre, what it might have included, and whether it was written or oral.</p>
<p>I have the text of the Constitution, from Ibn Ishaq, and Ibn Ishaq doesn't say when the supposed treaty was concluded. It just comes early in the account of the time in Medina.</p>
<p>Watt is writting in the 1950s and I'm sure that there must have been some discussion of the Constitution since then, but it would probably be found in journal articles, to which I don't have good access.</p>
<p>This would probably make a good article. Which I would start right now. If Wikipedia weren't eating my life and time and driving me into bankruptcy. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:23, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That quotation is from a section of the Torah that discusses the conduct of war in a specific time and place, namely the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites. It has no relevance to any later period. No rabbi or Jewish scholar would claim that it is part of "Jewish Law" in a meaningful way (i.e. applicable today or in contexts outside of post-Exodus Canaan); therefore it is absurd to say that the Banu Qurayza were judged according to their own law. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 21:07, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, the relevant rules apply to "cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby" - not purported traitors in your own city.</p>
<p>Anyhow, what's the point? That the ancient Jews were, by their own admission, genocidal criminals, then millenia later, so was Muhammad and his followers? I'd have hung them all.</p>
