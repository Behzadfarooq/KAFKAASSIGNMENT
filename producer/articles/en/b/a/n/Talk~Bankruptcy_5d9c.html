<p>I've made some major mods to this page to (what I think will) enhance accuracy for USA filers.</p>
<p>I've also made what could be construed as two a controversial changes. <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Rdsmith4</a> previously excised two links to www.beko.biz which when I last checked, was a link farm registered in Ireland. While it might have had some useful information if one continued clicking through from the referenced page, it felt too much like a commercial link. What will make this even more controversial was that I added an arguably self-serving but information-only link to my own Florida-only Florida Bankruptcy FAQ site.

<p>I've broken this out into a separate section (q: should this be a subsection to BR in the US?) and tried to fill in some of the more egregious changes in the act. The changes go <i>well</i> beyond adding a means test. I'm very comfortable stating that by saying it's merely (or that the most important part of BARF is) a means test is tantamount to expressing a POV.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes the US Trustee is already enforcing a means test on Chapter 7, and therefore the means test aspect is a mere distraction. The devil is in the details, and there's quite a bit of evil in these details. But I'm well into POV myself with this paragraph and I look forward to all of your NPOV edits to this article. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlawiki_4d11.html" title="User:Flawiki">Flawiki</a> 03:28, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>January 22, 2006. I am a Canadian trustee in bankruptcy and the original contributor who added the Canadian bankruptcy information. My objective was to write a concise overview to give people an idea of how Canadian bankruptcy works. I added three external links which I thought would add to the information while not cluttering up the page. The external links were on 1) Bankruptcy exemptions by province and territory 2) Canadian Bankruptcy FAQ 3) Details on Canadian Bankruptcy Reform.</p>
<p>Help me with the etiquette please. Someone removed the Canadian FAQ link (now restored by me). Someone also removed a "generic" description I made of proposals:</p>
<p>Personal proposals A debtor can make a "personal proposal" to his or her creditors, thus avoiding bankruptcy. Personal proposals are for those people who have funds available to make some payments to their creditors. Trustees have the duty to advise a debtor whom they think, has the ability to make a personal proposal. If the debtor does not file a proposal, the trustee will oppose his or her discharge, and recommend that the debtor remain in bankruptcy for a further year, and continue making payment during that time. Eligible debts are erased upon the satisfactory completion of the personal proposal.</p>
<p>A longer description of a consumer proposal (one of two types of proposal an individual can file) was substituted.</p>
<p>The help I need on etiquette is an explanation of what the rules on removing and substituting information are.</p>

<p>I notice that the topic 'Receivership' redirects directly to this page. I do not believe that is a correct redirection, since Receivership does not only apply to bankruptcy. For example, a person who owns a business that needs to be liquidated in order to satisfy a court judgement will find his business sent into receivership. Furthermore, the article doesn't refer to receivership at all. I believe there should be a new distinct topic for receivership that discusses its role in bankruptcies and also other proceedings. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Slaggg (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slaggg_fc3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slaggg">contribs</a>) 5 April 2006 05:36 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Why not create a new article called "Rebuilding Credit?" I'm certain some of the information in the section is useful, but it seems to be geo limited...definitely doesn't work in the US for about half of it. Some of it is quite good through. In that it doesn't do what it says however I've rmd it, inserting the material here for discussion, and would encourage you to create a new article on Rebuilding Credit in (whatever_country_this_is_for).

<p>It is possible for debtors in Canada and America to rebuild credit following the completion of their bankruptcy, if they follow several simple steps.</p>
<p>1. <b>Complete the bankruptcy as soon as possible.</b> If you have never filed for bankruptcy in the past, you are eligible for automatic discharge from bankruptcy in nine months. However, you must complete all of your duties, including monthly reports to the trustee, attending credit counseling sessions, and making all necessary payments. The sooner the bankruptcy is completed, the sooner it will be erased from the credit report.</p>
<p>2. <b>Begin saving money.</b> It is a well known fact that banks loan money to those who do not need money, not to those who desperately require it. You will have to prove that you can handle money if you want to borrow again, and the best way of doing that is to show that you have some savings. Try putting a certain amount of money in a savings account each month. This will allow you to build up a security deposit to be used for future borrowing.</p>
<p>3. <b>Acquire a copy of the credit report.</b> You should contact a credit bureau in your area and get a copy of your credit report. It should then be reviewed for accuracy. If any mistakes are found, such as debts appearing that were included in the bankruptcy, the credit bureau should be informed right away.</p>
<p>4. <b>Get a secured Credit Card.</b> One of the best ways to rebuild credit is with a secured credit card. You can use your savings on one credit card, to get a credit card with a similar credit limit. It will show up on the credit report as a normal credit card, and you can now have a credit card for use when you need it.</p>
<p>5. <b>Start an RRSP.</b> Use your additional savings to put money in an RRSP with a bank or investment advisor. If you contribute $1,000 to an RRSP, the bank will likely lend you another $1,000 to invest in your RRSP. This $2,000 will generate a tax refund at tax time that will almost be enough to pay off your loan. Your credit report will then show a paid off loan, and that looks great on your credit report! You’ll also have $2,000 invested in the RRSP.</p>
<p>6. <b>Continue Saving.</b> Your savings can now be used for down payment on a car or possibly even a house.</p>
<p>Rebuilding credit may take a few years, but by saving money you will eventually have the ability to borrow again.</p>

<p>Why is there so little information on the U.S. Bankrutpcy Reform legislation that was enacted on October 17, 2005 (Arguably the most important piece of bankruptcy legislation passed since 1978)? Have contributors found it too hard to generalize across state lines? Is U.S. banruptcy too geographically limited to merit a robust discussion? Is it too soon for people to fully grasp exactly what the law will mean? It seems like wiki should have some more information on this topic given the large impact it has had on bankruptcy in the United States. If lack of contribution is the problem, please let me know and I will be happy to help.</p>

<p>[<b>The following comments were added by an anonymous user at IP195.70.32.136 on 29 July 2006</b>]: Why there is no paragraph on the dubious philosophy and legality of the bankruptcy idea in the article. This is very basic stuff that must be addressed, since bankruptcy, at least for individual people, does not exist in many countries of the world, due to moral and principial objections.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the institution of bankruptcy violates the santity of private property. What the debitor owes me is mine and the gov't can't strip people of private property without due compensation, as clearly stated in the Constitution. The judge must pay me what I lose when he grants the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Also, bankruptcy is contrary to natural law, in that it violates the basic scientific law of "conservation of energy and matter" (since creditors' money disappears in a bankruptcy proceedings, even though money can be converted to material goods without restriction.) You can buy gold for money and gold is an element which has indestructible energy inside based on E=mc2.</p>
<p>Therefore bankruptcy should not exist and if the debitor ever recovers, he/she/it should pay, if needed under duress, no matter how many years have passed. The creditor should have power under natural law to detain the debitor and force him to return the loss via labour. This was the law with the wise ancient greeks, the first democracy in history. If the father owed money and couldn't pay, the entire family was put to "debt slavery" work, until the loss was recouped.</p>

<li>Well, if you substitute "rationale" for "evilness" he has a point (albeit a badly made one). Books have been written on the rationale for bankruptcy process (instead of just letting individual creditor's duke it our in a race for the assets). That concept probably does deserve a sub-heading. Probably two actually - as the treatment and rationale for bankrtupcy for individuals (fresh start and clean slate) and companies (collective distribution of assets generally produces more than a break-up, and is fairer to the creditors as a whole) is different. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegis_951c.html" title="User:Legis">Legis</a> 13:05, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi - I was wondering what the main differences are between foreclosure and liquidation, which are two insolvency procedures (among others). Can someone explain the main differences and advantages of each? I am having trouble finding a cogent and succint explanation.</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreclosure.html" title="Foreclosure">Foreclosure</a> is a legal process by which a bank/secured creditor can realise on the real property pledged to it by a debtor when there has been a default on the mortgage over the property; you do not need to be insolvent for a foreclosure to occur. <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquidation.html" title="Liquidation">Liquidation</a> is an insolvency process (in some countries) whereby the assets of a debtor are redistributed. Liquidation can also refer to a sale of assets (generally discounted) outside of insolvency. This is not legal advice, and any further discussion depends on the specifics (and probably doesn't belong here anyway!) <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMochajava97_ba8f.html" title="User:Mochajava97">Mochajava97</a> 20:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that his article would benefit from the addition of this simple definition of bankcruptcy at the beginning as taken from the BBC website:</p>
<pre>
  <i> "In most countries there are two tests for bankruptcy: </i>
      •A Company that cannot pay its debts because there is not enough money in the bank. 
      •A company with liabilities (or what it owes) that exceed its assets 
      (such as property,inventory or what it is owed)."
</pre>
<p>This would be advantageous for people just looking for a quick reference. It will also help to point out that there are subtle distinctions that exist with regards to the maening of the term: "bankruptcy" as bankcruptcy law is different in different countries e.t.c. --BusinessMan1 21:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear readers: I can speak only about the United States. The two definitions provided by user BusinessMan1 are, in the United States, essentially the two definitions for <i>insolvency</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The first definition -- roughly the <i>inability to pay one's debts as they become due</i> -- is sometimes called <i>equitable insolvency</i> or "cash flow" insolvency in the U.S.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The second definition for "insolvent" -- roughly <i>a financial position such that the amount of debts exceeds the value of assets, as adjusted for certain transfers</i> -- is <i>statutory insolvency</i>, sometimes called "balance sheet" insolvency. (Note: Although the insolvency test for assets is usually based on fair market value of assets, most balance sheets under U.S. accounting standards value assets based on historical cost rather than at fair market value). Note: The actual statutory definition is longer and more complicated than the summarized version I provided, and is found at <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title_11_of_the_United_States_Code_64a9.html" title="Title 11 of the United States Code">11 U.S.C.</a>&#160;<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/11/101(32).html" class="external text" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/11/101(32).html" rel="nofollow">§&#160;101(32)</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Theoretically, a company or individual could be "equitably insolvent" but not be "statutorily insolvent," or could be statutorily insolvent and yet not be equitably insolvent.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the U.S. at least, the term "bankruptcy" is sometimes used to refer not to the "insolvency" itself, but rather to the state of actually being in a legal proceeding called bankruptcy. Of course, the term is sometimes used just to mean "insolvent" as well.</dd>

<dd>Dear readers: <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> gives many definitions of "insolvency," and here are some examples: "[s]uch a relative condition of a man's assets and liabilities that the former, if all made immediately available, would not be sufficient to discharge the latter" [sounds like statutory insolvency]; or "the condition of a person who is unable to pay his debts as they fall due" [sounds like equitable insolvency]. The dictionary also notes that for purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (in the U.S.), "a person is insolvent who either has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business or cannot pay his debts as they fall due or is insolvent within the meaning of the Federal Bankruptcy Law" (citing UCC section 1-201(23)). <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black%27s_Law_Dictionary_b51d.html" title="Black's Law Dictionary">Black's Law Dictionary</a>, p. 716 (5th ed. 1979).

<p>Dear fellow editors: I believe editor L33th4x0rguy (LH) is correct on that point. In the United States, there is no statutory requirement that you actually be insolvent in order to maintain your bankruptcy case.
