<p>Unfortunately there is a disorder with categories related to human relations. And unfortunaely I am weak in English. For example, it is naural to have a category for various treatments of people ehich the treated people don't like: punishment, persecution, prosecution, ignoring, inflicting pain, etc.. What will it be? misitreatment? maltreatment? However these words bear a flavor of injustice. But I'd like to put just punishments here as well. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 02:54, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see what you're saying, but I still think that using "punishment" means that somebody has to have done something that needs to be punished. And in an article about refugees, it seems to apply that the refugees did something to deserve being forced from their homes. It sounds like you're looking for something like "War crimes" or "Violations of international law". <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">BanyanTree</a> 03:16, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This network of linked terms is a bit of tangle, imo. <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellion.html" title="Rebellion">Rebellion</a> is the umbrella term, but is one of the shortest of the articles, excluding the lists. <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel.html" title="Rebel">Rebel</a> states outright that it is someone who uses armed violence, backs away to include kids peeved at their dad, and ends listing rebel groups from science fiction, all within one page, without linking to Rebellion. A number of articles are well written, such as Freedom fighter and Terrorism, but they define each other in various ways. There is also a lack of 'event - participant pairs' besides <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellion.html" title="Rebellion">Rebellion</a> - <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel.html" title="Rebel">Rebel</a>, so no <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurgency.html" title="Insurgency">Insurgency</a> or <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutineer.html" title="Mutineer">Mutineer</a> (the destination of this last is amusing in this context). (Some of the others are hard to pair and Terrorism has its own network.) The Insurgent article links to <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subversive.html" title="Subversive">Subversive</a>, also amusing, and there is no pair. I am willing to put some time into this and would appreciate help, but beforehand I would really like to hear some thoughts on whether to create the pairs and kick Warren Zevon to a new page, meld the pairs that already exist, ignore Subversive or anything else that strikes you.

<dd>Well, I think <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel.html" title="Rebel">Rebel</a> should be merged into <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellion.html" title="Rebellion">Rebellion</a>, because at the moment Rebellion just gives us Political rebellion, which won't be what the reader is after in every or even most cases, and also because that seems to be accepted practice--we don't have an article called <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">Terrorist</a>, it just redirects to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>. That said, it may be hard to describe rebellion without it becoming a series of dictionary definitions. Perhaps rebellion could be a few summaries of various types of rebellion, with <i>Main article at <a href="../../../e/x/a/Example.html" title="Example">Example</a>.</i> under each header. I think all of the 'individual' articles (<a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurgent.html" title="Insurgent">Insurgent</a>, for example) should go to their event form, although something like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_fighter.html" title="Freedom fighter">Freedom fighter</a> is harder to do that with, given Wikipedia's propensity for the singular. Perhaps Freedom fighter can stay. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant.html" title="Militant">Militant</a> is well written, but the article's title seems to clash with the usual style, however I don't know where else it could go. I guess that's all I've got on the issue. I hope some of it can be of help. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 04:06, Nov 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BanyanTree,</p>
<p>So your talk note on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo_Civil_War_cc6b.html" title="Congo Civil War">Congo Civil War</a> led me to your Housekeeping Zombie article. It seems useful to have such a definition, but unfortunately we should not have encyclopedia articles on invented terms that are used only by ... you. I troubled to do the time tested resort of us all, the google search:</p>
<ul>
<li>wikignome/s: 1592</li>
<li>wikigremlin/s: 149</li>
<li>wikifairy/ies/wikifaery/ies: 238</li>
<li>housekeeping zombie/s: 12</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the latter 3 are of course mirrors or derivatives of the Wikipedia articles themselves.</p>
<p>As a courtesy I wanted to let you know before I listed WikiGremlin, WikiFairy, and Housekeeping Zombie on VFD. Unless you have a great reason to keep them. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 22:02, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>…do you want to be the one to move Congo Civil War? It seems like a significant action given the history of the article and, as someone who is really new, I feel vaguely uneasy about doing it instead of one of the long-time contributors who developed it. Cheers, BanyanTree 17:51, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd like it split, and you're welcome to split it, but the reason I haven't gone ahead and split the article is simply that it seems such a huge endeavour. A lot of the text on the page refers to both wars in the same breath - do we just just copy the text to both pages? Ultimately, I'd like the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_0380.html" title="History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> to be similar to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Sweden_91e9.html" title="History of Sweden">History of Sweden</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Germany_4fd2.html" title="History of Germany">History of Germany</a> etc, with a sidebar which has links to the relevant historical periods (like <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Congo_War_a920.html" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo War</a>, or Second Congo<b>lese</b> War). I'm not one of the significant contributors of the article - my contributions have mainly been copyedits. I think Users SimonP and DJ Clayworth provided the bulk of the article. I've promised to contribute in the Talk page of Congo Civil War, but again it was too daunting. I even read the only book specifically dedicated to the war (<i>The African Stakes in the Congo War</i>) - unfortunately it's mostly unreadable verbiage more concerned more with dry political theory than what actually happened. How can it be - nearly 4 million dead, and not one proper book on the subject?? Compare it to 9/11 (3000 dead) and the countless books which followed. Because most people know very little about the war, the article has to be much clearer than most. Almost like a childrens encyclopedia, with lots of pictures and illustrations. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 19:39, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Congo history box looks great! Also, thanks for correcting my misunderstanding on "references". And here I thought those external link numbers were just eye sores. I do have a question though. The one time I tried to move an article to a page that already existed, I had to have the old page deleted in order to retain the edit history. That's not really an issue for <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Congo_War_2721.html" title="First Congo War">First Congo War</a> as I was planning on just a cut and paste, but do we have to delete the blank <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Congo_War_a920.html" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo War</a> before moving <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo_Civil_War_cc6b.html" title="Congo Civil War">Congo Civil War</a> in order to keep the history? Let me know, and congrats once again on the box. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">BanyanTree</a> 20:14, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the compliment about the box. I'm not sure I've spilt up the periods in the right way. I had to cut a lot of text from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo_Free_State_af10.html" title="Congo Free State">Congo Free State</a> and paste it in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonisation_of_the_Congo_230b.html" title="Colonisation of the Congo">Colonisation of the Congo</a>, which doesn't quite work yet. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo_Free_State_af10.html" title="Congo Free State">Congo Free State</a> really needs a summary of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonisation_of_the_Congo_230b.html" title="Colonisation of the Congo">Colonisation of the Congo</a> on it's page to provide context. And the title <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precolonial_Congo_c6dd.html" title="Precolonial Congo">Precolonial Congo</a> seems to frame the history purely in terms of Congo's subsequent colonisation, if you see what I mean.</dd>
<dd>In my eagerness to get rid of the red links in the History box, I completely forgot about the issue of moving the edit history to <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Congo_War_a920.html" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo War</a>. Personally, it wouldn't bother me if the history goes, though I can understand if all the other contributors felt slighted. So, to play safe, I guess <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Congo_War_a920.html" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo War</a> needs to be deleted. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 21:38, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was wandering through some of "my contributions," and decided to stop by <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mau_Mau_f519.html" title="Mau Mau">Mau Mau</a> to see what had become of it. Thank God someone with some sense came along, tore it down and rebuilt it from the ground up. What a piece of crap it was! I don't have the time to read the improved article in its entirety, but I've seen enough to know it's far more balanced and factual than that claptrap that formerly passed for an article.</p>
<p>KCA, huh? The local, well-heeled, old-line upper class/yuppie-dominated white-bread civic association in my area goes by the same acronym. I found the juxtaposition of that group and the Mau Mau hilariously incongruous.

<p>I guess, you are a little overheated, my dear friend, because of recent ugly real vandalism, which makes me angry, too.</p>
<p>After calming down, I strongly recommend to study the following publication: <a href="http://www.ineter.gob.ni/geofisica/conferencias/ESC2004/Papers%20ESC%202004/SCE-Venkatanathan.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ineter.gob.ni/geofisica/conferencias/ESC2004/Papers%20ESC%202004/SCE-Venkatanathan.pdf" rel="nofollow">PLANETARY CONFIGURATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION</a> by N. Venkatanathan et al.</p>
<p>These Indian researchers of the Madras university <b>have predicted the Indian Ocean Earthquake within only 150 km and 29 minutes error</b> (see numerous references on my <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikinaut_Moon-Earthquake-Theory_0b9e.html" title="User:Wikinaut/Moon-Earthquake-Theory">special page</a> i.a.

<p>Perhaps, after really studying the 8 pages and the other references, you finally understand, why I want to place this on Wikipedia article of Indian Ocean Earthquake: because it <b>was predicted</b> and not everybody knows.</p>

<li>Dear Wiki contributors, admins &amp; sysops. <b>You have been mislead by Curps</b>. Please see that article in question and decide for yourselves if deletion is a correct Wiki thing to do.

The articles in questions is proposed to drill deep in the subject in question. In Asian tsunami : The earthquake I have attempted to focus just on the earthquake that caused the Asian Tsunamis. In <a href="../../../t/i/m/Asian_tsunami_%7E_Time-line_cce4.html" title="Asian tsunami : Time-line">Asian tsunami : Time-line</a> (currently vandalised by Curps), I have drilled down to the exact minutes to minutes account of the waves of deadly tsunamis. I will be added other article in the Asian tsunami series like the humanitarian aspects, current news &amp; occurrences etc. because I think it is the right thing to do. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 06:55, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi BanyanTree, Thank you for your kind understanding &amp; comments. I have listened to your advised &amp; visited <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> ... found out some interesting pointers to share with you.</p>

<p>1) Avoid bias. Articles should be written from a neutral point of view, representing differing views on a subject fairly and sympathetically.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was Curps Neutral when he deleted other points of view, even if they were differing. The term "Asian Tsunami" is an accept term or name for the event that happened on the 26th Dec 2004, covered by news media and the net. Blatantly calling <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> is silly because there have been hundreds of earthquakes very week since 26th Dec 2004 but there is only one deadly tsunami that has been named by the media as the "Asian Tsunami".<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Don't infringe copyrights. Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia licensed under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License. Submitting work which infringes copyrights threatens our objective to build a truly free encyclopedia that anyone can redistribute, and could lead to legal problems. See Wikipedia copyrights for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>No problems here. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>3) Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Its goals go no further. See What Wikipedia is not for more info.</p>
<ul>
<li>An 'encyclopedia' by Wiki definition is "containing articles on topics in many different fields ... specialise in a particular field", by branching Asian Tsunami to its categories covering specialised field &amp; topics is my purpose &amp; goal. In fact, I have come to a point to consider creating a "Asian Tsunami" Wiki project on my own ... care to contribute here&#160;;-) <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>4) Respect other contributors. Wikipedia contributors come from many different countries and cultures, and have widely different views. Treating others with respect is key to collaborating effectively in building an encyclopedia. For some guidelines, see Wikipedia etiquette, Wikipedia:Writers rules of engagement, Wikipedia:Civility, Dispute resolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>I admit I see thing differently, maybe because I am orient-asian, from a land far away ... in this case at the epicentre of the disaster ... I need some respect &amp; space which Curps has failed big time in rendering to me / others. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>5) No personal attacks (and move personal debates to email)</p>
<ul>
<li>I am attacked by Curps ... if this was real-life I would have been murdered by him already&#160;!! ...&#160;;-) <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>6) Please do not bite the newcomers</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only did Curps bite me, he chew the bits he bit-off from me&#160;!! He bit me when I was new, before I had an account, and he is bitting me now too&#160;!! <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi BanyanTree, I hope I didn't surprise you by placing it on FAC&#160;:). I see you're adressing the points raised; just make sure to report it on the request also, I guess the votes turn to support then. I'll look into it also, in a few hours (I'm going to eat with my girlfriend now). Kind regards, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 17:57, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Mark. Your placement wasn't a surprise, but waking up from a night out to see it getting hammered on didn't help my head any. It's always a bit humbling to see something you've worked on go to FAC, isn't it? &#160;;) If you could take a look, in particular, at the comments on language and grammar, it'd be a great help. I have a blindspot for flaws in my own sentences. Cheers, BanyanTree</dd>

<dd>I'll certainly do my best. However, I'm not a native speaker of English so creating <a href="../../../b/r/i/Wikipedia%7EBrilliant_prose_eabf.html" title="Wikipedia:Brilliant prose">brilliant prose</a> is not my strongest point. I think I'll ask some others to help as well.</dd>
<dd>As for the reference thing — I must say I don't particularly like the inline external links; I would like them better if they were like the off-line references. Could be a matter of taste though; I don't know how they think about it at FAC. Don't mind me if you don't agree. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 22:47, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is really shaping up. I had done a photo search before but couldn't find anything, but delved into the government images after the FAC comment and came up with the IDP photos. I'm really not sure about the Kony picture. I am not familiar with all the different types of copyright and so am pretty conservative about image use.</p>
<p>I don't much like the look of in-line references at all and think small super-script endnotes would be preferably. But there's not really a simple way to do that, and I'm not willing to do such a tedious tweak. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">BanyanTree</a> 21:46, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tedious indeed, because you'd have to renumber all thirty manually every time something is added or removed. That's not an option. As for the Kony picture, I'm not sure about it either. You could take a look <a href="../../../b/o/i/Wikipedia%7EBoilerplate_request_for_permission_3446.html" title="Wikipedia:Boilerplate request for permission">here</a> and maybe give it a shot. Or not. Anyway, the article is getting better and better — really cool! BTW, the US Government IDP pictures are a welcome addition. Keep up the good work! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 00:15, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the comments, Banyan! I went to <a href="../../../u/g/a/Uganda.html" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> last summer, so I'm quite interested in the LRA. How long before it gets featured, do you reckon?<br />
