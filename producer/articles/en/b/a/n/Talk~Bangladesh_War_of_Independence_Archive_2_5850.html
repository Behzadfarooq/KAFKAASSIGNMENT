<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genocide versus violence issue</span></h2>
<p>I think it's non-biased to use the word genocide. Violence is too general and can have multiple interpretations. I am reproducing an excerpt that shows that the violence was indeed a planned genocide.</p>
<p><i>London, 6/13/71). The Sunday Times....."The Government's policy for East Bengal was spelled out to me in the Eastern Command headquarters at Dacca. It has three elements:</i><br />
<i>*The Bengalis have proved themselves unreliable and must be ruled by West Pakistanis;</i><br />
<i>*The Bengalis will have to be re-educated along proper Islamic lines. The - Islamization of the masses - this is the official jargon - is intended to eliminate secessionist tendencies and provide a strong religious bond with West Pakistan;</i><br />
<i>*When the Hindus have been eliminated by death and fight, their property will be used as a golden carrot to win over the under privileged Muslim middle-class. This will provide the base for erecting administrative and political structures in the future."</i></p>
<p>PS: Thanks for the ise to ize. I am a little obsessed with British (aka standard) English!&#160;:) <a href="../../../u/r/n/User%7EUrnonav_4b88.html" title="User:Urnonav">Urnonav</a></p>

<dd>This is a difficult issue, and similar to ones that have arisen on other articles. Most people agree genocide was in progress in 1971, but there is nothing that clearly removes all doubt such as a war crimes prosecution. Important, if self interested, players such as Pakistan and the United States strongly disagree with the genocide label. In general the best solution in these cases is to use more general language, but to give a detailed accounting of the facts so that the reader can decide themselves if the more specific label of genocide is applicable. This is also important as there is also dispute over the very meaning of the word genocide and different readers will have their own opinions of what is genocide. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 06:15, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds sensible. I'll try to get some numbers and pictures. Sensible readers should be able to infer from a number like 3 million in 9 months (which is actually worse than the Jewish <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> of WWII!!!) <a href="../../../u/r/n/User%7EUrnonav_4b88.html" title="User:Urnonav">Urnonav</a></dd>

<dd>Doesn't the plan for Islamization of the Bengalis prove that the Pak Army didn't want to exterminate the entire Bengali populace? Of course, there was ingrained hostility toward Hindus (AFAIK it had been this way since Indian independence and partition post-1948) and the 3 million number in 9 months does look genocidal just in terms of scale. But it seems more of a "cultural genocide" than anything, what with the Islamization plan and all, rather than a plan to exterminate the Bengalis. It is my understanding that the mass killings and torture were in the cities (including capital Dhaka) where pro-independence sentiment was strong. Anyone who is read-up on the subject, I'd appreciate your input because I only have basic knowledge of what went on.</dd>

<dd>Of course I might be using a rather strict definition of genocide here, I know that the UN often terms something "genocidal" just in terms of abnormally high numbers from massacres and the like, but I personally think the term is not correctly applied at times, such as in early '80s Guatemala and 1975-79 Democratic Kampuchea. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J.

<dd>I think the issue was more of cultural, rather than Islamization. East Pakistan's 70 million Bengalis were 85% muslim already. True, the Pakistani Army was quite hostile to Hindu Bengalis, and also didn't consider Muslim Bengalis "muslim"-enough. I agree that they didn't want to exterminate "all" Bengalis (with 70 million people!!! even the biggest genocides didn't have that much in target). Also, the cultural factor seems to be the biggest issue in the genocide here. The rate of killings (1 to 3 million in 9 months) is definitely quite high.</dd>

<dd>I just want to clarify here that the killings were not only limited to Dhaka or other major cities, it was extended to almost all of the country (mass graves were unearthed in many places). The Bangladesh Government published a set of documents related to the independence war, but these are not probably online. I do have some book references, even some from Pakistan Army officers (Major <a href="../../../s/i/d/Siddique_Saliq_419d.html" title="Siddique Saliq">Siddique Saliq</a>, PR officer of Pakistan Army in Dhaka). I'll look up the appropriate references on the killings outside Dhaka. Anyway, Thanks for your comment. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 04:30, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well didn't "genocide" only come into common usage post-WWII, and that was when Hitler had, in fact, tried to exterminate the entire Jewish populace in Germany and occupied Europe. But in subsequent conflicts such a strict definition hasn't been attached to the term, so I'm unsure where it should be applied.</dd>
<dd>BTW thanks for referencing the number of people within Bangladesh, I knew it was densely populated like the rest of the subcontinent but I didn't know specific numbers. Another question I have about the conflict, is how much of it was fighting, and how much of it was wanton brutality against Bengali civilians from the Pak Army. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J.

<dd>Well, I can't quote figures off hand, but the Mukti Bahini guerrillas numbered around 100,000 , so the majority of the dead must be the civilians. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Styx/7297/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Styx/7297/" rel="nofollow">This website</a> has some graphic images from the time, some of the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Styx/7297/inda4.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Styx/7297/inda4.htm" rel="nofollow">killings in Dhaka and around the country</a>.

<dd>Like Ragib said, many of the brutalities included civilians. The <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamoodur_Rahman_fc5b.html" title="Hamoodur Rahman">Hamoodur Rahman</a> commision report compiled after the war by the Pakistanis revealed several brutalities like rape, torture, killings even by the officers of the Pakistan Army. However the "several" fails to give us an exact detail or the official number. It is assumed that the term genocide was used liberally to include the refugees who left the nation during the crisis as I believe the figures of 1 million is more or less to be accurate.</dd>

<p>I want to add more to discuss 'genocide' here. Is what happened an incident of genocide. The George Washington University National Security Archives has some interesting declassified documents in this regard.<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 17:32, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the mention of genocide in this article needs to be reviewed. At the moment it uses <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel words</a> to put across the idea with sentences like: " <i>In Bangladesh, and elsewhere, the Pakistani actions are referred to as genocide.</i>" and "<i>On the other hand, though the figure of 3 million is without clear proof, many believe that the real number is still exceedingly high (more than 1 million) and the killing can clearly be termed a genocide.</i> "
<dl>
<dd>As the article "weasel word" makes clear: Who are the people who say ..., who are the people who knew the truth and who ought to have spoken up, and when are the times when it is difficult to do something about something? What has been decided by whom? The sentences should be rewritten to answer the questions in the "weasel word" article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>a sentence in the article states that "<i>Among them, the infamous Blood telegram from the US embassy in Dacca, East Pakistan, stated the horrors of genocide taking place in East Pakistan</i>" The reference describe the unlawful killing of many political and other opponents of the Government but the source does not claim that the actions are a genocide.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If no one has been found guilty of the crime of genocide from atrocities carried out during this war then the word must be qualified with <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Wikipedia: reliable sources</a> which claim that it was a genocide (and preferably others which refute this).

<li>8 It is well established that where a conviction for genocide relies on the intent to destroy a protected group "in part," the part must be a substantial part of that group.

<li>10 This interpretation is supported by scholarly opinion. The early commentators on the Genocide Convention emphasized that the term "in part" contains a substantiality requirement. Raphael Lemkin, a prominent international criminal lawyer who coined the term "genocide" and was instrumental in the drafting of the Genocide Convention, addressed the issue during the 1950 debate in the United States Senate on the ratification of the Convention. Lemkin explained that "the destruction in part must be of a substantial nature so as to affect the entirety."[16] He further suggested that the Senate clarify, in a statement of understanding to accompany the ratification, that "the Convention applies only to actions undertaken on a mass scale."[17] Another noted early commentator, Nehemiah Robinson, echoed this view, explaining that a perpetrator of genocide must possess the intent to destroy a substantial number of individuals constituting the targeted group.[18] In discussing this requirement, Robinson stressed, as did Lemkin, that "the act must be directed toward the destruction of a group," this formulation being the aim of the Convention.</li>

How do I know it is not a genocide because the Appeals Chamber above says so. To explain how the Srebrenica massacre was a genocide, it said that one had to look at the total available population available to the perpetrators of the genocide. That it was only a genocide because not all of the 1.5 million Bosnian Muslims were accessible to the Bosnian Serb Army "<i>From the perspective of the Bosnian Serb forces alleged to have had genocidal intent in this case, the Muslims of Srebrenica were the only part of the Bosnian Muslim group within their area of control.</i>". Because of the nature of the society killing the men had an impact on 40,0000 Bosnians which as it happens makes up about 2% of the total Bosnian Muslim population. Therefore 2% is not under international law a "substantial part of the targeted group".

<p>This discussion is unnecessary. The point is that *many* scholars in and beyond Bangladesh believe that genocide has been committed in Bangladesh, and wikipedia has a responsbility to report that. The article can do with more citations, but the claim is NOT that genocide has been committed, but that there is widespread conviction that it has been committed. It is funny that one needs to look up definitions and such to report that. --<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 19:41, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just for example. Again, our job in wikipedia is not to *prove* genocide or otherwise, but to report that it is a widespread belief among many scholars that genocide has occurred. Let's not be the judge, but the reporters. This is independent of the citation situation, that must be improved. But again, we don't need to check any definitions of genocide (clearly widely debalted), to report a widespread claim.--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 20:00, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If *that* is your contention, then I can't agree more. If you are saying that we lack citations, lets find them. However, we should figure out what do u do if have 5000 professors making a claim (on either side)? This is not an issue where 5 academics have ever written things, again, on either sides. We might put in 10 citations, but by no means that means that 10 people have claimed that there was genocide, or otherwise. Though we should add many more citations, giving the impression that only 10 source claim the occurrence of a genocide (or not) is simply *wrong*. I don't know if you are aware of the sheer volume of work on this subject, not readily quotable as they are often in non-english languages.</dd>

<dd>Certain genocides are genocides by a process of international law and as such are not open to differing POVs. For example one can say that an international tribunal has found that the Srebrenica massacre was a genocide. No such statement can be made about this alleged genocide. The best one can do is state that so &amp; so thinks it was a genocide and why they think it was a genocide. There is no need to stack up references, one only needs the most suitable ones. For a start any neutral organisation is preferable to a party to the conflict. Something like the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html#Netherlands" title="Genocide">Genocide#Netherlands</a> court case for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frans_van_Anraat_7ed2.html" title="Frans van Anraat">Frans van Anraat</a> for supplying chemicals to Iraq, is preferable to an academic paper peer-reviewed paper, which in turn is preferable to an NGO web-site, because NGOs often have their own POV to push.</dd>

<dd>Also IMHO any opinion that does not take into account the recent judgements by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_Former_Yugoslavia_9b11.html" title="International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_Rwanda_21f3.html" title="International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> on genocide, is of less use than those which do take account of these judgements, because the judgements help to clarify what under international law is a genocide.

<dd>Let's say an international tribunal finds that genocide occurred in Bangladesh. Do we say on wikipedia that "Genocide happenned in Bangladesh"? NO. That is *still* POV. We must report *who* is is making that claim, and it is up to the reader to believe it or not. The FACT that the current version of the entry is trying to report (perhaphs less than perfectly) is that there is widespread belief that genocide has taken place. Nothing more or less. I don't see why we must endorse the view that something decided by an international tribunal is of more value. I don't know how many examples I need to give. Zahir Raihan made a documentary called "Stop Genocide" in 1971. Does that prove genocide? Is it as reliable as an international tribunal set up in 3000AD? these are up to the reader!</dd>

<p>The reference I put higher up this page (prosecutor v. Radislav Krstic - Appeals Chamber) is the appeal judgement of case the BBC is referring to it explains in detail why killing just 8,000 men could be a genocide. It has to do (amoung other things) with access of the perpetrator to the victim population (think of it as fox in a hen house. If there are 10 houses and the fox only has access to one, if the fox kills all the hens in the first house, then it can be credibly argued that the fox had "intent to destroy" all the hens if it could have gained access to them).</p>
<p>It is not that the definition has been overridden since 1948 but the recent genocide tribunals, the first since the coming into force of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide_2f25.html" title="Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide">CPPCG</a>, have had to interpret the meaning of the treaty in a court of law. This mean for example defining what "intent to destroy" and "in part" mean for a court trying someone for genocide. With each case, whether the defendant is found guilty or innocent, the legal meaning of the term becomes refined and clearer.</p>
<p>I would agree with your first statement, the format should be it that the XYZ international tribunal found Mr Mass-murderer guilty of genocide in Bangladesh. However you summation of my opinion shows that you misunderstood what I wrote. I am sorry that I did not make myself clear. To reiterate: opinions that do not take into account the recent UN sanctioned tribunals' judgements are of less use than those which do, because the judgements help to clarify what under international law is a genocide.</p>
<p>A person who says "I could murder a beer", does not usually mean that one can literaly murder a beer, it is a figure of speech. Often people use terms like "war crime" and "genocide" as figures of speech. Meaning they think which was done was morally reprehensible. This does not mean that they think the act was literaly and legaly the phrase they have used. As the topic is contriversial a mention on this page that "there is widespread belief that genocide has taken place" needs a source stating this, and it needs to be worded in such a way that it is clear who is stating this. The source needs to be "publish material that is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> with reference to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable, published sources</a>". --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 20:36, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One thing seems clear. No number by itself proves or rules out the possibility of a genocide, as the BBC news clearly shows.

<dd>In my opinion the numbers do matter. As the Government had access to the whole population even if they killed 3,000,000, (and from a quote in the article that was the target number even if that many were not killed) that would not be a genocide because "in part" was not substantial.

<dd>My point was that as both 3Mil and 26thou are "insubstantial" (I don't know, but I'll assume that's the case), proof of genocide depends on other factors and neither number strengthens or weakens such claims.

<p>Philip, I don't know how familiar you are with the various mass killings that took place during the liberation war. That you contest the use of the word "genocide" in this context is reprehensible. Here is what constitutes genocide according to the UN:</p>
<ol>
<li>United Nations Genocide Convention (in force 12 January 1951)</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 2: In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:</p>
<pre>
     (a) Killing members of the group;
     (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
     (c) Deliberately infliciting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
     (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
     (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. 
</pre>
<p>As for your "1.5 million isn't a significant number" statement, remember that the Pakistanis never voluntarily ceased the killing. The killing of Bengalis was only stopped by the millitary intervention of the Mukhti Bahini and the Indian military. There is ample evidence that shows the Pakistani massacres were aimed at the general populous with the intent to 'destroy' the 'in whole and in part'. You can see this when you note the targeting of the intellectuals and of university students (I take it you know of the cases where the Pakistanis locked in female students in their dormitories and then burned the whole building down with them inside?). As for the use of the term "genocide" by US diplomats in the region, see here: <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/BEBB3.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/BEBB3.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> . The word is used frequently in the documents collected by the National Security Archives, you'd have found quite a few incidences if you'd look with some sincerity. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 20:10, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Did you read what I have written above? I thought I made it fairly plain that I am familiar with the text of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">CPPCG</a>. Please read what I wrote above, particularly "<i>Killing 1.5 million is mass murder and most probably a crime against humanity ...</i>".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The current text says <i>According to the journalist Robert Payne on February 22, 1971 Yahya Khan told a group of generals, "Kill three million of them, and the rest will eat out of our hands"</i>. This would suggest that although brutal the intention was "only" to kill 3 million. 3 million out of the total available population would probably not fulfil the genocide requirement of the substantiality requirement of the phrase "in part" (see above for a more details).</dd>

<dd>See my comment above on the Soviet Union and the targeting of social economic groups. That some US diplomats used the term Genocide, is I think undisputed, and if you wish to include it in the text then providing it is properly sourced I have no objections to that, providing it is balanced with Nixon rejecting that assertion so that the text has a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</dd>

<dd>Changing a heading from Atrocities to Genocide is inaccurate, all Genocides are atrocities, but not all atrocities are genocides. The section covers more than the alleged genocide. Further as the term genocide is not near universally accepted for the behaviour of Pakistani forces, it is a non NPOV statement. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a></dd>

<p>I've read your comments, and they don't hold water. To know more about what constitutes genocide, check this out: <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/genocide/officialtext.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.preventgenocide.org/genocide/officialtext.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. In layman terms, what constitutes a genocide is the intent to destroy ALL OR <b>PART</b> of a people. Genocide has nothing to do with attempting to make a people of a group extinct, and therefore the fact that 3 out of 75 or so million people were actually killed is not a determinant of whether or not the term is applicable. The targeting of a population of a particular ethnicity or race or religion simply because that population is of that ethnicity or race or religion is enough to meet that requirement. Personally, I don't believe the UN definition should be adhered to anyway. The UN poorly funded organization when considering the magnitudes of the tasks it's burdened with; and as such the UN tends to adopt stringent definitions of such events simply to avoid having to do something about the event, and thus put more pressure on its challenged bodies..As such, the UN definition of genocide is not NPOV at all. Within Bangladesh, the term genocide is precisely the term used by all intellectuals. It's been used by NGOs as well as outside publications as well. Since we cannot agree on calling the atrocity 'genocide', my suggestion is a section titled "Genocide" that documents all the various publications and personalities that have used the term 'genocide' to describe this 'atrocity'. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 05:40, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please see the Appeals Chamber explanation of genocide rather than a pressure groups interprtation of what the tribunals say is genocide: <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICTY/2004/7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICTY/2004/7.html" rel="nofollow">Prosecutor v. Radislav Krstic - Appeals Chamber - Judgment - IT-98-33 (2004) ICTY 7 (19 April 2004)</a>. It explains how the tribunal interprets the words "in part" in the CPPCG.</dd>
<dd>You are of course entitled to your opinion about international law and whether the term genocide as interpreted by international tribunals is a non NPOV. But in the future if anyone is tried for genocide it will be using the definitions which have come out of the two international tribunals trying people for genocide not on what you (or anyone else) thinks is a better definition of genocide. The only serious debate on the issue is if the local courts can not try a genocide case, that they will be tried by an adhoc international tribunal (as the US wants) or by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Criminal_Court_154c.html" title="International Criminal Court">ICC</a>.</dd>
<dd>When placing claims in this article about an alleged genocide, because it is not at all clear that the actions of the Pakistani government met the legal definition of genocide, any claims should be worded shuch that it reflects a NPOV, and backed up with "publish material that is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> with reference to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable, published sources</a>". For example in the last couple of days I have expanded the Rummel entry to include a quote from him that it was a genocide. Ideally this should be balanced with another POV criticising his assertions. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 10:13, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The US Library of Congress talks in detail about this war under "liberation war" which was one of the sources used. The Russians obviously call it something like that as an ally of India then. Though officially Pak calls it as civil war - a nomenclature justification included in the article - it is NOT the way how the majority remember this war. The word "liberation war" is used in many media and historical accounts from Pakistan as well as since then. The UN refers to this as liberation war so I don't see any POV issue for an official name. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 05:05, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please could you direct me to the Library of Congress source because I could not find it with a quick search of the article. I had missed out a Google search of ["Bangladesh War" -wikipedia] above so I have added it, and it is 3 times a common as "Bangladesh Liberation War" but because it could refer to more than one one (not sure which other one) was the reason I added 1971 for a secondary search. Doing a seach of gov.uk only returns one page, a search of ac.uk does not return many pages, but it does return more with the name "Bangladesh War". It is a similar case with the domain ".edu":</p>
<ul>
<li>about 49 English pages from ac.uk for "Bangladesh War"</li>
<li>about 219 English pages for "Bangladesh War" site:.edu</li>
<li>about 14 English pages from ac.uk for "Bangladesh Liberation War" site:.ac.uk</li>
<li>about 44 English pages for "Bangladesh Liberation War" site:.edu</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing a search of the Amazon.com site on books returns nearly twice as many book titles "Bangladesh War" as "Bangladesh liberation War" (76 to 41). Can you show me any more UN page which calls it the "Bangladesh Liberation War" because when I google for the phrase including (site:un.org) I get:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 English pages from un.org for "Bangladesh Liberation War"</li>
<li>1 English pages from un.org for "Bangladesh War"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>4 English pages from unhcr.org for "Bangladesh War"</li>
<li>"Bangladesh Liberation War" site:unhcr. - did not match any documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seem to me that by any seach I do over a number of different criteria that "Bangladesh War" is more common than "Bangladesh liberation War" and IMHO "Bangladesh War" carries less POV than "Bangladesh Liberation War". I would be interested to hear any arguments that the title "Bangladesh Liberation War" does not carry more POV than "Bangladesh War" --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:59, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Both Amazon and Google are sites that use English in their searches. The west is particularly advanced when it comes to using the internet to create pages or discuss things. Amazon is obviously dominated by goods and books retailed in the Western countries. Therefore the results you get back disproportionately represent the opinion of the West. Most westerners have little or no knowlege of the event, save the famine that followed in 1975, so it makes sense that they'd defer to the most simplistic title for the event, namely the "Bangladesh War". To use popular search engines and shop sites like Amazon to determine the title of the article is rather unencyclopedic.</p>
<p>Bit of an off-topic...Is it POV to called what happened to Jews during WW2 a holocaust? POV doesn't mean we presume all sides equal at the cost of accurately depicting history. A neutral eye over what happened in East Pakistan prior to and leading to the war, and all that's happened since pretty much supports the phrase "War of Independence" or "War of Liberation", even from a neutral perspective. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 17:32, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>IMHO "BD Liberation War" isn't POV at all. It is simply more informative, and I don't see why it is POV or supportive of any side. Someone might opine that Independence of Bangladesh was an awful thing, but it has nothing to do with the FACT that that was the goal of the war!

<dd>Bangladesh Liberation War is not a soapbox nor a lecture pulpit for anyone. It was an atrocity commited by a government against its own people. Bengalis were as much Pakistanis as the pakistanis for west pakistan. Anyway, the 90,000 number has been referenced in a lot of sources. Instead of handwaving, if you provide some solid proof, that would work better. Civilian Pakistani administrators count as 40,000!!! Wow, isn't that stretching facts too much?

<p>"East Pakistanis noticed that whenever <b>one of them</b>, such as Khawaja Nazimuddin, Muhammad Ali Bogra, or Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy were elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, they were swiftly deposed by the largely West Pakistani establishment." Quoted from the article.</p>
<p>I do not know how far the above mentioned "heroes" can be called <b>one of them</b>(Bangladesh's own). 202.52.205.130 23:26, 16 April 2006 (UTC) Raqta</p>

<p>On 27th January, 1952, Khaja Najimuddin betrayed his commitment and again declared Urdu as the only State Language.</p>
<p>Hmmm does not sound like he is one of Bengal's own. 202.52.205.130 23:26, 16 April 2006 (UTC) Raqta</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">note</span></h4>
<p>In 1954 the United Front of Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani, A. K. Fazlul Huq and Hussein Shuhrwardi won the elections. Huq became the Prime Minister. In 1957 Shuhwrardi was the Prime Minister (instead of Bhashani who was the main popular force in the grand electoral victory of '54.)</p>
<p>Bhashani wanted total autonomy for East Bengal (Bangladesh) at the historic Kagmari conference, '57, but Prime Minister Shuhrwardi and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman went the opposite way thus forcing Bhashani out of the party he created -- The Awami League. (This paved the way for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to come to the centre of Bengali politics later in the 60s.) This event shows the betrayal of East Bengal by (at least) Shuhrwardi (even if we let Mujib off the hook since he was not the Prime Minister).</p>
<p>So IS Shuhrwardi really one of Bengal's own...</p>

<p>"He urged "his people" to turn every house into a fort of resistance. He closed his speech saying, "The struggle this time is for our freedom. The struggle this time is for our independence." This speech is considered the main event that inspired the nation to fight for their independence." Quoted from the article.</p>
<p><b>A.</b> This speech is considered the main event inspiring the nation to fight by Awami League adherents and may be, the Communist Party of Bangladesh adherents which at that time was allied to Awami League. I do not consider any one event as the main event that inspired the nation. The notion is rather simplistic. There were people who wanted to fight for independence as early as 1962... (Taherer Osomapto Biplob) and yes they were organised. There was an army called the BLF (Shahjahan Siraj) and there were other Maoist guerrilla armies that were preparing for a Pakistani onslaught well before the speech. The students were also far ahead of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.(Swadhinota Juddhe Bamponthider Bhumika) 202.52.205.130 23:26, 16 April 2006 (UTC) Raqta</p>
<p><b>B.</b> "his people" Quoted from the article.</p>
<p>Not all in the 7th March rally or the country were "his people". As Fakir Alamgir said on Trityo Matra, on Channel I, he and his allies (the leftists) had brought the masses to the rally... and had made it the mammoth rally that it was. I have spoken to non Mujib supporters who had attended the rally. The picture that Awami League wants to portray is that all the work was done by their Great LEADER Mujib and the article seems to speak for Awami League here.

<p>Well actually they were small only according to Awami League and pro Awami League sources. According to Col. Osmani own statements, he commanded only about 80 thousand muktis (men)... (From Osmani's interview) I do not remember the exact figure, but Siraj Sikdar's force (a Maoist style paramilitary as you call it) was larger (please verify). (Refer to, "Role of the Leftists in the Liberation War of Bangladesh) There were other such forces around the country.

<p><b>Conclusion (sort of)</b></p>
<p>Awami League accuses the BNP of manipulating history and itself is probably guilty of the same crime. Please write a balanced history without exaggerations or deletions AND without misinformation. Verify everything... If I am wrong, I will accept correction... if you are wrong... Please make necessary corrections.</p>
<p>The history in this article does not mention Maulana Bhashani, the creator of Awami League and the person who has pushed the country towards independence. The article does not talk about Sirajul Alam Khan, Siraj Shikdar, Huq, Toaha, Rashed Khan Menon, Colonel Taher, Belal Mohammad, Abul Bashar, Shahjahan Siraj, Abdur Rab, Makhan, Siddiqui, Abdul Matin (the main Language Movement leader) and others. I do not care what party they belong to or support but their roles are undeniable and must be mentioned.</p>
<p>Many of these leaders are alive ... why not interview them.... interview the closest associates of those who have died. Get a thorough picture of the war.</p>
<p>Also refer to Col. Osmani's interviews and you will find out many things. For one Osmani claims that he was not told that the Pakistanis were surrendering (refering to the 16th December). He says it was a deliberate act and he was distracted and kept out of the way by an Indian officer. <b>There was also an attempt on his life ON THE 16th OF DECEMBER, 1971.</b> (Also from his interview.) 202.52.205.130 23:26, 16 April 2006 (UTC) Raqta</p>

<p>The section on casualties as written now seems to indicate that the number 300,000 is more accurate than 3 million. The truth probably lies somewhere in between, but way too much is written in favour of the 300,000 figure included a vast number of so-called scholarly citations. Am I the only one who feels that the article seems to conclude that 300,000 is the actual figure instead of doing its (the article's) job of illucidating that it is just one more estimate - one provided by the accused? I personally would want to go ahead and rewrite some of this to make it more balanced, but I would like to hear others' comments.

<dd>Hannan's claims are controversial, and so is attempts to say Zia declared the message on the 26th. My parents were in Chittagong the whole time, and almost no one heard Hannan's broadcast, but almost everyone heard Zia's, but on the 27th. References are available either way.

The plan was to attack India on two sides with the help of China and thus stopping the attack on West Pakistan. Kissinger's meeting with the Chinese was with this intention. In fact, China was the only permanent member of the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_Security_Council_53d3.html" title="UN Security Council">UN Security Council</a> that was supportive of such an attack, and even provided economic and military assistance. But the support was limited to protecting West Pakistan in the face of a threat from India, and not aimed directly at the internal conflict. It was also suspicious that the U.S. did not want to dirty its hands. The Chinese government wanted a strongly worded UN Security Council resolution after which the PRC would help Pakistan. It however did not materialise due to the Soviet veto and China did not intervene in the war. <b>This entire section is POV, factually incorrect and uncited.</b></li>

Also please take some time to read UN resolutions of 1971 and you will find that Soviets did veto the proposal for a ceasefire. There are also lots of information on the internet and if u prefer researching it offline, then again you'll find sources that clearly tell u that point 4 raised by u is also not entirely true.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yayha Khan quote</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>I removed the Yayha Khan quote again: the point is not the veracity of it, which seems in little doubt, but its appropriateness in a section on casualties. According it such status in this section, in an effort to align it with the 3 million dead figure is an apparent attempt to create both cause and effect and give justification to the latter - he said kill 3 million so they did, which is of course preposterous as war does not work that way. I actully think that the article would benefit from being expanded with a specific section on genocide, in which such issues could be teased out aside from the casualty figures. That way the first half of Rummel's quote could be moved to there as well, leaving the section on casualty figures to deal with just that, and another section to discuss their origin. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECripipper_0070.html" title="User:Cripipper">Cripipper</a> 18:45, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>The current text says According to the journalist Robert Payne on February 22, 1971 Yahya Khan told a group of generals, "Kill three million of them, and the rest will eat out of our hands". This would suggest that although brutal the intention was "only" to kill 3 million. 3 million out of the total available population would probably not fulfil the genocide requirement of the substantiality requirement of the phrase "in part" (see above for a more details).</i></dd>

<li>Alas I dissent. I fail to see the connection. The quote is out of place and in appropriate, unless the section is expanded to explain why it is relevant. As it stands it is out of place and adds nothing to the paragraph; if you wish to expand the quote to give it context and relevance, that would be fine, but as it currently stands it appears to me that it was inserted by someone (?) to make a point about whether it was genocide or not, and the contextual qualifications have subsequently been lost. By all means turn the quote into something useful; at the moment, however, it is completely out of context and actually detracts from the sense of the section, rather than adding anything to it. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECripipper_0070.html" title="User:Cripipper">Cripipper</a> 22:34, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The quote is definitely relevant. This provides insight into the mindset of the Generals who pressed on with the bloody war. Yahya wasn't just another guy, he was the head of the military junta that planned the whole operation, and continued the 9 month long war despite huge number of civilian deaths. So, the quote must stay, as Philip mentioned above. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 07:08, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is certainly a place for the quote, just not in the section on casualty figures, which should deal just with casualty figures. Your rationale for keeping it is is different from that of Mr. Shearer, who appears to want to keep it to prove that it was not genocide. The section on casualty figures is not the place to demonstrate "the mindset of the Generals who pressed on with the bloody war..." In its current positioning it reeks of very sloppy history. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECripipper_0070.html" title="User:Cripipper">Cripipper</a> 15:15, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>What ever our motives, two people have requested that you do not remove the quote. It does not seem that you have a consensus to do so, ao unless you can persuade us that your view is the correct one and it should be deleted, please do not delete it again.</p>
<p>If you wish to move it to another place in the article lets talk about it here, before it is moved. Personally I think it is just fine at the end of the paragraph where it sits. One inference that a reader might draw is that as the quote was well known at the time, that his opponents used the 3M number against him. This is one possibility for how the 3M number became common currency in Bangladesh. Or it might be that they kept to the plan and really did kill 3M. Either way putting the quote there gives the reader some information which if we delete it they will not have. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 18:22, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well-written history should not leave the reader to infer anything. Was it well known at the time? If so then state this fact and state that it could be a reason why the three million fact gained currency. The idea that there was a plan with amry units keeping tally charts to fill their quota of three million is ridiculous. At the moment there is no visible justification to a lay reader why that quote belongs in that paragraph. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECripipper_0070.html" title="User:Cripipper">Cripipper</a> 00:37, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mujib and 3 million</span></h2>
<p>The two sources that are given in this for Mujib repeatedly using the three million figure are not acceptable sources. They are unsourced and uncited repetitions of second-hand information. These are not verifiable sources and are in breach of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. They are not acceptable sources. The problem with much of this article, and which I addressed in the foreign intervention sections in which I have a certain degree of expertise, is that most of this article has been written by people primarily trawling google for info and citing anything they can find to back up their argument. Very few of these conform to the standards of verifiability for Wikipedia, which requests that "Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. For academic subjects, the sources should preferably be peer-reviewed." Badly-written and poorly cited history articles in wikipedia are one of its weakspots and damage its credibility; the content of the individual articles outside of my expertise (except for howlers and general bad-writing) is not my issue. However, I fully intend to flag up weak citations or no citations at all, and unfortunately this article is full of them. I have left the weak ones (newspapers etc, but you really should start getting out some academic works on this as reference: <b>there is only one single peer-reviewed academic work or publication referenced in this entire article</b>), but fully intend to remove non-credible ones, such as Mr. Hossain's website and correspondance with the GBWR.<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECripipper_0070.html" title="User:Cripipper">Cripipper</a> 00:49, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Economic exploitation</span></h2>
<p>I've just read both the article and this talk page from beginning to end. First off, Crippiper has a valid point. This article is a little too stridently pro-Bengali for NPOV. However, Crippiper is going way too far in just trying to censor the parts he doesn't like. This is the first time I have heard that you can't <b>cite</b> original research. I was always told that when you write a report you look for first hand sources. Sumbuddy should go through this and make it a bit more neutral. However, when something is non-neutral but true, I don't waste my time working on it.</p>
<p>I only see one thing that's false or grossly distorted: Economic exploitation. One of the big problems with partitioning British India was the inequality of economic development. West Pakistan included some of the richest areas, while East Bengal was very poor, with very poor infrastructure especially after separating it from Calcutta. The figures say that 46.4% of the national budget went to EP in the early 1950s. I cannot believe that EP was paying anywhere near 46.4% of the taxes. (If they were, this article would cite the unfair tax rates.) I am sure that 46.4% was a <b>subsidy</b> not exploitation. Even 31.7% in the late 1950s might still be a subsidy. I could see EP being only 25% of the total GDP. Even if the late 1950s was truly exploitation, those numbers over 40% look like subsidy again. A rich man failing to give money to a beggar is not theft, and the rich province failing to subsidize the poor province is not exploitation.</p>
<p>If I am wrong, come up with a cite to prove me wrong. Otherwise, that section should be removed or recast to show the actual economic situation. It's likely that people perceived this as exploitation. Separatist leaders in Quebec and Slovakia have appealed to similar misperception. It's possible that both East and West Pakistan suffered economically from union. WP was dragged down by subsidizing EP, while EP wasn't getting foreign aid that it could have gotten as an independent country. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarticus88_0fa5.html" title="User:Barticus88">-- Randall Bart &lt;wiki@randallbart.com&gt;</a> 07:22, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your message. Actually, East Pakistan started earning huge foreign exchange right from the early 1950s. The reason? <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> broke out and it caused a huge demand in Jute-fiber bags, and the Jute mills saw a huge surge in demand. Therefore, the economic data is reasonable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Crippiper's comments, I didn't have time to reply to him but you are exactly right. Wikipedia's No original research principle is there to prevent WP from becoming the primary source of a fact. But, here, the original, primary sources are the Declassified US Govt documents, from a neutral source (George Washington Univ), and citing them as the source for information taken off those documents is perfectly OK. Otherwise, there would be NO research in the world at all ... :) --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 07:33, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>During 1950-1970, East Pakistan earned 50-70% of Pakistan's export earnings. However, it received only 25-30% of the imports.</li>
<li>55% of the population of Pakistan lived in EAst Pakistan, but only 16% of the civil service, and 10% of the military were from East Pakistan.</li>

<dd>West Pakistan's development in the 1950-1970 perdiod was financed by external resources.

<p>I was puzzled by that one as well because it was way different from the number I got last year. I was using google.co.uk which must have a broken index on that particular search because when I use google.com I get:</p>
<ul>
<li>about 38,700 for "Bangladesh War" -wikipedia</li>
<li>about 13,100 for "Bangladesh Liberation War" -wikipedia</li>
<li>about 122 for "Bangladesh Independence War" -wikipedia</li>
<li>about 1,120 for "Pakistani Civil War" -wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>To break those figures down a little, "Bangladesh War of" returns:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>about 21,900 for "Bangladesh War of independence" -wikipedia</b></li>
<li>about 296 for "Bangladesh War of Liberation" -wikipedia</li>
<li>about 331 for "Bangladesh War of 1971" -wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>However using google.com <i>about 961 for "Bangladesh War of" -wikipedia</i> and <i>about 9,860 for "Bangladesh War of"</i> I don't believe that there are 9,000 wikipedia pages with the term, and I don't see how "Bangladesh War of" returns less pages than "Bangladesh War of independence" unless the indexes are broken!</p>
<p>I would be happy to have the article at either "Bangladesh War" or "Bangladesh Independence War" but I think that "Bangladesh Liberation War" fails both <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a> common usage. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 23:04, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(edit conflict) Let's analyze the results presented by Philip above:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Bangladesh War of independence" -wikipedia: 21700 or so google hits</li>
<li>"Bangladesh Liberation War" -wikipedia: 13000 hits</li>
<li>"Bangladesh War" -wikipedia : 40k hits or so, but lets look into what we see starting with the first page:
<ul>
<li>First link (what you'd get if you hit "I'm feeling lucky" is www.subcontinent.com/1971war/1971war.html Where exactly on the page do you see the text "Bangladesh War"? I can't find it.</li>
<li>2nd link: <a href="http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/history/independence.html" class="external free" title="http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/history/independence.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/history/independence.html</a> "Bangladesh War <b>of Independence</b>"</li>
<li>4th link: BBC Article: "Bangladesh <b>war secrets</b> revealed" Note that the word war isn't used here to imply "Bangladesh War", rather it's part of "war secrets". Nothing in the article about the term "Bangladesh War"</li>
<li>7th link: www.regiments.org/wars/20thcent/71indopk.htm "Bangladesh <b>War of Independence</b>"</li>
<li>8th link: www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1971War/ "The fourteen day Bangladesh War in 1971 marked a decisive victory for Indian Arms". Didn't you realize that it is about the Indian Army vs. Pakistan Army 14 day war, (in other words. <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Pak_War_of_1971_6334.html" title="Indo-Pak War of 1971">Indo-Pak War of 1971</a>, not *this* war?)</li>
<li>10th link: www.iisg.nl/collections/bangladesh/d29-928.php "Posters from <b>Bangladesh - War on Independence - 1971</b>"</li>
<li>12th link: <a href="http://www.historyguy.com/india-bangladesh_2001.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.historyguy.com/india-bangladesh_2001.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyguy.com/india-bangladesh_2001.htm</a> About the <b>2001</b> border conflict between India and Bangladesh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on, but the above analysis of the first page or so shows that your argument about "Bangladesh War" being the most common term is quite invalid. "Bangladesh War" often turns up in google hits because the article has constructs like "Bangladesh. War &lt;something in the next sentence&gt;" rather than being <b>the</b> term for the war.</p>
<p>Even then, 39k vs (21k+13k for the war of liberation/independence) isn't a big difference to show absolute favor for "Bangladesh War". And if we count that many of the 39 k are actually part of "Bangladesh War of Independence" or "Bangladesh War of Liberation" , then your numeric argument falls apart.</p>
<p>In any case, google hits are not an absolute measure of something. Yes, if you could have shown a 10 to 1 or 40 to 1 ratio, that would be convincing, but here the number of hits are too close to warrant a ranking of popularity.</p>
<p><br />
As for NPOV concerns, the war's official name is "Bangladesh Liberation War", as used by Bangladesh and India and a lot of books/publications. Besides, would you consider <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> aka <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_war_of_independence.html" title="American war of independence">American war of independence</a> a POV term? That's well established in media and scholarly documents, yet by your argument, it would be a pov title.</p>
<p>Therefore, I strongly oppose any unilateral move of the article, based on some mistaken interpretation and misquotation of google hit statistics. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:18, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to agree with Ragib here—I've heard the term "Bangladesh Liberation War" many times, but never "Bangladesh War". <a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_f4f5.html" title="User:SFGiants">¿ςפקι</a><a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_Esperanza_5f28.html" title="User:SFGiants/Esperanza"><font color="green">Д</font></a><a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_f4f5.html" title="User:SFGiants">Иτς!</a> <a href="../../../s/f/g/User_talk%7ESFGiants_c3b8.html" title="User talk:SFGiants">☺</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7ESFGiants_1766.html" title="Special:Contributions:SFGiants">☻</a> 23:56, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Ragib your so called official name is a POV name that is used by only one side that fought the war. Why should a Wikipedia article use a non NPOV name when it also fails common usage? What I am putting forward the same argument that is put forward in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28events%29_ca3d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (events)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (events)</a>. The analogy with the American war of independence/American Revolutionary War is not pertinent to this: (1) because justifying a name for this article because another has a biased name is not an argument for a breach of the NPOV policy; and (2) although it could be argued that term "American Revolutionary War" is not a NPOV, it is a much finer point to argue, and it is the most commonly used name in the English speaking world to describe the war, so it passes the common usage which "Bangladesh Liberation War" does not.</p>
<p>Of course there will be some pages in "Bangladesh War" which are not about the war but most of them are. It has the advantages that as it does not need a disambiguation, It will show up in searches like those done above and it is neutral, but as I said before I would be happy with the page name of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_War_of_Independence_0d1d.html" title="Bangladesh War of Independence">Bangladesh War of Independence</a> if you think that the name "Bangladesh War" is not precise enough. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 00:17, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find this article to be very POV and using quite a few un-encylopedic words. Particularly, the "Fourth Stage of fighting in Bengladesh" it sounds like original research, is very POV, and speculates on motives without evidence or citation. There are also constant references to "shameful" actions of the Pakistanis, and many other poor word choices that make this article little more than propaganda. Whoever rated this a "B" article is sorely mistaken. This is one of the most POV articles I've seen. I know very little about the controversies or the background information, but was purely curious about this war when I saw a reference to it in another article. Whether or not the Pakistanis were evil, shameful, deceptive etc. is not up for Encyclopedia articles to decide.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.35.124.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.35.124.187_cca3.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.35.124.187">contribs</a>) 00:33, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>If you care to note, references to the "Bangladesh War" are within the context of Indo-Pak wars, i.e. to differentiate them from the wars over Kashmir (and a great many - I haven't read enough of them to be able to call it the majority - refer to the 'Bangladesh <b>w</b>ar, not the Bangladesh <b>W</b>ar.) Thus, within an article on Indo-Pakistani wars, there is an argument for calling the "Indo-Pakistan War of 1971" the "Bangladesh War". However, there is no argument for calling this article "The Bangladesh War", since historians do not refer to it as that. There is a very strong case for calling it the "Bangladesh War of Independence", but none for "The Bangladesh War". Renaming an article is not something that should be done on a whim, as you appear to believe. Unless a consensus can be reached the article should remain as it is. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECripipper_0070.html" title="User:Cripipper">Cripipper</a> 00:10, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I just checked the numbers on google. "Bangladesh Liberation War" returns about two-thirds of what "Bangladesh War" returns even when "Bangladesh War of Independence" hits are taken into account. A lot of the returns for Bangladesh War are actually a shortening of the full name "Bangladesh Liberation War" in spoken quotes. Some others are what Ragib mentioned: references to the Eastern front Indo-Pak War. Add to that the cases of Bangladesh &lt;random punctuation mark&gt; War cases and the fact that most of the returns are non-academic in nature and you get the idea that the numbers are not as significant when put in perspective.</dd>
<dd>However, I would like to ask Cripipper's question but slightly rephrased: what historical or NPOV reasons do you (Philip) propose for this intended move? I believe it would help us understand your perspective. The second point, which I have quite adamantly held against Wikipedia policies in some cases, is that knowledge, unfortunately, doesn't go by democracy. Just because most people at one point believed the Earth is stationary did not stop the Earth from rotating. An encyclopaedia's job is to give right, not necessarily popular, information.</dd>

<p>I will concede that the term Bangladesh War can also be used for the events involving India (which in Wikipedia is termed <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971_1260.html" title="Indo-Pakistani War of 1971">Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</a>) and that will skew the search. However the term "Bangladesh War Independence" is at least as common, and probably more so than the term "Bangladesh Liberation War", and BWI does not carry the non-NPOV that BLW. The term liberation implies that the nation was is a state of subjugation before the liberation. It may or may not be true, but to including the term in the title carries a none neutral point of view, which is a breach of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> policy. As I said above if BWL was overwhelmingly used, then there would be some justification with using it, but this is not the case so the title should be changed to a more neutral one. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:05, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Casualty section quote from USSD conference</span></h2>
<p>The Office of the Historian of the United States State Department held a two-day conference in late June 2005 on U.S. policy in South Asia between 1961 and 1972. The State Department invited international scholars to express their views on declassified documents recently published in the Foreign Relations of the United States series. Acording to a newspaper report published in both Pakistani <b>and Bangladeshi newspapers</b>, Bangladeshi speakers at the conference stated that the official Bangladeshi figure of civilian deaths was close to 300,000, which was wrongly translated from Bengali into English as three million. Ambassador Shamsher M. Chowdhury acknowledged that Bangladesh alone cannot correct this mistake and suggested Pakistan and Bangladesh should form a joint commission to investigate the 1971 disaster and prepare a report. "Almost all scholars agreed that the real figure was somewhere <b>between 26,000, as reported by the Hamoodur Rahman Commission,</b> and not three million, the official figure put forward by Bangladesh and India." [27][28][29]</p>
<p>I have two questions here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which Bangladeshi newspaper? Could we get some citations or names? Otherwise, I am going to remove the bolded part a week from now.</li>
<li>The second bolded part is wrong grammatically. Between has to have a structure like "Between x and y". However, in this case, there's no y. Does anyone know what he actually said?</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I have an issue with this section. Most of this is US justification to not intervening in the war. As far as Bangladeshi sources are concerned, from what I recall, the papers seem to treat the speakers as being selectively picked for some ulterior motives. There are numerous conferences held everyday with speakers. Why quote numbers from them? It's not really a reputed academic source, is it, especially given USSD's involvement in the War?</p>

<p>"The Pakistani Army was in a dreadful condition and gradually lost the will to fight because most of their major fortresses had fallen to the allied Bengali-Indian forces. It was a matter of shame for the Pakistani High Command that a well-trained army was losing the war to the common Bengali civilians, who were barely trained and had outdated weapons. To conceal this shameful matter they launched an air attack near the Indian border on December 3 so that the real facts would remain unknown to the common people and people would say that Pakistani Army did not lose to the Mukti Bahini but to more powerful Indian armies. This led India to announce war against Pakistan officially and they started attacking near the Pakistan-India border from the 6th of December. All-out war between Bangladesh-India and Pakistan began. The agility and strategy of the Mukti Bahini, aided by Indian forces, overwhelmed the Pakistani forces and within 10 days of India's joiníng the war, the Pakistani Army was compelled to an unconditional surrender on December 16, 1971."</p>
<p>The phrasing is pretty slanted. The "shameful act?" "So that the real facts would remain unknown to the common people." This needs to be cleaned up.</p>
<p><br />
Agreed. How about this?</p>
