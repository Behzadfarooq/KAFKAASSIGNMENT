<p>When the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Free_State_628e.html" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a> came into existence in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> three categories of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banknote.html" title="Banknote">banknote</a> were in circulation. These consisted of notes issued by the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_England_ea3c.html" title="Bank of England">Bank of England</a>, the <a href="../../../h/m/_/HM_Treasury_81f1.html" title="HM Treasury">British Treasury</a> and six Irish banks then in existence who were <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter.html" title="Charter">chartered</a> to issue notes. Only British Treasury notes had <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_tender.html" title="Legal tender">legal tender</a> status within the state. The issuing of banknotes by multiple private institutions was an everyday aspect of banking in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> at the time and indeed remains so in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> today.</p>
<p>A banking commission was created in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, the <i>Commission of Inquiry into Banking and the Issue of Notes</i>, to determine what changes were necessary in relation to banking and banknote issue in the new state. The commission was chaired by Professor Henry Parker-Willis of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> who was Director of Research of the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_Board_08a8.html" title="Federal Reserve Board">Federal Reserve Board</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. The commission was given a terms of reference:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"To consider and to report to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_for_Finance_%28Ireland%29_ded9.html" title="Minister for Finance (Ireland)">Minister for Finance</a> what changes, if any, in the law relative to banking and note issue are necessary or desirable, regard being had to the altered circumstances arising from the establishment of <a href="../../../s/a/o/Saorst%C3%A1t_%C3%89ireann_6a59.html" title="Saorstát Éireann">Saorstát Éireann</a>."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The commissions report of January 1927 recommended the creation of a currency for the state, but one that would be directly backed and fixed to the <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">pound sterling</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> on a one-for-one basis. This new currency, the "Saorstát pound", was overseen by the politically independent <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency_Commission_%28Ireland%29_4a0f.html" title="Currency Commission (Ireland)">Currency Commission</a> created by the Currency Act, 1927. As a result of the backing by the pound sterling the notes of the Commission could be presented at the Bank of England, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and exchanged with the pound sterling, without charge or commission, on a one-for-one basis.</p>
<p>A second banking commission was created in November 1934, the <i>Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and Credit</i>, to inquire into the creation of a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_bank.html" title="Central bank">central bank</a> among other things. The majority report of August 1938 recommended for the creation of a central bank with enhanced powers and functions. This resulted in the creation of the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Bank_of_Ireland_76ab.html" title="Central Bank of Ireland">Central Bank of Ireland</a>, but it would take three decades before the bank would have all the rights and functions associated with a central bank.</p>
<p>As the usual convention for banknote issue banknotes are and were issued in the name of the Currency Commission or Central Bank as existed at the time of print.</p>

<p>Before the advent of the euro three series of notes were issued which held legal tender status; these are generally referred to as "Series A", "Series B" and "Series C" respectively. A series of notes, the "Consolidated Banknotes" were issued but were never legal tender.</p>

<p>The initial series of notes, called "Series A", was devised by the Currency Commission, these notes were printed by Waterlow and Sons, Limited, London which was acquired by <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_La_Rue_85c8.html" title="De La Rue">De La Rue</a>. The commission created an advisory committee which determined the theme and design of the notes. Notes were in the denominations of 10/-, £1, £5, £10, £20, £50, and £100. Each note has a portrait of an Irish colleen, believed to be <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Lavery_e368.html" title="Lady Lavery">Lady Lavery</a> – wife of the artist <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir.html" title="Sir">Sir</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lavery_abf2.html" title="John Lavery">John Lavery</a>, who was commissioned to design this feature.</p>
<p>The predominant theme on the notes is the <a href="../../../r/i/v/Rivers_of_Ireland_1375.html" title="Rivers of Ireland">rivers of Ireland</a>, which are depicted as heads taken from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Custom_House_2d5d.html" title="The Custom House">the Custom House</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. Whilst there was some uncertainty as to which rivers were depicted, it is agreed that rivers in both the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Free_State_628e.html" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> were chosen.

<p>This series of banknotes were never legal tender notes but essentially equivalent to "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Promissory_note.html" title="Promissory note">promissory notes</a>" that continue to be issued by some banks in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. These notes were issued as a transitional measure for eight banks ("Shareholding Banks" of the Currency Commission); Bank of Ireland, Hibernian Bank Limited, Munster &amp; Leinster Bank Limited, National Bank Limited, Northern Bank Limited, Provincial Bank of Ireland Limited, Royal Bank of Ireland Limited and Ulster Bank Limited. These notes were issued, first, between <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_6.html" title="May 6">May 6</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">June 10</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> under the arrangement that the banks withdraw previous notes they issued and refrained from issue of further notes. The consolidated notes were only issued by the Currency Commission and the last notes were printed in 1941, the notes were officially withdrawn on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>.</p>
<p>Each note contained the common design of a man ploughing in a field with two horses on the front and they are often referred to as the "Ploughman Notes" because of this, the main differences were the name of the bank and its authorising signature. The notes denominations, and the back designs were; £1 (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Custom_House_2d5d.html" title="The Custom House">Custom House</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>), £5 (St. Patrick's Bridge, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_%28city%29.html" title="Cork (city)">Cork</a>), £10 (Currency Commission Building, Foster Place, Dublin), £20 (<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_of_Cashel_acd4.html" title="Rock of Cashel">Rock of Cashel</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Tipperary_285e.html" title="County Tipperary">County Tipperary</a>), £50 (<a href="../../../c/r/o/Croagh_Patrick_a86e.html" title="Croagh Patrick">Croagh Patrick</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Mayo_aade.html" title="County Mayo">County Mayo</a>) and £100 (Killiney Bay, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Dublin_5703.html" title="County Dublin">County Dublin</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Banknotes_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland_be6f.html" title="Edit section: 1976-1993: Series B Banknotes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1976-1993: Series B Banknotes</span></h3>
<p><i>Main article: <a href="../../../s/e/r/Series_B_Banknotes_%28Ireland%29_0743.html" title="Series B Banknotes (Ireland)">Series B Banknotes</a></i></p>
<p>This series of notes called "Series B" was commissioned by the Central Bank of Ireland and were designed and brought into circulation between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. Servicon, an Irish design company, was employed to design the notes of the denominations; £1, £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100. The £100 note was never issued or circulated. This remains somewhat of an idiosyncrasy in the issue of Irish banknotes as this is the only series without a note of this denomination.</p>
<p>The theme chosen for these notes was <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Ireland_d82a.html" title="History of Ireland">history of Ireland</a>, and each note featured the portrait of a person with this theme in mind from a particular era from historic to modern. The Lady Lavery portrait, from Series A, was retained but this time as a watermark.</p>

<p><i>Main article: <a href="../../../s/e/r/Series_C_Banknotes_%28Ireland%29_47de.html" title="Series C Banknotes (Ireland)">Series C Banknotes</a></i></p>
<p>This series of notes called "Series C" was the outcome of a limited competition held in 1991 in which nine <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Irish_artists_c6d1.html" title="List of Irish artists">Irish artists</a> were invited. The winner and designer of the series was <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Ballagh_f41b.html" title="Robert Ballagh">Robert Ballagh</a>. This series of notes had denominations of £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100, no <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_pound.html" title="Irish pound">Irish pound</a> note was designed as the currency had a <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coin.html" title="Coin">coin</a> of this value since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_in_Ireland_bbb0.html" title="1990 in Ireland">1990</a>. This series was introduced at short notice, with the £20 being the first to be issued, following widespread forgery of the Series B £20 note. The last banknote of the Series C issue was a £50 that was issued in 2001.</p>
<p>The theme for this series was people who contributed to the formation of a modern <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and to this effect it includes politicians, a language, a literary and a religious figure. The political figures do not include anyone directly associated with the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_War_of_Independence_d28c.html" title="Irish War of Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>, which eventually lead to the creation of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Free_State_628e.html" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a>, as this might have proved controversial both because of the war itself and its aftermath, the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Civil_War_de5a.html" title="Irish Civil War">Irish Civil War</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Banknotes_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland_be6f.html" title="Edit section: The Euro">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Euro</span></h2>
<p><i>Main article: <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro_banknotes.html" title="Euro banknotes">Euro banknotes</a></i></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Bank_of_Ireland_76ab.html" title="Central Bank of Ireland">Central Bank of Ireland</a>, as an agency of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Central_Bank_0258.html" title="European Central Bank">European Central Bank</a>, produces <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro_banknotes.html" title="Euro banknotes">Euro banknotes</a> at its <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency_Centre_18f1.html" title="Currency Centre">Currency Centre</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandyford_Industrial_Estate_b657.html" title="Sandyford Industrial Estate">Sandyford Industrial Estate</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>.</p>
<p>Generally central banks in the Eurozone provide banknotes of one specific denomination each year, according to demand and a rotating allocation (determined by the ECB). Prior to the introduction of the euro in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, national banks produced several of the lower denominations to build up stockpiles. Since 2002 however, the Central Bank of Ireland has only printed €10 notes, <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">as of 2005</a>. Although notes produced in other Eurozone states circulate alongside domestically produced notes, the country of origin for any Euro banknote can be identified by a one-letter prefix preceding the serial number. Banknotes produced in Ireland can be identified by the prefix "T".</p>
<p>A further complication is that the actual printing of banknotes is not necessarily undertaken in the country in which banknotes are given a serial number and released. The Central Bank of Ireland is the sole Irish printer of Euro banknotes (in some other Eurozone countries, notes are printed by a private company commissioned to do so by the central bank, rather than the central bank itself). Any notes printed by the Central Bank of Ireland will have the prefix "K" before the series code in a small star on the front of the banknote.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Ireland does not currently introduce €200 and €500 notes into circulation, although these are legal tender in the country. If spent (by people coming from another Eurozone member state) they are unlikely to be passed to other consumers, and will find their way back to the banks (which usually only dispense notes up to €100).</p>
