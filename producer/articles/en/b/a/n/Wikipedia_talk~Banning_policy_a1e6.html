<p>This looks like a good time to update the community ban section. The community has begun applying topic bans in addition to outright sitebans. See <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_noticeboard_Archive2_e838.html#Community_ban_request_on_User:GordonWatts" title="Wikipedia:Community noticeboard/Archive2">Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard/Archive2#Community_ban_request_on_User:GordonWatts</a>, which GordonWatts attempted to appeal to ArbCom and the committee rejected his appeal. Also the recently closed <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_noticeboard_e3f8.html#Community_ban_proposal_for_Miracleimpulse" title="Wikipedia:Community noticeboard">Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard#Community_ban_proposal_for_Miracleimpulse</a>.</p>
<p>Also I suggest including a link to the guideline <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a> which offers a model for community action culminating in community bans. An important criterion there makes a consensus of <i>uninvolved</i> editors is the standard for community banning. That part has been at guideline level for half a year now with no problems (it was implemented as a safeguard against good people getting railroaded out of the project) so I suggest adding that qualification to the banning policy statement on community bans.</p>

<p>"As a matter of curiousity" how many "banned and nuisance persons" operate across more than one language/Wiki area? If the number is "very low" it might be easier to consider other routes than blanket bans. The crossovers are more likely to occur in some areas than others - eg English/<a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a>.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure any comprehensive survey has been performed about multiple language problem users. Each language edition is administrated separately and decides on its own policies. Wikipedia.en doesn't have an oversight role - that would rest with Meta. While an effort to coordinate banning policies across languages might be worthwhile, it's tangential to this particular thread. I'm requesting that the policy language be brought up to date with actual practice. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 18:48, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are misinterperting the use of "ban" in this area. A community ban is only for en.WP. Although sometimes people may use "ban" to describe a wikimedia wide ban for editor who engages in threats, it is seldom done in practice since currently every wiki has a seperate user log and there is not way to automatically connect account on several wiki's to one person. Alhough there are occasions when a "banned user" popped up on another wiki and was noticed and blocked; it is rare. This may change in the future, but I have heard of no disscusion of a method for instituting wikimedia wide bans as of now. In any event such an method of banning would need a seperate policy (i.e. not on en.WP) with much wider discussion. If you are disscussing a policy on en.WP, the issues being disscussed will not be applied outside of en.WP.--<i><font color="#9966FF">Birgitte</font><font color="#CC99CC" size="2">SB</font></i> 21:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A very low number I think. Sofar I only have been tracking a spammer and a group of kids trying to get their names into various articles. Apart from that I have only come accross one crackpot being banned/blocked in 3 or 4 wikkies. OTOH some editors have been referred to as <i>being banned on xx wikki</i>, which never was a reason to block them here as long as they did not disrupt here. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 14:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've struck most of the change as instruction creep ("reasonable expectation of notification", "disruptive user may forfeit these expectations", "not obliged to wait").

<dd>I don't know about that merge, they are very different things.

<ul>
<li>Precisely my point. If the distinction is vague, then one page should clearly explain what it is. I'm not saying that blocking is the same as banning, obviously it's not, but they're related enuogh to be covered on one page, for the same reason that protection is on the same page as unprotection. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:43, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Respectfully, Radiant, I really am disappointed that you responded to none of the several solicitations for input and then unilaterally altered policy counter to the discussion consensus immediately after the update got implemented. The new paragraph addresses reasonable concerns expressed at two different appeals to ArbCom where editors were blocked during community ban discussion and not notified of their ban discussion until after it had concluded, effectively denying them the means of defense. Additionally, the stipulation for <i>uninvolved</i> editors to decide on community bans has been at guideline level for half a year and was the most important provision in getting the proposal accepted as a guideline: partisan edit warriors shouldn't be empowered to railroad people out of the project. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 14:50, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll add that, by selectively leaving some new material and deleting others, Radiant's diff amounts to a unilateral attempt to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> banning policy. If Radiant disagreed with the method used to garner consensus, the appropriate response would have been to revert the entire update. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 14:53, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Get real, Durova, that someone disagrees with (part of) your edit has nothing to do with ownership (ad hominem is a fallacy, I'm sure you knew that). Policy pages are edited all the time by lots of people without "formal consensus gathering", and none of the links you cite point to any actual consensus gathering in the first place, just to lengthy talk pages where that gathering supposedly occured. I hadn't noticed your earlier invitations, or I would have responded earlier. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:00, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please express your thoughts in less a less inflammatory manner than <i>get real, Durova</i> and refrain from accusing me of logical fallacies I have not committed. My objection in no way constitutes an <i>ad hominem</i> attack: it regards your actions, not you as an individual. As your question <i>Has the community ever issued topical bans as opposed to general ones?</i> reveals, you were unaware of recent precedents that affect the policy you altered. I did link directly to the threaded discussion that formed consensus on the policy and within that thread my posts provided other links to the relevant precedents, upon which I would have gladly expanded had you requested clarification. Alterations to policy are weighty edits and should not be made in ignorance. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 15:12, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You don't need to announce policy changes; the normal wiki process governs.</li>
<li>The policy isn't "set" because you discussed it at some place, it can be edited later on; the normal wiki process governs.</li>
<li>You haven't actually linked to any major consensus building related to this change. Not that that's necessary, but you claim to have a strong consensus backing for your actions and this is not apparent.</li>
<li>If people (e.g. me) disagree with an addition to policy, we discuss it on its talk page.</li>
<li>Don't accuse people of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNership</a> or of ignorance, per <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.</li>

<dd>I don't agree with this proposed change. The change to "consensus support among uninvolved users in good standing" will herald endless wikilawyering about what constitutes "involved," and in any event, just because someone may be "involved" doesn't mean their opinion should be discounted. If someone has been harassed by a user, for example, that person has a right to have their opinion carry weight without allegations that they're too "involved" to count. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:37, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Durova, can you give one example of "teams of partisan editors exploiting the community ban option to railroad good people out of the website"? I've never seen it happen, though of course every user who's banned claims to be a good editor who was unfairly treated. Users who are banned indefinitely are almost always given warning after warning, usually from multiple admins. I've personally never seen any good editor (good in terms of content contributions or behavior) have this happen to them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:44, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(outdent) To respond to SlimVirgin first, I'm not aware of a case where such railroading actually happened. The potential for that type of abuse got discussed extensively when <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">WP:DE</a> was at the proposal stage. Would you like me to cite specific posts and threads from those discussions? As long as community ban discussions were housed at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> the risk of that abuse was pretty low (although other problems attended holding them there). With the opening of <a href="../../../c/n/_/WP%7ECN_1165.html" title="WP:CN">WP:CN</a> I've been active to reduce potential for that happening.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard/Archive1#Proposal_to_community_ban_CroDome_.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.C2.A0.C2.B7_logs.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_user.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_log.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard/Archive1#Proposal_to_community_ban_CroDome_.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.C2.A0.C2.B7_logs.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_user.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_log.29" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> So far the community has handled this well, and I'm proud that it has, yet - let me know if you need more specifics than a general link to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EDisruptive_editing_Archive_1_5f2f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Disruptive editing/Archive 1">Wikipedia talk:Disruptive editing/Archive 1</a> - what's apparent to me from close involvement throughout the process is that the community has addressed this proactively. I don't really object to keeping that language at guideline level if consensus hasn't formed for advancing it: my impression had been that it was merited. Slim, is that your only objection to the edit I implemented this morning or are there other points you wish to raise?</p>
<p>And to Milo, <i>in good standing</i> here means the same thing it means at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> discussions or <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> discussions: basically someone who has a meaningful edit history, isn't blocked or banned, and isn't a sockpuppet or meatpuppet.

I removed only the parts of your change to which I objected; I see no reason why I should remove parts to which I did not object.

<dd>I'm well aware of that, of course, since it was posted to my own user talk page. And I'm also aware (and sympathetic) that community banned editors recently targeted SlimVirgin with similar allegations in recent <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> requests. I've been targeted in the same way - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=102456389&amp;oldid=102442394" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=102456389&amp;oldid=102442394" rel="nofollow">this example</a>. It's taken some hard consideration to arrive at the conclusion I've reached: that it's simpler and easier for the community to identify such allegations as frivolous and disregard them as such than for the community to remedy deliberate railroading by a coterie of edit warriors (if policy explicitly allows such exploitation). I've little doubt that I'll take heat from time to time for being bold and impartial in the community's interests, yet any sysop who takes action in dispute resolution keeps a good wardrobe of flameproof suits for that purpose. If you see a way to close <i>both</i> methods of exploitation I'm all ears. I chose the lesser of two evils. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 20:23, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>(outdent)It's unhelpful to accuse someone of a logical fallacy without being specific. Which part that statement do you interpret as a false dichotomy, and for what reason?</p>
<p>As examples of how it's fairly simple to deal with frivolous allegations of involvement, let's look at the two recent arbitration requests where SlimVirgin got targeted. First, the Arthur Ellis attempted appeal:</p>
<dl>
<dd>...<i>It is also rather unfair that a community ban by admins and invited editors like Clyoquot, who also alse edit warred with Ellis and Slime Virgin on pages like <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a>, unlike an Arbcom process, allows permanent banning without anything resembling due process and without even informing the ban target that a ban is being considered or asking for his take on things or the reason why he feels wronged enough to act out in ways that are seen as vandalism.</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=114711347&amp;oldid=114710827" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=114711347&amp;oldid=114710827" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>There's the reference to SlimVirgin: one insulting assertion with no supporting evidence. The attempted appeal ended in early closure. It was already on its way to rejection on its merits when I submitted a statement that linked to extensive vandalism, template abuse, and a user threat by the same IP addresses that had requested the review.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Request_to_review_indefinite_block_of_User:BabyDweezil" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">BabyDweezil</a> request has garnered more serious consideration and, as of this writing, there remains a chance that it could open. Yet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Durova&amp;diff=115126872&amp;oldid=115113620" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Durova&amp;diff=115126872&amp;oldid=115113620" rel="nofollow">this appeal</a> at my talk page, which got cited at this discussion yesterday as an example of how an involvement claim could be gamed, turned out to be an honest misunderstanding that got resolved with an explanation. I'll quote that explanation in full here because it's also relevant here.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I wasn't going to reply to this, but a post at another user talk page that invoked my name leads me to change my mind: silence implies consent so I ought to speak up. This thread demonstrates a logical fallacy called <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_assertion.html" title="Proof by assertion">proof by assertion</a>.

Ten <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schoenberg_ee5c.html" title="Arnold Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> fans are trying to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> the article and say that Schoenberg is the greatest composer in music history.

The Schoenberg fans huddle together somewhere and decide to run this Mozart fan out of the project. They tag team him, heckle him, and goad him into a <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> block. Finally the Mozart fan gets frustrated and commits an act of vandalism. That's where I come along. While I'm browsing the page I see the words</i> I'd rather eat ten pounds of rancid warthog meat than listen to Schoenberg. <i>So I click edit and type</i> removed vandalism <i>in my summary. About two weeks later the Schoenberg fans start a community ban thread on the Mozart dude and all ten of them support the ban. Well none of those ten votes count because those are the people who've been disputing with the Mozart guy all along. But my vote's valid and the fact that I reverted his edit doesn't make me involved. I was just performing routine housekeeping. The Mozart guy might accuse me of bias, but that claim carries no weight because I hardly ever edit that type of article and he can't read my mind. (My actual opinion is that I'd like to move Arnold Schoenberg from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_composers.html" title="List of composers">List of composers</a> to List of cruel and unusual punishments, but that's beside the point). Even if I issued a block for vandalism on Mozart dude, I haven't been a party to his dispute, and it's perfectly valid for me to support or oppose at the ban discussion. Mozart guy can't drive out the sysop who issued the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> block on that basis either, unless Mr. Mozart can prove that the other admin had been part of the opera content dispute, and in that situation Herr Mozart could have opened an administrator conduct <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> because sysops aren't supposed to issue a block to gain the upper hand in a quarrel.</i></dd>

These two examples where users misinterpreted the <i>uninvolved</i> requirement follow a pattern: either the user is reasonable, in which case he or she adjusts to feedback, or the user is unreasonable, in which case the protest can be disregarded. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 15:39, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there's any simpler way to express the gist of this I'm open to refinements. Regarding notification and defense, there can be situations where a disruptive user's participation renders notification all but impossible. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Gundagai_editors_750b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gundagai editors">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Gundagai editors</a>. And as for submitting a defense, sometimes a blocked editor is so problematic that the user page needs protection. Apologies in advance to participants who aren't sysopped: the example that springs to my mind is from a deleted user talk page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Marsiliano&amp;action=edit" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Marsiliano&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> So as I expressed before implementing my edit, two different factors deserve balanced attention: notification and defense where feasible in order to prevent one kind of exploitation (good editors getting railroaded), weighed against troublemakers who would exploit policy loopholes and try to tie the community's hands and prolong their own disruption. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 19:46, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about ""A user who is the subject of a proposed community ban should be notified of the proposal and if blocked may respond on their own talk page."

<dd>The second version of that looks pretty good.

At the end of the day Brandt can edit his talk page and so we cant under current policy completely silence his voice. thje ref he gavce me the other day after I asked if anyone had one was put in the article by me and not by him and I should not in a future) be punished for such an edit on the basis that it was co-operating with a banned user.

Posts to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> would be exempt, so that they can appeal their blocks. Or they can email the unblock mail list. Or mail Oversight.

<p>Denny, bans are generally taken to be preventive, not punitive. At least they were, in the days when they weren't simply ways of getting rid of one's enemies. But anyway, that's the theory. A bit of flexibility at the margin allows the possibility of rehabilitation. It should be considered a success if a bad user turns good, surely? Also, the focus has mostly been on behaviour rather than personality. We're not discouraging the person as such, we're discouraging the bad editing patterns. Many of Wikipedia's policies are at base edit focused rather than person focused. It doesn't make sense in that framework to scrub out good edits just to punish bad editors. And yes, I suppose it can be frustrating when banned people just won't stay banned, but they are not necessarily pursuing negative ends, and allowing some wriggle room keeps us (just barely) human. We can argue over the wriggle room -- on the one hand, I can see a strong argument for hardbanning everyone who contributes to Wikipedia Review (and I'd like to see Jimbo do it, given the disgusting treatment handed out to some of the valued contributors here), while on the other, I urge accommodating those who are trying to contribute positively here (which is, in the case of contributors such as Jon Awbrey, a petulant, whiny child, a losing proposition -- I guess I cannot help wanting the grievances of hurt people to be resolved) -- but I think it has a purpose, particularly given the belief in rehabilitation.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:31, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. Banned is banned, and for good reason. Editors are only banned after extensive conflict, allowing them to edit for any reason would force good editors to have to deal with users who have abused and harrassed them repeatedly. Also, there is no technical way to allow this, so you would either have to allow posts from unverified IP addresses which claimed to be the banned user, or to unblock the banned user's account and hope they only use it for the allowed purpose. People with complaints about the content of articles naming them can contact the Foundation by e-mail; the communications committee routinely reviews such complaints and posts valid ones to talk pages.

<dd>Um, pot-&gt;kettle, Zibiki Wym? Especially as it turned out that 4 of the accounts who were restoring Brandt's comments were sockpuppets of a banned user? I was probably wikilawyering with the best of them at 2 months. Let me check...yup, I was on Categories for deletion my second day and posting to AN/I at one month. Anyway this is all a distraction. The people who think that it's ok to let banned users make "reasonable" comments make the mistake of thinking that "banned means banned" is some kind of adherence to rules for rules' sake. Banned users are banned for good reasons and it is these reasons why tolerating or encouraging cracks in the dike is a bad idea. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The purpose of banning someone is to prevent them from damaging Wikipedia. If allowing a banned user to edit their own talk page does no damage, then what exactly are you trying to prevent? It's a matter of common human decency. Not allowing someone to make civil edits to their own article talk page is petty and vindictive.

<dd>I think that common human decency requires that we consider the users who have been driven off Wikipedia or otherwise had their private lives invaded by Mr. Brandt. I think that such behavior damages Wikipedia greatly, and that tolerating comments by such users on talk pages, even nominally reasonable comments, is not only the camel's nose, but shows enormous disrespect for the distress that many good Wikipedians went through before the user was banned. I happen to think that entertaining such edits is offensive to good Wikipedians in the same way that giving a seat on the PTA activities planning committee to a person who had lost custody of their own children through abuse and neglect would be offensive to good parents. And I happen to think that the OTRS email system satisfies our duty to banned users quite well enough. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:12, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While appreciating your good intentions, as a "victim" of said page I think that keeping Brandt completely off wikipedia will only encourage him to add further wikipedians to the list, etc, whereas allowing him a little space on his own article might get him to calm down and possibly even persuade him to remove said page. Certainly both the "let him edit his bio talk page" and "dontn under any circumstances let him" are both motivated by a dislike of his hivemind page, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem with the PTA analogy is that the PTA can't do things which affect the lives of non-PTA adults--while the whole *point* of having a policy about biographies of living persons is that Wikipedia can affect non-Wikipedians by having articles on them. Any comparable PTA analogy would be a little contrived, but imagine a small town where the PTA both deals with children and also occasionally chooses a townsperson to kill, like a less random version of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lottery_468a.html" title="The Lottery">The Lottery</a>. If the PTA was trying to kill someone, I'd think it's reasonable for them to be able to attend a PTA meeting whether they've been deprived of their children or not. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 03:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, absolutely. Any banned user who is the subject of an article needs to have the right to discuss his biography on the article's talk page. Only a particularly severe amount of invective should be cause for withdrawing this, and then only for limited times. It is blatantly unfair to have an article on someone while prohibiting that person from discussing his or her concerns about it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Living people who have biographies at Wikipedia and have never had an account and don't want to register one can and presumably do contact the Foundation with complaints. Mr Brandt already has an extra advantage as a user â€” he can contact any administrator through "email this user". Why do people talk about this as if leaving him banned means that he's 100% helpless with regard to inaccuracies in his article? <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElinorD_6fce.html" title="User talk:ElinorD">(talk)</a> 10:53, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I gather, based on his own complaints, that people ignore him when he tries to contact them privately. By posting on the talk page he reaches a wider audience and makes it more difficult to ignore him. Furthermore, as the subject of the article Brandt is an invaluable resource, and instead of just demanding the article be taken down he has been making specific points about ways to improve the content lately, so I would argue that in the interest of creating a better article about him we should give him a voice. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr. Kohs, this is the talk page of Wikipedia's banning policy, not a forum for your personal grievances.

Policy should be guided by general principles that apply to all relevant situations. The examples Mr. Brandt showed me were of requests that his entire article be deleted rather than of specific BLP concerns within the article. As for your own e-mail experience, please substantiate it with specific examples. Be aware also that either you or Mr. Brandt also could have followed up with an e-mail petition to an uninvolved administrator (we have over 1100 of them). <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 15:41, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm I really should explain my reasons. User's get banned only rarely, and when they do it is because they are damaging to the encylopedia. Brandt is certainly in that category. He is very bad news for anyone who gets on his wrong side. If he is allowed to edit the talk page, he will be interacting with people. Sooner or later ( well sooner, we know his MO) one of these people will say or do somthing that upsets him and he will go for them. We cannot allow that to happen. We must make it perfectly clear that he is not welcome here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a>}~
<dl>
<dd>So instead of risking someone possibly pissing him off sooner or later, you're choosing to guarantee that he's pissed off right now. I'm not really seeing how that's the better choice.

We have a moral obligation to marginally-notable people who we place as the number one hit on a Google search. Many of these marginal subjects would go virtually unnoticed if we didn't use our search engine ranking to artificially boost their profile. Editors search the web looking for any tiny pieces of information on his life, some of it 40+ years old, that they can scrape together and put in his article. Regardless of how you feel about him personally, he must be allowed to voice his concerns in a civil manner in a place where people interested in his article may view them.

<p>The policy about reverting banned users' edits regardless of the merits of the edit needs an overhaul. It might be used to pass down vandalism to pages in the following way:</p>
<p>User A is a banned, but not blocked user. User B is a vandal. User C is the normal good Wikipedian.</p>
<p>User B vandalizes an article. User A sees it, and, breaking his/her ban, reverts the vandalism. What should User C do then? Revert to the vandalized version of the article? That is what comes from this policy, but it's clearly wrong. Or leave it as is? That is leaving a ban breaking unsanctioned. If we substitute User C for another vandal, he/she can revert to the vandal version without consequences! We need an exception for "obviously good edits, such as vandalism reverts", but at the same time we must make sure that the exception is impossible to abuse. Any ideas? <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetRolller_3D_a1bc.html" title="User:NetRolller 3D">NetRolller 3D</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetRolller_3D_c4ca.html" title="User talk:NetRolller 3D">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NetRolller_3D_54d6.html" title="Special:Contributions/NetRolller 3D">contribs</a>).</small> 12:28, April 2, 2007</p>

<dd>The simple answer is that both users should be reverted, one for vandalism, and the other for violating a ban. Of course, if the last version <i>not</i> by either of them happens to identical to the version by the banned user, no "double revert" will be visible as it would often be a <a href="../../../d/u/m/Help%7EDummy_edit_0c7d.html#Null_edit" title="Help:Dummy edit">null edit</a>.</dd>
<dd>If you see this happening often, you might ask whether the users are actually the same person. Consider this strategy:
<ul>
<li>Obsessive content edit by banned user's sockpuppet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Georgia_%28country%29&amp;diff=61275432&amp;oldid=61273160" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Georgia_%28country%29&amp;diff=61275432&amp;oldid=61273160" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>
<li>Page-blanking vandalism by banned user's other sockpuppet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Georgia_%28country%29&amp;diff=61276059&amp;oldid=61275432" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Georgia_%28country%29&amp;diff=61276059&amp;oldid=61275432" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>
<li>Vandalism revert by bot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Georgia_%28country%29&amp;diff=61276069&amp;oldid=61276059" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Georgia_%28country%29&amp;diff=61276069&amp;oldid=61276059" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>
<li>Anonymous revert of banned user's content edit (a month later) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Georgia_%28country%29&amp;diff=66295084&amp;oldid=63664347" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_Georgia_%28country%29&amp;diff=66295084&amp;oldid=63664347" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>
