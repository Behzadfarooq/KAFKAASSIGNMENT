<p>Hi. Please don't do that to templates. It places not just the template at the top of its own category, but also any articles with the template. I have sorted this out with the noinclude trick. <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morwen.html" title="Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 17:27, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, thanks for catching that. I didn't think of that. When I checked the cat after the edit all the districts were under their proper letters, but the template was under an asterisk so it seemed kosher. Do you think that was just a cache issue? In any case, thanks again. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 17:33, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, kind of a cache issue - things that include templates with categories won't get updated until you edit the actual page (as regenerating everything on altering the template would be rather impractical). <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morwen.html" title="Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 18:08, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

I also have come across articles which "generalists" would be unlikely to instantly recognize as fallacious or highly misleading. Sounds like you would agree with me and with <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a> that expert knowledge is sadly undervalued in the WP, to its detriment.</p>
<p>Incidentally, have you come across this book?</p>

<dd>Hi CH, Thanks for your comments. I had written up that contrib and, after previewing, seriously thought of sleeping on it but went ahead. I still agree with it, though it's a bit more raw than I like my contribs to be. That's what I get for writing when I'm tired and stressed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I stated, I don't know what it all means for me just yet. The two issues that seem to add users that I respect to the ranks of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMissing_Wikipedians_2d19.html" title="Wikipedia:Missing Wikipedians">Wikipedia:Missing Wikipedians</a> dispoportionately are too many ridiculous edit wars over minor issues and dealing with the constant onslaught of vandals and just plain schlock editors. It is not entirely clear to me if this is a steady state in which new users are replacing the users who are leaving fast enough to scale with the growth of Wikipedia as a whole or if Wikipedia's resilience is actually deteriorating. I think Larry has made some good points, but he does himself no favors by occasionally popping up to reminisce about how Wikipedia is all his idea and how much it began to suck once he left, at least if his intention is to help Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What the wiki desperately needs are some metrics, like someone threw together recently on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a> on the relative contributions of various categories of users, as right now all the discussion is taking place in a vacuum. Hopefully the recent hoopla will inspire someone to create statistics along the lines of "Percentage of new articles created by anonymous users that are deleted within one week", "...by users whose account is less than one week old...", etc. Once the article validation system gets put into place, something like this may be possible for individual articles as well to track individual editors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A categorization of pages, going from "stub" to "growing" to "mature", combined with restrictions on user editing, is one idea that I've been thinking aobut. For example, any user may edit a stub, while only users who have made a few edits over the previous month may edit "growing" and "mature" articles can be limited to regular users. I'm sure there's something awful about this idea that hasn't occurred to me yet...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm still letting this all churn for a while, but I figure that there must be some way to address the issue of both lack of expertise and the "bad edit" onslaught that drives so many good users away. I have certainly begun taking a harder line on editing.

<p>Hi!&#160;:-) Since we have a common interest for African history, I thought that maybe you wouldn't mind if I asked you some advice. Looking at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Uganda_0a4f.html" title="History of Uganda">History of Uganda</a> and the History of Uganda Series, built almost completely with the public domain <i><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html" class="external text" title="http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html" rel="nofollow">A Country Study: Uganda</a></i>, I thought that the same project could be actuated for the other African country that are covered by the Country Studies, so to expand radically and modify <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Mauritius_7b7e.html" title="History of Mauritius">History of Mauritius</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Chad_374d.html" title="History of Chad">History of Chad</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Comoros_6180.html" title="History of Comoros">History of Comoros</a>, ecc. Every country should have, like Uganda, a template "History of xxx Series", so to not expand too much the main history article (as with <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Uganda_0a4f.html" title="History of Uganda">History of Uganda</a>, the chapters would be only relatively brief summaries, while seperate articles would treat in detail the various periods). A problem is that many of these studies were writteneJust to see how it comes, I've started to work the project on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Chad_374d.html" title="History of Chad">History of Chad</a>, for now putting the country study stuff only before 1900. What do you think of the idea, in general? And regarding <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Chad_374d.html" title="History of Chad">History of Chad</a>, do you think I'm proceeding OK or is it better to leave the whole story and revert my edits on Chad? I'm sorry to disturb you, but I thought you could've been interested. <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:15, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Aldux. I appreciate your question. I do think that the {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistory_of_Uganda_3663.html" title="Template:History of Uganda">History of Uganda</a>}} series is nicely organized, though as with all Africa articles it could do with some more attention. &#160;;) Along with your thoughts, I think that sections that point to a "main article" should be no longer than three paragraphs. Looking at the Kanem-Bornu section of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Chad_374d.html" title="History of Chad">History of Chad</a>, which is much longer than the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanem-Bornu_Empire_8521.html" title="Kanem-Bornu Empire">Kanem-Bornu Empire</a> article, I would suggest merging everything into the article and then writing a 1 or 2-paragraph section for the History of... article.</dd>
<dd>An alternate way of doing this would be to create a new Empires of Chad article and moving the text under <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Chad_374d.html#Era_of_Empires_.28AD_900.E2.80.931900.29" title="History of Chad">History of Chad#Era of Empires (AD 900–1900)</a> into it. However this would still require merging the Library of Congress info into the existing articles, and create an intermediary level that doesn't seem needed at this point. This appears to be a lesser option.</dd>
<dd>I don't see anyway of doing what you propose without some work merging it into the pre-existing articles. Of course, if the existing article doesn't have any information not already included in the LOC info, then a simple replacement may in order. I don't see any edits by you at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Angola_919c.html" title="History of Angola">History of Angola</a>, but given the amount of work I see involved I would encourage you to tackle the first History of... article by itself until you see how much work you're giving yourself. Hopefully, this has helped.

<dd>Thanks for your advice&#160;:-) I'll follow your proposal, and merge the LOC Kanem-Bornu material with the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanem-Bornu_Empire_8521.html" title="Kanem-Bornu Empire">Kanem-Bornu Empire</a> article. I also see you've built <a href="../../../o/u/a/Ouaddai_Empire_7431.html" title="Ouaddai Empire">Ouaddai Empire</a>, and greatly expanded <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baguirmi_Empire_cdc7.html" title="Baguirmi Empire">Baguirmi Empire</a>; great work!&#160;:-) As for <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Angola_919c.html" title="History of Angola">History of Angola</a>, that was only an error on my part, and I'll certainly proceed one History for time.

<dd>On an entirely different topic, I was looking over your user page for the first time in many months. I was a bit taken aback by your comment that the current CSB essay is "rather snide", as I'm pretty sure that I wrote the foundation of the current version. I vaguely recall that I did this back when I was trying to revamp the WikiProject around March 05. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias&amp;oldid=10373489" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias&amp;oldid=10373489" rel="nofollow">CSB description at the time I rewrote it</a>, had a lot of subpages that required constant updating and the lists seemed to encourage people to add their POV disputes and seek protection under the "I'm systemically biased against!" defense. I probably sound a bit defensive about this but I was taken aback to find such comments about work with which I was moderately satisfied from a respected user. That said, I am not attached to the current CSB essay and you are welcome to modify or replace it as you wish.

<p>In my opinion a month long block seems to be a little harsh. The user seems to have some good contribs mixed in with some vandalism/bad faith edits. His user page is discouraging, but all in all I don't think you are being "too harsh" though I would reduce the block significantly, but that is at your discretion. There are, just from scanning his talk page at least 7 warnings for vandalism, in my opinion those should not be deleted at all. That's the only reason I reverted and suggested that he archive his talk page. Thanks for the message and happy editing. <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_7104.html" title="User:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#151B8D">Knowledge</font><font color="#7D1B7E">Of</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">Self</font></a> | <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_36c0.html" title="User talk:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#461B7E">talk</font></a> 19:48, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, thanks for your input. There are some issues with this user, and I don't think that Wikipedia is the place to work them out, but I've been going through his contribs and I agree that he has built up enough credibility that a month is excessive.

<p>Hi BanyanTree. Sorry for taking some time to reply to your message from the 9th. My understanding is that the terms "Rwandese Patriotic Front" and "Rwandan Patriotic Army" were synonyms prior to 1994, if the latter term was used at all. They were an armed rebel group, so their political and military functions were more or less indistinguishable.</p>
<p>After the reconquest of Rwanda, however, it is my understanding that the RPF decided to split its political and military functions (at least on paper). I have better source for this, but right now, quoting <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion%2C_the_Fox%2C_and_the_Eagle_b55d.html" title="The Lion, the Fox, and the Eagle">The Lion, the Fox, and the Eagle</a></i> (p. 246), about the <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibeho_incident.html" title="Kibeho incident">Kibeho incident</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As the months went on, the insurgent RPF and its now separate military wing, the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), finally decided it was time to force these prople out of the internal camps; by March 1995, only Kibeho camp remained.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I imagine this sort of split is common for successful rebel movements, at least those that care to give the impression they're not military states.</p>
<p>It's possible that the term "Rwandan Patriotic Army" was used to describe the army of the RPF before reconquest. However, since it was more or less all one organization, I'm inclined to think that for clarity we should just refer to everything pre-conquest as the RPF, and reserve the term "Rwandan Patriotic Army" for the nominally separate post-conquest military entity.</p>
<p>It wouldn't surprise me to hear they had been renamed to Rwandan Defence Forces or some such thing; after all, the names are pretty similar, so if the Rwandan government is striving to convey the message that the party and army are separate, a very distinct name for the army would seem to be in order. I'll leave it as "Rwandan Patriotic Army" for now, and see if I can find a reference to the new name.

<dd>Hi 24.60.107.154 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.60.107.154.html" title="User talk:24.60.107.154">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.60.107.154_c6f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.60.107.154">contribs</a>), would you like to explain your relationship to <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueTruth_fd64.html" title="User:BlueTruth">BlueTruth</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlueTruth_7f6e.html" title="User talk:BlueTruth">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BlueTruth_476a.html" title="Special:Contributions/BlueTruth">contribs</a>) and 67.35.28.112 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.35.28.112.html" title="User talk:67.35.28.112">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.35.28.112_7f1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.35.28.112">contribs</a>)? It's odd that BlueTruth just blanked some warnings off of your talk pages, which raises suspicions that BlueTruth is your sockpuppet. It also seems odd that you would leave me a message now as I left a No personal attacks note several days ago. However, I did just leave a warning notice at 67.35.28.112's talk, so it strikes me that you could not be responding to another IP's talk unless you were at both. What makes this all the weirder is that you and .112 have been edit warring on <a href="../../../a/y/m/Ayman_al-Zawahiri_9a6c.html" title="Ayman al-Zawahiri">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damadola_airstrike.html" title="Damadola airstrike">Damadola airstrike</a>.

<dd>Of course. BlueTruth is me. I am 24.60.107.154. I make no secret of this. I started editing Wikipedia just a week ago, and decided I wanted a name so came up with the BlueTruth account last night. I will use BlueTruth from now on. I am NOT however, 67.35.28.112. I have one computer I'm using currently and that's at my home address. I'm not having a revert war with 67 " " for kicks. I honestly think that person's information is inaccurate, and I'm really trying to keep the level of quality on both those pages to a higher standard. I'm still new to this thing, so I apologize if I broke any rules or overstepped any boundaries.

<p>greetings BanyanTree, i was curious as to whether you (and others from the wikipedia africa community) would be interested in helping to barnraise <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum_in_Nigeria_8a00.html" title="Petroleum in Nigeria">Petroleum in Nigeria</a>, an article i started at the beginning of '06. I'm pretty much planning on camping out at the campus library all weekend working on it, and there is also a significant amount of information available online. that said i will be doing most of the work, but any help would be appreciated. <a href="http://www.remembersarowiwa.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.remembersarowiwa.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a> is a good place to start browsing info online (excuse me if im being presumptuous). thanks! --<a href="../../../g/o/z/User%7EGozar_9ff3.html" title="User:Gozar">Gozar</a> 18:21, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Gozar. You're not being presumptuous at all and you've made a great start. I try to avoid pulling info directly from advocacy sites when I don't have enough background knowledge to figure out what is being left out, but will try to pull some relevant data from Bank, UN and government sources to provide a counterbalance if you handle the advocacy stuff. Also, I've decided I rather like <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cite/Cite.php" class="extiw" title="m:Cite/Cite.php">the new reference system</a> and will try to introduce it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On a tangential topic, your note made me think that perhaps the <a href="../../../a/f/r/WP%7EAFRICA_da08.html" title="WP:AFRICA">ACOTW</a> could perhaps be better served by making it much less formalized. (After seeing the troubles that the CSB COTW ran into, which led me to replace it with the open tasks template, I simply do not believe that we have the critical mass of editors to draw upon to sustain regular collaborations.) However, a template that any <a href="../../../a/f/r/WP%7EAFR_c6db.html" title="WP:AFR">WP:AFR</a> member could change weekly so it read "<a href="../../../g/o/z/User%7EGozar_9ff3.html" title="User:Gozar">Gozar</a> invites editors to a barnraising at <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum_in_Nigeria_8a00.html" title="Petroleum in Nigeria">Petroleum in Nigeria</a>", etc, may be about the level of bureaucracy needed. Just a thought. Anyway I'll try to pitch in sometime this weekend, <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 19:31, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with you on your opinion of the status quo for, particularly with regard to the ACOTW, which didnt seem to do much of anything. That said, help would be fantastic, because my strong suit in this matter is probably environmental/poverty stuff. anything way you could incorporate the 9 (it's something like 9) regime changes would be awesome. so far a broad overview i have of a section titled something along the lines of "history and politics till the 1990s", would include 1. discovery,2.a sub-section on Biafra which leads to--&gt; 3. nationalization of the industry, 4. a sub-section on OPEC and the relationship with it.<br />
some unifying concepts for the section ive written are "government control has evolved since the 1960s, with the gov. control increasing from no control in the 60s, to have a large stake at present" (i want to include charts of this growth, also historical production for the country). and, "smooth sailing in terms of productivity between Biafra and basically the early 1990s when the Ogoni became a "threat". this was despite numerous regime changes". all the events involving ogoni land would come under a "human rights section" of sorts. --<a href="../../../g/o/z/User%7EGozar_9ff3.html" title="User:Gozar">Gozar</a> 19:46, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, isn't this precisely the hidden agenda Mel was wondering about? The word that is being dropped to the wise (Mel) here is that - hint hint, nudge nudge - before he deletes the Aetherometry Talk pages, he should consider the fact that Helicoid voted against Connolley's adminship and participated in writing anti-wikipedia articles. But you know what? The reason I voted against Connolley and co-wrote the anti-wikipedia articles has everything to do with precisely these "hidden agendas" that seem to be one of the mainstays of how Wikipedia goes about its business. And after dropping this "hint", which clearly suggests that the non-deletion of the Aetherometry talk pages is meant as an act of revenge, this Banyan Tree innocently pretends to be "a little curious" about why I want the pages deleted! Please, can we stop playing these endless games? <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelicoid_2d44.html" title="User:Helicoid">Helicoid</a> 01:13, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Helicoid, well at least you're forthright about it. I see that you are someone who appreciates and is accepting of an honest opinion, so I might as well make myself clear: I think Helicoid is a pseudoscientific loon who is trying to get an admin to remove easily accessible evidence of his looniness. I respect Mel's judgement and I don't have an exact objection so won't undelete it myself, but think that if anything good comes from Helicoid's participation in Wikipedia, it will be accidental. And if Helicoid has anything to say about me, I trust he will say it on my own user talk page rather than continuing to fill up Mel's talk. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 04:01, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My dear Banyan Tree, I am sorry, but I believe in keeping discussions continuous - and since the discussion started with your little hint to Mel, I think it is appropriate to work out the issues right here, where it started. As I said very clearly at the Village Pump, the Aetherometry Talk pages contain unfounded, unsubstantiated derogatory claims about Aetherometry. You are simply making another such claim, and acting as if you were saying something important and revealing. All that you're revealing is your own prejudice - and since you seem to be proud of it, I am willing to congratulate you on it. But I still don't see how there is anything "curious" about a proponent of Aetherometry wanting those derogatory claims removed. You insinuate that the reason for my wanting the claims removed is that they are true. But this, too, is completely unfounded: I might just as well want them removed because they are false. And your elevation of name-calling to the status of "evidence" is not a great testimonial to your intelligence, you know. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelicoid_2d44.html" title="User:Helicoid">Helicoid</a> 04:29, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>Above discussion copied from <a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis">User talk:Mel Etitis</a>. Forcing yourself into a conversation, making that conversation between you and the visiting user, and then demanding that it continue on the third person's talk page is quite rude. I am continuing this here.</small></p>

<dd>I apologize profusely. I had thought that when you said "Please, can we stop playing these endless games?", it was a request. It has become clear that you meant it as a rhetorical query about our collective capabilities, and what I meant to be forthrightness has most probably been perceived as a horrible rudeness. I have surely offended you and hope that you can forgive me. I am very sorry.</dd>
<dd>Due to my lesser intelligence, I have trouble understanding the "issue" you refer to. The Aetherometry pages were deleted because the community decided that the derogatory claims made in the talk pages were both well-founded and substantiated. I am but a lowly user of inadequate intelligence and I am certainly not the person to speak to about the consensus decision of my more intelligent peers, such as they reached at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aetherometry_%28second_nomination%29_349e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aetherometry (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aetherometry (second nomination)</a>, nor to speak about issues of true or false. If you give me enough time, I will try to do my best to formulate a response to any further posts you may have. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 04:56, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh come come, that's a patent lie. The Aetherometry entry was deleted because there is no mainstream literature about Aetherometry, one way or the other. This lack of literature includes the lack of any literature that would substantiate the derogatory claims. Or have you perhaps personally reproduced the experiments and obtained results different from the ones described in the primary literature on Aetherometry? Or do you agree with the results, but have an alternative and better explanation of the results? Speak up. How, in your view, how are the derogatory claims "substantiated"? <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelicoid_2d44.html" title="User:Helicoid">Helicoid</a> 05:58, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, you have some gall to say that I "forced myself" into the conversation. You were making insinuations about <b>me</b> in a public forum. Surely it is very proper for me to reply, no? <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelicoid_2d44.html" title="User:Helicoid">Helicoid</a> 06:02, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good weekend Helicoid.</dd>
<dd>Actually, I consider my initial post at to be quite proper. Mel had asked at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#What_are_the_policies_governing_the_.28non.29deletion_of_Talk_pages_for_deleted_articles.3F" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">the Village Pump</a>: "Nor is it clear to me what urgency there is in deleting them (any more than I can see the need to keep them). Is there some hiddn agenda here of which I'm unaware?". I dropped him a line pointing out what the "hidden agenda" may be. You jumped in saying that it was indeed the "hidden agenda", though your outrage at my initial post would hold more weight if your response to Mel's question had preceded mine.</dd>
<dd>I'm sure that some of my more intelligent colleagues have quoted many acronyms beginning with "WP:" in discussions with you in regards to the actual content of your post and perhaps applicable policies, so I will not bore either of us by attempting to replicate that conversation. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 13:09, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, your colleagues in WP (I don't think they have shown much sign of intelligence) have done, time and again, exactly what you are doing. People who don't know me from Adam and could not tell, if their life depended on it, what my ideas are, see fit to pronounce, in complete self-assurance, that I am a loon, a crackpot, a snake-oil-vendor, a fanatic, etc. And when I get frustrated and angered by this, they quote at me acronyms beginning with "WP". On the other hand, when <b>I</b> quote acronyms beginning with "WP" - such as the speedy-deletion rule for talk pages - they insinuate that this is "curious", and sufficient reason to do the opposite from what I ask. What in the world have I done to warrant this kind of treatment? Declared that the earth was flat and made of ground veal? Preached that ingestion of lye was the proper treatment for cancer? Promoted genocide, perhaps? No. I have declared my conviction that there is experimental and theoretical evidence that may very well support the claim of the existence of energy in massfree form, and that this evidence is worth examining. I am not asking anybody to share this conviction, and I certainly think that it doesn't make any sense to "share" it without minutely examining the evidence. But by the same token, it doesn't make any sense to judge it as "looniness" without minutely examining the evidence. Without examining the evidence, the only position that makes sense to me is to withhold judgement. Now, you called me a "pseudoscientifc loon", and you referred to the wanton name-calling that went on in the Aetherometry Talk pages, as "evidence". Do you not realize that the people who engaged in the name-calling had not examined any scientific evidence? They examined it as little as you did. Yet you, too, see fit to join them. Please, explain this to me. Treat me for a moment with the courtesy you would normally extend to strangers, and explain. It is the weekend, after all. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelicoid_2d44.html" title="User:Helicoid">Helicoid</a> 14:13, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
