<p>This article needs to be a little bigger. I for one,think that's a fact. Also,when exactly will Banjo-Threeie come out,and what is it about?

<dd>First off, please sign your comments and keep them in the correct form for the talk page. Second, while your questions are valid, there is a problem with them. The game was only announced three days ago and, with the announcement, a teaser trailer. Therefore, we have very limited information and cannot make the article any longer than it is, otherwise we risk adding repetition and nonsense. We do not know when the game will come out, we do not know what it will be about, we basically don't know anything yet. Until more information and pictures/videos of gameplay become available, the article should basically remain as is. --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 19:53, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Conker, there is more than 2 banjo kazooie games. Technically there is 6. The 2 n64 games, the 2 gba games, the cell phone game, and bk3. Ive played and beaten them all. My life revolves around this series (literally). --<a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallin_Tanjo22_284a.html" title="User:Dallin Tanjo22">Dallin Tanjo22</a> 22:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are two primary titles in the series, not six (three primary titles if you include BK3). The other games are only spin-offs of the first one. And I highly doubt you've played and beaten them all. Afterall, BK3 still doesn't even have a release date.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 13:39, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ive beaten all FIVE then. <a href="../../../g/r/u/Banjo-Kazooie%7E_Grunty%27s_Revenge_d256.html" title="Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge">Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge</a> is not a spin of. It is an interqual. It takes place between kazooie and tooie. Therefore there are 4 primary games and 2 spin offs. --<a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallin_Tanjo22_284a.html" title="User:Dallin Tanjo22">Dallin Tanjo22</a> 19:19, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You seem to be treating this as a message board, which is against policy. This page is for discussing changes in the article, not discussion of the games, themeselves. My message was to correct you, not to converse with you. However, I will reply once more. Grunty's Revenge, while it comes between the two games, does not mean it was a primary game. The game had very little advertising, it was a scaled back version of the other games, and it had a subpar storyline. Just because it strings the other games together, doesn't mean it is of the same quality and is given the same credit as the other two.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The first two games had heavy advertising, tons of work went into them, overall play time far exceeds the middle game, and the series is built around them. The series is not built around Grunty's Revenge. Also, the first two flow together; you don't need the middle game for the primary games to make sense. However, you do need at <i>least</i> the first game to make GR make any sense at all. In other words, the series wouldn't lose anything without GR, and it doesn't gain anything with it. This makes the game relatively useless to the series. Grunty's Revenge was nothing more than a spin-off to make money. --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 21:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey,I gotta useful tip.Banjo-Threeie (From what I've heard) is supposed to come out in March 26,2007.Or maybe not,I might be wrong.But I'm pretty sure I's going to be in the "Next Year" timeline.--<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConker_The_Squirrel_8693.html" title="User:Conker The Squirrel">Conker The Squirrel</a> 20:49, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for signing your message this time. As for what the message contained, you're wrong. There has been no release date announced. Why? Because they've only just started working on the game. Also, please do not add this information into the article. This is considered a rumor and it has no business being in the article.

<p>In the trailer it says Banjo is Back and it is closer to a title than Banjo Kazooie 3 because it has a logo and everything, I think the title of this page should be changed to Banjo is Back with Banjo Kazooie 3 being a redirect to here. Guess who i am 09:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely not. The most likely title for the third game is Banjo Threeie as it follows the idea set by Banjo Tooie by naming the next game what Grunty said at the end of the previous game. The reason Banjo-Kazooie 3 is the current title to the article is that all major gaming sites have this listed as the tentative title to the third game. The line, Banjo is Back, was meant to tell you, the viewer, that Banjo is coming back to the gaming world, not that it is the title. They put a copywrite on it so no one else could use the catch-phrase. If you go to Rareware's webpage and look it up, they explicitly state that they are not telling us the name of the game yet and that this information would come out in due course. Until then, the page should remain as is. --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 17:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I didn't get huffy. The only thing in my statement that may be considered remotely "huffy" was "Absolutely not." and, even then, it wasn't really huffy, it was letting you know exactly where I stood before I even started explaining. And, like I said before, well, just read the last reply. Unless this becomes the actual title for the game, it's all speculation, which, isn't allowed on Wikipedia as it's rumor and original research. This tentative title is "safe" as it isn't rumored and it can't be taken as original research. It's just informing you about the third Banjo-Kazooie game (hence: Banjo-Kazooie 3); nothing more, nothing less.--<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 12:12, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really hope they decide to name it Banjo Threeie. I loved the first two games. Maybe if you want to put in some rumors and talk, you can put under a new section of rumors or something. PIrish makes a good point too. The title hopefully will follow the traditional naming process of the Banjo Kazooie series.&#160;:D --Relyk 22:43, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with rumors is that it's all original research and wikipedia has a strict policy on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. That's why everything has to be verifiable on these articles. While I think the title will most likely be Banjo Threeie, I can't put it in the article because I came to that conclusion on my own, in other words, I was not told by Rare or Microsoft that it would be the title. It has to come from a reliable source and, if it doesn't, it can't be included. Therefore, we cannot have a rumor section for this reason. --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 13:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to disturb,but I just want to know if Grunty will be a playable character,or a main villan(AGAIN).I'm pretty sure she's going to be a villan,rather than a playable character...After all,she did say in the end of Banjo-Tooie(Which I'am playing right now)"Just you wait until Banjo-Threeie!".I'm not complaining,infact,it's about time the game will come out.If I'm asking too much,and that the information has yet to be comfirlmed,my bad.I'm just so ancstious to get it for my 360,<b>IT HURTS</b>.<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConker_The_Squirrel_8693.html" title="User:Conker The Squirrel">Conker The Squirrel</a> 16:37, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been wondering if this game has any chance of being released on the Wii too. I know that it says XBOX 360 on the trailer, and that Microsoft bought Rare, but the series has been on Nintendo the whole time, so you'd think that it might be on the Wii. Has Rare said specifically what consoles this game will be on?</p>
<dl>
<dd>When Rare got bought by Microsoft, all of Rare's characters went with it. There are only one or two characters that were originally Nintendo (I think Conker was one of them) that Nintendo actually got to keep when they switched ownership. Therefore, since Banjo and Kazooie are NOT Nintendo creations, they will go to Microsoft. This game will not be coming to the Wii unless Microsoft up and decides it doesn't want to own Rare anymore, which is highly unlikely since Rare is doing so well for them (<a href="../../../e/l/e/Kameo%7E_Elements_of_Power_8120.html" title="Kameo: Elements of Power">Kameo: Elements of Power</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/v/Viva_Pinata_abbf.html" title="Viva Pinata">Viva Pinata</a>). --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 03:54, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Am I the only one who thinks the new character designs are horrendously ugly? It looks like they've had a long night of drinking, woke up in a bathtub full of ice with a dull ache near their kidneys, and then went off to film the trailer. -<a href="../../../j/h/f/User%7EJHFTC_516e.html" title="User:JHFTC">Toptomcat</a> 13:21, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please keep discussions on the talk page to discussions of the article, not the game. For discussion of the game, please find an online forum.
