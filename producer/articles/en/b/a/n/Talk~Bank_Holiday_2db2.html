<p>In the US, the term "bank holiday" sometimes refers to the practice during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> of forcing banks to close to prevent the rapid withdrawal of all funds from a bank, which would have led to bank insolvency of course. Thus bank holidays were used to slow down panic attacks. -- Myria 22:09, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>the "Bank Holiday" of 1933 that you are refering to created a new type of banking in the united States of America, look in Blacks Law Dictionary Fourth edition, member banks of the Federal Reserve System can only conduct banking business during an emergency declaired by the President. Are the banks open? Yes, and we are still under that national emergency declaired by FDR. The Tradeing with the Enemy Act of 1917 was also ammended by FDR to include citizens of the United States as the enemy's. January 26, 2005</p>

<dd>The mention of US bank holidays is relevant since there is a such a term in the united states, but with a rather different meaning. It would be possible to split this article into "Bank Holiday (US)" and "Bank Holiday (UK)" (with the latter receiving the redirect from Bank Holiday), but there isn't enough info for a whole US article at the moment. I've made the US reference into a footnote as is used on other articles where a term has a secondary minor but relevant meaning.

<dd>As far as I can ascertain, the term "bank holiday" in Australia refers to a local holiday (on which banks are required to close in a defined district). The only "state"-wide Bank Holiday with that name is the Australian Capital Territory's first Monday in August holiday. New South Wales also has a "Bank Holiday" on the same date but it does not apply state-wide, and there are a number of districts in NSW with their own local holidays under the Banks and Bank Holidays Act 1912. Queensland also has local holidays called "bank holidays" (but are not "public holidays" as legally defined). Is all or any of this worth mentioning in the article, do you think? -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 9 July 2005 12:14 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quote: <i>Recent practice by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> governments has been for the May Bank Holiday to be on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">8 May</a> in years where it would otherwise fall on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a>, presumably out of a desire to avoid the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialist</a> connotations of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_Day_2f10.html" title="May Day">International Workers' Day</a>.

<p>This <b>only</b> happened in 1995. While it is true that the May Day holiday is not popular with many sections of the Conservative Party (very likely for the reasons mentioned above), this holiday has fallen on a Monday only twice under Conservative governments since its introduction in 1978: in 1989 and 1995. In 1989 it was celebrated on 1 May, the first Monday. In 1995 it was moved for one year to the second Monday, 8 May, "to commemorate the 50th anniversary of VE-Day". -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 14:02, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says that Boxing Day could, strictly speaking, be on either 26th or 27th of December, because it's the first weekday following Christmas, citing the example of a Saturday Chrismtas bumping Boxing Day to Monday.</p>
<p>But if Christmas Day is on a Friday, Monday will still be the next weekday, making Boxing Day the 28th of December. If someone can confirm that, could they update the article?</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's the older definition of <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=weekday" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=weekday" rel="nofollow">weekday</a> as 'any day except Sunday'. Boxing Day automatically then occurs on the 27th, and is not a 'holiday in lieu of' (the day 'in lieu of Christmas' is therefor on the Tuesday as the next available non-statutory day). If the 26th is a Saturday then 'Boxing Day' is that day, and the 'holiday in lieu of' occurs on the Monday.</dd>

<p>In England and Wales, if 1 January falls at the weekend and the bank holiday is taken on the following Monday, is the 1 January a public holiday? My assumption is that it is not. Can anybody confirm this? Is the answer the same in Scotland - in respect of both 1 and 2 January?</p>
<p>NB. At Christmas, I understand that when the 25th and/or 26th occur at the weekend and the bank holidays are taken on the 26th, 27th or 28th (as appropriate), the 25th and/or 26th are public holidays.</p>
<p>This question is asked in respect of the enforcement of parking regulation where the relevant traffic order will control whether the regulations apply on bank holidays, which by virtue of O'Neill v George (1968) SJ 128 are taken as including any public holiday.</p>

<p>"Bank holidays are so called because they are days upon which banks are shut and therefore (traditionally) no other businesses could operate..." I'm still not really clear about this, as the generic terms used here in Australia are "public holiday" and "school holiday". Are there holidays in the UK -- other than school holidays -- on which banks are open? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 15:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
