<p>It is said that China banned 'ben hur' in 1930. the film wasn't released until post-war, so i'm assuming this means that book (as this is where the link goes). however, this is a list of banned films, not books.</p>

<dd>The movie was actually unbanned and made available on VHS and VCD almost a year later iirc. My cousin has a legal copy of the movie on VHS - bought it soon after the movie was unbanned iirc. I last saw the movie available on VideoCD next to Babe II at a video store I frequent. And on that point, I don't believe Babe II was ever banned- iirc it was being promoted over the radio quite heavily.219.93.44.71 08:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IMDB is not wrong, they are two of the most famous banned films ever in the UK? Read the review below, it states everything.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually Straw Dogs was according to this website banned for many years on video. This from another website&#160;:</dd>
<dd><b><i>During the early 1980s Straw Dogs was made available on home video in the original cinema version. Prior to the introduction of the Video Recordings Act (VRA) in 1984 it was not necessary for video releases to be separately classified by the BBFC and so Straw Dogs was released on video on the basis of its existing ‘X’ cinema certificate. After the introduction of the VRA it became necessary, however, for Straw Dogs to achieve a separate video classification certifying its suitability for ‘home viewing’. Under the staggered system for classifying the huge number of videos already on the market it was necessary for English language films classified by the BBFC between 1st January 1970 and 31st December 1974 to receive a video classification, or be withdrawn from circulation, by 1st March 1988. Straw Dogs was therefore legally available on video in the UK, uncut and without a video certificate, until March 1988.</i></b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Along with The Exorcist and Death Wish, Straw Dogs was ultimately removed from video shops in 1988 because the BBFC’s then Director, James Ferman, did not feel that it would be appropriate to classify this particular film for video release ‘at that time’.</b></i> <a href="http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/case_study_strawdogs.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/case_study_strawdogs.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
<dd>As the article goes on it explains that it wouldn't be till 2002 that the film would be uncut. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELummie_02bc.html" title="User:Lummie">Lummie</a> 03:16, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People need to be REALLY CAREFUL when saying that a film is banned in the PRC. Most films are not banned, in fact very few are. What happens is that the Chinese government imposes an import quota on foreign movies (I think it's about 20 movies a year) and won't allow more than that quota in theaters regardless of how non-political and non-sensitive the films are.</p>
<p>This isn't censorship, it is market <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectionism.html" title="Protectionism">protectionism</a>. The government is afraid that foreign films with big SFX budgets and big name actors (EVERYBODY in China knows the big Hollywood stars) will take box office earnings away from domestic movies and bankrupt domestic film companies.</p>
<p>You also need to be careful when saying that something is available on DVD. The chances are that the DVD version of a foreign film that is not in theaters will be pirate.</p>

<p>Looking at what people claim to be an injunction against "The Profit" there seems to be no nationwide injunctive in place against its showing. I don’t think “The Profit” is banned in the US. According to what people claim to be an “injunction” it was only prohibited from being shown immediately prior to jury selection. Indeed, it is pretty much impossible in the US to obtain any larger “prior restraint” against people. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/TheProfit/injunction.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/TheProfit/injunction.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/TheProfit/injunction.pdf</a></p>

<dd>I'm speculating it says on the DVD/VCD cover it's for non-Muslims only. Potentially vendors may be required to check the <a href="../../../m/y/k/MyKad_d1db.html" title="MyKad">MyKad</a> or more likely I suspect may just tell the person it's for non-Muslims only. More likely (obviously this wouldn't be directed by law) racial profiling may be involved and vendors may carry out one or both of the earlier suggestions if a <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay.html" title="Malay">Malay</a> person (or someone who looks like one) tries to buy a copy. Most likely though I suspect this ban isn't really enforced (and given how easy it would be to obtain a pirated copy there is really no point and also I suspect most Muslims aren't particularly interested in watching it either). Having said that a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> in possesion or caught viewing the movie could probably be prosecuted under Malaysia's <a href="../../../s/y/a/Syariah.html" title="Syariah">Syariah</a> law for Muslims. Note that alcohol and other non-<a href="../../../h/a/l/Halal.html" title="Halal">Halal</a> food products like those derived from pigs are widely available in Malaysia.

<p>I have some concerns about the China section. One of the problems is that China only allows a limited number of imported movies every year as the article states (I've heard the it's 25). As such, it's difficult for us to claim a certain motive for not showing a film, even if it is a box office hit unless an official in the PRC gives such a reason. Note that the reason why I'm aware of this is because the recent Bond flick was the first ever to be shown. However we don't mention any of them (and some of them did touch on China somewhat). What I think we should do is only report cases were we have a reliable source which suggest the Chinese have a certain motive in not showing the film. We can attribute this claim to said source and we can also mention the official reason and let the reader decide. If there is no reliable source which makes any claim about why the movie was not shown we should not mention it at all. It is not up to us to decide why certain movies were not shown or suggest movies weren't shown because the Chinese officials didn't like the content, such an attempt would fall foul of verifiblity and OR policies. Currently, the Brokeback Mountain article includes references which attribute motives and includes the official Chinese reason. When I have time I'll copy these to this article if someone hasn't done it already. The rest are likely to be removed unless references can be found to support the claims. P.S. I'll keep the banned outright ones which are a different issue <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 10:25, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
