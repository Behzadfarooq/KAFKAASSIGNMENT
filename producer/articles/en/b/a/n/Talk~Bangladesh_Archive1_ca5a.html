<p>Just a quick question, is it possible to obtain arial Maps of villages in Bangladesh via the internet.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Early Civilization in Bangladesh</p>
<p>The short passage on early civilization in Bangladesh mentions evidence of Buddhist monasteries from around 700 BC. If, however, the life of Buddha and the subsequent rise of Buddhism as a movement are to be dated around 500 BC (as the page on Siddharta Gautama maintains), this claim is blatantly false.</p>
<p>The History of Bangladesh page, on the other hand, begins its story at the arrival of Islam, so it is of little help here.</p>

<i>"<b>The initial seeds</b> of Independence was sown by the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_Movement_f5bd.html" title="Language Movement">Language Movement</a> of 1952"</i> is a controversial statement if not false.</p>

<dd>"When Indian independence was achieved in 1947, political motivations caused it to be divided into a predominantly Muslim Pakistan and a predominantly Hindu India."</dd>

<p>"political motivations" caused a division?

<p>It certainly is odd. The obvious reason for a division between Hindu and Muslim is religion, not politics. If the writer is denying that he should justify it.</p>
<p>He refers to the "divide-and-rule" notion of the British, I believe. I think the sentences is badly worded. What he tries to mean, I think, is:</p>
<p>The division was done on the basis of religion but there was a political motive to devide, i.e. the people didn't break it up themselves due to religious differences.</p>
<p>Does that sound right?</p>

<dd>You are totally right. Divisions are called bibhags (বিভাগ) and districts are called zila or jela (জেলা) officially. So if you want to add them in, sure. There are also Union Councils (union porishod - ইউনিয়ন পরিশদ) that are part of the "Local Government". There is an increasing effort to strengthen Local Government but it's an on-going process. <a href="../../../u/r/n/User%7EUrnonav_4b88.html" title="User:Urnonav">Urnonav</a></dd>

<dd>upozila is an obsolete term. it was used as an administrative unit a lot during Ershad's regime but has not found popularity later since thanas were actually better defined. mouza is the same issue. <a href="../../../u/r/n/User%7EUrnonav_4b88.html" title="User:Urnonav">Urnonav</a></dd>
<dd>Yeah, the same unit gets renamed from upazila to "thana" or vice-versa each successive Govt. So we had thana-upazila-thana-upazila-thana over the last 4 govts. Now it is called thana. However, the comment on <b>mouza</b> is not correct, it is still quite widely used for administrative and land measurement purposes. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 04:47, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Odd...on my trip to Bangladesh (Just recently, I was there for the month of January 2005), I heard the term "Thana" used only once or twice. At the University &amp; the Academy I stayed at, most of the professors, students, and staff were using the term Upazila. Do thanas differ from upazilas in name only, or also geographic area represented? <a href="../../../j/x/n/User%7EJxn_62cf.html" title="User:Jxn">Jxn</a> 15:20, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, to make it clear, here is the whole story. "Thana" means police station, and since the British colonial period, it was a lower level administrative unit. When BNP was in power in the late '70s, they used this widely to promote their canal-digging and other campaigns. However, the unit was more oriented to police level administration than civil administration. Now, in the 80s, the Ershad Govt decided to have a newer level of unit which would be lower than District level, higher than Union level, and would be elected by votes. So they renamed "Thana" to "Upazila". When BNP govt came to power again in 1991, they thought it was better to revert to their own term, "Thana". Then came Awami League govt in 1996 which thought "Thana" was too BNP-ish. So they reverted to "Upazila". Then came BNP govt in 2001, and as usual, they reverted to "Thana". Make your own conclusions from this tug-of-war. In normal people's mind, it really doesn't matter (except for getting a few offices in their areas rather than district head quarters). People usually use the word "Thana" to mean police stations, and still use the term "Upazila" to mean the administrative unit, but that use is not correct officially. End of story. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 21:36, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoa... this discussion is going on for too long. Ok, my comment on mouza needs clarification. I know it's not obsolete, but it's not used as administrative use anymore. At least I have never seen it being used that way. The only places I have seen it are marriage certificates and land deeds! The deal with thana and upozila was clarified by Ragib. I believe for Wikipedia articles, we could mention both words. There are some cases for using thana. Ok, now every thana is very clearly identified - there's a police station! However, upozilas, because of the tug-of-war Ragib mentioned, were incompletely established. Some have upozilla headquarters; most don't.</dd>

<dd>There is also a zone problem. For example, in Dhaka, no one will ever talk about Mohammadpur upozila, but there is a Mohammadpur thana. Election zones are defined in terms of thana too. So, thana is more universal, although more used in metropolitan areas that don't have upozilas. Upozila is particularly important for rural areas! Upozila is a term preferred by the rural government advocates. It creates a basis for creation of an alternative decentralised local governing system, whose head can be possibly associated with the upozilla. Just to break it down, upozila means "sub-district" (and was intended to indicate townships).</dd>

<dd>Thank you so much for your help in explaining all of this! The association between upozilas and rural areas makes much sense in context of my recent visit to bangladesh (other than hearing all the university staff constantly refer to the term upozila because the University is in Dhaka), because I spent the majority of my time in the villages outside of Bogra. I think I am finally starting to understand the way divisions work in the country.

<dd>Namibia's coastline, according to the CIA FActbook, is 1 572 km long, and most of it is continuous sandy beach. I would say that this very much casts into question any claim by Cox's Bazar that they have the world's longest beach at a mere 120 km.
<dl>
<dd>The question is, what would you define as a <b>beach</b>. Having been to Cox's Bazaar, I can definitely attest the fact that all of the 120 km of Cox's Bazaar is a continuous sandy beach and maintained as such. It is quite doubtful that you can claim the coastline of a whole country as a single beach. Cox's Bazaar is unique because it is considered as a single beach rather than a coastline (in case of Namibia, I presume that you are claiming a whole coastline, without any port or harbors, which would really be unusual). Quoting from <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach.html" title="Beach">Beach</a>, "There are several beaches which are claimed to be the "world's longest", including Cox's Bazar, Fraiser Island beach, 90 Mile Beaches in Australia and New Zealand and Long Beach, Washington (which is about 30km). Wasaga Beach, Ontario on Georgian Bay claims to have the world's longest freshwater beach.". I don't see anyone claiming the entire coastline of Namibia as a single beach. Cox's Bazaar is, which is the main claim expressed in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">here</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach.html" title="Beach">here</a>. I had reworded the claim from "The longest beach" to "Many people claim Cox's Bazaar as world's longest beach". Since there is no definitive survey or authority in declaring in either your or my favor, I'm reverting to my edit of the line. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 20:02, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You've just proved my point, actually. There are several claimants to the title, and Ninety Mile Beach in Victoria, Australia is aptly named if the map is anything to go by (although the beach in New Zealand with that same name is not). You forgot to mention Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia, by the way. It, too, is acurately named. Therefore, I think Wikipedia is justified in saying that the beach at Cox's Bazar is 120 km long, and perhaps even in saying that it is one of the world's longer beaches. However, it cannot state flatly that it is the longest. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelisi_9a88.html" title="User:Kelisi">Kelisi</a> 20:16, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is it a problem to say "is often claimed to be the longest"? Is it non-factual to say that people claim it to be such? I really don't like the "albeit erroneously" at all. Doesn't the "often claimed" say pretty clearly that it is just that; a claim, and not even a claim that everyone that lives or is associated with the place makes?<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer"></a>—<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer">iFaqeer</a> <a href="../../../i/f/a/User_talk%7EIFaqeer_6379.html" title="User talk:IFaqeer">(Talk to me!)</a> 21:57, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a problem because there are other beaches which are longer. I have named a few. Wikipedia, as far as I understand, is for disseminating <i>knowledge</i>, not people's vanity. It's a long beach, but not the longest. I have already suggested an alternative wording. If you don't like the "albeit erroneously" bit, change it as I have suggested. Just don't call it the world's longest beach, or even that people claim it is, because that's twaddle. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelisi_9a88.html" title="User:Kelisi">Kelisi</a> 01:23, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kelisi, I agree with your point. However, people <i>are</i> claiming it is the longest beach, aren't they? So, the sentence is technically right. However, Wikipedia stresses on not using terminologies like "many claim", "some claim", "there are claims". The best is to mention that the beach at Cox's Bazar's stretches over 120 km without any interruption and all of it is maintained as a single tourist spot. I personally object to your correction because the sentence becomes meaningless. Apologies if I am offending you because the structure " Cox's Bazar, south of Chittagong, has a 120 km-long natural beach, which is often, albeit erroneously, claimed as world's longest continuous natural beach" is, without any hesitation, a very badly formed sentence. If it is wrong why is the sentence there? If it is not, why write it? I am restructuring the sentence to avoid all your points of views. Please pursue a correction, if required.

<p>I totally agree with you as far as the character assassination goes but the article is still far from neutral even now Although better than before and not historically vague as we have seen previous versions but consider the following: <i>To worsen the situation Mujib in January 1975 introduces BAKSAL, a Mujib loyalist paramilitary, in order to reinforce his dictatorship. BAKSAL replaced the multi-party parliamentary democracy, banned independent newspapers, and demolished civil rights. Thousands of opposition political leaders were killed and abducted by the BAKSAL and most of them abductees never returned.</i></p>

I believe the issue with <a href="../../../z/i/a/Ziaur_Rahman_70b2.html" title="Ziaur Rahman">Ziaur Rahman</a>'s declaration being on the 27th is based on a shaky argument and I have yet not seen any reference backing this up. True, the declaration wasn't heard by anyone as it was made but it <i>was</i> made on the 26th from the books and records I have seen so far. Also, the section tends to potray the <a href="../../../m/u/k/Mukti_Bahini_a788.html" title="Mukti Bahini">Mukti Bahini</a> as a rather useless group that made these so-called "harassing attacks" and mainly provided intelligence to some invisible Indian Army!

<li>I think, and from eyewitness accounts I have heard from others in Bangladesh, that the declaration by <a href="../../../z/i/a/Ziaur_Rahman_70b2.html" title="Ziaur Rahman">Ziaur Rahman</a> was made on March 27. When I was in primary/high school in Bangladesh, our textbooks used to state that fact. However, controversy started when Awami League govt came to power and claimed that the on march 26, MA Hannan declared the msg. I found a reference from Pakistani Army PR officer Major Siddique Saliq's book that a faint radio transmission was made after <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman_3007.html" title="Sheikh Mujibur Rahman">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> was arrested, but that was probably not heard by any. The funnier part started after BNP regained power and this time, the declaration date by Zia was moved to March 26. I asked my parents and others who happened to be in Chittagong, they all agreed that they first heard any declaration of independence from Zia's message, but the date was definitely March 27. There may be an earlier message by MA Hannan, but that was not heard by the majority. Indian transmitters/BBC rebroadcast Zia's message so it definitely IS the declaration of independence. But the date is most likely to be March 27. I don't know what the textbooks of BD say now, but it was March 27 until quite recently. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 17:43, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The declaration deal is very murky to me as well. My parents were on the virtual geographic opposite of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chittagong.html" title="Chittagong">Chittagong</a> and so were most other people I know who were there in Bangladesh during the turmoil. They mention various dates but obviously they all heard <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> re-broadcasts. The interesting thing here is that some people mention 27th as the date on which they got the information from BBC. That inspires me to believe that the declaration might have been made very late on 26th or very early on 27th. So, the information currently in use on the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Liberation_War_b476.html#Declaration_of_independence" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">Bangladesh Liberation War page</a> might actually be right. However, assuming a declaration on 27th by Major Rahman still leaves us or Wikipedia readers in a bit of darkness about why 26th March became the Independence Day. So, are we assuming that <a href="../../../m/_/a/M_A_Hannan_65fd.html" title="M A Hannan">M A Hannan</a>'s declaration happened on the 26th and hence the date's importance? In that case, I need some references to rectify the errors in the dates mentioned on various pages.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Who was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman really working for?</span></h2>
<p>Recently it has been brought to my attention that SMR was actually an Indian agent whose job was to orchestrate and ensure the breaking away of East Pakistan from West Pakistan. It has been alleged that SMR <i><b>never</b></i> would have <i><b>won</b></i> the elections, had Indian spies not stuffed a lot of ballot boxes for him or had not had them stuffed by poor poll station staff by paying them off. It seems that the Indians had a win win situation on their hands: If Pakistan hands over government to SMR, India takes over Pakistan by proxy through SMR in control of Pakistani government. If Pakistan refuses to hand over government to SMR, SMR gets a nice clean excuse to declare independence from Pakistan. Either way, India succeeds in damaging Pakistan. What say you to this conspiracy theory? <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Toby_Belch_53eb.html" title="User:Sir Toby Belch">Sir Toby Belch</a> 09:41, 11 August 2005 (UTC) (Note: I did not pull this theory out from my you know what, people are really claiming that this is what really happened))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't give too much credit to the RAW - the "secret service" of India. They are so secretive that no one knows what the heck they did or even where they operate but this is taking it a bit too far. If the conspiracy theory that SMR was a setup of India, the Indians either had some kind of unbelievable ballot stuffing process that was almost invisible and executed perfectly - which is impossible or this whole this is just another fabrication by the ISI. Even Indira Gandhi couldn't escape the election fraud charges in her own country after she was found guilty on it. So is it really plausible that a similar exercise across all 169 seats in an alien land would have netted a near 100% success without a shred of evidence?</dd>

<p>I'm somewhat amused at the different attempts that still go on after long 35 years to "justify" the defeat of West Pakistan in 1971. Sheikh Mujib had everything to gain from Indian help, and he may have taken it. However, that doesn't make him an Indian agent ... unless you call every leader of Pakistan an American/CIA agent. The logic behind your conspiracy theory is laughable, so I won't dwell on that. Yahya Khan tried Sheikh Mujib and others on the same conspiracy charge (The Agartala Conspiracy Case), and Sheikh Mujib was freed on all counts. That was during Pakistan period!! Besides, you are not aware of the huge popularity of Awami League at that time. Finally, I'm really curious about the inability of Pakistanis to this day to accept the defeat ... hey we Bengalis didn't want to be oppressed, sidelined, so we elected our own government .... whether that helped India or not wasn't really a matter in consideration. The Army didn't gave us power, and started killing people, and the war commenced. What is unclear about the whole issue? --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 14:57, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to correct you on that. It's not most pakistanis but a few pakistanis. most of them just don't want to discuss the "double humiliation". one was losing to a so called inferior race - the bengalis and the other was surrendering enmasse to their arch rivals: India. no countryman would like to see the back of a certain portion, especially the more populated and fertile portion to be cut off in under a fortnight. So some made up this justification that it was "not needed anyway" or "we are better off now" etc to feel better rather than accept the embarassing failure.</dd>

Almost all foreign / non-native speakers pronounces the word "Bangla" like the word "Bang". Meaning of "Bang" is not good. But the main point is that ... "Bangla" is getting pronounced wrongly. That is the reason i've added the correct pronunciation words, which should be pronounced by all and correctly.<br />

<p>Are you saying ... foreigners / non-native speakers are pronouncing the word "Bangla" like in "Bangladesh" and language "Bangla" correctly ?<br />
Then you're absolutely wrong. It is not easy for them to grasp quickly. And i think you're misunderstanding why i've added that paragraph. i want the pronunciation to be clear to all foreign / non-native speakers, by giving reference to the correct words. If you want, you are very welcome to include a better or more correct pronunciation reference words. So others know the correct pronunciation.<br />

<p>Response from Wikipedia member "Ragib" : There is the IPA (International phonetic alphabet) for doing exactly the same thing as you are looking for. Please look into that, instead of adding non-standard text into articles. Thanks.<br />

<p>Below paragraph is for "Bangladesh" page :<br />
Actual pronunciation of "Bangladesh" is ... <i>bäng-lä-desh</i> ("Bung-laa-day-sh"), letter "a" in the "<i>Bang</i>" is pronounced like the word "<a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungalow.html" title="Bungalow">Bungalow</a>"(single story house), or like the letter "a" in the words "<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a>" or "fathar". "<i>La</i>" is pronounced like the beginning of the word "<a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunch.html" title="Lunch">Lunch</a>" or "<a href="../../../l/a/v/Lava.html" title="Lava">Lava</a>". And the letter "e" in the "<i>desh</i>" is pronounced like the "e" in the words "<a href="../../../e/n/d/End.html" title="End">end</a>" or "met".</p>
<p>Below paragraph is for "Bengali Language" Page :<br />
Actual pronunciation of the word "Bangla" is ... <i>bäng-lä</i> ("Bung-laa") ... letter "a" in the "<i>Bang</i>" is pronounced like the beginning of the word "<a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungalow.html" title="Bungalow">Bungalow</a>"(single story house), or like the letter "a" in the words "art" or "fathar".

So more than 70% people on internet cannot see many characters used in the IPA/unicode, instead they see a ractangular blank box in that character place, that is why we need to explain things in another alternative way. To make a clear conception of correct pronunciation, using example of different words, as well as IPA, is completely fine, and in my opinion, even better. Using only <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a>, doesn't clarify the pronunciation.

<p>Without disturbing the existing ones, have added a map of <a href="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/maps/images/bangladesh/Political.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/maps/images/bangladesh/Political.gif" rel="nofollow">Bangladesh</a> with Rail and Road links. Suggestions (spelling, region, etc.) welcome. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiljoshi_730b.html" title="User:Miljoshi"><font style="color:#5A3696">ΜιĿ</font></a>ː<a href="../../../m/i/l/User_talk%7EMiljoshi_e74b.html" title="User talk:Miljoshi"><font style="color:#008000">talk</font></a> 11:28, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Map needed with clear demarcation of region</span></h2>
<p>a new map with just the regions is required. no names of small cities etc. maximum the state capitals if required. something on the lines of those that exist in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> articles. A new reader would find it confusing to make out the regions of Nepal. I'd do it but I'm not into imaging etc. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 05:11, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>also added a peer review request to improve this article. see top of page. Wanted to inform editors involved in this article to try and make this FA. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 06:15, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h2>
<p>Being a native Bengali speaker, I find it strange to argue with David Matthews (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Matthews_ff5a.html" title="User talk:David Matthews">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Matthews_b14d.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Matthews">contribs</a>) on the meaning of Bangladesh. Desh means country. Bhumi means land. Bangladesh is not called Bongo-bhumi. If you need any more information on the translation, let me know, but other than that, please don't add a wrong translation of the country's name. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 02:11, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nawab</span></h2>
<p>"Dhaka became an important provincial center of Mughal administration as the seat of the Nawab. The Bengali ethnic and linguistic identity probably crystallized during this period" -- Doubtful. The Sultan's if Bengal such as Giyasuddin Ajam Shah played a crucial role, as did the Palas in "crystalizing" the Bengali identity. --<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmitra_a0eb.html" title="User:Shmitra">ppm</a> 17:39, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
