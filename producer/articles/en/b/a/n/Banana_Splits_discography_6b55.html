The Banana Splits' 1969 single "Long Live Love"</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Banana Splits</b> were a musical group of four animal characters; <b>Fleegle</b>, a beagle; <b>Bingo</b>, a gorilla; <b>Drooper</b>, a lion; and <b>Snorky</b>, an elephant; (played by actors in costumes), who starred in their own successful television series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Banana_Splits_Adventure_Hour_3a1d.html" title="The Banana Splits Adventure Hour">The Banana Splits Adventure Hour</a></i>.</p>
<p>The Banana Splits' <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubblegum_pop.html" title="Bubblegum pop">bubblegum pop</a> <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a> was provided by studio professionals, including <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Kooper_1a13.html" title="Al Kooper">Al Kooper</a> ("You're the Lovin' End"), <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_White_714e.html" title="Barry White">Barry White</a> ("Doin' the Banana Split"), and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Pitney_5646.html" title="Gene Pitney">Gene Pitney</a> ("Two Ton Tessie"). The music director was prolific songwriter and producer Mark Barkan<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> who also co-wrote the main theme (as well as other songs used in the series) with Ritchie Adams. According to an interview in DISCoveries magazine, Adams and Barkan sang "Wait Til Tomorrow," "We're The Banana Splits" and "The Tra La La Song". David Mook produced all of the released tracks (co-producing the single sides <i>Long Live Love</i> and <i>Pretty Painted Carousel</i> with Aaron Schroeder), credited as "A Past, Present and Future Production by David Mook for Hanna-Barbera Productions, Inc." (Mook also co-wrote the theme songs for <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Barris_f543.html" title="Chuck Barris">Chuck Barris</a>' <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dating_Game_d8ae.html" title="The Dating Game">The Dating Game</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Newlywed_Game_2ae3.html" title="The Newlywed Game">The Newlywed Game</a></i>.) Arranger <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Eskew_0483.html" title="Jack Eskew">Jack Eskew</a> also orchestrated some of the Splits' tunes. Three singles, "The Tra La La Song", "Wait Till Tomorrow", and "Long Live Love" were released by the Splits along with an album, <i>We're the Banana Splits</i>. Two 45 RPM EP records with four songs each were available via an offer on the back of <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellogg%27s.html" title="Kellogg's">Kellogg's</a> cereal boxes. Two of the three singles as well as both EPs were issued with picture sleeves.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Bootleg recording">bootleg recording</a> of all the released Splits recordings was made and released on CD in 1995 on the Hollywood Library label. (This CD was mastered from vinyl sources at a slightly increased speed, with some rather heavy-handed noise-reduction, resulting in a noticeable echo effect, especially at the end of songs.) One song, "Wait Til Tomorrow", later appeared on a various artists bubblegum hits CD, sourced from the Hollywood Library bootleg. Fake reproductions of the Decca Records album also appeared during the 1990s. They are identifiable by the absence of the Decca Records logo from the lower right corner of the front cover, and the elimination of all references to Decca Records on the back cover. Additionally, all copies are white label promos (the Decca logo does appear on the label). An earlier, picture disc vinyl bootleg also appeared in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The Banana Splits also released the following singles and albums:</p>
<p><i>45 RPM Singles</i></p>
<p>(1968) Decca 32391 Wait Til Tomorrow/We're The Banana Splits</p>
<p>(1968) Decca 32429 <i>The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana) (Single Version</i>)/Toy Piano Melody</p>
<p>(1969) Decca 73256 <i>Long Live Love</i>/<i>Pretty Painted Carousel</i></p>
<p><i>(All Decca singles were released in mono mixes. Song titles in italics were not included on the</i> We're The Banana Splits <i>album. Decca singles 32429 and 73256 were issued with picture sleeves; Decca 32391 was not--although foreign releases of the first single had picture sleeves.)</i></p>
<p><i>45 Extended Play Records</i></p>
<p>(1969) Hanna-Barbera 34578 <i>Kellogg's Presents The Banana Splits</i></p>
<p><i>Side One</i>: The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana) (Alternate Mix)/That's The Pretty Part Of You</p>
<p><i>Side Two</i>: It's A Good Day For A Parade/The Very First Kid On My Block</p>
<p>(1969) Hanna-Barbera 34579 <i>Kellogg's Presents The Banana Splits</i></p>
<p><i>Side One</i>: Doin' The Banana Split (Alternate Mix)/I Enjoy Being A Boy (In Love With You)</p>
<p><i>Side Two</i>: The Beautiful Calliopa/Let Me Remember You Smiling</p>
<p><i>("The Tra La La Song" and "Doin' The Banana Split" are the same takes included on the</i> We're The Banana Splits <i>album. However, as released here, they are presented in "twin-track" stereo mixes, with vocals in one channel and instruments in the other, not unlike some of the early Beatles stereo mixes. These records were sold together as a Kellogg's cereal box offer, and were released through Hanna-Barbera's premium division. They came in a mailer including unique outer artwork, showing Fleegle holding the two discs. Both were issued in art sleeves featuring drawings of the characters; advertisements promoting these discs on the back of contemporary Kellogg's cereal boxes showed slightly different artwork, and had a copyright date of 1968 rather than 1969. In the prototype artwork for the second disc used in the cereal box ad, it is more clear that the Banana Buggy is driving atop the surface of a 45 RPM record.)</i></p>
<p><i>Album</i></p>
<p>(1968) Decca DL-75075 <i>We're The Banana Splits</i></p>
<p><i>Side One</i>: We're The Banana Splits/I'm Gonna Find A Cave/This Spot/Doin' The Banana Split/Toy Piano Melody/Soul</p>
<p><i>Side Two</i>: The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)/Wait Til Tomorrow/You're The Lovin' End/In New Orleans/Two Ton Tessie/Don't Go Away--Go-Go Girl</p>
<p><i>(All songs on the album are true stereo mixes. There are two minor cover variations. The earliest pressings had a darker green color and had no copyright notice, which on some copies was added on a small yellow sticker. Later pressings are a lighter shade of green and have a copyright notice printed directly in the lower left corner of the front cover. Counterfeit versions of the vinyl album appeared in the late 1990s. They carry a white promo Decca label, but have all other references to Decca Records removed, including the front cover logo. The songs also fade out slightly earlier than on the original album.)</i></p>
<p><i>Compact Discs</i></p>
