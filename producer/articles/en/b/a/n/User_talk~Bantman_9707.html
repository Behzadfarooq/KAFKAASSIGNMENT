<p>Something went wrong on your last edit of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>. Most of the page got duplicated. I reverted the edit to clear this up, but I probably therefore dropped your intended edit. Can you look this over?</p>
<p>BTW, this has happened twice before on 1951. It might have something to do with the "births" and "deaths" subsections having duplicate names; I don't know.</p>

<p>Great work so far, keep up the good work. But while you are adding so much info, why not take a second to cite individual facts? That makes later fact checking so much easier and helps improve the demonstrable reliability of the article. The percieved lack of reliability is about the only thing wikipedia's critics have left. So do what you can to head that off at the pass by using inline citations. The <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a> has a great way of doing it. It is still in a bit of development, but works well now and any problems can be fixed in the future.

<p>Hii; I've been watching your rennovation of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a>, and I must say I've been quite impressed. I am a trained gemmologist, and although I do not specialise in diamonds, I have graded a few; I've also several reference texts which may prove useful in building up the article's currently weak citations. I'm glad to see most of my contributions to the article have been retained; my edits to the article were mostly made early last year, back when it was a featured article. Its featured status discouraged me from making any major edits (plus I'm a lazy git), and sometime in the interim the article was removed as an FA. Some text I had added apparently did not survive the test of time. I did notice the current FA nomination, but decided to leave it be until the "spotlight" had passed. I didn't want to step on your or anyone's toes (and I hate edit conflicts), and besides, you seemed to be doing an excellent job at cleaning it up.</p>
<p>The article and most of the spin-offs (though underdeveloped) you've created cover most areas fairly well, but I can recognise several weak spots (namely enhancements and imitations). There may be some POV issues with respect to the four Cs (not in the parts I wrote, of course; *grin*), but that's hard to avoid due to the subjectivity of the whole affair. For example, I'm still a bit uncertain about the insisted inclusion of the "important" maximum/minimum distance between the eye and the diamond; it's not very helpful that this factoid's only "citation" is a link to a BBS thread. This factor may be important to certain grading systems (of which I must be unfamiliar; the ones mentioned are dated 2004 and 2005), but certainly not to all of them. Diamond grading systems are notoriously inconsistent, of course; the article should say that there is no <i>de facto</i> standard, although the GIA's colour and clarity grades come closest to being universally accepted. I do know that Pagel-Theisen's <i>Diamond Grading ABC: The Manual</i> (9th edition, 2001; considered a "bible" by diamond graders) makes no mention (that I can recall; I'll have to read it cover to cover again) of eye-to-stone distance, aside from the distance being varied (when using a loupe) until the view is sharp. (It is true that the book predates the systems mentioned, but change is slow in the diamond world.) I don't quite understand why such a factor would be important in grading <i>cut</i>, which has to do with measured proportions and the imperfections of polish which necessarily are examined with a microscope. Anyway, I know you didn't write that bit. Just sharing my thoughts.</p>
<p>I have a lot of technical knowledge of the subject, with references to back it up. I want to work with you, though, so that we don't end up duplicating each other's work and/or conflicting with each other's edits. I'm also not sure what you intend the structure of the article to be in its "final draft" (no such thing on a wiki, but you know what I mean), so I'm hesitant to add any new content before I understand the situation more. I know you're trying to keep the article's size to a manageable level by using summary sections, but I can't decide where I should best begin fleshing things out. Is there a particular area you might like assistance with?</p>

<dd>Gregory, thank you for your generous offer! Any and all help would be greatly appreciated! I am actually <i>not</i> an expert; just a poor guy who spent his life savings on a diamond about a year ago, and did a little research to make himself feel better before doing it. And of course I am God's gift to copyediting, so I do what I can&#160;;) Anyway... for the main article, my remaining tasks are:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Clean out the <i>External links</i> by removing irrelevant links, moving to sub-articles when necessary, and moving to the <i>References</i> section when appropriate.</li>
<li>Reworking the <i>History</i> section (based mostly on the — in my opinion — excellent reference of the American Museum of Natural History's website)</li>
<li>Finding sources and writing the <i>Industrial diamond industry</i> section, and filling out the <i>diamond supply chain</i> and <i>sources</i> sections (I don't believe current references will have enough to do this satisfactorily).</li>
<li>Figuring out what the heck to do with the <i>symbolism</i> section — some of it could easily be moved to history (and I was 90% done doing that until I had second thoughts about it), but overall the section is problematic in that I'm having trouble a) imagining a way the section will flow well internally, and b) imagining a place in the overall article the symbolism section "fits" into. It aslo needs rewriting, which I've been putting off because it's difficult; the April birthstone and LifeGem bits are noteworthy I suppose, but sort of strange and out of left field when it comes to integrating it into the article.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>As you noted, the article is already quite long and I'm guessing that when I'm done it will be around 40 to 45 kb. My plan was to use this article as a summary of all the various facets (haha) of diamond as a topic, with a little heavier weighting on actual diamond characteristics (what I've called material and gemological properties) and natural history, as the article <i>is</i> titled "diamond"; and a little less weighting on industry, history, symbolism, etc. Nonetheless, I'm concerned that it will be too long once I'm done, but I don't want to cut anything. It's all so important!&#160;:) I don't think it's terrible to have an article like this at that length though, so unless the villagers come to the gates with torches and pitchforks, I'm happy to let it stand that long.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I see it the real issue, and the one that I am certain you have vastly more capability to address than I, is all of the subarticles. All that I did was move the original text to the new subarticles I created, so that I could abridge and rewrite with abandon. (This may have been foolish, but if I rewrote each subarticle as I created it, I'd be weeks away from getting to where we are now on the main article.) The result is that the subarticles are basically just sections of the original article which failed so spectacularly on FAC and was, in my opinion, substandard. The intent was to weed out detailed information in the name of brevity and clarity, but in many cases what I've written is (of course I have to say this) substantially better than what is to be found in the subarticle, minus many of the technical details. I guess I'm saying that in my view, almost <i>all</i> the subarticles are weak points. An expert such as yourself, with definitive references in hand, could blaze a glorious path of retribution... er... I mean, judicious edits... through the subarticles. I've always thought that a summary article is only as good as its subs. (Speaking of which, I think it's probably appropriate to have a diamond grading systems subarticle; I just haven't created it yet because I have nothing to paste into it!) Ideally, we finish this (what I consider rough) redo of the main article, then redo the subs, then come back to the main article and polish it up with any new things we've learned (or errors corrected) while doing the subs. Of course, this rough redo of the main article can go simultaneously with the sub rewrites.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(This brings up an issue that is germiane not only to this article, that I'm not sure what to do about... I'm hoping you have an idea about what is right. In a summary article, is it proper to list as references all of the refs used on important subarticles, or just list them on the subs and leave them off the main article? For example, if we have a source that says a diamond scratches at 200 GPa, we site it on the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Material_properties_of_diamond.html" title="Material properties of diamond">material properties of diamond</a> article; if in the main article we then use the sub as a reference to say "diamonds are hard", do we list the reference on the main article too? What if we say "diamond scratches at 200 GPa" in the main article? I'm unsure what proper procedure is here.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the specific issue you raised re: viewing distance, I agree with you -- I think the whole topic is dubious at best. As far as I understand it from looking at the talk page, the whole thing arose out of a misunderstanding of microscopy and magnification multipes, and has nothing really to do with actual grading methodology. Of course I could be wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, you're making a generous offer to help, and I'm more than pleased to take you up on it. Most important to me is that there is nothing factually wrong or misleading in the main article. As you can see from my list of remaining tasks, I'm not going to tinker anymore with the properties sections for now, so by all means if you want to correct or clarify anything, go for it. (I try to work in section edits, precisely to avoid edit conflicts which are odious.) I'd shy away from adding much more factual material to the article in those sections, unless it's currently really missing the point on something. Instead, I feel that the real attention needs to go to the subarticles. Almost all of those need to be completely rewritten, and as stand-alone articles many, well, don't stand alone very well. They could all be significantly expanded, and that is where your technical knowledge would be of best use, IMO. I hope we can work together on those too; it can get lonely working alone&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Hi again; and thanks! Sorry about the delay, but I was busy last night with more fish stuff (I like to write articles on subjects I'm not yet an expert on as in the process I can learn a great deal). As you've seen, I've taken your cue regarding the subarticles and started my editing with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Material_properties_of_diamond.html" title="Material properties of diamond">Material properties of diamond</a>. I think it could easily stand alone now, but I'll likely come back to it later on to improve it even further. I'll leave any main article edits til after I've done everything I want to the subarticles. I included three references (I hope my format is okay), but there's room for a few more.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking of references, I'm not sure what to do about the main article in this regard. I've never written a summary article, so I'm as unsure as you when it comes to deciding whether to include every single reference used in the summary sections in the main article's references. Your remarkable editing skills have mitigated the problem, however, as the way you've summarised the topics makes it easy to reference everything said with fewer sources (due to the low incidence of nitpicky facts or figures). I think we can get away with only referencing the most important facts on the main article (though I realise this would be arbitrary).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm also a bit abashed to hear of your troubles with the symbolism section, as I wrote almost all of it (ack!). That was back when the article was much, much smaller; someone else started the section but left it at two lines of text, basically parroting DeBeer's marketing pitches. I couldn't let that stand, so I dug into my jewellery/goldsmithing history texts to get a few basic facts. Someone added the tempered diatribe against DeBeers later on, and I'm glad you've relocated it. I do hope it's salvageable; could it be melded into the history section? Perhaps rename the section to "Cultural and symbolic history of diamond"? Or nix "and symbolic" altogether. We gemmologists aren't historians, unfortunately, but I tried my best.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Re: the symbolism section, let me remove my foot from my mouth. My problem with it was that it's so different from the rest of the article that it's hard to find a good spot for it in the story arc of the article. On the other hand, it's too important and too good info to delete or even relocate. I did a little bit of clean up on it (really relatively minor), and I'm feeling better about it now. There's still a touch of inspecific language and grammar issues that I want to clean up, but on the whole I think it'll stand fine more or less as-is. Certainly nothing to be ashamed of! &#160;:)</dd>

I'm looking forward to seeing your progress... don't worry about hurrying yourself though; I myself tend to work in fits and starts, and then let things fallow for a few days (in addition to keeping things from becoming tedious, it's a great way to get a new perspective on things). As long as you're working on fish topics too, check out <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarium.html" title="Aquarium">aquarium</a>; I pushed that to FA a couple months ago. I'm quite proud of it... but I think <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a> can be even better. With your work I'm confident it will be.

<dd>Hi again.. I haven't quite disappeared, but my free time (and energy) has been unexpectedly truncated. I've spent what free time I have working (offline, in fits and starts!) on the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_simulants.html" title="Diamond simulants">diamond simulants</a> article, and I hope to have it done sometime within the next 24 hours (or even before my head its the pillow, if I can manage). I think I may have gotten a bit carried away, because by the time I'm done it'll be near 30 KB. But like you I never want to edit anything out, and I think it's all worth saving. You've obviously noticed my expansion of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_enhancement.html" title="Diamond enhancement">diamond enhancement</a>, and your edits and expansions to it were excellent. (I'm apparently horrible at proofreading or otherwise critiquing my own work. Your expansion to the intro was perfect, and I felt like slapping my forehead for neglecting to draw the same lines.) I'm also glad to hear the symbolism text isn't a lost cause! And, as always, your edits to it were a significant improvement; as was the mother-of-all intros you wrote for <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a>. (My apologies if I'm giving you praise-induced encephalitis, but it had to be said.&#160;;)</dd>

<dd>As for aquariums, I did indeed notice you had turned it into a feature; and bravo! (I really should frequent FAC more often, it seems.) I'll admit I haven't read it _entirely_, but I fully intend to over lunch tomorrow. Just a few months ago the subject was little more than a couple of paragraphs and some spammish links, and now the subject has an article to really do it justice. I have five tanks, and although they all sit empty nowadays, I was once (up til 4 years ago, when I was 18; I started at about age 10) an avid (freshwater) aquarist. I even managed to get a flock of bronze <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corydoras.html" title="Corydoras">corydoras</a> to breed (I see you wrote that article too!). I should really start a tank up again this summer. I miss having a school of Congo tetras to gawk at (which is even more satisfying when you've grown them from plain jane juveniles, I've found).</dd>

<dd>Gregory, glad to see you are still on the case! I figured we were all distracted by the 24-hour-plus "read-only" wiki outage the other day. I myself have been doing things that are almost totally irrelevant, filling out decent articles for red links from <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a> -- <a href="../../../n/2E/w/N.W._Ayer_%26_Son_efd0.html" title="N.W.

I'm glad you don't mind me swooping in on your newborn, really lovely articles and sprucing them up a little bit... as they say, two heads are better than one. I'm sure you would have thought of the same things yourself; collaboration just helps things go faster. It's very easy to get possessive and defensive, and I'm so glad you aren't. Regarding the rest of the subarticles, I think I'm going to try and tackle the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_industry.html" title="Diamond industry">diamond industry</a> article next. Not sure when I'll get to it though, hopefully by the next few days I'll put something together. And I'll be sure to swing by any big edits you put up; don't mind my (minor, minor, <i>minor</i>) cleanup -- "standing on the shoulders of giants".</dd>

<p>(Resetting indent): That diagram was a great find! I've translated it into English, uploaded it to Commons (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Diamond_cut_history.png" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Diamond_cut_history.png">here</a>), and added it to the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_cut.html" title="Diamond cut">diamond cut</a> article. I've yet to expand the accompanying text, but I'll try to get around to that by the weekend (hopefully sooner). I must say I found your Argyle mine article very informative. I hadn't seen the Gems &amp; Gemology issue you used as a source (nice of the company to make the relevant article public in PDF form!), so all of my knowledge of the mine had been gleaned from passing references and asides. I feel much less ignorant now.&#160;;)</p>
<p>I'll eventually take a crack at creating a new image or two to illustrate <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_simulant.html" title="Diamond simulant">diamond simulant</a>, though unfortunately I currently only have a (coloured) YAG, sphalerite, and sphene at hand. I'm also not so great at photographing cut stones, apparently. I've set my very next task to be polishing off the enhancement article with at least one more reference's worth of detail. Can't make myself too many promises as I'm in a rather changeable mood. I do know, however, that this has been the most productive collaboration I've yet been a part of on Wikipedia.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../h/a/d/User%7EHadal_a4d0.html" title="User:Hadal">Hadal</a> 05:14, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the indent reset; I was about ready to do it myself.&#160;:) I've been agonizing for weeks now over the status of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_industry.html" title="Diamond industry">diamond industry</a>, and now am leaning toward deleting it as a subarticle and just letting what is in the main article, stand as-is. The problem is that I don't want to delete much of what's in the main article because I think it's valuable as a part of a top-level overview of the topic, but at the same time I don't want to develop the topic into a larger article (because I don't have the desire or energy). I need to recuperate from this mental defeat for a few days before I select another subarticle to attack, although I'm leaning toward copyedit duty in the face of superior technical knowledge and sources available to others (yeah, I'm talking about you!).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>BC vs. BCE has been discussed ad nauseam on the talk page, and the page should be left as-is in that stylistic selection.</dd>

<p>The real concern is that you are writing for the Wikipedia and their style is to use AD &amp; BC, not BCE &amp; CE so you should follow their standard. Please take this up with the organisers of the Wikipedia and leave the era identifiers as BC &amp; AD until there is an agreement to the method that is agreed upon in the Diamonds article.

<p>Thanks for the quote. So now back to the lack of consensenus on the article. It seems there is none as others have sided with the BC/AD rule and you still have not answered the question of redirect pages as the standard. Glad to discuss it.

<p>I have done some analysis of the discussion. If anyone would like to see the work, please contact me. With the RFC aside, the discussion can be summarised as following</p>
<ul>
<li>AD: 6 (six) brian0918™ , Dewet , Doovinator , Gene Nygaard , Jasper , Walter Görlitz</li>
<li>CE: 2 (two) Bryan is Bantman/Bantman, Hadal</li>
<li>CrucifiedChrist and Taxman just want the debate to stop.</li>

<p>Hi I am almost 70 years old and have a very good memory. Long before TV, Camels had an ad on the radio with a slogan as I quoted, including the "mild, mild". To get something more definitive, you would have to consult audio libraries or the cigarette company itself - they might have a record. Or their agency. Is there no response there? I was just checking random pages, and I have never in my life heard the ad without those two words. I have not, however, watched television (more than perhaps a total of 6 hours) since I graduated high school in 1952 and I believe TV ads were allowed for some years. If the slogan was on packages rather then on radio, the assonance would mean little and space would be at a premium. Therefore, if the slogan appeared on a package (including carton), space considerations - to allow larger type, less clutter, etc) may have won over assonance (you can't hear assonance in print!) and the words deleted. I can also remember well Lucky Strike ads, with the intonations of an auctioneer rattling off bids and ending with "Sold to American". Also they had "LSMFT". Incidentally, my sister smoked, and died of cancer at age 27 in 1956.</p>
<p>The fact that you got only a few hits just means memories are poor and nostalgia for old radio ads is low. Here's a link which purports to have the line (but I can't guarantee which agency did it- you could find out by the year which I would guess from nearby logs to be 1953)</p>

<p>I really don't think there is any excuse for rude emails. In the UK most companies will sack people for sending rude emails. It is difficult enough to construct a nice email and I have been spoken to/fired from jobs for sending emails much tamer than the ones that I have received on this web site (the one from David Brooks). I think that people need to realise that there is no excuse for sending rude emails. They would not be rude emails to a colleague or boss, so why do they send rude emails to other people on this website. I think that they need to make a policy that people who consistenty send inflammatory emails should be banned from the site. There was no excuse for that man saying that I did not have any courtesy.</p>
<p>We are all volunteers. If I did something wrong then I am open to criticism, but I do not appreciate that David Brooks saying that I did not have any coutesy. The way he acted, you would have thought he ran the place. In his page he said he is a journalist, so I can only assume that he scours wikipedia and other websites for news bits to write about because it is his bread and butter and he must earn a living from it. Most of the rest of us poor slobs have regular jobs and don't get all anal about a little mistake here or there becuase after all it is a free website. People don't have to contribute to the website if they don't like the quality of it. Also, rather than saying that I did not have any courtesy, he could have sent me an email telling me the correct way to do it. That would have been more appropriate.</p>
<p>With regard to body language, I compiled that piece perhaps 7 years ago and sent it to Janus Publishing along with the manuscript for Blind to the Molesting Hands. The editor left soon afterward, and they said they were not going to publish my essays because it did not do the story justice. I can only assume that the editor or someone else in that company decided to take my essays with him when he left the company, and used the essays without my permission. That is the only explanation that I can come up with for what happened. Sarah Ferguson was accused of plagerising, so perhaps on a psychic level someone picked up on my words. It is also worth noting that patents for inventions usually all come in at around the same time, but they have to give the credit to one person even though several people submitted them at the same time. It is the nature of the universe that when people are ready to accept things several vessals will come to dissimenate that information. Of course, I am not for one minute suggesting that I am a vessel that has something really outstanding or interesting to say, but perhaps that is how the confusion started in the similarity between the articles. I don't know how that happened, but I do know that I wrote my article close to 7 years ago. I do not know how it was so similar in nature to that other article because I have not looked at the website or read the piece, and I am not about to contact the person on the website to say that I am the copyright holder for it. I do have the article on my computer and it has the date and time stamp, so if anyone wants to take me to court then perhaps I can use that as evidence. I have enough copyrighted information to my name already. Regards,--<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETracyRenee_37d9.html" title="User:TracyRenee">TracyRenee</a> 13:38, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It does not bother me re body langauge. I said from the very beginning that if people did not like it they could delete it. I have enough work of my own on the internet that I have copyrighted on the internet that it does not matter.</p>
<p>I did go back and re-read David Brooks email before I deleted it, and it was not as awful as I and originally thought, but it still wasn't very nice. He said I was dumping articles and expecting other people to clean up and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>I personally have copy-edited a lot of articles and I have never become enraged or angry. I have just done what I could. I cannot copy-edit all articles because I don't know enough about the subject. Today I did an article on induction and it was obvious that it was a presentation that someone had done, but I edited what I could because I happen to know a little bit about induction having been in the USAF for 15 years as a radio relay repairman. The point is, David Brooks did not know me at all, yet he felt he had the liberty to send me offensive emails. I doubt very seriously he has even the remotist idea was induction is, yet he feels he has the right to criticise other people.</p>
<p>The only time I have ever been even the slightest bit critical was when someone put a post up about some writers, and the grammer was really bad. I edited it and posted about the quality of the grammer, and said I hoped it wasn't the writers who had that kind of grammer. The person who posted sent me an email back and said to feel free to edit, which is what I did.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should just stick with what I know, which is a little bit of grammer and a little bit of everything else.</p>

<p>Thanks for stepping in with the above person. I have to take a bit of the blame since my message that wasn't exactly soothing - I should learn not to check "new pages" for more than 10 minutes at a time; I get so irritated at all the glop being dumped on wikipedia that my tone gets harsher than it should. I admire your patience, which accomplishes more in the long run than scolding, although in this particular case I'm afraid it's going to be an awfully long time. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 19:16, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bantam,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for emailing me, but I did not see my message so much as a dispute as a complaint about the fact that one member of the group is sending inflammatory emails.</p>
<p>I am also curious to know what your position in the group is because although you have not been rude to me, your emails have been very condescending, treating me as if I am a five year old. I would have been much happier with your correspondence if you had not been speaking down to me.</p>
<p>Just so I can have some clarity of the situation, would you be kind enough to tell me exactly what your position of the group is. What is your title and who appointed you to that position?</p>
<p>On the message of deleting the rude emails that I received, my son, who was abducted by his father, reads wikipedia. I do not have a very good relationship with my son and only speak to him on the phone. My son has a problem with treating people with disrespect,and I try to teach him to treat people with respect, but it is difficult because his father did not raise him to respect other people, and we live in a world where people are not treated with respect. I am worried what my son would think if he was to look on my page and see all of the rude emails that people have sent to me. I still think that the people in this group should be careful of their emails. You have gone to great pains to tell me over and over again so repeatedly what high standards wikipedia has, but I have not really seen those high standards, especially in the form of emails that have been sent to me.</p>
<p>I would also like to say that with regard to my son, he got involved with some religious freak over the internet, and even ran off with her with my money, and as soon as the money ran out she dumped him. She sent me several emails in the same condescending, patronising manner that you did, and this girl/woman did a lot to damage my relationship with my son. I hope you can appreciate, therefore, that it takes a lot more than sending a few emails to someone trying to appear to be superior to make an impression on my psyche. I suppose that I have been through too much in my life to be taken in by other people. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETracyRenee_37d9.html" title="User:TracyRenee">TracyRenee</a> 06:07, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't usually talk about my personal issues, but I wanted you to have a little bit of understanding. My son reads wikipedia and what is he going to think if he just happens to look at my page and finds all kinds of emails from people attacking me.</p>
<p>Also, that guy David Brooks got very personal. He verbally attacked me by making comments about my lack of courtesy, saying that I dumped articles and expected other people to clean them up, etc. That is very personal and was much more personal than me saying a few things about my son. I don't have a good relationship with my son and I don't want him to read offensive material that other people have written and sent to me just to upset me. If my son was to read those things then he would feel very justified in his very negative feelings about me.</p>
<p>Also, wikipedia is a community, but in addition to criticising people all the time they should also try to promote an area of respect and courtesy. Do you think that guy David Brooks had any courtesy for me when he sent me that inflammatory email?</p>
<p>I made a point of reading your page and you stated that you have done a lot of editing. Perhaps you should try your hand at writing a few articles. I also noted that you are in the glee club at college. Oops, that was personal. It seems that we never can get away from dealing with personal issues.</p>
<p>It really is difficult not to get personal with people when you strike up an email correspondence becuase that is the whole nature of the correspondence. For whatever reason, you have decided to use the internet to reach out to people, and for whatever reason you have decided to get personal.</p>
<p>I spent all day thinking about you and what your motivation is for getting involved in wikipedia. I know that you have not been in wikipedia very long, according to your page. I also know that you do a lot of editing. I also know that you really like the glee club, although I cannot remember what the glee club is. I thought to myself, what does Bantam get out of wikipedia? The only professional reason that I can come up with is that perhaps you might want to get into publishing and see volunteering at wikipedia as a way into the door.</p>
<p>I got into wikipedia out of boredom, personally. Working in an office can be pretty tedius, so I liked to look at the site. I have also contributed a few articles, but I don't know how many people have deleted out of the sheer pleasure of it. I did not even know you could send messages to people until someone sent me a message, and the first time I received a message I thought, gee, I have made some friends here. Unfortunately, most of the messages have not been very nice, so I have deleted them. I don't want to clutter my page up with messages that are not very nice, so I hope that you can understand.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, the matter re my original grievance is resolved, so there is no need for you to email me any more if that was why you emailed me. I don't really get into non-personal issues on my free time because I have to spend so much time at work having to deal with people who are not very nice, but I must deal with them to earn a living. I therefore prefer to spend the rest of my time either in my solitary pursuits of writing, reading, crocheting, or sometimes emailing friends. I have no desire to enter into communications with people to discuss the next big article or to complain that someone put a comma in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Good luck in whatever it is you decide to do with your life. I would also like to point out that the internet is a vehicle where people can pretend to be whatever or whoever they like to be, but the true test in our success lies in how we relate to people in the real world and how we get on in paid employment. Any reprobate can fire off an inflammatory email, but it takes true courage to show tolerance and understanding for other people.</p>

<p>I don't want to play these psychological mind games with you any more. I only ever emailed you in the first place to be polite, even though according to you and David Brooks, I don't have any courtesy.</p>
<p>I would like to point out for the record that you played no part whatsoever in resolving any disputes or grievances that I may have had, and in fact you just upset me even more with your unsolicited emails to me saying the things that you did. I just responded to your emails because I thought you might turn out to be a nice person.</p>
<p>I think you like to play mind games with people, reel them in, and then slam dunk them. I have met lots of people like you, who have sent me unsolicited emails, pretending to be my friend, and then when they got my trust to slam dunk me. The game you played is nothing new. It is probably a favourate passtime of many unevolved souls who get into the internet because they can be anybody they want to be and nobody will ever be the wiser. In fact, it is a quite common game that people like to play because they can feel superior. But feel superior to who? Anybody can bash out an email telling other people what to do, but they would never do it face to face. You would never tell me face to face the things that you emailed me becuase you know that I would either walk away from you or ask you how you dare to speak to me like that.</p>
<p>Don't forget, it is you who started this email correspondence, not me. Before a few days ago I never knew you existed, yet you reached out to me over thousands of miles becuase you had a deep primal need to let me know that you do exist. You emailed me, I did not email you, so it was you who wanted to touch another living soul, not me. If you did not want to be acknowleged for your worth as a human being then you never would have emailed me. You would have simply ignored my email that I posted on the message board, but you had a need within youself to validate your existance in a world where you are often considered insignificant, and you reached out to me, even though you do not want to admit it. It was not I who reached out to you because I do not need to validate my existance in the world, but you reached out to me for your own justification and validation that you are a human being worthy of contact with other human beings who are quite capable of getting on with their lives without you.</p>
<p>You sent me unsolicited emails and I responded in an open honest heartfelt manner. I bared just a tiny bit of my soul to you, but you are not ready to really know people, even though you made an initial attempt by emailing me and then backing down,which I suppose is why you use such an impersonal medium as the internet to correspond. If you really wanted contact with people you would do it face to face and not on a screen where you can pretend to be anybody you want to be. You caught me off guard with that little psychological game that you played, although I should have seen it coming because I have experienced it so many times in the past, over the internet and one to one.</p>
<p>Good luck with whatever it is you do, but perhaps you should stay out of mediation because you not only did not resolve any disputes, but you just upset me as well. I don't think you should give up your day job.</p>

<p>Hi Bryan, thanks very much for your comments on my FAC nomination of <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldfell.html" title="Eldfell">Eldfell</a>. I just wanted to see if you felt they'd been addressed to your satisfaction now? I think I've covered everything you suggest, except as I say, info on the submarine effects is not easy to come by. Anything particular you had in mind for that? Also, my confusion of east and west - you said you though from other context that the map arrow must be south instead of north - what was that context, because it must be wrong as well?

<dd>Hi WT. I'd make these corrections myself but I'm so unfamiliar with the subject, I can't tell when what seems inuitive is right.&#160;:) In the "the eruption begins" section, third paragraph, it says "activity soon became concentrated on one vent, about 0.8 km north of Helgafell." If the main vent is where Eldfell cinder cone is marked on the map, it actually appears east or southeast of the town. In the "evacuation" section, first paragraph, it says "lava flows were already moving slowly into the western side of town"; from the map it appears that lava flows were moving into the eastern side of the town; the west end looks unaffected by lava flows. Those are the only things I noticed; love the article -- fun read! - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantman_f0a0.html" title="User:Bantman">Bryan is Bantman</a> 17:05, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, the vent was indeed 0.8km north of Helgafell, which was the old volcanic cone southeast of town. I've tweaked the wording to try and make the relative locations of Helgafell, the town and the new vent clearer. And you're absolutely right that lava flows were actually moving into the east of town, and never got near the west.

<p>There seems to be support for the 1242 date.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could also try to consult a Lancet article</p>

There's stuff on "destructive fishing practices" in <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">Fishing</a> which relates to collection of live fish for the aquarium trade which you might want to demerge and use (it's a bit of a dogs dinner of an article!). "Destructive fishing practices" might be a bit of a broad title, unless you're going to include things like dynamite fishing and bottom trawling. If there's anything I can do... <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnilocra_a4d1.html" title="User:Anilocra">Anilocra</a> 23:02, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for <a href="../../../a/n/i/User_talk%7EAnilocra_5a62.html#Destructive_fishing_techniques" title="User talk:Anilocra">your comments</a>. There's definitely a good article or two to be had there somewhere. I've been thinking about taking a big stick to the various fishing related articles and trying to knock them into some sort of logical shape for a while (I might be crazy, but I don't think the best bait for catching pickerel belongs on the main fishing page!). I've just finished working on <a href="../../../m/y/x/Myxobolus_cerebralis.html" title="Myxobolus cerebralis">Myxobolus cerebralis</a> (I spotted <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Myxobolus_cerebralis_8324.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Myxobolus cerebralis">your comment</a> - got me there&#160;:) ) so I'm looking around for something else to do. Maybe I'll take it upon myself to shepherd some newbies into a collaborative effort on this. Baaah, baaah...&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnilocra_a4d1.html" title="User:Anilocra">Anilocra</a> 23:36, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Heh, actually I've known about it almost since it started. While doing RC patrol I was noticing a lot of changes to the Puget Sound page a while back by new users. I asked on some talk pages about it and their teacher told me that it was a class project. See <a href="../../../p/u/g/Talk%7EPuget_Sound_6476.html" title="Talk:Puget Sound">Talk:Puget Sound</a>. He eventually listed it on that page of class projects, and that's when I found out that it wasn't just that article but five articles. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 18:55, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, also, regarding contacting the people in charge, I talked with him on IRC and I think he's pretty clear on things since reading that page about school projects. If you notice someone in the future doing something that might be a class project, point them there. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 18:58, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Bantman - <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">Jguk</a> is using a bizarre scheme whereby 'articles' (template container pages, really) are built using transclusion (not unlike the FAC page). What's worse is he is using the wikipedia:namespace from WikiProject subpages to hold article prose and then linking directly to that from the headings on the container page. For an example see: <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_%288-30_April%29_e274.html" title="2005 English cricket season (8-30 April)">2005 English cricket season (8-30 April)</a> (a page he is putting through peer review at <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_2005_English_cricket_season_%288-30_April%29_3107.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/2005 English cricket season (8-30 April)">Wikipedia:Peer review/2005 English cricket season (8-30 April)</a> with the intent of finishing it up before FAC).

<p>My first thought: spiffy! I honestly can't think of anything to amend; I even like the colours you've chosen. I do wonder whether the new box should be inserted before or after the mineral infobox in the properties article, but that's not a big deal for me. (Probably before, if only for consistency's sake.)</p>
<p>I'm quite glad to see you're still actively improving these articles, because over the past few weeks I've become somewhat distant from the site due to several concurrent crises. While I am having something of an early-life crisis (trying to figure out exactly where I'm heading), most of the drama stems from the neighbours, whose oak tree fell on our house on the 5th, and whose chimney (along with the house attached to it) continues to lean precariously against (and slice into) our house, creating a major safety hazard and inevitable water damage. The falling tree caused significant damage to the roof, as well as decimating the backyard (it knocked down two fences, damaged the deck, and flattened many expensive perennials). I now have some idea how tornado victims must feel, except that we have other people (rather than nature) to blame.</p>
<p>Even before the tree fell, its crown branches were leaning over and against our roof, abrading shingles and allowing squirrels and raccoons ready access to our attic. We asked the neighbours to do something about this tree last year, because it was clearly a problem; it also had quite a few dead branches, all of which hung menacingly over our deck. They completely ignored us; we spent $2,500 on roof repairs just last spring. One month to the day of complaining to the city about the tree and chimney, the former comes crashing down. (The city never took action, so we plan to file a claim of damages with them as well.) Even though the fallen tree was pressing against both our house and the other neighbour's, the tree's owners were not prepared to do anything about it—until the city issued them an emergency order, forcing them to. They still refuse to pay for any of the damages (caused by both the tree and the chimney), which may total c. $65,000. Since they've just sold their house(!) for $650,000, we'll have to move fast to try to put a lien on their property before the deal closes, sometime in September. Something tells me the new buyer hasn't been informed of these recent developments. (The chimney has actually been a problem for over a year, but the real estate agent said it wasn't her problem). The owners have Vermont plates and have only lived here for about two years, so we don't know how the legal situation might change if they move across the border.</p>
<p>While this is all happening, an entire circuit in this house has fried, meaning I have to wait until the evening to plug my computer in (as it's sharing power with major appliances). These days, I rarely have the energy to do more than check my mail. If worst comes to worst, we may have to sell this house; I may also have to cancel my university application for this year, and use the student loan for more pressing needs.</p>
<p>I'll cut my rambling short(ish) and spare you at least a dozen more paragraphs. Thanks for asking for my input, and thanks doubly for creating the infobox! I can't promise anything, but if I catch a break from the madness, I'll take a crack at beefing up the synthetics article. I've begun to miss the energetically focused feeling of writing articles.

<li>My comment was made for the benefit of others, not for you; therefore I don't care if you respect my opinion.</li>
<li>I have not read the entire history of nominations; I trust other editors' characterizations of such. My comment regarding abuse is in response to your actions vis-à-vis the renominations etc., not the content of the previous FAC nominations.</li>
<li>I don't care what your father said, it carries less weight than the opinions of other editors who have earned my respect over many months.</li>
<li>Mark is not all-powerful on FAC; he is merely the instrument of community consensus. I'm sure he would agree. If the community were to disagree with him, we could overrule him, or take away the powers that have been given him (informally; his power is due to the deference of others, and nothing else).</li>
<li>"Abuse of the system" can be defined as following the letter, but not the spirit, of the rules. I feel that you are doing this, and your legalistic defenses are insufficient in my view.</li>

<dd>You have made a choice to focus on how you perceive you are being wronged by others, and ignore the fact that you are disregarding long-held community standards. That is your decision, but that is why you are running into so much resistance, and why I don't think we can have a useful dialogue here. That is also why I choose not to take you as an example of a good way to participate here at Wikipedia; I believe many of your tactics are counterproductive. I have seen sufficient evidence; one's knowledge need not be encyclopedic to be able to make an informed decision. Why would I defend someone's opinion which I do not support? I defend their right to have it, just as I defend my right to attack it. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantman_f0a0.html" title="User:Bantman">Bantman</a> 04:53, September 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>"one's knowledge need not be encyclopedic to be able to make an informed decision."</b> <font color="#000077">Well, I admit you are right; it is more efficient sometimes to take shortcuts that <i>usually</i> work, but not only do I think I'm right, but also, I feel you are caught in a catch-22 loop: You won't read the page because you disagree -and you disagree because you won't read the page. Circular. You have a right to prioritize, but I think you would enjoy the personal answers that I gave to almost every single criticism, and, yes, sometimes I admit I'm wrong, and I hope that doesn't surprise you. ~~ If you took as much time looking at the evidence as you do in arguing with me, you'd be a lot more informed, and spend less time overall; I have done my part to help fellow-editors publish a high-quality page -and I took time to address every concern raised, and remaining silent only if I had already answered that question. Don't get stuck in a circular catch-22 situation; If you're that restricted on time, maybe <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is not for you, but that's only my opinion.

<dd>Combative? I'm just being encouraging. Being combative would be to not give a second request. Anyway, you DID make edits after I sent you the first request. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:41, 14 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Combative is threatening that my objection would be striken if I didn't hop to it and clarify ASAP. I think a neutral observer could tell the difference between what you said and "encouraging", and see that the difference is vast. Threatening to have one's vote striken within such a short time period and for such an easily remedied offense is combative. 48 to 72 hours is a more reasonable time frame to give someone adequate time to reply.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the specifics, my first edit after I received your notes was to respond to them. You made two requests, including your threat, while I was offline. Your requests were posted 6 hours 29 minutes apart, during which time I made no edits; in fact, I made only one edit between my first two posts to the FAC page in question, <i>two minutes after the first FAC post</i>. So I am afraid you are incorrect in your understanding of the relevant facts.</dd>
<dd>I hope we can keep this from becoming antagonistic; I fear I have offended you by some of my comments and if that is the case, I apologize. However, I do think that you could benefit from some constructive criticism on how you choose to interact with the FAC community, and I have tried to provide that in the interests of all. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantman_f0a0.html" title="User:Bantman">Bantman</a> 00:25, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is nothing about what I've said that is even remotely counter-productive. I left the second response after you edited Lakitu, but I left the first one before you edited it. Unactionable objections can be stricken, you realize, and that was in no way actionable, since you yourself said the statement didn't make sense. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:47, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have never edited Lakitu; please get your facts straight before referring to them as evidence. I made a typographical error which was corrected as soon as I was made aware of it. In my opinion, you were overzealous in 'defending' the article, and I told you so. I told you so because I don't appreciate being bullied, and thought you'd like to know that's how your comments were perceived, so that maybe you could choose your words and actions a little more carefully in the future. A little patience and humility would go a long way toward making your interactions with others more pleasant and your time on Wikipedia more productive. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantman_f0a0.html" title="User:Bantman">Bantman</a> 01:12, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You were trying to use my edit history as evidence supporting your position; therefore your statement that I edited Lakitu is material and goes to show that you assumed what my actions were, without checking. You were rude in your messages to me, and wrong in your depiction of the facts. All I wanted was a simple note saying it was a misunderstanding; you are the one who has chosen to escalate it. This is making it hard for me to accept your actions as good faith. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantman_f0a0.html" title="User:Bantman">Bantman</a> 01:26, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Idea: Read what I say. For instance, you could read that I said you edited Lakitu (which you didn't), instead of claiming I am... I dunno WHAT the Hell you thought I was plotting. I mean, of course, it's not a crime to assume that everyone is trying to plot against you, but it is plain silly. Or, how about you read that fun little sentence where I called it a misunderstanding? Too big of a strain for you? Stop trying to make me look guilty because of a mistake of mine. You're ignoring the facts so that you can say you cannot accept my actions as good faith. You made a mistake in your saying, which started this, I made a mistake in misreading that Brian guy as your name, so before you go accusing me of wrongdoing because I thought you were ignoring the request, actually consider that your statement was involved in the argument. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:49, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I would not consider 13th century "obscure", for one&#160;:-) (Even if I know more about the 17th). I would also consider that royal marriages are significant (especially when Eleanor was the mother of the next king and he was apparently very fond of her). If I remember correctly, the marriage had something to do with his father's war against the Alphonso of Castile, her brother. I'll check. - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 11:49, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good catch! I looked a little further into it, and it appears to be the result of typos in the online version of the source I originally used.

<p>Hi Bantman - yes, it is standard botanical format; what it is saying is that the aspens are in the genus <i>Populus</i> (poplars), and in the section <i>Populus</i> of that genus (when a genus is divided into a number of sections, one of the sections, the one described first, retains the genus name as its section name; the other sections get different names). I guess it could perhaps be worded a bit more clearly for those not familiar with botanical conventions, I'll see if I can think of something - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 00:14, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
