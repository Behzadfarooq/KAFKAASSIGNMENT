<p>You will have to provide some sources to back up this claim. Wikipeida is not a place for original research. Looking at the BoS's own history, it states it was set up for commerical purposes, <i>Bank of Scotland was established by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland on 17th July 1695 'for the Carrying on and Managing of a Publick Bank'. It is the only bank ever to be founded by such an Act and the</i> <i><b>only commercial institution created by the Scots Parliament</b></i> <i>which is still in existence.

<p>With all due respect to you both, neither of you has really provided much in the way of external evidence. Surely some of that would settle the matter far more effectively than bickering?

<dd>By the way, Mais Oui, I have no <i>con</i> arguments to offer; but I do question two of your <i>pro</i> arguments: 1) surely "public" bank just means not <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_bank.html" title="Private bank">private</a>? 2) A control on banknote printing is critical in the modern era of floated currency, since that's how the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_supply.html" title="Money supply">money supply</a> is regulated.

<li>Neither the Bank of Scotland, or anyone else, describe the bank as the "central bank of the Kingdom of Scotland". The bank's own history states they were set up for the purposes of promoting trade ie a commerical bank. If they were a "central bank", then it would be stated in the bank's own account of their history- I don't think they would miss something as important as that. I have asked Mais_oui to provide evidence that the Bank of Scotland was a central bank, but he refuses. His reverts state that users should discuss their reasons on the talk page, even though I have contacted him directly on here, and on his talk page. If Mais_oui cannot provide any evidence that the Bank was a central bank it must be removed. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 10:49, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK, to end this ridiculous situation I'll try to write a compromise version. Unfortunately, it will violate the no original research policy, since it will say "some say..." and the <i>some</i> will refer to wikipedia editors, not the public at large. But that's better than letting this preposterous little dispute go on.

<dd>I'm sorry, but that's even worse. Either it was or it wasn't a central bank, and sticking in this fudge which really pleases no one is the worst kind of compromise, which just makes wikipedia look bad.

<dd>I think that Doops compromise wording is actually very good and clear. Many sources equate the BoE and BoS of this period, thus implying that the BoS was also a central bank. The difference of interpretation should be made explicit in the article, and not shuffled off under the carpet. Wikipedia is not here to represent "official" versions of history (or official versions of anything else)., but to attempt to present the truth. The truth is that many writers and readers over the centuries have understood the BoS and BoE to be equivalent institutions from the outset. If they are not, we deserve a cogent disposition of the difference of interpretation in the article. Doops' edit is a good start.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 13:31, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mais oui appears to be wrong, and should certainly desist from trying to edit his view into the article unless he provides supporting evidence (and preferably discusses it here first). The only thing central bankish about the BoS was an initial monopoly on public banking, meaning no-one else was permitted to issue banknotes etc. It did not lend to government, was not controlled by it, and did not control the money supply as a whole. I've added an explicit comparison with the Bank of England. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 23:22, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>One of the banks mentioned in HBoS's family tree (see the "history" link, in the external links in the article) is the Caledonian Bank. The official history refers only to the original bank, up until its merger with the BoS in the early 20th Century. But in the early 1990s there was a branch of the Caledonian in St. Andrew Square in Edinburgh, and just for the novelty of it, I had an account with them. It seemed to be a bit of an experiment in branding for business banking. Clearly it was quite small-scale: my cheque book showed an unusual 4-digit account number rather than the usual 8! A few of their documents had BoS branding on them, so the excercise was incomplete, and the connection sure. But I have no documentation relating to it now. Does anybody have anything we could refer to, to allow for a mention of this, and to give an explanation of what they were up to? – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 17:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
