<p>I believe my version's better, so I reverted back to it. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's less bottom heavy - a good intro doesn't just introduce the sections, it summarises them.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I may be amenable to accept this, but I think it's still bloated. It is not crucially relevant to the terms themselves how they were transformed over time into something different - this does not belong to the introduction. Besides, if you put everything in the intro, there isn't anything really left for the article. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Banate" is the English word for banovina, following the same pattern as khanate and margravate.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't able to find it in any dictionaries when I originally searched for it, nor is it actually popular on Google (the first ten hits of "ban banate" search are either ours or not particularly known; the results of a "banate" search largely aren't about this at all), so I'm wary of introducing the neologism. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a>
<dl>
<dd>Banate is far from neologism, IIRC, it's what Britannica 1911 uses. I was surprised not to find it in dictionaries, since it is fairly common in historical texts, at least those I've read. The medieval glossary at <a href="http://netserf.cua.edu/glossary/b.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://netserf.cua.edu/glossary/b.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (looks well researched and referenced) seems to agree. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 16:27, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A neologism doesn't have to be all that <i>neo</i> to be a neologism&#160;:) Although I agree that it happens, it can't be a particularly common word (i.e., not that much more common than a raw transcription like <i>banat</i> or <i>banovina</i>), you'll notice how the NetSERF glossary also mentions <i>banovina</i> and the reference is dated 1994, so historians also seem to still be in the process of accepting this term. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 12:49, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Calling the section on banovinas "20th century" is wrong, as the "medieval" position of Croatin ban existed until 1918.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The section title is because these bans were introduced in the 20th century and the previous section was named after a historical period, it breaks the flow to name this one after a country. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a>
<dl>
<dd>Still, the section headings make it sound like there were no bans between the middle ages and the 20th century.

The other unneccessary factoid was that Yugoslav banovine were named after rivers - very much impertinent here.

<dl>
<dd>I didn't know this was controversial. There's plenty of sources, many of them Croatian nationalists, so I'll just cite Lovrenovic <a href="http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&amp;reportid=151" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&amp;reportid=151" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, who is known to be anything but an extremist. As he says, "Banja" is clearly an adjective, so "spa" etymologies can't work. I'm not aware of any other explanations of what "Banja" might be an adjective of. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 13:06, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying it's <i>controversial</i>, but if it wasn't certain enough to get mentioned before, how certain is it...?

<p>What does look like a factoid, though, is the resemblance of "ban" to "khan". Are there any sources for those words being cognates? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 02:39, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, the Online Etymology Dictionary (an english source, but nonetheless) gives the origin as the Persian <i>ban</i> "prince, lord, chief, governor" and related to Sanskrit <i>pati</i> "guards, protects". The Sarmatian <i>bajan</i> seems to fit with this. So the turkish/mongolian <i>khan</i> does seem to be a bit of a red herring. I say remove the 'khan' until someone can point out some source claiming a relationship. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluePlatypus_82c6.html" title="User:BluePlatypus">BluePlatypus</a> 14:43, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. English "bank" is from Italian "banca", meaning "bench".

<p>800 years? Actually no, you are counting, on croatia's behalf, also those years of so called "banate" within hungary. This shouldn't be considered as real bans as this was more something of a romantic look back at history - compare it to when croat movements in the 19th century called croatians to be "illyrians". My point is: it is not important to the matter of how many years they had bans but rather in which way they had these bans, one cannot really call the croatian bans in the 18th century to be bans, they were perhaps bans to name but not in way of ruling. Bans existed in Bosnia all the way from 7th century to year 1463. Please you rewrite the article or I will do so. I am croatian myself and the public croatian historian view of the croatian usage of Bans is as following: croatian kings and knez's who adopted the name from local nativ ban rulers in Bosnia <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a> 23:41, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>just looked at croatian rulers and bosnian rulers and it looks like you mixed up the years!, the bans where in bosnia for 800 years and in croatia for 500, by other words the other way around. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></dd>

<p>No the croatian "bans" are from 1107-1527, after 1527 Habsburgers ruled croatia and it was no longer a banate. Making it to be some 500 years + short periods later mainly in hungary-union, not making it more than 550 years at the most.

<li>Ban, as it occurs in the Croatian tradition and history, originates in the efforts of Ban Jelačic in the 19th century to make Croatia less dependent from Hungary. Croatia had been treated as a constituent part of Hungary since the 12th century, and this was a major achievement when it comes to the preservation of that Croatian identity and defining it as it is today. Croatia borders have been very much defined during that time, the borders of today’s Republic Croatia not being immune to it. The references to ban in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia are linked to this tradition and do not have much in common with the titles of the medieval Bosnian rulers, which in fact predate them. However, the origin of the title ban, as in Kulin ban, may very well be indigenous to Bosnia, i.e. does not necessarily indicate a vassal position of the Bosnian rulers, as a matter of fact it would be hard to produce evidence to support that implication. It is a very bold statement at its best.</li>

<p>Illyrian origin? Not likely. The term exists in Chinese and Iranian&#160;:-)))))) Cf. Chinese <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tai-Pan_1eca.html" title="Tai-Pan">Tai-Pan</a>, Lo-Ban, and so on. <i>Pan</i> and <i>Ban</i> mean "leader" in Chinese, unless I'm mistaken. I go for an Asiatic origin. By the way, can we please have <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">references</a> for the Illyrian origin theory? Sorin Paliga, a <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_linguistics.html" title="Historical linguistics">historical linguist</a>, has also proposed a Daco-Thracian origin for the term, but I doubt it is from Dacians, Thracians, or Illyrians.

<p>The title was first used in the lands of Bosnia, there is no discussion about that. Later it was incorporated into Croatian rule, due to Croatian occupation of Bosnian areal and rulers. So I repeat; The title was <b>not</b> used in Croatia first, but in <b>Bosnia</b>. I suppose you will change this or else there will be some complications. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_1010.html" title="User:Damir Mišić">Damir Mišić</a></p>

<dd>For Damir: I do not care where the title was used first, but you just reverted to an old version of the article destroying all changes and improvements that other users made in this article. That is not quite nice behaviour, you know. If you want to change something, please change, but in the CURRENT VERSION of the article (not in the one several months old), and please DO NOT DESTROY THE WORK OF OTHER USERS.

<p>The title entered English from Croatian not Serbo-Croat. The latter is just an older name for Central-South Slavic diasystem (still in use somewhere though), dialectal continuum not a standard language.--<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactanista_f498.html" title="User:Factanista">Factanista</a> 13:23, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, the word is not Croatian by origin. Since there are several theories about its origin and since it was also used in medieval Bosnia (and medieval Bosnia was not a Croatian land no matter what some Croatian historins claim), the title is connected with Serbs as much as it is connected with Croats. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 15:15, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
