	    <p><b>Banya</b> (<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a>: баня) is a traditional <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> steam bath. The banya is not as hot as the Finnish <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauna.html" title="Sauna">sauna</a>, but what it lacks in temperature is compensated by pouring more water over the stones of the stove, creating <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam.html" title="Steam">steam</a> and higher <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humidity.html" title="Humidity">humidity</a>. Studies have shown that the high-heat and method of producing steam in a Russian banya vaporises the water to a smaller particles, implying a more effective vaporisation, which is meant to impart a more pervasive heating than can be achieved with other saunas, and feels dryer than Finnish saunas<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the steam room (called parilka, парилка) there is a wood stove, where the heat comes from. Beside the stove stands a bucket of water that is poured over the heated stones of the stove. Usually across the stove are wooden benches.</p>
<p>There are banyas that are heated "black" (по-чёрному) and banyas that are heated "white" (по-белому). In the first case, the smoke is led out through a hole in the ceiling. They are characterized by boulder stones and clay balls and cauldrons for the hot water. The firewood is usually birch. The smoke from the wood darkens the inside of the banya (therefore "black"). For white banyas there are different constructions, but all have stone stoves with a tank to heat the water. Therefore, white banyas need bigger branches as firewood. Some banyas are in the inside of big stone stoves.</p>
<p>In most Russian banyas it is customary to have three rooms, the steam room, the washing room, and an entrance room. The entrance room customarily has pegs to hang clothing upon and benches to rest on. The washing room has a tap of very hot water, which is heated in the stove of the steam chamber. A vessel or tap for cold water is usually located here for mixing the water to accommodate a comfortable washing temperature. The heater is usually composed of three compartments, with a fire box that is fed from the entrance room. Sitting atop this is the rock chamber, which usually has a small hole to throw the water into; the smoke pipe continues up through the rock chamber and through the water tank, which is the top-most section of the stove. A tap connects the water tank to the washing room to supply the hot water for washing. The top of the water tank is usually closed to prevent vapour from infiltrating the banya, and water to be thrown on the rocks should be taken from the tank as this will make better steam than if cold water were used. If an electric heater is used, the firebox is omitted. Most Russians will identify the wood-burning stove as a better banya heater, and studies have shown that negative ions are produced from wood-fired heaters, whilst electic heaters produce positive ions. The steam chamber usually is entered when the stove is hot but has not yet been splashed with water. Getting a good sweat on before using water is preferred to using steam right away, as the sweat is thought to protect and condition the skin to the steam.</p>
<p>Chapkas, felt hats, are used to protect the hair, and a padjopnik (поджопник), or ass-pad is used to sit upon as the hot dry wood can be very uncomfrotable for bare skin. The chapka also allows the user to tolerate higher temperatures without feeling lightheaded or faint. Chapkas, padjopniks, and a felt mitt are commonly sold in sets at shops in Russia, along with aromatherapy scents specially made for inclusion into the steam water. After the first good sweat is induced, it is customary to cool off in the breeze outdoors, or splash with cold water or in a lake or river. The banya is then entered again, and steam is created by throwing small amounts of water upon the rocks in the heater. It is desirable to throw small enough amounts on rocks that are sufficiently hot to ensure that steam is fine and water evaporates quickly; otherwise steam will be too cool and have a clammy "feel". The steam should feel like a wave of heat and not be overly moist, this is due to the high temperature of the rocks and the quick evaporation, causing very fine particles of vapour that are highly dispersed. Waving the venik will also cause a wave of convective heat to be felt, the reverse of a wind-chill effect. The second sweat is commonly the first time venik would be used, but it is not uncommon to wait until the third session. After each sweat, cooling off is repeated, and patrons may take this break to drink beer, tea or other beverages, play games or relax in good company in an antechamber to the steam room. A black banya is much more rudimentary, and is generally considered to be less desirable than the "white" banya described above.</p>
<p>Commercial banyas often have only a steam room, or a steam room and a dry room depending on local custom, or the money the owner of the banya was willing to spend.</p>
<p>Going into the steam room is alternated with showers or baths of cold water, as well as standing in the breeze to cool off outside. In the parilka, people often hit themselves or others with bunches of dried branches and leaves from <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_birch.html" title="White birch">white birch</a> or other suitable wood (called venik, веник) in order to improve the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circulation_%28physiology%29.html" title="Circulation (physiology)">circulation</a>. In summer usually fresh brancheses, regarded rather short-lived and smelling of raw grass, in winter bushes that have been dried and then moistened in hot water previous to using them are taken. It is important that the bushes have leaves so it doesn't hurt. In the winter when it gets dark early, people may roll in the snow with no clothes on, or may run into cold lakes through holes cut into the ice for this purpose.</p>
<p>The dressing room is called predbannik (предбанник).</p>
<p>Another kind of banya is popular among the Russian military, mountaineers and other people who travel for extended periods in harsh natural environment. It's called "pokhodnaya banya" (походная баня, hike banya) and represents a steambath made in a tent. Hike banya is usually made on a bank of a river where many big round stones are available. The stones are made into a big circular pile, 1-4 meters in diameter, 0.5-1 meters in height, so that there is space left on the ground to make fire inside of the pile. Then, a lot of firewood is burned for a few hours in this improvised stove, until the stones on the surface of the pile become so hot that water poured on them turns into steam. Around the pile, a space is tarped to form a small tent. The banya is ready. It's supposed to have a lot of steam inside and be really hot, so that after it you could cool off in an ice-cold mountain river.</p>
