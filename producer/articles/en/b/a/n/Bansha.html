<p>The names Bansha and Kilmoyler do not appear in ancient records but instead this area was divided into different ecclesiastical administrations. The modern parish of Bansha &amp; Kilmoyler comprises the whole of the two Civil Parishes of Templeneiry and Clonbullogue, and also parts of the four parishes of Killardry, Relickmurry and Athassel, Kilshane and Cordangan. The Papal Taxation records of 1291 record Templeneiry and Clonbullogue as Nachrich and Clonhalke, Archbishop O'Hedian (1437) names them as Naryt and Clonbolygg. Bansha village is thought to be an ancient settlement and its main geographical features and landed gentry of the surrounding area were vividly described by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Lewis_%28publisher%29_b678.html" title="Samuel Lewis (publisher)">Samuel Lewis</a> in his Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, published in 1837. Historically, it was a small compact village comprising two streets and two lanes - Main Street and Barrack Street with adjacent Banner's Lane (named after the Rev. Benjamin Holford Banner, the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Ireland_72de.html" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> rector of the Parish of Templeneiry) and Cooke's Lane which was a small enclave off Main Street, named after a member of the Cooke Family of Cordangan Manor, who lived here. The Station Road from Bansha Bridge (over the River Ara) to Bansha railway station had a strategic importance for about a century as it was the commercial artery connecting the village to both the station and the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creamery.html" title="Creamery">creamery</a> which was the centre of activity each morning as trains arrived on one side of the road and busy creamery activity on the other side gave a vibrancy that has now been lost with the closure of both. The village expanded towards the end of the 20th century when the "Galtee View" residential area was developed in the <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glebe.html" title="Glebe">Glebe</a> close to the old Village <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watermill.html" title="Watermill">Mill</a>.</p>

<p>Bansha came to national prominence in the middle of the 20th century when Very Rev. John Canon Hayes, founder of <a href="../../../m/u/i/Muintir_na_T%C3%ADre_43c8.html" title="Muintir na Tíre">Muintir na Tíre</a> was appointed parish priest of Bansha &amp; Kilmoyler in 1946. Due largely to his endeavours, a factory - Bansha Rural Industries - was started and enjoyed some success producing preservatives for the Irish home market. At that time also, Bansha was to the forefront in developing many Muintir na Tíre initiatives and for a time in the 1950s enjoyed the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soubriquet.html" title="Soubriquet">soubriquet</a> of <i>The Model Parish</i>. While Bansha still relies mainly on an agricultural economy where dairying is the main preoccupation, many of its residents are employed in industry and commerce in neighbouring towns such as <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipperary.html" title="Tipperary">Tipperary</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/h/Cahir.html" title="Cahir">Cahir</a>, and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clonmel.html" title="Clonmel">Clonmel</a>, to where they commute on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Séamus Ryan, a native of Deerpark, in nearby Kilfeakle, was a member of the Irish Senate—<a href="../../../s/e/a/Seanad_%C3%89ireann_a7e0.html" title="Seanad Éireann">Seanad Éireann</a>—before his untimely death in 1933. Mr.&#160;Ryan and his wife, Agnes Harding of Solohead opened their first retail shop in Parnell Street, Dublin in 1918, known as the Monument Creamery. They specialised in the sale of dairy products and quickly developed their business to include a chain of over thirty restaurants and shops in Dublin over the next four decades. After Mr.&#160;Ryan's death, his widow carried on and indeed expanded the business.

He was born a few miles distant at 'Suirville', Ballyslatteen. He took part in many colonial campaigns in Canada and India, but mainly in Africa, including the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashanti.html" title="Ashanti">Ashanti</a> wars and the <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu_War_2854.html" title="Zulu War">Zulu War</a> under General <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolseley.html" title="Wolseley">Wolseley</a>.

His views on colonialism were often controversial as he was sympathetic to the natives in many of the outposts of Empire in which he served. His wife, the famous battle artist, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Thompson_6e83.html" title="Elizabeth Thompson">Elizabeth Thompson</a> (1846-1933), known as Lady Butler, continued to live at the Castle until 1922 when she went to live at Gormanston Castle, Co.

Lady Butler died in 1933 in her 87th year and is buried at Stamullen graveyard in County Meath, just up the road from Gormanston. Among her many famous paintings is "The Roll Call" depicting a scene in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimean_War_40b1.html" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a>.

Both Billy and Stephen, together with their brother Bobby and sister Antoinette, spent many childhood days at Bansha Castle where they were once marooned during the civil war when Bansha and the surrounding area was the cockpit for fighting between the Free State forces and the local republicans.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bansha.html" title="Edit section: The McCarthys of Springhouse">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The McCarthys of Springhouse</span></h2>
<p>The McCarthy Reagh family of Carbery in west Cork were aristocrats of the old gaelic order (Lords and Princes of Carbery) and had their original base at Kilbrittain Castle. Denis McCarthy Reagh, Chief of the McCarthy Reaghs settled at Springhouse, near Bansha in the late 17th century where he built a mansion and had an estate of 9,000 acres, which in its day was considered to be the largest cultivated farm in Europe. Owing to the severity of the Penal Laws, his grandson, also named Denis went into exile in France where he died at Argenton, Berry in 1761. Justin McCarthy (1744-1811), son of the exiled Denis, realised his father's property and settled at <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toulouse.html" title="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>. He was an accomplished linguist and classical scholar. He cultivated the fine arts and possessed one of the finest libraries in France, rivalling the King's collection at Paris. Because of his illustrious Irish ancestry he was ennobled by <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Louis_XVI_fe69.html" title="King Louis XVI">King Louis XVI</a> as Count of Toulouse in 1776 and was admitted to the honours of the French Royal Court in Paris. The McCarthy family were noted priest-protectors in penal times and Springhouse was considered a safe haven for priests on-the-run from persecution. A namesake, Donough McCarthy was consecrated Bishop of Cork &amp; Cloyne on 16 Aug. 1713 in <i>Villa Domus Fontis</i> which was the latinised equivalent of Springhouse. Another member of the family of a later generation was Catherine McCarthy of Ballygurteen, Kilmoyler, who survived the sinking of the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Titanic_9d7a.html" title="RMS Titanic">RMS Titanic</a> in 1912. The family still survives in Ireland and also in France through the daughters of Count Justin of Toulouse who married into the French aristocracy. A family branch of recent memory lived at 'Coolavunga' in the townland of Barnlough during the 20th century and members of that family still reside in Tipperary Town. The family's great mansion was dismantled in the early 19th century with only a trace remaining near the lake shore in the grounds of Kilshane House which was built by the Lowes who replaced them in the 1820s and who also had an estate in Kenmare, Co. Kerry. The place was called Springhouse because there was a spring or well near a whitethorn tree close to the scullery at the rear of the mansion house and the townland assumed this name thereafter.</p>

<p>There is a vibrant contemporary scene in Bansha which is experiencing an unprecedented increase in population due to new housing developments. The Bansha Agricultural Show is held annually and in recent years, the social scene has been augmented by the festival week in late August. For recreation, game shooting and fishing in the rivers Suir, Ara and Aherlow are popular pastimes. For the more athletic, there are also a number of sporting clubs such as Bansha Athletic Club, Bansha Golf Society, Bansha Celtic F.C. which promotes Association football (soccer) and the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galtee_Rovers_GAA_6468.html" title="Galtee Rovers GAA">Galtee Rovers GAA</a> - Hurling &amp; Gaelic Football Club (affiliated to the GAA, 1885). The latter two clubs enjoy a friendly co-existence as many of their football players are members of both clubs.</p>
