<dd>Hell no. In fact, I'm pretty annoyed at the overall quality of your recent edits. Your two new articles (<a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_bandgap.html" title="Direct bandgap">direct bandgap</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indirect_bandgap.html" title="Indirect bandgap">indirect bandgap</a>) were not introduced properly, and were too hard to understand for someone who didn't already know it. Plus they were conceptually wrong - silicon absorbs light quite well, despite its indirect bandgap. And you don't use GaAs for fibre lasers, you use erbium doped glass.</dd>

<dd>It's true. If you want to explain it better, fine. I didn't put it back in because I forgot, not because I disagree with it.

<dd>Actually you are right, it is true. I wasn't thining hard enough about that. I can't think of how to better explain it right now.

<dd>In the direct-bandgap article, I wasn't referring to a "fibre laser", and my original wording was "fibre-optic laser", which clearly implies a laser using in fibre-optics (communications), not a fibre laser. To be more clear, however, it should have read "solid-state laser for use in fibre-optics". --<a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgrant_02cc.html" title="User:Dgrant">User:Dgrant</a></dd>

<p>I'm actually wondering now if that figure is even correct at all. Did you get it from a source, or draw it yourself? It might actually be good to show one of those classic figures where they show the difference between a metal, insulator, and semiconductor, insofar as the bandgap. --<a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgrant_02cc.html" title="User:Dgrant">User:Dgrant</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I got it from lecture notes, so it's not very reliable. You made a good point about mobility. But I hadn't heard the one about number of carriers at melting point before. The usual definition (used obliquely in <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insulator.html" title="Insulator">insulator</a>) is conductivity at zero K. -- Tim</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The mobility point I made was not explained very well. I used the phrase: "significant amount of carriers" which is again kind of vague. I only brought up the melting point issue because we want to talk about temperatures at which the material is in solid state, but I think that just makes it more confusing... The more I think about it, the more hard I think it is to define what an insulator is... Actually, conductivity at O K is a difficult thing to look at as well. Semiconductors become insulators and superconductors become VERY conducting.... --<a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgrant_02cc.html" title="User:Dgrant">User:Dgrant</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this statement is a bit vague: "In many devices this kind of conductivity is undesirable, and larger bandgap materials give better performance". I think we should say, "In a &lt;blank&gt; device, this kind of conductivity is better..." where &lt;blank&gt; is an example of one of these devices. --<a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgrant_02cc.html" title="User:Dgrant">User:Dgrant</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Fine, go for it. Just remember: make it better, don't delete it. -- Tim</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just a couple of nit-picky points I would like to make. The first one is that I'm confused as to who we are aiming the article at. You explain that "e" is the exponential "function" yet just state chemical formulae (GaAlAs etc.) without explanation. If you assume the target reader is newbie enough to not know what "e" means in the expression, they are unlikely to know what some of those chemicals are. Secondly, this phrase seems to make no sense to me whatsoever: "Conductivity is undesirable, and larger band gap materials give better performance." Conductivity is what makes, for example, the internet possible. I fail to see how conductivity can therefore be undesirable! That sentence needs either removing or a big revision to make clear exactly what is meant, particularly making reference to what situations high conductivities are undesirable. I understand that some people will find some of this very nit picky, but it's something I've picked up from my project supervisor! &#160;:P Lateralis 19:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The only available carriers for conduction are the electrons which have enough thermal energy to be excited across the band gap,"</p>
<p>Is this correct? It is my understanding that the conductivity of intrinsic semiconducter material is due to thermally generated electron-hole pairs so that the charge carriers are an equal number of electrons (in the conduction band) and holes (in the valence band). <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 16:20, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It would be really nice if someone would explain where the band gap arises from. It has something to do with the periodic potential (in the free electron model it disturbs the free-electron energy band -&gt; bragg reflection creates the bonding and antibonding states at the edges of brillouin zones and the energy gap is the "area" between bonding- and antibonding state energies at the edge) but why aren't there any quantum states in the gap? Would be really helpful. Sorry for my english, hope you can understand&#160;:) --Risto 28.1--<a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETiresais_c82c.html" title="User:Tiresais">Tiresais</a> 17:13, 18 July 2006 (UTC)0, 2005</p>
<p><br />
to Risto; the bandgap is the electron-conductance of material as defined by its atomic structure, where:</p>
<p>e (-Eg/kT)</p>
<p>e is the exponential function Eg is the band gap energy k is Boltzmann's constant T is temperature</p>
<p>Electron transfer is dependant upon two points material band gap and temperature.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I do know that the atomic structure defines the size of the bandgap, I do know that the probability for an electron to be at a certain state is given by Fermi-Dirac distribution, but what I'd like to know is where the band gap arises from quantum mechanically. Or didn't I just understand what you tried to say&#160;:) --Risto</dd>

<dd>Only two electrons can occupy one energy band in quantum mechanics. The proximity of atoms in a solid mean that there must be many levels bunched together (otherwise how could the electrons exist?). The closeness of these levels give rise to the appearance of 'bands' of energies within which electrons can occupy. In insulators and semi-conductors, energy is reqiured to free the electron from the valence bands in the lattice, hence the band-gap is the energy to free the electrons from the lattice structure. Is that the answer you were looking for?--<a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETiresais_c82c.html" title="User:Tiresais">Tiresais</a> 14:07, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't make the original question, but you explained it pretty clear I think! As to his last question: "but why aren't there any quantum states in the gap" - The answer is of course that it wouldn't be a gap of there were (occupiable) states in it! But I would like to rephrase the question as: What, from a QM point of view, determines the size of the bandgap? Is it purely atomic structure? I would think it has to do with the ease in which orbitals can be mixed, or is that incorrect? Is there some general rule to understand this? -- Mipmip 08:44, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Presumably the size of the band gap depends on how strongly an electron is held in the lattice structure of the material. MY A level course didn't cover what effects this strength, however. sorry I can't help any further... Might be worth checking round related articles in lattice structure and bond strength. --<a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETiresais_c82c.html" title="User:Tiresais">Tiresais</a> 17:13, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed the big table of band gaps (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Band_gap&amp;diff=110870216&amp;oldid=110869646" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Band_gap&amp;diff=110870216&amp;oldid=110869646" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). It was unsourced - so there is no way of knowing if it is accurate or even if it is a copyright violation. --<a href="../../../h/2/g/User%7EH2g2bob_b842.html" title="User:H2g2bob">h2g2bob</a> 18:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
