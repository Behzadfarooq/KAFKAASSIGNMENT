<p>As I write this (April 3, 2006 8:55pm) I am in a lively discussion with a Bangor, Maine resident and writer of the official Bangor website who takes issue with the accuracy of Wikipedia in general and the Bangor, Maine and Bangor Area Transit articles in particular. He is definitely anti-wiki. I as a avid reader and contributor is of course pro Wiki. Read and decide for yourself.</p>
<p>Sorry for the "longnormous" link, but I don't know how to shorten it. The discussion was in the alt.tv.lost newsgroup and the relevant points begins with Hunter, which is me lamenting about an error I made in regards to when the new Ben Franklin $100 dollar bills debuted. It begins with reply no. 7 in the google group alt.tv.lost and I say:</p>
<p>"Sigh. Never mind. I finally did what I should had done in the first place and looked it up. The large portrait Ben Franklin $100 bill was introduced in 1996. Oh well. Note to self: ALWAS consult Wikipedia before posting"</p>
<p>Then the ant-Wiki guy, Ryan Robbins jumps in.</p>
<p>Enjoy. I hope I acquitted myself and wiki well. The discussion is still going on as I write this</p>

<p>Even as an 8-year-old kid who <b>loved</b> Bangor (I was born and grew up there) I could never believe that ridiculous story about the guy whistling some hymn while he's in a office dedicated to naming the settlement. The bureaucrat says: "What's that?" "Bangor." "Oh, okay. See ya later." So the first guy then walks off without bothering to tell the official what the name is supposed to be? Or wondering why the guy doesn't ask him what it's supposed to called?</p>
<p>Total bullshit. Let's ask Stephen King -- he's another writer: does this sound plausible enough to put into any of <b>his</b> stories? <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 30 June 2005 04:30 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I've lived all my life in Bangor, and I agree with you--but the article does note the story as being "apocryphal," which means "probably not true." Here's my theory: I actually heard the settlers wanted the town to be called Sunbury, so I think when the minister went to Boston, he merely chose Bangor as the name instead, in honor of his favorite hymn... and then made up some silly story to cover his, ahem, "mistake." And since we'll never know the answer to this, asking Stephen King merely because he's a writer isn't going to answer it for us. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndyfitz_13eb.html" title="User:Indyfitz">Indy</a> 23:26, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

This was a few years ago now, but I seem to remember there having been something like 13 towns in the USA called Bangor, and about 6 towns called Belfast. With the large number of Scots-Irish and Irish-Americans in the USA, would it be surprising if this town wasn't named after the town of Bangor located in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>? The only tune I can think of that mentions Bangor refers to the town in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>.

<dd>I just read all of that. Hilarious!! I know of this guy, as I am from Bangor, and frankly his childish arguments are embarrassing. He does seem to be nothing more than anti-Wiki--probably watched too many Siegenthaler media interviews. Anyway, the whole point behind Wikipedia is that it's a self-correcting system; the various users work to constantly improve and correct. That's why there are external links all over the place--to support what's there. The BIG QUESTION, of course, is why this guy didn't merely correct the inaccuracies. Apparently he more enjoys crapping on Wikipedia and those who support it, and whining about inaccuracies. I'm sure, as others like him do, he'd argue that he doesn't want any part of such a bad thing... but taking part and correcting errors makes it a better thing, so that's a circular argument. I just realized I'm rambling, so I'll shut up now. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndyfitz_13eb.html" title="User:Indyfitz">Indy</a> 00:28, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, you make some good points, which ought to be brought up from time to time when the frustration level of dealing with idiots all the time becomes too much.

<p>I think the historical pictures used in the entry aren't the best choice for representing modern day Bangor. I think we should use modern pictures in the majority of the entry, and save the historical pictures for the "history" part of the entry, or for the bangor historical society. What follows are are my reasons why each picture should be changed, along with a suggestion of what should replace it.</p>
<ol>
<li>1. "Central Park circa 1910" What is pictured here is now a small set of parking spaces next to city call. There is no park there to take a picture of anymore. Further more, that picture is in the "media" part of the entry. Would it not make more sense to have a picture of "WLBZ", or perhaps even the "Bangor Daily News" office buildings in that spot?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>2. "Old Post Office circa 1910" This building doesn't exist anymore either, and hasn't since 1911. Why on earth do we have this image representing the city when this building hasn't existed in the city for over 90 years? Why not instead have a picture of the current Downtown area? A picture such as the fountian in front of the wig and couriour.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>3. "Pickering Square circa 1910" Anyone who may view this website, and see's this picture will be quite shocked by the modern version of Pickering Square. Picking square is now a parking garage, a bus station, and a local hang out for hoodlums. I feel a modern day picture of main street would fit better here.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>4. "Post Office and Peirce Memorial circa 1945" I have no objection to this picture other than it is outdated. The building pictured is now City Hall and not the post office. I feel that A more modern picture of the Memorial with the Bangor Public Library behind it would be more suited to being the first picture in the "cultural" section of the entry.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>5. "Chapin Park circa 1906 &amp; Park Street circa 1910" these pictures while very nice have both been put in the "sports and recreation" section of the entry. Neither of these locations are good representations of the modern day "sports and recreation" that occurs in bangor. I feel some more modern pictures of the 13th street stadium, park, andwater park be more suited for this section.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>6. "Penobscot County Courthouse in 1999, Hammond Street" This is a very nice picture. It's modern, it's clear, but why is it in the "Famous Bangorians" section of the website? Would it not make more sense to have a picture of Stephen King's house instead? Or perhaps maybe just a picture of the Hannibal Hamlin statue downtown?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now don't get me wrong here i'm all for history and preserving it. But this is wiki, not the "Bangor Historical Society."</p>

<p>A long article in yesterday's New York Times about the salmon fishing in the Penobscot jogged my memory about the old-time Bangor salmon pool, which, as I recall, was just below the dam. Beginning in 1912, the first salmon caught every year went to the President in Washington. I'm too lazy to do it myself, but there's lotsa info available on the Net for someone to put in a (small) paragraph about this. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 05:15, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed it has the Mayor's term ending in 2006. As it is now 2007 it would be good to get the new Mayor in there. I'd do it, but I don't live in Bangor anymore.</p>
<p>I also played with some pictures - I've done some photography work on Bangor and thought I'd add some of the nice shots I took here. I didn't want to totally grab all the photo spots, so I left several of them. Just thought it might dress up the article a bit! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGambitMG_03dc.html" title="User:GambitMG">GambitMG</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/m/User_talk%7EGambitMG_ec47.html" title="User talk:GambitMG">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GambitMG_6b27.html" title="Special:Contributions/GambitMG">contribs</a>) 23:38, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Paul Wall was born in Bangor? I have not been able to verify this; it seems that several sites list his origin as Houston, Texas. I have not found any mention of Bangor anywhere else. Does anyone have a source for this? Spacemanspif 05:37, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>While I don't like to edit articles myself, there are three bridges that connect Bangor to Brewer, the Veterans Memorial Bridge which is I-395, the Joshua Chamberlain Bridge and Penobscot River Bridge (official name?)</p>
