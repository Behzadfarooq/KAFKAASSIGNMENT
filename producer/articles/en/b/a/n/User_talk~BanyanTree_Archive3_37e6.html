<p>I am contacting people who previously helped to vote to delete a generally objectionable photograph by a vote of 88 to 21, and who might be unaware that immediately after that image was voted to be deleted someone posted <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html#Autofellatio_2" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">another which was very similar in content.</a> My objections to this, and the previous image that was voted to be deleted might be based upon reasons far different from any that you have, but I <b>do</b> object to it, and consider the posting of such images to be acts of asinine stupidity, which burdens the project and its major educational aims in ways that they should not be burdened, and can be extremely detrimental to the acceptance and growth of WIkipedia's use and influence. Thus far those who I believe to be in the extreme minority of Wikipedians who would like to include these images, many who have been channeled to the voting page from the article with which it is associated have dominated the voting, 23 to 12 (as of the time that I composed this message). I would like to be somewhat instrumental in shedding a bit more light upon the issue, and if possible, helping to turn the tide against its inclusion. It might also be necessary to begin making an effort to establish an explicit Wikipedia policy against explicite photographic depictions of humans engaged in erotic, auto-erotic, or quasi-erotic activities. To my limited knowledge such images have <i>not</i> been accepted as appropriate <i>anywhere</i> else within this project, and frankly I can agree with those who are casually labeled <i>prudes</i> for opposing their inclusion, that they should <i>not</i> be. <b>Vitally important information that might be unwelcome by some is one thing that should never be deleted, but <i>un-needed</i> images that can eventually prevent or impede many thousands or millions of people from gaining access to the great mass of truly important information that Wikipedia provides is <i>quite</i> another matter.</b> There are vitally important distinctions to be made. Whatever your reasons, or final decisions upon the matter, I am appealing for more input on the voting that is occurring at <b><a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html#Autofellatio_2" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion</a></b>. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 01:19, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not as familiar with West Africa but according to <a href="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3013" class="external text" title="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3013" rel="nofollow">this</a>, they are different. The AFRC was the former government military, which carried out a coup <i>against</i> the government in 1997, while it was fighting the RUF. The RUF and AFRC then seemed to almost merge before ECOWAS invaded in 98. But there a clearly different origins. I didn't know this before, but it looks like the AFRC was the dominant partner, so maybe the post-1998 mention of "RUF forces" is inaccurate and should be "AFRC forces", though I'd check a few more sources before making such a claim.

I have been arguing against the misinformed and unsubstantiated statements added to both articles by <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoylee_ce6a.html" title="User:Roylee">User:Roylee</a>. Roylee answered to my question on his talk and on <a href="../../../m/e/n/Talk%7EMende_language_ab45.html" title="Talk:Mende language">Talk:Mende language</a> by simply reverting back to his previous version. I don't want to turn this into an overheated argument so I'm stepping back from it for today, after having carefully explained my position and actions. If you have the time, could you take a look at the situation and maybe try to explain policies like Cite sources, Verifiability, Reliable sources, Weasel words, etc. to Roylee? Besides you, I have also asked <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">User:Garzo</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">User:Mustafaa</a> to tune in, hoping to bring reason to these articles.

<li>Hi mark, I took a look and agree with you. But, as Roylee hasn't made any edits since, I've watchlisted both of the above pages and will see if he continues his pattern of edits before jumping in.

<li>Thanks a lot! There is more to it. If you feel like digging into a web of crackpot and fringe theories being edited into Wikipedia in a self-supporting way, I invite you to take a look at his other contributions and at my most recent remark on his talk page. Mende people in the Americas (<i>before</i> the Transatlantic slave trade), shipbuilding in the Sahara, a relation between the Mende of Sierra Leone and the Mende langauge of Papua New Guinea... it seems that <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/@HH!1E!ED!919A26D33BAB/PAULNUBIAEMPIRE/BLACKCIVILIZATIONS/" class="external text" title="http://community-2.webtv.net/@HH!1E!ED!919A26D33BAB/PAULNUBIAEMPIRE/BLACKCIVILIZATIONS/" rel="nofollow">this page</a> contains all those outlandish claims. What worries me most is that he seems to edit articles that are not watched very closely; many of his unsubstantiated additions have not been called into doubt simply because he is the last editor. I don't like it at all. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 18:20, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think I saw something about Mende being derived from British English, which may be the most amusing tidbit.

<dd>Thanks for looking into it and for posting it at RC patrol! I've been busy removing lots of <s>bosh</s> unsubstantiated statements from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maritime_archeology.html" title="Maritime archeology">Maritime archeology</a>, carefully placing it on its talk page, listing problems and violated policies and guidelines... but there is much more and I'm losing courage (and patience). I hope the RC patrol listing will bring in other editors to examine his edits and take appropriate action.</dd>
<dd>You know, things like this really touch Wikipedia in its weakest spot. They drain the resources of polite and patient editors who instead of checking and removing pseudofacts should be contributing quality content. It is very disturbing. I'm inclined to simply revert everything without checking; this should simply be a case of 'showing the door to trolls'. In fact, if no-one is going to give a very good argument against it, I will do it. What are your thoughts? — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 22:07, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am similarly inclined. I reverted one of the Moroccan towns he edited without checking the actual info, but then decided that I should run it by someone to make sure I wasn't paranoid, which is why I put it on RC patrol. If you want to go ahead, perhaps with a edit summary explaining the situation and inviting reverts from legit users if the info is actually good, I'd be the first to applaud. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 22:15, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, you are so much more of a thorough editor than I. I was thinking of an edit summary like "Roylee has been placing information on fringe theories into Wikipedia, which is now being removed wholesale. Please revert this edit if the information in this case was actually valid." It's definitely not worth getting stressed over. Let a couple more eyes take a look at it from the note on RC patrol and work on it when you want to. I'll probably start taking on a bit sometime this weekend, but right now I need to go out and eat Salvadoran with friends. Hmmm... yummy.

<dd>Not on your break yet?&#160;;) Looks good. If you intend to refer people to it, a little explanation would be useful - either your text above or my RC notice would work with minimal tweaking. I don't even know why you're bothering to move questionable content to talk pages. It's available in the history and this has certainly progressed beyond the stage of polite notices, though I suppose that it might make more people aware of Roylee's pattern of edits. I've begun taken the stance that unless the edit is obviously innocuous, it should be reverted - and let another user revert it back if the info was good. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a> notes on RC patrol some other questionable edits that I wasn't aware of.

Wikipedia convention is that articles should have the commonly used English version of a name, if there is one.

The RDR seems to be the only group that hasn't attracted a consistent English transliteration. At some point I will get around to starting the AliR article and will note its original French name in the text before making sure that the links to it in other articles are English, unless someone beats me to it. It's obviously not a big deal, especially since the article isn't made yet, but I thought I'd let you know beforehand.

<dd>On an entirely different topic, I have put up a notice for the creation of Uganda-geo-stub, which will probably actually be Ug-geo-stub (because I don't have the energy to type "anda"), at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_Criteria_7749.html#Africa-geo-stub_split-up" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Criteria">Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Criteria#Africa-geo-stub split-up</a>.

<p>I said it before, but I'll say it again... really strange I'd run into another admin on AA. What makes it even weirder is that it's the first time I've played in almost a year. I stopped playing back when one of the upgrades came out that caused everyone's client to crash when they were killed and tried to view other players. I've been playing the PS2 game Mercenaries a lot recently and it made me want to get back into AA. I was actually dreading having to go through all that training again, but luckily my account was still active. Anyway, hope I see you on again sometime and hopefully I won't be in such a spot as to increase your ROE&#160;:/ <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 06:47, May 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First for me too, unless there are some users with different names. I've only had an account about six months, most of that stuck in 2.1 after all the non-Mac people switched to 2.3, and just started playing again two weeks ago when I saw the upgrade was out. Yeah, last night I felt like I should be in opfor for a while there. I had been out on the town for seven hours and thought I'd get a game in before crashing. Hopefully I'll run into you again, with unimpaired skills. &#160;;) - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 16:05, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hi banyan tree, I just put up a stub for <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_mundi.html" title="Axis mundi">axis mundi</a> after getting over the initial shock of its absence in the wikipedia, and figured i'd drop you a note after looking at the "what links here" and seeing your plan for the entry. Its not very in depth, you might want to look at it. my own personal feeling is that the page should be "axis mundi" and not "world axis"; i don't think world axis is commonly used- but i'd certainly be willing to discuss that. I will add more to the page but only had time to put up a stub at the moment. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> 22:45, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Heah! Wow, <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_mundi.html" title="Axis mundi">axis mundi</a> looks great. Thank goodness somebody got around to adding it! I was truly shocked as well, even though I normally don't edit in that area. I added a redirect from <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_axis.html" title="World axis">world axis</a>. I agree that axis mundi is probably more common (and sounds cooler) but I have a habit of using the English version of everything possible. "Axis mundi" is such a dominant usage that I'm certainly not going to fuss about it.</dd>

<dd>Hi TreveX, I had actually already put the new human rights page on my watchlist before your message. Nice work, especially in how you've been shaping up the core Uganda pages. I'll have to see if I have something to contribute to the new articles.</dd>
<dd>I've been meaning to go through the new district pages and put them on my watchlist since you made them, but couldn't force myself to do it. So putting the new geo stubs in was a good excuse, and I was also able to find some articles that had not been brought into the geo-stub fold previously, and add a little content from casual knowledge. Mind you - most of my "casual knowledge" seems to relate to conflicts, so I may have just given the impression that that every single district was in the middle of violent upheaval. Ha! In any case, it certainly cleared up the Uganda-stub category page.

<dd>That is a tough one. On first look, Watch seems to have been set up for a different purpose. Roylee is already listed on the RC patrol page, which is probably the most relevant.

I had left a message on the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EBabel_adb3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Babel">Babel talk</a> page which outlines very briefly my ideas, but hadn't had any response so I decided to make a couple of examples to drum up a little interest - I obviously succeeded because you talked to me!<br />
<br />
Although I had started with musical instruments, my aim was to produce a system similar to the language one which would enable Wikipedians to highlight their interests and proficiencies in a concise way on their user pages. I don't believe this is entirely unnecessary from an encyclopaedic point of view - it would facilitate communication between users about articles in which they have a particular interest; or perhaps might be able to contribute valuable knowledge. For example, a user tagging articles as stubs, finding one about a composer of music for the violin, might be able to bring up the User_violin category, and find someone with an interest in the instrument who would be happy to expand the article. As a <i>secondary</i> function, these templates would also make it easy for people to find like-minded users, and then see what they'd contributed to - an interesting way of broadening one's horizons by inviting exploration of parts of Wikipedia one might not otherwise have visited. I freely admit that the way I've set out the templates I've made so far is probably non-optimal; if the consensus is that I'm causing an unnecessary mess, I'll happily stop and concentrate my efforts on other aspects of Wikipedia. I planned to stop at the 5 categories I've made so far anyway, and to see what people's reactions were.<br />
<br />
I hope my actions won't have landed me in the doghouse - my intentions were honourable and I hope that you and other users will be able to understand what I was trying to achieve.

<dd>Hi Yummifruitbat,</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your message. It clarified your intent, which I was quite confused about. If nobody else has contacted you about it, I would assume they don't see a problem with it and I may be overly concerned. Since you seem to be having some trouble getting feedback, I've posted a message about your templates to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Music_6ac7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music</a>, the members of which have the background to give you informed feedback. Hopefully, you'll get some comments. Happy editing! - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 02:10, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi again BanyanTree - thanks for your help. As I mentioned on the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EBabel_adb3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Babel">Wikipedia_talk:Babel</a> page I didn't intend this idea to be confined to musical instruments, but to any major skill or interest. Music just seemed a logical place to start! I haven't received any other comments so far, but if the response from WikiMusic is generally negative, there won't be any hard feelings on my part.<br /></dd>
<dd>As an aside while I've got the attention of someone important, would you mind having a peek at <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douvres-la-D%C3%A9livrande_3216.html" title="Douvres-la-Délivrande">Douvres-la-Délivrande</a>? It's my first attempt at a proper de-stubbing, and it'd be nice to get some feedback. I'm not sure the infobox about the radar is really on the right page, but it seemed relevant and I didn't have a lot of information on which to base a whole article about the radar itself. I might do a bit of research and make that my next project, though. Thanks again for your help! -- <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYummifruitbat_2d22.html" title="User:Yummifruitbat">Yummifruitbat</a> 02:34, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I doubt that I'm "someone important", but I took a look. That's a nice and meaty expansion. I sometimes worry that I add too much information on conflicts to articles, but it's better than leaving it out, and someone else can always come along and add info on other topics. There is a <a href="../../../w/u/e/Wuerzburg_radar.html" title="Wuerzburg radar">Wuerzburg radar</a> article to which I moved the infobox. That article may need a page move, as well as a check for other needed redirect pages, if you want. More substantively, there appear to be contradictions between the article and box that need to be reconciled. I generally assume that anything World War II related has its own article, but couldn't find one on the Wasserman radar you mentioned. Feel free to drop by if you'd like further feedback.

<p>Next time you remove a deletion tag be sure you read the discussion thread before and and justify the reason why you are deleting the deletion tag.</p>
<p>That is all. - Take care. (added by <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.70.147.251.html" title="User talk:68.70.147.251">68.70.147.251</a>)</p>

<dd>Just received your response. I see no conflict with the speedy deletion notice, if you read our discussion in the discussion thread rather than aimlessly cherry-picking articles you would have known that. All the same I have no interest in debating the issue, I reported you for vandalism - I'll let the other admins handle the outcome. Goodnight.

<dd>The "aimless cherry-picking" you mention is sometimes referred to as "RC patrolling anon edits". Please sign your contributions on talk pages with four tildes (~~~~).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, the article has already been up at VFD and kept. There is no procedure for reaching "consensus" on a talk page and then slapping a speedy tag on it in the hopes that an admin ignores policy and gets rid of it. If you want it gone, put it up for VFD and argue your case. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 02:53, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
