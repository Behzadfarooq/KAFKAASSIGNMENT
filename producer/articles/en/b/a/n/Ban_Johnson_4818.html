<p>Johnson was born in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwalk%2C_Ohio_a6e1.html" title="Norwalk, Ohio">Norwalk, Ohio</a>. He studied law at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marietta_College_cfca.html" title="Marietta College">Marietta College</a>, but didn't complete his degree. He later became the sports editor of a paper in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati.html" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>. During this time, he befriended <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Comiskey_3d1e.html" title="Charles Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a>, who was then manager of the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>. At the suggestion of both Comiskey and Reds owner John Brush, Johnson was elected president of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_League_%28U.S._baseball%29_302b.html" title="Western League (U.S. baseball)">Western League</a>, a faltering <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_league_baseball.html" title="Minor league baseball">minor league</a>, at a reorganization meeting in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>.</p>
<p>Johnson had criticized the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a> for its rowdy atmosphere, which was driving away families and women. He set about making baseball more friendly to both. Contrary to the practice of the time, he gave his <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire_%28baseball%29.html" title="Umpire (baseball)">umpires</a> unqualified support and had little tolerance for players or managers who didn't give them due respect. He fined and suspended players who used foul language on the field. Soon, the Western League was recognized as not only the strongest minor league, but the best-run league in all of baseball.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_Johnson_4818.html" title="Edit section: Formation of the American League">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Formation of the American League</span></h2>
<p>Johnson, however, had a bigger plan--another major league. With the help of Comiskey, who bought the <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux_City_5228.html" title="Sioux City">Sioux City</a> franchise and moved it to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Paul%2C_Minnesota_4333.html" title="St. Paul, Minnesota">St. Paul</a> in 1894 after leaving the Reds, he began an ambitious plan of expansion. He got his chance after the 1899 season, when the National League dropped teams in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore.html" title="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland.html" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisville%2C_Kentucky_392f.html" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Johnson moved the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Rapids%2C_Michigan_4f0d.html" title="Grand Rapids, Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> franchise to Cleveland, where they would eventually become the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Indians</a>. He also had Comiskey move his St. Paul team to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, where they eventually became the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">White Sox</a>. The latter move was made with the blessing of the NL, which saw Comiskey's team as a way to head off any attempt to revive the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_%2819th_century%29_8ca3.html" title="American Association (19th century)">American Association</a>.</p>
<p>The 1900 season was an unqualified success, and Johnson received a 10-year contract extension. In October, he withdrew the American League from the National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues). The final step came on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28.html" title="January 28">January 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>, when he declared the American League would operate as a major league. He then upped the ante by placing teams in Baltimore, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and Washington.</p>
<p><a name="A_baseball_power" id="A_baseball_power"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_Johnson_4818.html" title="Edit section: A baseball power">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A baseball power</span></h2>
<p>The NL then made a critical blunder by limiting salaries to $2,400--a low sum even by 1901 standards. Johnson, Comiskey and the other AL owners responded by raiding NL rosters, promising disgruntled players much higher salaries. Eventually, over 100 players "jumped" to the new league. After a two-year war in which the AL trounced the NL in attendance both seasons, the NL sued for peace. Under a new National Agreement, the AL was formally recognized as the second major league. A three-man National Commission was set up, comprised of both league presidents and Reds owner <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Herrmann_562d.html" title="Garry Herrmann">Garry Herrmann</a>. Although Herrmann was nominal president of the commission, Johnson soon dominated the body.</p>
<p>Johnson ruled the American League with an iron hand. He brooked no criticism, and made it very difficult for men he didn't like to buy into the league. For instance, when <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Frazee_bec6.html" title="Harry Frazee">Harry Frazee</a> bought the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, Johnson tried almost from the start to drive him out. Frazee was the first owner in league history not to be virtually handpicked by Johnson. In fact, it was Johnson who started the rumors that Frazee was <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> and thus not fit to be part of the "noble" sport of baseball. At one point, he even had ownership interests in the Cleveland and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Washington</a> teams. There were unconfirmed rumors that he owned stakes in the other six teams as well.</p>
<p><a name="Downfall" id="Downfall"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_Johnson_4818.html" title="Edit section: Downfall">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Downfall</span></h2>
<p>The Frazee dispute planted the seed for Johnson's downfall. Eventually, the league divided into two factions, with the Red Sox, White Sox and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> on one side and the other five clubs (the Indians, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Athletics_8a0b.html" title="Philadelphia Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Browns_f5db.html" title="St. Louis Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Washington Senators</a>, known as the "Loyal Five") on the other. By this time, Comiskey had become a bitter enemy of Johnson; the two men's once warm friendship had strained considerably after Comiskey lost <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Quinn_%28baseball%29_99b7.html" title="Jack Quinn (baseball)">Jack Quinn</a> to the Yankees for the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> season on a Johnson ruling. Johnson's authority eroded further that year when the Red Sox traded <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Mays_903a.html" title="Carl Mays">Carl Mays</a> to the Yankees in defiance of a Johnson order to suspend him. The Yankees got an injunction to allow Mays to play.</p>
<p>The final nail in Johnson's coffin proved to be the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sox_Scandal_05a7.html" title="Black Sox Scandal">Black Sox Scandal</a>. Johnson blew off Comiskey's claims that his White Sox may have been on the take from gamblers. However, when the scandal broke after the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> season, the White Sox, Red Sox and Yankees threatened to pull out of the American League and join a new 12-team National League. The enlarged league would include a new team in Detroit unrelated to the Tigers, who were owned by Johnson loyalist <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Navin_abd8.html" title="Frank Navin">Frank Navin</a>. However, Navin was in no mood for another war and persuaded the other five clubs to agree to appoint a new National Commission of non-baseball men. Federal District Court Judge <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis_737d.html" title="Kenesaw Mountain Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> was appointed as chairman. However, Landis would only accept an appointment as sole <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioner_of_Baseball_2c4b.html" title="Commissioner of Baseball">Commissioner of Baseball</a>, with unlimited power over the game. The owners were still reeling from the damage to baseball's reputation due to the Black Sox Scandal, and readily agreed to Landis' demands.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, a clash between Johnson and Landis was inevitable, and it happened prior to the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924_World_Series_8130.html" title="1924 World Series">1924 World Series</a>. Landis banned two <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Giants_cfa9.html" title="San Francisco Giants">New York Giants</a> from the Series for attempting to bribe members of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> late in the season. After <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_Frisch_7490.html" title="Frankie Frisch">Frankie Frisch</a> and two other Giants stars were implicated, only to be cleared by Landis, Johnson demanded that the Series be canceled. He publicly criticized Landis for his handling of the affair, and Landis threatened to resign if the AL owners didn't rein Johnson in. After the Series, the AL owners promised to remove Johnson from office if he stepped out of line again. Johnson remained on good behavior for two years, even getting an extension of his contract to <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> and a raise to $40,000 (he'd previously made $25,000).</p>
<p>However, in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, Johnson criticized Landis for granting <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_Cobb_62bb.html" title="Ty Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tris_Speaker_077c.html" title="Tris Speaker">Tris Speaker</a> an amnesty after evidence surfaced that they had fixed a game in 1919. Landis demanded that the AL choose between him and Johnson. The AL owners were prepared to remove Johnson from office at their annual meeting in January <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>. However, Johnson was in ill health at the time, and the owners decided to put him on an indefinite sabbatical instead. Johnson tried to return in the spring and acted as if nothing had changed. However, the situation had become untenable, and Johnson was forced to resign at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Johnson died at age 67 in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. He was elected to the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting%2C_1937_96a3.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1937">1937</a> as one of its charter members. The athletic fieldhouse at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marietta_College_cfca.html" title="Marietta College">Marietta College</a> is named in his honor.</p>
