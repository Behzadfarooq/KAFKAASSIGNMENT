	    <p>TALK BANTVA</p>
<p>OCCUPATION OF BANTVA &amp; KUTIYANA</p>
<p>My name is Abdur Razzaq Thaplawala. I was born in BANTVA in 1936. I am a professional executive and more than 100 articles &amp; papers written by me on corporate law, taxation and industrial economy have been published in National &amp; International Journals.</p>
<p>Sometime, I write about events touching my life, my community &amp; my mother tongue. I have included these articles in the following website sponsored by me:</p>
<p>www.memonworld.net www.memonworld.com.pk</p>
<p>I write my personal experiences without any bias or favour. The article “Occupation of Bantva &amp; Kutiyana” included in my website is such one article.</p>
<p>A friend forwarded to me the comments of Mr. Vikas Kumar Ojha in an article which he has later withdrawn on 30th August, 2006. In his original comments on my article, he has demanded “references required” after every para and has used the word “dubious.”</p>
<p>He has used the most uncivilized words in his write-up of 30th August, 2006. I strongly object to the words “Shit-head” “some damn fucking Pakistanis” – “dubious” etc used by Mr. Vikas Kumar. The “WIKIPIDIA” must be having a code of ethics and I leave it to the good sense of the editors of WIKIPEDIA for any action in the matter.</p>
<p>Regarding the objections of Mr. Vikas, I will say as follows:</p>
<p>1. The article is research oriented and is based on authenticated sources. 2. I am in favour of harmony between people and government of India &amp; Pakistan. 3. Most of the material is based on</p>
<p>a) my personal observations b) “Mujahid” which was published from Junagadh and “PATRIKA” a DAILY published from Bantva. The editor of Mujahid Mr. Yusuf Mandvia was later on put behind the bars for 3 years in Junagadh.</p>
<p>4. As an instrument of accession with Pakistan was not yet signed, Bantva &amp; Manawadar were occupied by Indian Army and there was no opposition or trouble until 15th November, 1947 when some farmers broke the doors, houses and took away all valuables. This happened after inflammatory SPEECHED MADE BY Sardar Walabh Bhai Patel and Samardas Gandhi against Memons of Bantva. 5. The sikh army did not take part in looting the houses but they also did not prevent the looters who took away valuables appliances &amp; clothing in bullock carts before their eyes inspite of the fact that there was night curfew. 6. This loot occurred on 15th November, 1947 and from midnight to early morning. There was no blood shed and there was no other incidence except this one but the entire population of Bantva left for Pakistan in a week. 7. The story of Kutiyana was different. It was part of Junagadh State and it was occupied by Aarzee Hukumat organized by a journalist of Rajkot Mr. Samar Das Gandhi under the patronage of Sardar Walabh Bhai Patel (Home Minister). 8. There was a lot of blood shed and looting in Kutiyana but official Indian Army was not involved. 9. The information department of Gujrat Government 7, Dr. Jiwraj Maheta Bhawan Gandhi Nagar has published a 250 pages book in Gujrat in February, 1999 with the title:</p>
<p>“JUNAGADH NEE AARZEE HUKUMAT – SAMBHARNA GRANTH – (MEMORIAL VOLUME)”</p>
<p>I have got a copy of the book with me.</p>
<p>10. The book narrates most of the events covered by me in my article viz:</p>
<p>- Arrrest of Khan of Maravadar - Arrest of the Rules of Sardargarh - Organization of a voluntary army for occupation of different towns specially Kutiyana - Dismantling of railway track at SARADIA and removal of Railway engine from the track. This train service was the only link between Junagadh &amp; Kutiyana. - Photographs of unofficial army and removal of railway engine from the track are included in the book. - Meeting at Mahabat Khanji College compound at Jungadh addressed by Samardas Ghandi &amp; Sardar Aallahbh Bhai Patel (Home Minister) and the inflammatory speech against Memons of Bantva.</p>
<p>11. In Gujrat, the mass migration took place from only two towns i.e. Bantva and Kutiyana. This had a very favourable impact on the economy of Pakistan. Please refer to the book of:</p>
<p>MR. STEPHEN LEWIS – A SOVIET AUTHOR</p>
<p>The author writes:</p>
<p>“If Pakistan beat the economic odds then a great deal of credit goes to the Memons.</p>

<p>P.S.: The site www.memonworld.net referred into WIPEDIA does not include my article “Birth Place Revisited”. A copy of it is annexed.</p>

<dd>Hi fellow Wikipedian. I have already apologized for my comments once. When I wrote them I was pretty new to Wikipedia and I apologized immediately after it was pointed out to me be other users. I apologize again for any hurt caused to you or others. I'll strike my offensive comments. As far as the section in question is concerned, please give me some time as I am very busy with my real life (a family emergency). Mahalo. --<a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikas_Kumar_Ojha_2898.html" title="User:Vikas Kumar Ojha"><b>Vikas Kumar Ojha</b></a> <sub><a href="../../../v/i/k/User_talk%7EVikas_Kumar_Ojha_776f.html" title="User talk:Vikas Kumar Ojha"><i>Talk to me!</i></a></sub> 13:39, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>What kind of a shit-head has written this article.</s> What does the Author think Wikipedia is - A place to vent out Social or national differences. <s>Citing some damning Autobiographies of some damn fucking Pakistanis is not in accordance with policies and nuetrality of Wikipedia.</s> A prepostorus and unacceptable accusation has been made as to India Invading this princely state. This article is in full contradiction of the Article <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantva_Manavadar_33ef.html" title="Bantva Manavadar">Bantva Manavadar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bantva-Manavadar was a princely state founded in 1760 on the Kathiawar peninsula in Gujarat, India. It had an area of approximately 574 km², and contained 26 primarily Muslim villages. Upon independence in 1947, the princely states were forced to join either India or Pakistan. Bantva-Manavadar acceded to Pakistan in September, 1947, and then rescinded the accession and re-accedeed to India on February 15, 1948.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>False accusations have been made as for Sikh Regiment looting villages. I demand Immediate resolution of the mistake by the author or other concerned fellow Wikipedians within 1 week or this Section would be removed. --<a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikas_Kumar_Ojha_2898.html" title="User:Vikas Kumar Ojha">Vikas Kumar Ojha</a> 15:03, 20 August 2006 (UTC) <sub>As pointed out by fellow Wikipedian: <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPark3r_cea4.html" title="User:Park3r">Park3r</a> on <a href="../../../v/i/k/User_talk%7EVikas_Kumar_Ojha_776f.html" title="User talk:Vikas Kumar Ojha">my talk page</a>, the swearing done by me above was unwarrated.
