<p>Re: your mentioning of Nafaanra there. Actually, I was being mildly ironic — mentioning the LRA FA-candidacy there did not get it any extra attention. I think CSB is great, but that it's too loose to get the healthy sense of self-assurance other Wikiprojects draw their energy from. An 'accomplishments' page might improve that. But thanks for the kind words! Warmest regards, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 14:51, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah yes... subtlety. The fact that I basically ripped the CSB template up and then wandered about reorganizing pages, and got the mildest of responses, did raise questions in my mind about the level of focus of the group. Do you think that the project is inherently unfocused? If so it might be worth making CSB a skeleton umbrella group for a variety of more focused groups, such as the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Wikipedia%7EAfrica-related_regional_notice_board_47a7.html" title="Wikipedia:Africa-related regional notice board">Africa-related regional notice board</a> and others for Women's Studies, Latin America, etc. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">BanyanTree</a> 15:58, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You hit the nail on the head. If you take the time to read the (messy) talk page, you'll see that there have been various proposals to improve the structure of the project. It's just that no-one takes the time to really remould it. I'm not planning to devote time to it either, because (1) I'm countering the systemic bias anyway in the area of African languages and linguistics, and because (2) the Linguistics section on CSB Open Tasks is working quite well as a more focused group. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 17:06, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ugh. I just took a look; that's nasty. I suppose that the way you're doing is the most logical. Even the members on the Africa board have really divergent interests and forming smaller ad-hoc working groups is most efficient given the inability to form an over-arching structure.

<p>What is your justification for removing the Knobtweakers link?</p>
<dl>
<dd>It had just been removed with a variety of off-topic external links. It has been added several times previously only to be removed. The only edits done by the anonymous user who put it back shortly afterwards have been to add the link. The evidence of self-interested spam is pretty convincing. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree"><i>Tree</i></a> 08:18, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did you bother to look at the site? It has hundreds of direct links to very high-quality music. It's providing a very valuable service to the electronic music community. Talented artists who have had literally zero song downloads get hundreds overnight when a link is posted to their music. The top ten lists are syndicated in print by several local community papers across the US. IMO, the social importance of the resource is a lot better criteria than who posted the link, or how many times it's been edited off the page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did take a look at it. It has less commentary that I expected and, as someone with a moderate amount of experience browsing through MP3 blogs, I had never heard of it before. The list was originally started for the most well-known and representative blogs. I'm not fussed enough to get into a revert war, but I'm obviously not the only one who thinks that it is the odd-man out in the list as every other time it has been inserted somebody has removed it. Oh, yeah - and please sign your posts with the quadruple tildes (~~~~). - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree"><i>Tree</i></a> 09:02, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Lackluster is a talented electronic music producer who has connections with Merck and Bleep (Warp Records, widely known for the Aphex Twin affiliation). The other day, A.Vanvranken sent him a demo CD. Lackluster replied in a very nice letter that he loved the music, but he had to rip the songs to Mp3 so he could sell the CD and buy some bread to eat.</p>
<p>These guys need to reach a wider audience so that they can afford to keep making quality music. I'm filling a much needed role in the electronic music community.</p>
<p>"I've noticed a lot of traffic from your site, so thanks for the help!&#160;:) Peace and respect!" -- KGBkid</p>
<p>This is why I keep reposting my link, and this is why I will continue to do so until it stays put. I hope that doesn't offend you. As for the commentary, about 70% of my subscribers use iPodder, and rarely see the comments, anyway. It is an Mp3 blog, after all. It's about the music. <a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDilvie_59bd.html" title="User:Dilvie">Dilvie</a> 10:36, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a short note. When we are finished remoulding CSB and when everything looks neat and tidy we should notify the editor(s) of <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST">The Signpost</a>; that would get CSB a lot more attention. Other places to advertise might be Goings On and the Village Pump (Misc). Ideally, we'd present a short overview of the most significant CSB results so far. Additionally, it is certainly worth noting that both Wikipedia's systemic bias and the CSB project have gotten quite some blogosphere coverage, partly thanks to Xed giving it some publicity outside of Wikipedia: <a href="http://h2odev.law.harvard.edu/ezuckerman/" class="external text" title="http://h2odev.law.harvard.edu/ezuckerman/" rel="nofollow">Ethan Zuckerman</a>, <a href="http://headheeb.blogmosis.com/archives/026942.html" class="external text" title="http://headheeb.blogmosis.com/archives/026942.html" rel="nofollow">Post by Xed on <i>the Head Heeb</i></a>, also <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/27/zuckerman_wikipedia_.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/27/zuckerman_wikipedia_.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.qwghlm.co.uk/blog/?p=495" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.qwghlm.co.uk/blog/?p=495" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and this Google searches: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=xed+%22countering+systemic+bias%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=xed+%22countering+systemic+bias%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=countering+systemic+bias&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=wikipedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=countering+systemic+bias&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 19:40, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I think BanyanTree's right, if you want an article about this it would be nice if you could come up with the draft for me. I'm rather stretched trying to write most of the articles myself. It doesn't have to happen for the upcoming issue, just whenever you get done with whatever you're doing.

I do feel a little uncomfortable moving something from another person's user space, but I can't imagine he'd want his work to just sit.

<p>I some times find the urgency/dynamic that a "... of the week" format generates rather useful. For example, the evolution that <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partition_of_India_a525.html" title="Partition of India">Partition of India</a> underwent as COTW was interesting--it was a topic that I thought would take years and long drawn-out struggles to make sense of.</p>
<p>Having said that, the proposed reorg of CSB makes sense to me. The argument that especially in the field of engaging with systemicly under-represented topics/POVs, the groups of people focused on them really are the ones that can do anything meaningful and should be reached directly thru the Region/Topic-related boards is a strong one.<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer"></a>—<a href="../../../i/f/a/User%7EIFaqeer_dd4c.html" title="User:IFaqeer">iFaqeer</a> <a href="../../../i/f/a/User_talk%7EIFaqeer_6379.html" title="User talk:IFaqeer">(Talk to me!)</a> 08:45, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree about the effects of a CotW. The issue is that for a CotW to effect meaningful change, there must either be a very large body of participants it can draw from (as in the entire wiki) or a small group of dedicated and knowledgeable editors to one topic. CSB is composed of a medium sized group of people with many interests, which seems the explain the highly uneven response to the weekly (or longer) collaborations. I also agree that having collaborations among more focused groups, assuming they have a decent level of membership, might be more fruitful.

<p>Hi BanyanTree! Many thanks again for nominating and supporting me — now I've got those rollback links on diffs and all other scary new powers... I've been cutting back on my wikitime lately, due to real world commitments. I'll see if I can gather information for a Signpost article about CSB. Another idea I got: if CSB in its new form is ready, we should notify all (more than fifty) participants. I'm sure much of them have lost interest due to the unwieldy structure — letting them know they can go for it again must be a pleasant task.</p>
<p>After going through the administrator's reading list I'll see what I can do at CSB. Open Tasks needs to be templatized, but I have the feeling that we need some time to do this right (I very much like the 1/4 boxes idea, BTW). Especially your last remark on regional noticeboards got me thinking about the inherent structure of CSB (and it remembered me of earlier, similar remarks by other users). See you! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 20:18, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Congratulations on your promotion! Don't let the power go to your head. &#160;;) Do you think that we should inform the CSB members before things are settled? There's obviously a lot of work still to be done, and I've been thinking about maybe trying to convince someone to start a Latin America-related regional noticeboard with the template idea. (I find it astonishing that there isn't one already.) But then there's always bound to be more work to be done so maybe it shouldn't wait...

<p>Thanks for your work on presenting Category:Terrorist organizations as a CfD.

I looked at the category [age and saw that some anon had added the CfD tag to it, but had not posted it to the CfD page. I also saw that it survived a CfD in November 2004.

I've actually been thinking about this since seeing mention of it on VP. One idea to consider would be an automatic upgrading of users after a certain amount of time or edits on the assumption that they are not a troll, and have accumulated enough experience to avoid ignorant mistakes. For example, have the system set up to grant a user who has been registered for more than three months and has more than 1000 edits the ability to do rollbacks and add to In the News, etc. A full-admin could revoke "trusted user" privileges if she feels that they are being abused, and there could be a community review process to have them restored.

<dd>There's a special page where users can make requests of developers. (Sorry, I don't know exactly where it is.) But they are already overloaded and something this major would obviously require a community consensus. The super-user page is a good start to keep discussion going, but it's bound to be a gradual process of getting people aware of the proposal and then putting it up for a well-publicized vote. I'm not sure what changes are planned for the software, so have no idea how feasible implementing this would be on a technical level, as opposed to a policy one. If you want to keep pushing on it, trying to get some information to answer the technical end and posting to the policy proposal page would be very useful.

<p>Hi BT, It appears to me that <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somali_Region%2C_Ethiopia_3bb4.html" title="Somali Region, Ethiopia">Somali Region, Ethiopia</a> both refer to the same territory (and perhaps not only by Ogaden nationalists). See <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ogaden+%22Somali+Region%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ogaden+%22Somali+Region%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Google results</a>. I had thought that Ogaden lay within the larger Somali Region, as suggested by <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/cia04/ethiopia_sm04.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/cia04/ethiopia_sm04.gif" rel="nofollow">this map</a>. That small map doesn't show the different regions, but if you imagine a rough line from Dire Dawa to Moyale, most of the area to the right is the present-day Somali Region. Based on this, Ogaden would seem to refer to only the easternmost portion - maybe at some point that was true, and/or the borders were never really defined (and for that matter, I don't think the Ethiopian/Somalian national border is officially demarcated).</p>
<p>I wonder if a map exists from the British protectorate (as described in <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a>). I'll see if I can find one and see how it compares with the present-day Somali Region.</p>
<p>I found some maps of the different <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_Ethiopia_1ec4.html" title="Regions of Ethiopia">Regions of Ethiopia</a> at <a href="http://www.uneue.org/Maps/Maps.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.uneue.org/Maps/Maps.htm" rel="nofollow">this site</a> and the map for the Somali region (<a href="http://www.uneue.org/Maps/photos/Somalipage.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.uneue.org/Maps/photos/Somalipage.htm" rel="nofollow">see here</a>) doesn't mention anything about Ogaden, though this would make sense if both names refer to the same area. (BTW on a different subject, I've added links to these maps from the various Region articles.)</p>
<p>This brings up an interesting, and possibly contentious, issue: Should <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somali_Region%2C_Ethiopia_3bb4.html" title="Somali Region, Ethiopia">Somali Region, Ethiopia</a> be merged to one article?

<dd>Hmmm... <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/bc/snrs/history.html" class="external text" title="http://www.angelfire.com/bc/snrs/history.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> seems to be a good overview of the origins of place names, or at least one of the few that attempts to explain them. "Somali State includes the Hawd and Researve Area, Isa/Gurgure Zone, Jigjiga Zone, Bali, Sidamo and Ogaden District" and "In 1987, the Derg offered Ethiopian Somalis two autonomous regions: Dire Dawa (Include Dire dawa, Jigjiga, Harshin and Hawd &amp; Researved Area) and Ogaden (Godey and Qabridahar Zones)". So <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a> seems to be part of, and not identical to, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somali_Region%2C_Ethiopia_3bb4.html" title="Somali Region, Ethiopia">Somali Region, Ethiopia</a>, as you mentioned. It also appears that Somali Region is referred to as "Region 5", which is a term that I kept running across when writing the <a href="../../../o/n/l/ONLF_d788.html" title="ONLF">ONLF</a> stub. The location articles are certainly short enough for a merging, with Somali discussing the sub-regions including Ogaden, but I don't think that it's imperative. In any case, some clarification is needed for the relevant pages. Also, I previously made <a href="../../../a/b/y/Abyssinian_Somaliland_1874.html" title="Abyssinian Somaliland">Abyssinian Somaliland</a> a redirect to <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a>, but perhaps it should point to Somali Region. Thoughts?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've also seen mention of "Zone 5." There was one Google result in which someone defined Zone 5 as "Somali Region (Previously known as Ogaden Region)" so that's why I had that idea. But there are also various references to "non-Ogaden Somalis," which seems to refer (depending on context) to either non-Ethiopian Somalis who are in Ethiopia (i.e. fighting in the Ogaden War or a subsequent conflict), or to Ethiopian Somalis who do not identify themselves as Ogaden. I think you're right, leave the articles separate, but make some mention of Ogaden lying within Somali Region. Not having seen the term before, I can only assume Abyssinian Somaliland is synonymous with Ogaden. -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 05:39, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You've rather jumped to conclusions. There seems to have been an edit conflict, which might partly account for it. I found the article in a poor state — the English was fractured in places, and it wasn't in accordance with Wikipedia style. I tidied it, neither adding nor deleting any information. You, on the other hand, have reverted all my careful edits, apparently simply to change the category. I realise that, if you've been having problems with an anon vandal, your temper might be getting a bit short, but I'm nothing to do with that, I assure you. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:14, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BanyanTree, when you had asked me to take a look at the Ogaden-related articles, I wasn't aware of all the anonymous edits coming from 192.30.202.xxx. Wow! I guess the changes I proposed above would have really stirred up a hornet's nest. Mel, if you're still watching, I did change the first paragraph to one from the last edit by SimonP. I thought it was more properly NPOV than the existing paragraph, which was from one of the anon edits. -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 23:36, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, 192.30.202.xxx (Toronto Public Library address) also vandalized <a href="../../../m/e/l/Meles_Zenawi_28b8.html" title="Meles Zenawi">Meles Zenawi</a> today — not the first occurrence from that source (but the first time in a couple of months).

<dd>Hi Gyrofrog, I don't know about you but I'm not used to having edit wars in the areas in which I normally contribute. I don't know if I can handle all the excitement. &#160;;) I've added <a href="../../../m/e/l/Meles_Zenawi_28b8.html" title="Meles Zenawi">Meles Zenawi</a> to my watchlist to help out if the anon returns there. Also, I'll try to add the region numbers to the relevant articles sometime soon, though I have been very busy recently. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 14:56, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm already watching <a href="../../../m/e/l/Meles_Zenawi_28b8.html" title="Meles Zenawi">Meles Zenawi</a> myself, and I've seen that anon IP range before. Yesterday I happened to notice it was the same IP range as <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a>. If I can find the list of Zone Numbers maybe I'll handle it in the meantime... I think <a href="../../../m/e/l/Meles_Zenawi_28b8.html" title="Meles Zenawi">Meles Zenawi</a> might be the only edit war I've been involved with (other than an outright prank). -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 17:02, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks! I think it helps make the regions seem like a whole and helps other editors move through.
