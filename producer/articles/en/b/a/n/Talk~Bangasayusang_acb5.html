<dd>I put the reference to No.1 in for more accuracy. Please trust me when I say there is no intention on my part to imply that the Miroku is the top-rated Japanese National Treasure. Instead, if you would look at any of my edits in <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_treasures_of_Korea_9f40.html" title="National treasures of Korea">National treasures of Korea</a>, I always put the number down because that is how the artwork, etc. has been classified and thus makes it easier to keep track of.

<dd>Mentioning the number does not make it more signifcant or not. But omitting the number makes it more inaccurate. Can you articulate again what is offensive about adding the number? From what you wrote it seems to suggest that the number of the diesgnation should be mentioned? Here is an example of the mention of the No.1: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN4770021879&amp;id=kbng7myGQH4C&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=japanese+%22national+treasure%22&amp;sig=XQW4AhaEFiXBwoWUw9tXc9DIqPQ" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN4770021879&amp;id=kbng7myGQH4C&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=japanese+%22national+treasure%22&amp;sig=XQW4AhaEFiXBwoWUw9tXc9DIqPQ" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETortfeasor_6c5d.html" title="User:Tortfeasor">Tortfeasor</a> 08:12, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>in both korea and japan, the numbers are not rankings by importance but used for identification. certainly useful info, commonly used. Appleby 08:14, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First, I can not find information at the google book link.</p>
<ul>
<li>Omitting the number makes it more inaccurate.
<ul>
<li>No. The Mirokubosatsu designated as a Japanese National treasure at the Koryu-ji is only one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The numbers are ~ used for identification. certainly useful info, commonly used.
<ul>
<li>No. Mirokubosatsu's number is used for advertising not for identification. If the numbers of National treasures are useful and commonly used, can you tell what is No2, No3, ... etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm afraid Korean people believe the number is a kind of ranking. Because the Board of Audit of Korea said "Namdaemun is not worth being designated as National Treasure No. 1"<a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200511/200511070023.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200511/200511070023.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, although "it was a misunderstanding to assume the designation implied a kind of grade."<a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200511/200511150003.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200511/200511150003.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> The number may be misleading information, as the Board of Audit did.--<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMochi_5de4.html" title="User:Mochi">Mochi</a> 14:01, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mochi: You know the number isn't a rank. I know the number isn't a rank. The article you cited are Korean people being silly. and I'm getting the feeling that this is getting silly too. The Miroku is classified as No.1 and so it is relevant information. Someone might want to know that. Deleting it means useful information is gone. If its used for "advertising" than there isn't a reason why it shouldn't be included. If you want to make an article on Miroku, please do so. The google link, whether you can access it or not says "Japan's first national treasure."

<p>If the numbers are useful, other national treasures should also be called with numbers, but they aren't (See <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_treasures_of_Japan_d662.html" title="National treasures of Japan">National treasures of Japan</a>). Calling treasures with numbers are Korean custom. I'm afraid somebody think such custom are common also in Japan, so I delete.--<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMochi_5de4.html" title="User:Mochi">Mochi</a> 08:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Deleting useful information is bad no matter what you personally may think is relevant or not. If you were so concerned about people thinking that the number was that misleading perhaps you should have clarified it in the article instead of continually deleting it. And to be honest, I really think that the article on the national treasures of Japan needs work. Besides the fact that I have provided a reference that mentions that the Miroku's designation as No.1 so there is evidence for my position as well which you have conveniently ignored. I have fixed the article to allay your concerns and I hope you don't delete information again. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETortfeasor_6c5d.html" title="User:Tortfeasor">Tortfeasor</a> 17:43, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree that the numbers are useful information. If it is useful and commonly used, all other national treasures are being refered with numbers, but they aren't. Futhermore, I cannot find the full list of designation numbers on the Internet.</p>
<p>Some people in Japan misunderstand that "Miroku-bosatsu is National Treasure NO 1, so it is the most important one." Of cource, it is the first designated, but some other treasures are also designated at the same time. It is one of the most important, but not the only one. Koryuji itself advertises "National Treasure NO 1", but that is nonsence. The author of your reference may have been affected by such.</p>
<p>You added the number is just a classification, so that OK. Thanks. But I wonder why you would like to write the number. --<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMochi_5de4.html" title="User:Mochi">Mochi</a> 01:14, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry, There are no numbers:-) The number of ”国宝又は重要文化財指定書規則” is the numbers of <b>DOCUMENTS</b> not tresures itself. 220.211.227.126</p>
<p>I changed my opinion back. I think the number is not necessary, because the number is of the designation documents, not the number of national treasure itself. The number is something like ID number for people and have no meaning. What we should mention is that two statues looks similar, that's all.--<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMochi_5de4.html" title="User:Mochi">Mochi</a> 15:33, 14 July 2006 (UTC)　Plus, there are several National Treasure #1 in Japan for several categories. So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bangasayusang&amp;diff=58025408&amp;oldid=57984541" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bangasayusang&amp;diff=58025408&amp;oldid=57984541" rel="nofollow">This edit by Appleby</a> is inaccurate. --<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMochi_5de4.html" title="User:Mochi">Mochi</a> 15:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The art world consensus is that they are twins. Try reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0913304549/002-8449122-5462440?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0913304549/002-8449122-5462440?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">Transmitting the Forms of Divinity</a>. It is a very good book, published by the Japan Society, and details exactly why the Miroku is almost certainly a Korean piece. Or just the source provided in the article already. Also, without any citations, you saying it just "looks similar" is probably original research.</dd>

<dd>I can't believe that there isn't an English citation explaining what you are saying and it would make your case more credible if it were easy to look up, in English, because that would indicate the commoness of your assertion because English writers found it worthy enough to mention your point. Also, if you want to verify my links you can get a Google account or simply physically check out the books themselves and look up the information. This would still conform with verifiability. I made the links for your convenience but if they don't work on your computer for some reason there isn't any reason why you can't just check them out. The fact is that these three authors all found it relevant and important enough to mention that the Miroku is Japan's first national treasure, and it is a pretty common fact mentioned often when a source describes the Miroku. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETortfeasor_6c5d.html" title="User:Tortfeasor">Tortfeasor</a> 16:42, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm in Japan, so Japanese books are far more accessible than English books, that's why I cite Japanese documents. I have a Google account, however the links do not work. Google may not accept <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_link.html" title="Deep link">deep links</a>.</p>
<p>Two of your citations "New Japan solo" and "Gateway to Japan" are travelars guidebooks. Koryuji-temple advertizes Mirokubosatsu as the National Treasure #1, so it is natural the writers of the books write so.</p>
<p>You said "I always put the number down because that is how the artwork, etc. has been classified and thus makes it easier to keep track of." The books you cited probably mention about other National Treasures. Can you find numbers of those National Treasures?

<dd>M: I'm not sure if there is anything else to say. The sources provided state that the Miroku is generally noted as the first national treasure. Whether it deserves this "title" isn't relevant as long as we present a neutral point of view which we have done by compromising on the foot note already added which disclaims that there is no inherent ranking involved in the numbering. Whether you personally like it or not, the Miroku is generally acknowledged as the first Japanese national treasure as an interesting side note or for publicity, but it is still often times mentioned. I don't think I need to provide references of other national treasures here because I dont think its relevant to the Miroku because for whatever reason, the mention of the Miroku goes hand-in-hand with the mention of its statusas the first national treasure. Like I wrote before, if you could at least find a source that explicitly explains your point I would feel more comfortable rather than your personal interpretation/translation of a document without the necessary context and explanation to even understand what the document actually says. The number doesn't have to be useful per se so much as it is interesting information that is relevant and in that sense is useful to the reader to know. In conclusion, I'm not sure what else you want and I'm not sure about your motivations based on dubious statements about red pine earlier but unless you have another suggestion I think this is the best compromise. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETortfeasor_6c5d.html" title="User:Tortfeasor">Tortfeasor</a> 21:33, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You said the number is for accuracy at first, however, you changed your opinion and says "The number doesn't have to be useful per se so much as it is interesting information that is relevant and in that sense is useful to the reader to know." We should remember that this article is not about Miroku, but Bangasayusang. Are there any relations between the designation number of Miroku and Bangasayusang? Of course not. We should not write unrelated information just because it is interesting. If you would like to write the designation number of Miroku, you should do in the article of Miroku, not here.--<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMochi_5de4.html" title="User:Mochi">Mochi</a> 11:50, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The status quo of the article, the compromise, is based on the fact that you said it was okay to leave the number if there was a clarification of what the number meant. Even if you've changed your mind now, I think that the statue quo is the best solution because it presents the information in a neutral way by presenting both sides of the "issue."

<p>As I said, No.1 is not a special number. When Miroku is designated on June 9th 1951, some other treasures are designated. We should mind that Miroku is not the only first designated National Treasure. I don't mind if some guide book mention "Miroku is the first National Treasure" as a trivia and I don't mind if somebody write so on the article of Miroku with footnote. But this is the article of Bangasayusang. That's why you are insisting to write unrelated information violating neutral point of view. How many books you cite, I don't agree to write the designaiton number., because this is the article of Bangasayusang. Only a compromise is to write the National Treasure designation number all the time as you do to Korean National Treasures. However, you are not willing to accept this idea, we should delete the number from this article.</p>
<p>Plus, you may ask me what the other first designated National Treasures are. Some examples I found are in <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakushi-ji.html" title="Yakushi-ji">Yakushi-ji</a>. According to <a href="http://www.nara-yakushiji.com/guide/worldheritage/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nara-yakushiji.com/guide/worldheritage/index.html" rel="nofollow">National Treasures list in Yakushiji Official Website</a>, five sculptures in Yakushiji are National Treasures designated on June 9th 1951. June 9th 1951(（昭和26年 <a href="../../../s/h/%C5%8D/Sh%C5%8Dwa_period.html" title="Shōwa period">Showa</a> in Japanese) is the day when <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_treasures_of_Japan_d662.html#Former_and_Present_National_Treasures" title="National treasures of Japan">present National Treasure system</a> started.--<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMochi_5de4.html" title="User:Mochi">Mochi</a> 11:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tortfeasor, do not revert without reason. You have not shown any relation between the designation number of Miroku and Bangasayusang.

<dd>The number doesn't need to be related to the relationship between the two statues but since the Miroku is often, when mentioned, described as Japan's first national treasure that is why it is added and why it is cited.

<dd>The sources I provided don't make the distinguishment that you seem to be so concerned about. They simply acknowledge, correctly or incorrectly, that the Miroku is the first national treasure of Japan without any caveats what so ever which makes me doubt your personal interpretation. I don't think I believe you, not because I don't trust you, but because you haven't provided any credible English sources and because all the sources I have read mentioning the Miroku and the fact that it is the first national treasure never make as many addendums to the title as you do. I have seen the statue mentioned like that many times, otherwise I would have never included the fact.</dd>

<dd>If you are going to be so audacious as to suggest that I should only edit articles where I am an "expert" I would say that that goes against what Wikipedia is about and I hope you didn't mean it.

<dl>
<dd>If you would like, any other time I mention a Japanese National Treasure, I will write the designation number. But I am not going to go out of my way to do that. Perhaps instead of arguing about a number that has an adequate footnote addressing your concern, a little more effort in fleshing out the Japanese National Treasure article would perhaps be a better use of time because I would be very interested in reading about them.

<p>You think I suggest that the statue is "Japanese", however as I said I wonder where the Miroku was made. I 've read several Japanese books and find both stories are mentioned.

<p>The article says “Bangasayusang, or Geumdong Mireuk Bosal Bangasayusang” – so the <i>Geumdong Mireuk Bosal Banga<b>sayu</b>sang</i> is no.&#160;83, and the <i><a href="../../../g/e/u/Geumdong_Mireuk_Bosal_Bangasang_ca84.html" title="Geumdong Mireuk Bosal Bangasang">Geumdong Mireuk Bosal Bangasang</a></i> (NB, no <i>sayu</i> here) is no.&#160;78? Perhaps we should have some DAB template in those articles… <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipeditor_a998.html" title="User:Wikipeditor">Wikipeditor</a> 00:25, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipeditor: You wouldn't happen to know a colloquial name for either statue? We've been trying to figure out alternate names or some solution otherwise we might have to do what you suggested above. In talk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Geumdong_Mireuk_Bosal_Bangasang" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Geumdong_Mireuk_Bosal_Bangasang" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> KJ said that no. 78 is also called "samsan bangasayusang" so I was thinking of moving it there. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETortfeasor_6c5d.html" title="User:Tortfeasor">Tortfeasor</a> 02:28, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
