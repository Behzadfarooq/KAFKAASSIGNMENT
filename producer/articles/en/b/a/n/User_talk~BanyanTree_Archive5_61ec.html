<p>The other Congo Wars articles (and the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo_Crisis_cc5b.html" title="Congo Crisis">Congo Crisis</a> article begin with <i>You may be looking for &amp;elipsis;</i> intro lines.

"<a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo_Crisis_cc5b.html" title="Congo Crisis">Congo Crisis</a>" might conceivably be typed in by someone who was trying to find information on the recent conflicts, which is why there is a dab on top. For the (not easy) decision process on how to divide the pages, see <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_Congo_War_d63e.html#Disambiguation_between_the_1960.2C_1996_and_1998_conflicts" title="Talk:Second Congo War">Talk:Second Congo War#Disambiguation between the 1960, 1996 and 1998 conflicts</a>. In short, First and Second Congo War used to be one article at Congo Civil War and nobody would start an article about the war at independence because nobody could figure out what it should be called. After the division, the History of the Congo template was created to make navigation easier. I think that there are clear reasons to have a dab on top of Congo Crisis, which could conceivably refer to the recent conflicts, and not the recent wars, which are too wordy to be easily guessed at.

<p>Hey, I am planning on volunteering in Africa for extended periods time in the relatively distant future (3-5 years) and have questions about the usefulness of particular languages. I am going to be signing up for a class within the next few days where I have both French (level 1 wiki-babel experience) and Swahili (no experience) available to me as options. My main intersts African interests lie in Southern and Central Africa, with special interest in the DR Congo and to lesser degree, Kenya. I ethnologically researched Bantu languages including Swahili, and I am curious as to what degree Swahili is similar to other Bantu tongues (ie Zulu). You should know i am an undergrad. college student living in the United States will live here for the next several years, in all likelyhood. That said, my question consists of two parts:</p>
<p>1. How difficult is speaking amongst differing Bantu languages, Swahili is grouped in the Narrow Bantu - Central family, along with most of the other languages I am interested in. Is the difference relatively minor, where there are mostly just dialects (i.e. much like Indian languages [Hindi, Urdu]) which would allow me to easily, or is it the connection more like that of the Romances languages of Europe?</p>
<p>2.As someone living in the United States, I have almost unlimited access to French language materials and learning tools. My interest in the DR Congo combined with this availability and the fact that I have already taught myself up to an intermediate level of skill cause me to think that I may be better off running with the French and concrentrating heavily on it. Is this a better idea?</p>
<p>Basically, what I am asking is which of these would better suit me for aiding those in need in Southern/Central Africa (maximize the number of Africans I can communicate with). I know this is rather long. Thank you for your time. --<a href="../../../g/o/z/User%7EGozar_9ff3.html" title="User:Gozar">Gozar</a> 04:44, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Swahili is not very similar to Zulu. I speak a fair bit of swahili, but it does not help in Zululand. I would say French is a much better bet - certainly very useful in West Africa, and Rwanda/Burundi, and (I think) DRC. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwizzy_6422.html" title="User:Wikiwizzy">Wizzy</a>…<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiwizzy_3a7f.html" title="User talk:Wikiwizzy"><big><big><b>☎</b></big></big></a> 11:51, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll basically repeat Wizzy. French is definitely more useful in central Africa for almost every sort of interaction, since anyone with an education will speak some French. If you are planning on working with poor rural women, who would be least likely to speak French, then it might be worth considering Swahili as a lead into the local language but even then I'd probably still go with French so you could operate effectively in a country like DRC.</dd>
<dd>A dialect of Swahili is spoken in eastern DRC, but there are some significant vocabulary changes. I had a Muganda friend, who spoke the market-level of Swahili that is common in Uganda, who found that after several months of working with Rwandan refugees she would follow most Kinyarwanda conversations. Given that knowledge of two Bantu languages and some extended contact was required to get a firm hold on a third that was geographically close, I wouldn't bet on being able to transition from a medium level of academic knowledge of Swahili into an entirely different Bantu language with any sort of ease.</dd>
<dd>So, go with French but I would encourage you to pick up the basic greetings, bargaining words (numbers, "how much?", etc), and directions (where is?, left, right, etc) in Swahili as well, as people will know those in regions quite distant from East Africa. One of my most ridiculous experiences was backpacking into Rwanda and realizing that of the three languages that one could operate in (Kinyarwanda, French and Swahili), I was most knowledgeable in Swahili and that was limited to phrases like "I want to go to..." and "I want beans and rice". I ate so much beans and rice there! Except one time when I got my words messed up and ended up with fried bread and mutton in an oily sauce. &#160;:D Ha! I'm still not sure what I actually said to get that. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 16:58, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I decided to break out the proverbial chainsaw after I found myself transferring misinformation from other Wikipedia articles into <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_flu.html" title="Spanish flu">Spanish flu</a>. I'm still very unhappy with the state of such a major article; there's a lot of definitional issues that need to be worked out.

<p>I was wondering why my site(MarketUganda) was being deleted everytime i added it. Whats fun is i was on of the first persons to add some of the external links on the Uganda Page and I of course included my own page. I find it unfair that my site cant be listed when i have helped to add the other external links which are by any meaning not so different from mine.

<dd>Hi MarketUganda, Wikipedia is quite strict about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what is not allowed</a> and links to commercial sites with limited relevance clearly applies.

<p>Hey BT, was just wondering what you thought should be done to the YM article before submission to FAC. I think that trimming is probablt the order of the day rather than adding reams more stuff. Even in it's current state, I am pretty sure that the article would graduate pretty quickly in FAC, but I still want something we're happy with first and foremost. What are your thoughts? No worries if you don't have time to participate in a FA push. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreveX_ae5c.html" title="User:TreveX">TreveX</a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreveX_97ec.html" title="User talk:TreveX">talk</a></sup> 23:21, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Trevex. The article is incredible, with a lot of detail I wasn't aware of. I think you're right in saying that, if anything, it needs to be streamlined. The laborious way of doing this would be to move info into <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Uganda_0a4f.html" title="History of Uganda">History of Uganda</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Resistance_Army_a579.html" title="National Resistance Army">National Resistance Army</a>, etc but I'm not sure what the current attitude toward long articles is at FAC and it's worth seeing what the critiques are before spending a lot of time working on it. The one thing is that I generally limit any section with a "Main article" link to a max three paragraphs as the main article should handle details, so the section on <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_Nairobi_Agreement_406f.html" title="1985 Nairobi Agreement">1985 Nairobi Agreement</a> could be condensed. I feel uncomfortable contemplating structural edits to an article that flows as well as this one, but could certainly break out the wiki-scalpel if there's a need to trim it down. (I've actually been thinking about making a couple subpages from the LRA article because it's just too darn long for a convenient read.)</dd>
<dd>Frankly, I don't have the level of background knowledge to make an informed critique of content but I have one question: in the line <i>"The RPF melted away into the Vumba mountains straddling the Rwanda/Uganda border."</i> are you sure it's Vumba and not <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virunga_Mountains_45cc.html" title="Virunga Mountains">Virunga</a>?</dd>
<dd>My wikitime has dropped quite a bit recently as the job has gotten silly, but I'll try to help respond to FAC comments and can certainly have a go at cutting it down if you want.

<dd>The issue is that stating "Kampala is the capital of Uganda and Buganda" creates an equivalence between the two. Kampala is first and foremost the capital of Uganda, and that needs to be emphasized clearly.

<p>Since I was thinking that someone outside was deleting the site everytime I had added it, i never realised that it was the admins that were deleting the site. But i think its weird that other "commercial" sites are allowed and listed, but not MarketUganda. My main goal for the site is to offer visitors an easy way to access uganda related web sites, a resource that is appreciated among many but if you choose to ignore it, then i have to say that its not in line with Wikipedias original idea. An simple example is if you strickly forvid commercial links, the Yahoo would not be listed, so how do you defend that? As i mentioned when i discovered Wikipedia, there were almost no external Uganda related links and I took the chance to add some on the different Wikipedia's versions. Had i known that you would saw that as spaming, well, I would have done things differently.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi MarketUganda, There is a line between legitimately useful commercial sites and spam that has been placed mainly for commercial purposes that has to be decided by Wikipedians. One of the marks of the latter is if the person putting the link in has an edit history consisting of nothing but putting the single external link in (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Marketuganda" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Marketuganda" rel="nofollow">Marketuganda</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=83.233.36.192" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=83.233.36.192" rel="nofollow">83.233.36.192</a>), rapidly reverts its removal and uses an IP sockpuppet to try to sneak it back in after it has been reverted (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uganda&amp;diff=25612862&amp;oldid=25584288" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uganda&amp;diff=25612862&amp;oldid=25584288" rel="nofollow">reverted by me</a>). I note the addition of no other links besides MarketUganda. Users whose edit history consists of nothing but adding commercial links have very little credibility for arguing about their addition of commercial links, and thus none to fall back on when engaging in an edit war. I would let it rest. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 13:48, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I really like having templates on pages, as a sort of see also, but better formatted. I am thinking about adding one to pages on the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Leone_Civil_War_e6b4.html" title="Sierra Leone Civil War">Sierra Leone Civil War</a>. I made one really quick, based on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIslam_b728.html" title="Template:Islam">Template:Islam</a>, at <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_template%7Emano_river_conflict_1bf6.html" title="User:Smmurphy/template:mano river conflict">User:Smmurphy/template:mano river conflict</a> (to be retitled, my original name idea was too ambitious). I have a couple of questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>I want Sierra Leone Civil War to be written larger in the first line, but i think that just adding &lt;br&gt; a couple of times would be too ad hoc. Do you have any idea how I could do this?</li>
<li>Is a template like this appropriate? Do I have the right idea about when to use a template?</li>
<li>I have a tendency to use too many/short sections, since I like how articles look and their improved readability with them; an ideal wp would have lots of sections, I think. I now fear that I could replace the word section with templates and the same would be true (i understand templates are deleted if they are too useless, and I think I could make them <i>seem</i> usefull enough to avoid that). Is this bad? What if there was a template connecting all <a href="../../../f/u/z/Fuzzy_logic.html" title="Fuzzy logic">fuzzy logic</a> topics, or the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberian_Civil_War_e079.html" title="Liberian Civil War">Liberian Civil War</a> topics, or <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_coast_rap.html" title="East coast rap">east coast rap</a>? Is that too much?</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe I should be asking someone else, feel free to pass me along.<a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a> 05:09, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Smmurphy, I think a navigation template for <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Leone_Civil_War_e6b4.html" title="Sierra Leone Civil War">Sierra Leone Civil War</a> would be very useful. I've done some minor edits already; hope you don't mind.
<ol>
<li>I don't understand what you mean in this point. If you want the font size larger, you can increase the number in &lt;font size="+2"&gt;, but my personal sense is that even +1 would be fine in indicating a title.</li>
<li>I like navigation templates, especially for complicated topics. The only time that I have seen an edit war over navigation templates is when they overlapped - countries in Africa vs member states of the African Union.</li>
<li>I tend to be less happy with a lot of sections consisting of one-paragraph. It often strikes me as a result of editors not having thought through the structure of an article and how topics flow into each other so they end up chopping it into discrete bits and substituting a long TOC for an explanation of how subtopics interrelate. Of course, for most of the Africa article I work on the problem is that the main body of the article is an undifferentiated mass begging for a couple sections. But enough of my ranting, generally speaking I think a medium length article can handle up to to two templates without it being excessive if they are useful like a 'navigation template ("this article is an integral part of a web of articles on Topic A", e.g. {{<a href="../../../r/w/a/Template%7ERwandan_Genocide_88fd.html" title="Template:Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a>}}), a chronology navigation template (e.g. {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistory_of_the_DRC_d216.html" title="Template:History of the DRC">History of the DRC</a>}}) or a 'group member' template ("this article topic is a member of Group A", e.g. {{<a href="../../../a/f/r/Template%7EAfrica_bc4d.html" title="Template:Africa">Africa</a>}}).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>A couple of other comments:
<ul>
<li>All of the articles on {{<a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIslam_b728.html" title="Template:Islam">Islam</a>}} have this template, which is why there is a "Part of the series on the..." on it. Do you actually intend to put this template on <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mende_tribe.html" title="Mende tribe">Mende tribe</a>? If not, then the "part of a series" text should probably be removed for clarity.</li>
<li>This template is really long. Ideally, you would be able to see all of it on the screen at one time. You can reduce the length by moving titles with shorter subjects onto one line separated by a point as {{<a href="../../../i/s/l/Template%7EIslam_b728.html" title="Template:Islam">Islam</a>}} does and seeing how much further the topics could be pruned down to the essentials.</li>
<li>Formatting tweaks: Long article titles that go to a second line are confusing as the formatting doesn't show that the end of that title isn't a second article. Piped links to acronyms or shortened names would be in order here. Also, the colors are currently in Islamic green; a neat tweak would be to put it in Sierra Leonean national colors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I said, I really like these boxes, as they allow me to parse a good deal of information quickly. So, I like yours so far, although I have two possible addition suggestions - <a href="../../../t/w/a/Twa.html" title="Twa">Twa</a> and something to do with UN involvement. I don't remember how much the Twa were involved, but I do know that some people have complained about the lack of recognision of their part in the Rwanda genocide (both killers and victims). As for the UN link, that probably reflects some sort of bias on my part, given how things are usually reported (This happened, then this, now the UN is getting involved, but the UN had to run away, so the UN . . . .UN . . . UN . . . meanwhile people are dieing, but the UN . . . UN . . .)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, rambling answers are great, parsimony is for the articles, not talk. I made some of the fixes you suggested. The colors add some pizaz, I think. I'm using the lighter SL green and the closest blue I could find. I guess I like verticle templates more, but horizontal ones at the bottom are probably more appropriate, which do you prefer? As for length, I added a philosophy section on my main page (hopefully you will think its funny, not arrogant), which explains that if I want something to be long, I will make it long, unless someone changes it. My other option is to do like {{<a href="../../../r/w/a/Template%7ERwandan_Genocide_88fd.html" title="Template:Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a>}}), and add a bunch of dabs for each topic. That is an enticing option - something like this will tend to last, I think, so it would be nice to do it right. I'll have to think about it. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a> 05:00, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I like the new colors and the length of the template. The vertical one is more useful, I would think, placed just after the TOC so people could jump to a related page after reading the introductory paragraph... The horizontal ones placed on the bottom tend to be for templates of groups of articles all at the same level of hierarchy. I also did a formatting tweak so no line ended in a dash. All in all, it looks like it's ready to go live.</dd>
<dd>Also, thanks for your comments on my drafted navbox. There are some major holes in the Great Lakes chronology, but it may be worth putting it out in articles so people can fiddle with it. I read your philosophy statement and can relate to the "10 people" line. I'm so used to having pretty much free reign within my normal editing sphere that the inevitable clashes when I edit a core page like <a href="../../../i/t/n/WP%7EITN_7166.html" title="WP:ITN">In The News</a> probably seem more antagonistic than they really are.

I guess the point is to add it to pages where the reader can use it to aid surfing, so hopefully it works well.<a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a> 06:49, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello - I think I've been here before! My IP address has been blocked for "chronic subtle vandalism". Not sure why, I haven't been personally warned before this block, but a few months ago this happened and was sorted out after a day or so. Being an AOL user, IP addresses can often cause all manner of problems; unless I really am a trouble maker (and I really don't think I am), I think this block is a well-intentioned mistake. I mean no harm or offence, I have been contributing to articles for months now, have a Barnstar to prove it!!</p>
<p>I trust this is a mistake unless there have been complaints made against me? Hope this can be resolved, I mean nothing but good here. <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktorbuk_af25.html" title="User:Doktorbuk">doktorb</a> 04:49, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed that a lot of treaties are signed in and named after <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abuja.html" title="Abuja">Abuja</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. I decided to make the page <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abuja_Agreement_d809.html" title="Abuja Agreement">Abuja Agreement</a> into a dab, so I could link it to the treaty signed in Liberia, and so I wouldn't confuse it with the <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abidjan_Peace_Accord_a45a.html" title="Abidjan Peace Accord">Abidjan Peace Accord</a> signed during the conflict in Sierra Leone. I was wondering if you could check the list of treaties I've made there (especially since I included one for the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur_conflict.html" title="Darfur conflict">Darfur conflict</a>). Its redlinks right now, do you think treaties are inherently significant enough for a stub, or should they be rl until someone expirienced can fill them out? Is there a consensus on naming in this case (my names are like: <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abuja_Accord_%28Liberia%29_9d55.html" title="Abuja Accord (Liberia)">Abuja Accord (Liberia)</a>)?<a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a> 00:27, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see any one Abuja Agreement that is obviously more important that another so a dab looks like a good solution. I'm all for stub in the lack of actual articles. I normally don't start one unless I have at least three sentences worth of information, but have certainly seen one-sentence substubs gradually grow into interesting stubs or short articles over a course of months. There isn't really a formal naming policy, but <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nairobi_Agreement_73fe.html" title="Nairobi Agreement">Nairobi Agreement</a>, which is also a dab, uses years rather than locations. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 00:59, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the copy edit, that was worse writing than usual for me&#160;; ) I guess I like using dates better, as multiple countries may be involved, etc. BTW, do you know when to use "agreement" and when to use "accord," i don't know the difference?<a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a> 02:03, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey BT, glad to see about <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museveni.html" title="Museveni">Museveni</a>. To be honest, I'm still not happy with it and will enjoy tweaking it before its 24 hours of glory. Disgusted to see that he has finally lost the plot. have you seen the news recently??! It makes me want to buy a £400 ticket over there and write for the monitor until they throw me out. Involved with lots of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairtrade.html" title="Fairtrade">fairtrade</a> activism down my neck of the woods, and thus my wikibreak. btw, if you're ever in the UK be sure to look me up. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreveX_ae5c.html" title="User:TreveX">TreveX</a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreveX_97ec.html" title="User talk:TreveX">talk</a></sup> 02:06, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, that thing with the gunmen outside the courthouse is just absurd. At least we don't have to wonder about his motivations anymore. I'm actually surprised that the Monitor is still in operation at this point. It all deserves a good description on WP.

<dd>Good to hear that you are off doing good when not on the wiki. I've been thinking that I need to take a break myself, but I keep coming back "just" to check on anon edits to my watchlist. Kate's counter recently told me that one year ago today I started editing on Wikipedia, after being appalled at the state of the LRA stub. Thanks for the invite and will do so.
