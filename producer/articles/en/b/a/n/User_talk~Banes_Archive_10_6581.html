<p>Hi Banes! I noticed you added some things to your user page. Unfortunately, you can see the letters pass the boundary of the design. Just to let you know that if you adjust the height value you can get around this problem! I've already fixed it for now, but if you happen to modify your user page again, you can take a look at the diff and see what I changed. <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs">Fetofs</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/e/t/User_talk%7EFetofs_75a9.html" title="User talk:Fetofs">Hello!</a></sup> 10:59, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe firefox doesn't adjust this automatically ... Well, anyways, you can always ask me to modify it if you want. <a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs">Fetofs</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/e/t/User_talk%7EFetofs_75a9.html" title="User talk:Fetofs">Hello!</a></sup> 11:16, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Banes/Archive 10, thanks for participating in my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Proto_17cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Proto">RfA</a> discussion. Unfortunately, my fellow Wikipedians have decided at this time that I am not suitable to take on this additional responsibility, as the RfA failed with a result of 66/27/5 (71.0% support). If you voted in support of my request, <b>thank you</b>! If you decided to oppose me at this time, then I hope that if I do choose to reapply in the future, the effort I will make in the meantime to improve and expand my contributions to Wikipedia may persuade you to reconsider your position.

<p>Well, that's no problem. You won't get in trouble, but you seem to be showing some development of admin-rogueness (which is always good). If it was me, I would have warned them with test4, seeing as the IP kept changing so there isn't a huge need to block each one.

<p>Grazie for stopping by! Oh, and sorry about not responding to your other comment -_- --back when we were talking about poetry, that is. But to finish off that discussion, I was just thinking about 'political' poetry the other day, and how it go beyond biting, to being moving. For one, several months ago I started a poem about the <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a>, after watching <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel_Rwanda_92de.html" title="Hotel Rwanda">Hotel Rwanda</a>. Though, I only managed one verse to date; hopefully I'll be able to finish it before long. I guess we'll just have to see ^^.</p>
<p>Oh, and many congratulations on admin-ship! I was wondering if I should vote, but feared the possibility of a relatively non-credible user's vote having the opposite effect, sorta to the "meatpuppet" effect. But more importantly (since I'm sure a "haven't known him for long, but..." vote would've been fine&#160;:D), there were plenty of supports all along ^_^. So yes.

<p>Hi, Banes. I saw the "shindig" annoucement on <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA">WP:EA</a>. But thanks for inviting me anyway. Thanks, even more, for caring enough to re-read my <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EViolinGirl_Statement_8c6a.html" title="User:ViolinGirl/Statement">statement</a>, and coming back 20 minutes later to revise your message. It means a lot to me (both that you invited me, and even more that you tacked an addendum to it). This still isn't easy for me...I'm still struggling to "give up" wikipedia, (even though I still am on, if you know what I mean). I'm not sure what God is trying to teach me through all this, but I have a feeling it has something to do with trusting him to give me the friends that are <b>His perfect best</b> for me...because right now, I honestly have no RL close friends...at least, no RL friends that I see often enough to really count. I guess maybe God is using this to cast me full on him...God "grinding me to powder" so I will "fall on this Stone (Jesus Christ)". <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=21&amp;verse=44&amp;version=9&amp;context=verse" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=21&amp;verse=44&amp;version=9&amp;context=verse" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Anyway...I guess that was a little RL-ish for Wiki...but I hope you understand.

<p>Good morning Daniel,</p>
<p>We noticed that you reverted all webpages that we have previously updated (IP 210.84.41.77).</p>
<p>We do not understand the reasons for such a decision. Please note that:</p>
<p>1) all submitted resources are NOT spammy links but relevant webpages containing listing of accreditated universities/colleges ranked by web popularity in each country.</p>
<p>2) 4icu.org is a reputable international education directory selecting and reviewing world-wide Universities and Colleges. 4icu.org includes 7000 Colleges and Universities ranked by popularity in 200 countries.</p>
<p>3) each university/college included in our database is reviewed according to the information directly received by many of the institutions included and through an "Error report" option available to all visitors.</p>
<p>4) we continuosly update and upgrade our database by contacting all Universities included and though the above mentioned "Error report form".</p>
<p>5) we do not include affiliation links or open universities. To guarantee the quality of our database we include accredited universities only in accordance with the International University Association (UNESCO) information and guidelines (see <a href="http://www.unesco.org/iau/" class="external free" title="http://www.unesco.org/iau/" rel="nofollow">http://www.unesco.org/iau/</a>) and other national accreditation institutions.</p>
<p>6) 4icu.org is extensively linked by many reputable organisations.</p>
<p>7) 4icu.org is the parent website of other two reputable website available at 4icj.com and 4imn.com</p>
<p>We kindly ask you to review your decision and reinstate the previous submissions.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving a brief reply on this matter.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us, should you require further information on the 4icu.org directory.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Fabio</p>

<dd>(answering our anon) I noticed when the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_universities_in_South_Africa_4a96.html" title="List of universities in South Africa">List of universities in South Africa</a> page was updated. I checked the references - there were a mere 30 universities linked, considerably less than the number already on that page, therefore adding nothing. I checked the contributions from the IP, and saw a consistent pattern of visiting Lists of Universities, and adding (admittedly contextual) similar links - pages with adverts, encouraging the visitor to 'add another university'. Please check <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What wikipedia is Not</a>. In summary, your (210.84.41.77) link added nothing of value to the page, and there was a consistent pattern of the same to many other pages. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwizzy_6422.html" title="User:Wikiwizzy">Wizzy</a>…<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiwizzy_3a7f.html" title="User talk:Wikiwizzy"><big><big><b>☎</b></big></big></a> 07:13, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Hello Andy,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I take the time to inform you about a few points which might help you to better revise your decision:</p>
<p>1) Our South African webpage <a href="http://www.4icu.org/za/" class="external free" title="http://www.4icu.org/za/" rel="nofollow">http://www.4icu.org/za/</a> contains 18 Universities. This number is not much less than the number of organizations included in the International Association of Universities' (Unesco) listing available at <a href="http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/list_data/s-nw.html#South_Africa" class="external free" title="http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/list_data/s-nw.html#South_Africa" rel="nofollow">http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/list_data/s-nw.html#South_Africa</a> That listing includes most of the ACCREDITED universities in South Africa. The South African Ministry of Education <a href="http://www.education.gov.za//Educ_Related_Sites_Folder/unitech.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.education.gov.za//Educ_Related_Sites_Folder/unitech.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.education.gov.za//Educ_Related_Sites_Folder/unitech.htm</a> and SAUCA <a href="http://www.sauvca.org.za/about/memberins/" class="external free" title="http://www.sauvca.org.za/about/memberins/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sauvca.org.za/about/memberins/</a> both include a similar number of universities.</p>
<p>Moreover, we do not include open universities, minor higher education institutions or organisations which are not officially accredited by the National Bodies of each country (e.g. South African National bodies: <a href="http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/systems_data/za.rtf" class="external free" title="http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/systems_data/za.rtf" rel="nofollow">http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/systems_data/za.rtf</a>). The listing provided by the International Association of Universities is a good starting point to learn which higher education organisations are accredited and, therefore, REPUTABLE. The quantity of links is not a good indicator of the quality of a webpage or the links included.</p>
<p>2) All links available in our listing webpages (e.g. <a href="http://www.4icu.org/za/" class="external free" title="http://www.4icu.org/za/" rel="nofollow">http://www.4icu.org/za/</a>) lead - when clicking on them - to a webpage with a review for each university. The review includes some information directly collected from those Universities which have replied to our Update requests (please see our previous emails). The links do not lead to the University websites only. This should add some value to the Wikipedia listing. An Error report form is available for any visitor who wants to report additional information or incorrect information. Most of the time, we receive these type of reports directly from representatives or students/alumni of the universities.</p>
<p>3) Our directory includes about 6600 universities around the world (see <a href="http://www.4icu.org/reviews/index0002.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.4icu.org/reviews/index0002.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4icu.org/reviews/index0002.htm</a> for a listing by name). Currently the only country listing which does not include any university is Afghanistan <a href="http://www.4icu.org/af/" class="external free" title="http://www.4icu.org/af/" rel="nofollow">http://www.4icu.org/af/</a> where, unfortunately, the technological situation probably does not consent to establish an internet presence. Our database does include Afghanistan universities but we prefer to publish only those organizations with a website and internet presence. However, for each country, we include an option "ADD A UNIVERSITY" to let visitors suggest - free of charge - additional higher education resources. No registration is required and all personal data are collected according to our privacy policy.</p>
<p>4) All universities are ranked by web popularity. This is an approximate indicator of the relative popularity of each higher education organisation within a country. This help international students who want to study abroad - and might not have a good insider knowledge of the major higher education organisations available in each country - to choose a popular university. This ranking is a unique feature of our website and do add some value to the Wikipedia listing.</p>
<p>5) Our directory has Google Page rank of 6 and an Alexa Traffic Rank of 332,000. These figures do not justify a "spamming need".</p>
<p>6) Our directory is open and free of charge to visitors and to the included organisations. Adverts are the only source of income which can help to update and maintain the site. I am not sure whether Wikipedia includes external links to non-profit sites only. We do not include affiliation links or receive sponsorships by the higher education organisations included.</p>
<p>Should you consider the above considerations sufficient to reinstate the external links as useful additional resources to the wikipedia webpages, I would be glad to submitt them again in accordance with the Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>I would also be happy to contact you or any Wikipedia supervisor by phone to better illustrate the above points.</p>
<p>I await for your reply and thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Fabio</p>

<dd><i>(Banes, we will use your talk page for this discussion, thanks)</i>. Fabio, There are some guidelines on wikipedia regarding External links.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files</a>
<ul>
<li>I do not think that your links fall in this category, but I am mentioning for completeness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#What_should_not_be_linked_to" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External_links#What_should_not_be_linked_to</a>
<ul>
<li>I think you pass most of these tests. Item 2 is borderline, but you fail on Item 9.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#External_link_spamming" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam#External_link_spamming</a>
<ul>
<li>I do not think you violate any of these principles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam#How_not_to_be_a_spammer</a>
<ul>
<li>I confess point 5d is what made me ask Banes to revert all your links.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, I did review your directory the first time, and if you had added it to <b>just</b> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_universities_in_South_Africa_4a96.html" title="List of universities in South Africa">List of universities in South Africa</a>, it might have squeaked through (but see my reservations above). However, the mass adding is not something we can condone. Wikipedia is an important, reviewed, resource, and is subject to many attempts of bringing other web pages to a wider audience (as you are doing).</p>
<p>I appreciate the reviewed nature of your links, I especially appreciate your courtesy in asking for consideration, but you must also see things from the project's perspective.</p>
<p>I suggest&#160;:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a logged in account</li>
<li>Maybe moving this entire discussion to your talk page (If you had had a talk page, I would have looked at it first before asking for reversion of your additions). This will give others perspective, as they will surely see your pattern as well.</li>
<li>Add links more slowly, and comment them appropriately (I think your previous comments were fine)</li>
<li>A comment on the talk page supporting your position</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you still fail on item 9 above, and I cannot guarantee you success long-term.</p>

<dd>Hey Banes, I’ve been working on trying to integrate those new templates into the UPA page. I've rearranged a few things, but something still doesn't seem right.

<dd>It's not really clear on the 3rr thing. Honestly, I think that he may have violated it, but it's very edge-casey.

<dd>Was your dropping by about the random page? 'Cause if so, I did notice, and replied...I think it's somewhere ^^up there. No worries, though. Too bad about RL stress. I hear ya'. Thankfully, the pull of the internet isn't so strong as it was even a week ago, so it's becoming easier for me to practice/study weekdays. (Today's my day off, it always is.) I peeked at the <a href="../../../b/e/c/Beck_Depression_Inventory_108e.html" title="Beck Depression Inventory">Beck Depression Inventory</a> thing...that's WEIRD. Strange. Can't people tell if they are depressed or not? Hmm...I'm VERY upbeat, almost all the time. My mom says, "You live up here and only occasionally stoop to here &lt;using corresponding hand motions to illustrate her point&gt;." Yeah, the wisdom teeth are "<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Poppins_48ce.html" title="Mary Poppins">practically perfect in every way</a>" now. I got out the stitches last Wednesday, what a relief! I'm convinced that the surgeon sewed my cheek to my gums, because as soon as they were out, I could smile easier...seriously! And re:violin practice...oh, yeah, strings...they are something else. I'm VERY persuaded that my violin was mad at me for the wisdom teeth experience, because when I got back practicing, I was tuning up, and she (yes, my violin's a she) dropped instantly. Normally she's very easy-going, but she got temper mental with my lack of practice, I do believe.

<p>Hi again Esperanzians! Well, since our last frolic in the realms of news, the Advisory Council has met twice more (see <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">WP:ESP/ACM2</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM3_e83b.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM3">WP:ESP/ACM3</a></b>). As a result, <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_CHA_cf77.html" title="WP:ESP/CHA">the charter</a> has been ammended</b> twice (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details) and all of the shortcuts have been standardised (see the <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">summary</a> for more details). Also of note is the <b>Valentines ball</b> that will take place in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" rel="nofollow">the Esperanza IRC channel</a> on the 14th of February (tomorrow). It will start at 6pm UTC and go on until everyone's had enough! I hope to see you all there! Also, <b>the spamlist has been dissolved</b> - all Esperanzians will now recieve this update "newsletter".</p>
<p>The other major notice I need to tell you about is the upcoming <b>Esperanza Advisory Council Elections</b>. These will take place from <b>12:00 UTC on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20th</a> to 11:59 UTC on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">February 27th</a></b>. The official handing-over will take place the following day. Candidates are able to volunteer any time before the 20th, so long as they are <b>already listed on <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_M_38a8.html" title="WP:ESP/M">the members list</a></b>. Anyone currently listed on the memberlist can vote. In a change since last time, <i>if you have already been a member of the leadership, you may run again</i>. Due to the neutrality precident, I will not vote for anyone.</p>
<p>Yours, as ever, Esperanzially,<br />
