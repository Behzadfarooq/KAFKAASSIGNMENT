<p>Hey there BT, Thanks for your support with the main-page FA counter idea, especially for creating the template. What do you think we should do now - just impliment it or place a poll advertised at the community bulletin board?? I've asked the same question at the original disussion on <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Talk:Main Page</a>.

<dd>My thought is that the {{<a href="../../../f/a/_/Template%7EFA_number_684f.html" title="Template:FA number">FA number</a>}} template isn't worth much until <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a>, as the guy who makes the whole FA process turn, agrees to use it for his updates. I'm less worried about the folks at FARC. I'm waiting on a response from him on his talk, but there is an off chance that he wants someone to go ahead so he isn't seen as giving it some sort of "FA Director decree"-status <i>or</i> that he hates the idea and just refuses to discuss it. I think there is a strong consensus already, but I'm trying not to be a pain in Raul654's behind or give the appearance of going around his back. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 16:09, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I originally asked him on his talk page if he would like to comment on the idea. He responded on Talk:Main Page (as you have already probably seen). But in case you didn't, he wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I support this idea, as long as I'm not the one who has to do it, and it doesn't interfere with the way WP:FA works (e.g, with the actual numbering scheme). Raul654 04:36, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not exactly sure what he means by "interfere with...the actual numbering scheme" but I would assume your template does not. Otherwise he seems to be quietly supportive of the concept. In the light of <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">user:Monotonehell</a>'s remider that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a democracy, as soon as you get word from him I believe we should just impliment it. However, I am not confindent enough in media-wiki, and especially with how the main page is set up, to do this myself - at least in a "neat" way. Would you? <a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitty_lama_3854.html" title="User:Witty lama">Witty</a> <a href="../../../w/i/t/User_talk%7EWitty_lama_ba72.html" title="User talk:Witty lama">lama</a> 18:12, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure. I would have done it a day ago if I wasn't taking a softly-softly approach. There has been another exchange at <a href="../../../r/a/u/User_talk%7ERaul654_d9a5.html#Would_you_support_putting_the_number_of_FA.27s_on_the_front_page.3F" title="User talk:Raul654">User talk:Raul654#Would you support putting the number of FA's on the front page?</a>, involving Raul, Titoxd and I. I'll give it another few hours and, if someone hasn't beaten me to it, go ahead and risk the wrath. It seems to involve a permanent full protection of {{<a href="../../../f/a/_/Template%7EFA_number_684f.html" title="Template:FA number">FA number</a>}}, transclusion into {{<a href="../../../t/f/a/Template%7ETFAfooter_d66e.html" title="Template:TFAfooter">TFAfooter</a>}}, and a replacement of the two occurrences at <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a>. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 18:35, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>If the template is permanently protected, how do the editors who maintain <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a> update the number when articles are removed daily? Also, who will be able to run this bot once it's approved? I wish the folks proposing this would consider <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a> in addition to Raul - he's not the only person who updates that number. Raul has to edit the FA number roughly twice a week: FAR editors have to access it sometimes daily. I am not an admin, and when the regular FAR admins are absent, I may have to fiddle with the number. I'm sorry to see you're less worried about the folks at FAR, since we do have to access the template more often than Raul, and it will possibly be our lack of access that will mess up the number. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 15:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Sandy, While I had considered that there might be theoretical FA regulars who weren't admins, I thought you <i>were</i> an admin so the more decentralized nature of FAR would work to the advantage of the template. That is an issue. The <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBot_requests_273d.html#featured_article_counter" title="Wikipedia:Bot requests">requested bot</a> would appear to be an even better solution. In the period while we're waiting for it to be created and approved (crossed fingers), an interim solution is needed. The options I see are either having people in your position make requests to <a href="../../../f/a/_/Template_talk%7EFA_number_d975.html" title="Template talk:FA number">Template talk:FA number</a> or reimplementing a hand-updated number on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a>. The former reduces the possibility of the numbers being thrown off, while the second increases the level of makework for the admin who copies that number to the template (I would of course volunteer). You can make that determination as you know how often you and other non-admins change the number; I would support whichever you choose in the interests of making the transition as painless as possible. Also please weigh in at the bot request.</dd>
<dd>On a slight tangent, I was about to ask if you wanted me to nominate you at RFA, but I see that you've recently turned down an offer. The impulse was of course prompted by this conversation, but you look thoroughly qualified. Best, <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 15:36, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Banyan - no, I really don't want to be an admin. There are other admins I can ask, who are FAR regulars, to update the number when needed, but we're just adding so many steps to the process, when there are already so few to do the work. During the times, for example, when the FAR regular admins can't do the work (now, for example, as they are busy with real life issues), is it possible for non-admins to be authorized to use the bot, if/when it's approved&#160;? I don't really know how bots work, or what the protocol is, but because I follow both FAC and FAR, I try to keep tabs on all the numbers, and make sure that articles are listed and de-listed from all the different places where we track them (and that's more places than some imagine&#160;:-) and that talk pages are updated accordingly. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 15:45, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The neat thing about the bot is that it would simply count the number of articles listed at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a> and then stick that number in the template. So anyone who could edit WP:FA would change the number on the template. I am concerned about possible vandalism, e.g. blanking the page to watch the number fall, for which I've offered a possible solution on the request page. The main issue is that the last time a bot with an admin flag <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_TawkerbotTorA_57e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/TawkerbotTorA">was proposed</a> it turned into a massive discussion, so I'm hoping that someone will volunteer to code the bot and then there is enough support to it get approved at <a href="../../../b/r/f/WP%7EBRFA_d541.html" title="WP:BRFA">WP:BRFA</a>. Raul's support as a 'crat should help. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 16:17, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Joel just closed a FAR, so I counted the pages to be edited in the process - 1) close the review, 2) add the review to the archive, 3) remove the article from FA, 4) update the count, 5) remove star from article, 6) replace FA template on talk page, 7) add it to former featured articles, and 8) remove it from list of articles with citation problems. From <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelr31_1d76.html" title="User:Joelr31">Joelr31</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoelr31_6ce3.html" title="User talk:Joelr31">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Joelr31_14b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Joelr31">contribs</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia:Former featured articles (+1 Revised Standard Version) (top)</li>
<li>Talk:Revised Standard Version (no longer FA) (top)</li>
<li>Revised Standard Version (no longer FA) (top)</li>
<li>Template:FA number (-1 Revised Standard Version, and this template is very bad)</li>
<li>Wikipedia:Featured articles (-1 Revised Standard Version)</li>
<li>Wikipedia:Featured article review/archive (â†’Removed status - +Revised Standard Version) (top)</li>
<li>Wikipedia:Featured article review (closing Revised Standard Version, no longer FA)</li>
</ul>
<p>and then I remove it from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia:Featured articles with citation problems (Removed status Revised Standard Version) (top)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if we have to keep track of yet another piece, we should start doing what Raul does when he closes FACs - not update the article talk page, and let someone else worry about keeping all the pieces together as far as removing stars and updating counts. It's just bad practice to have a number separate from the articles, and will be too easy to forget that step.

<dd>I have left notes on the article and user talks, as well as putting the citation into ref format just for the heck of it. I am watching the page and will handle continued unsourced assertions.

<p>Hi BT, would you give a look at a new article I wrote, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Legion_ab3f.html" title="Islamic Legion">Islamic Legion</a> (a panafrican Libyan force that seems to have played a roled in Janjaweed evolution). Since you've got Prunier's work, I wanted to know if you could signal me some error and the year when the force was created. Sorry for disturbing you, but since the Legion's involvement with Darfur, I thought you could find it wort a look.

<dd>Hi Aldux, Great job! I slightly expanded the article. Both my Prunier and Flint &amp; de Waal books are tremendously confused about distinguishing between Libyan regular forces, Legion forces and Libyan-supported Darfuri militias in this period, but hopefully it made sense. I've also listed the article at <a href="../../../n/a/f/WP%7ENAFR_5a82.html" title="WP:NAFR">WP:NAFR</a> and nominated it at <a href="../../../t/d/y/T%7ETDYK_93e3.html" title="T:TDYK">T:TDYK</a>.

<dl>
<dd><i>Grazie Mille</i>!!! I really didn't pretend such work, I'm humbly grateful, the de Waal and Prunier input is highly appreciated. As for the confusion, don't worry: this is a typical result of Qaddafi's strategy, who masked even regular troops as legionnaires so to claim that no Libyans were in the bordering countries. So all works have to deal with this ambiguity. If I can help you in some way, please tell me; I'll be happy to reciprocate. Thanks again, ciao.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 16:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In normal Wikipedia practice, a talk page post might be corrected for typos, grammar and links, but changing content is strongly frowned upon, especially if other users have already responded to the post. Given the delicacy of the situation at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Health_Sciences_Antigua_8924.html" title="University of Health Sciences Antigua">University of Health Sciences Antigua</a>, it would be reverted on sight. It would probably be best if you didn't modify the comments. What might be acceptable is to, for your comments only, strikethrough your comments and add an indented comment that either explains that you are retracting the original comment or offering a reworded version so it is clear to everyone what was originally posted, as well as offering you the opportunity to correct misunderstandings. For example, if I wrote in this situation:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I like apples. BanyanTree 10 December 2006</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>To correct, I might write:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>NOTE: I wish to modify several of my earlier comments. Since this is a sensitive topic, I have struck through the text I wish to retract or reword and posted reworded comments. I have not modified any existing content.

<dd>This is obviously a little silly, but any attempt to change the substance of comments on that page would undoubtedly be reverted. If you do this, be sure to use the above link to this discussion in the edit summary and sign every post with a timestamp. I'm unsure that it would be accepted by other users, i.e. it might just be reverted as an attempt to "cheat" in the conversation.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure what you have in mind, but it would be much simpler to simply add a post to the end of the page offering clarification on your earlier comments. This would also be much less strange to other readers.

Naturally I have reverted these edits and explained to him on his talk page (with two warnings) that his inclusion of that link is not permitted on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Just now I noticed an <i>anonymous</i> editor engaging in the <i>same</i> behaviour with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amitabh_Bachchan&amp;diff=94263126&amp;oldid=94239280" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amitabh_Bachchan&amp;diff=94263126&amp;oldid=94239280" rel="nofollow">Amitabh Bachchan</a> and appears to have done the same with other pages too (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/59.176.115.207" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/59.176.115.207" rel="nofollow">See contributions</a>). This clearly suggests that the same individual is at work and is most probably trying to avoid further warnings (and possible block notices) being placed on his (Shafiq.ad's) talk page. Please advise. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkantik_d4be.html" title="User:Ekantik">ekantiK</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkantik_16c1.html" title="User talk:Ekantik">talk</a></sup> 14:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey Ekantik, I tagged 59.176.115.207 (<a href="../../../5/9/2E/User_talk%7E59.176.115.207.html" title="User talk:59.176.115.207">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.176.115.207_84b1.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.176.115.207">contribs</a>) with {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam3_ee22.html" title="Template:Spam3">spam3</a>}}. If it is blatantly obvious that sockpuppets are being used, treat them as the same user and skip to {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam3_ee22.html" title="Template:Spam3">spam3</a>}}. If the user has a stable IP then a block could be used to affect all accounts. If not, I'm afraid that you'll have to report each new account individually. I'm willing to block if a final warning is given, though make sure that you write that it is a Shafiq.ad sockpuppet either in edit summaries and talk pages, so another user can recreate the story without asking you what is going on.

<p>You said to me "If tigers are the largest species, then they would be bigger than blue whales, assuming that you don't go beyond the animal kingdom. "largest cat species" is clearly correct. Please don't change it. - BanyanTree 19:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)"</p>

<p>Hi BT, sorry to bother you again. I've run into a little more complicated problem which relates to a user's conduct. To give a bit of background I'm involved with the editing on <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a> which has been thtough ArbCom. I may also be considered a critic of SSB which "officially" registers a conflict of interest, but I don't think this is a serious problem because I believe that I have edited the SSB article with the same standards that I edit other articles (mainly involving cleanup of redundant texts, removal of POV, etc). The problem here concerns the conduct of <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> who has been deeply involved with editing the SSB article and who also has a deep conflict of interest (his being the most vocal defender of SSB and defamer of SSB's critics) and is a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single-purpose account</a>. It would take too long to give you examples of all of these things but please feel free to ask clarification if you need it. In the meantime you <i>may</i> like to consider speed-reading from <a href="../../../s/a/t/Talk%7ESathya_Sai_Baba_317d.html#SSS108_Please_stop_removing_well-sourced_relevant_info" title="Talk:Sathya Sai Baba">here on</a> to get an overview of the long-running argument. As you will see, SSS108 refuses to behave in accordance with Wikipedia policies and guidelines (AGF, NPA, the whole lot) under cover of the fact that he keeps alleging that I am a biased critic of SSB and that my edits are POV-pushing. I beg to submit once again that any edits I have made are of the same standard that I have carried out on other articles.</p>
<p>The specific problem with SSS108 (and which I would like your advice on, and anything else besides) relates to a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>; he created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SSS108#Response_To_Ekantik_aka_Gaurasundara" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SSS108#Response_To_Ekantik_aka_Gaurasundara" rel="nofollow">section</a> on his talk page that I feel is defamatory against me because it fits the description of <i>"Posting a link to an external source that fits the commonly-accepted threshold for a personal attack, in a manner that incorporates the substance of that attack into Wikipedia discussion. Suggesting a link applies to another editor, or that another editor needs to visit a certain link, that contains the substance of an attack."</i> (<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html#Examples_of_personal_attacks" title="WP:NPA">Last example of NPA</a>). Under cover of providing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SSS108&amp;diff=93681675&amp;oldid=93534553" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SSS108&amp;diff=93681675&amp;oldid=93534553" rel="nofollow">Google link</a>, that link actually directs the reader to defamatory blogs and websites <b>authored by SSS108</b> which he has done many times: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93679973&amp;oldid=93607126" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93679973&amp;oldid=93607126" rel="nofollow">diff1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93976686&amp;oldid=93974710" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93976686&amp;oldid=93974710" rel="nofollow">diff2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93854900&amp;oldid=93854437" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93854900&amp;oldid=93854437" rel="nofollow">diff3</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93974323&amp;oldid=93963607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=93974323&amp;oldid=93963607" rel="nofollow">diff4</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=94970613&amp;oldid=94937539" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=94970613&amp;oldid=94937539" rel="nofollow">diff5</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95226116&amp;oldid=95220227" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95226116&amp;oldid=95220227" rel="nofollow">diff6</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95229451&amp;oldid=95227650" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95229451&amp;oldid=95227650" rel="nofollow">diff7</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95232050&amp;oldid=95231512" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95232050&amp;oldid=95231512" rel="nofollow">diff8</a>. So I think that this is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and would appreciate your advice, especially since the editor in question persists in editwarring (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95225169&amp;oldid=95224891" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95225169&amp;oldid=95224891" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95226524&amp;oldid=95225894" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95226524&amp;oldid=95225894" rel="nofollow">2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95228123&amp;oldid=95227317" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=95228123&amp;oldid=95227317" rel="nofollow">3</a>) that is obstructing the development of the article.</p>
<p>I'd also like to clarify that I am not locked in a dispute as such. Whatever claims are made, I am confident that my edits are made to improve the article and the Wikipedia project. I believe that this is true of every article that I am involved with and I show no special preference to any particular article. For the record I also asked <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html#NPA_Advice" title="User talk:Zscout370">Zscout's opinion</a> and he advised me to file an RFA. I'd really rather prefer asking your opinion and advice and if you could do something before I involve myself with a complicated RFA.

<dd>Hi again, just a quick update. After serving SSS108 with two NPA warnings, he stated that he is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SSS108&amp;diff=95250709&amp;oldid=95250562" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SSS108&amp;diff=95250709&amp;oldid=95250562" rel="nofollow">not going to stop</a>.

<p>For additional information, please see <a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html#Response_To_Ekantik_aka_Gaurasundara" title="User talk:SSS108">this section on my talk page</a>. <i>"Ekantik/Gaurasundara"</i> is a vicious defamer of Sathya Sai Baba on the internet and created a blog specifically attacking me and my involvement on Wikipedia. He also has made numerous derogatory comments on groups and forums about my involvement and edits on Wikipedia. He engaged me in debate incognito and I discovered he used the sockpuppet <i>"Gaurasundara"</i> (a name that directly ties him in with the Sai Controversy). He has since admitted that he is <i>"Gaurasundara"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ekantik&amp;diff=92842950&amp;oldid=92758286" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ekantik&amp;diff=92842950&amp;oldid=92758286" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Despite these facts, <i>"Ekantik/Gaurasundara"</i> is going around saying that he does <b>not</b> have a POV to push and his extra-Wikipedia defamation campaigns are <b>irrelevant</b> to his presence on the Sathya Sai Baba Wikipedia article. All of Ekantik's edits and comments (in relation to Sathya Sai Baba) deal exclusively with the Sai Controversy (except spelling corrections and grammar).

<p>Greetings once again BT! I must again ask for action or at least advice on Nigeria-related pages; particularly I am concerned about the <a href="../../../a/t/i/Atiku_Abubakar_17cb.html" title="Atiku Abubakar">Atiku Abubakar</a> article. Abubakar has defected from the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Democratic_Party_%28Nigeria%29_5a24.html" title="People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)">ruling party</a> and that has likely generated this nuisance. Basically, the NPOV and weasel words tags were applied some time ago but i went through the article and cleaned up anything i saw that presented a problem (obviously you're encouraged to verify) and removed both those tags. however, non-registered IPs continue to reestablish the neutrality and weasel word tabs, always from differing IPs (this has occured on a day-to-day basis for more than a week); i realize this is not <i>content</i> issue but it's still an annoyance i would like to eliminate. A similar pattern is emerging with <a href="../../../b/u/h/Buhari.html" title="Buhari">Buhari</a> (opp. candidate in 2007 presidential election), and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.202.32.30_cd21.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.202.32.30">this IP</a> has added POV content to the article, though only on two occasions thus far.

<dd>Hi gozar, It looks like it's still at the advice stage. I don't see either a discussion at the anon's talk, nor at the article talk. Avoid having a conversation through the edit summary of reversions. In order to establish that the IP is actually disrupting Wikipedia to the extent that it equates to vandalism, there has to be much more. My advice is to post to the article talk that you have reverted with the reason, and and invite the anon to the discussion on his/her talk. If there's no response, then the other guy shows that he isn't interested in making a better article and you have a fair argument that he is a fanatic who is making harmful edits. If he does show up, you can figure out if a compromise is possible. In my experience, "NPOV" tends to be code for "I think you are an idiot", so try another policy that doesn't require multiple other users weighing in on what they think is neutral. I like <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> as it is concrete and, if both sides come up with sources, you can have a conversation about <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliability</a> and source neutrality that isn't actually a personal criticism of the other editor. (Do <i>not</i> look at the post directly above this one and call me a liar!&#160;;)) I normally do not even think of semiprotection until the last 50 edits in an article are in the past 2 or 3 days. Speaking of that, I'll be removing the semi pro from <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> shortly, so if you have any major structural edits you want to get in...

<dd>&lt;chuckle&gt; It is kind of ridiculous, isn't it? More seriously, I'm a little confused about why one would put that on the subpage. For example, if a page was fully protected, why would we want to allow an anon to remove the template saying so? In any case, I'll go check to see if I missed similar links in subpages in that last batch of protections. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 17:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good point. I just don't care that much adding these funny boxes. If I think of it, a (small) bonus of *not* adding it on the template page is, that on a high use template you purge the cache of all articles transcluding the template. So if you change the protection status *and* want to have a matching box on top you'll have to edit the template. If you edit the /doc subpage, the caches are not purged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_doc_page_pattern" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_doc_page_pattern" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. On another note, users can see on the tabs on top of the page if a page is protected. That's what makes me wondering about all these funny boxes. But alas, this is box-o-pedia&#160;:-). --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 17:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's true - on both points. &#160;;) I had sort of assumed that, since protection changes show up in the history, they purged the cache, but there's no reason they should and having protections show up in histories is a new feature anyways. I really wish I new how to make the picture on my user page appear with less defined borders, but it appears that I'm stuck with a tree in a box, which is a melancholy sight.</dd>

<dd>When I unprotected after over a month, the spree started an hour and half later. Exact same vandalism with the exact same edit summary, over and over, like before the previous protections.

<dd>Yeah, that's why I was so reluctant to unprotect. The thing that gets me though...why does the vandal wait for us to lift protection?

<p>I know that, but you're missing the point. Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia, should resist accepting language created by pressure groups. "Fairtrade" is hardly a neutral word. It's a brand; it shouldn't be used so readily. It's almost akin to using the word "Googling" without quotation marks in a similar context. <a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExeunt_5da0.html" title="User:Exeunt">Exeunt</a> 09:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not what I'm arguing for; it's about context, too. I don't think that the coffee's designation as a Fairtrade product is important enough to its identity to be one of the first things mentioned. The use of quotation marks was to disclaim Wikipedia's endorsement of the brand. I'd rather have the reference to Fairtrade removed. <a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExeunt_5da0.html" title="User:Exeunt">Exeunt</a> 16:02, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Fairtrade certification is clearly key in their breaking into the specialty market. And Fairtrade is something that has to be earned by the business. Another metaphor: in the first line of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_De_Niro_be83.html" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, is <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> given undue prominence? In terms of looking for key descriptors that impact the subject of the article, I don't really see a reasonable challenge. Endorsement doesn't even come into the equation - it is important to the article and itself has a well-developed article. I find the heated arguments about how we can't describe either Maraba's qualities or products without somehow compromising the wiki strange, as the <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_July_11%2C_2006_3461.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article/July 11, 2006">Microsoft blurb</a> was basically a laundry list of products and I don't recall any such controversy at all.</dd>

<dd>I have a huge problem with actors being described as "Academy Award-winning" in the first sentence. In fact, I removed "Grammy Award winning" from the <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludacris.html" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a> article just 16 minutes before you wrote that comment.

<p>Hi BT. I'm writing a quite a long article on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chadian-Libyan_conflict_7f41.html" title="Chadian-Libyan conflict">Chadian-Libyan conflict</a> and more generally Libyan involvement in Chadian civil war, and I'm a bit worried, because I've already reached 39K and have still <i>a lot</i> to write (I will probably pass 60K). This is the first time I've ever written such a long article, and I'm reluctant to cut or educe what I've alread made, for the efforts I made in finding sources and organizing them in a (I hope) coherent narrative. What do you think?--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 18:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey Aldux, I'm a big fan of concise articles. See number six of <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a>'s points for one reason, and <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal" class="extiw" title="q:Blaise_Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a>'s "I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time" for the even more pithy reason. I consider anything beyond 32kb to be an indication that nobody is editing (in the traditional sense, of deciding what is important and what is not) the page while anything beyond 40kb just ignores the fact that the hypothetical reader doesn't have an hour to devote to your article. I'm still not sure what would be needed to cut <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> down to 40kb or below, but clearly nobody has been able to make that tough call of deciding that some events and campaigns simply need to be shuffled off to a subpage, regardless of how proud some people are about them. In summary, shorter articles are more likely to be read and the size limitation forces editors to make choices about what is truly vital to the article and refine wording, making better articles.</dd>
<dd>Getting back to your article, I suggest you write the entire thing in one article and then decide what to cut. For example, I suggest that everything before the start of the conflict in 1980 should be in one or more separate articles - either existing articles such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Libya_d5da.html" title="Foreign relations of Libya">Foreign relations of Libya</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Chad_5955.html" title="Foreign relations of Chad">Foreign relations of Chad</a>, or a separate article such as Chadian-Libyan relations. The latter would, of course, have a summary section for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chadian-Libyan_conflict_7f41.html" title="Chadian-Libyan conflict">Chadian-Libyan conflict</a>. My ideal length for <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> sections is three paragraphs, but I often fail at this. (See the Background section of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur_conflict.html" title="Darfur conflict">Darfur conflict</a> for what I consider to be a failure, and the History section of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur.html" title="Darfur">Darfur</a> for a successful summary, when I recently broke out <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Darfur_7db7.html" title="History of Darfur">History of Darfur</a>.) You may need other subpages depending on how long the article gets and how it is structured. Are you thinking of pushing the article into FA status? It's looking impressive. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 21:29, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the article will absolutely have to be cut to around 40K; my problem is the incredible complessity of Chadian factionalism, and I'm forced to at least partly enter in these to explain the actions, the behaviour and the final defeat of Gaddafi. To put it clearly, I'm afraid that by cutting it too much everything may become too confusing. A solution would be write a decent article on the Chadian civil war (1965â€“1993), that is at the moment missing. As for moving all the start to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Libya_d5da.html" title="Foreign relations of Libya">Foreign relations of Libya</a>, I can't do this without altering the equilibrium in the article; but I can try creating several new articles, and, as you suggested, creating Chadian-Libyan relations, even if it's hard to say what is relations and what conflict, as Gaddafi had, except at the very end, always the support of a strong number of Chadian forces against his Chadian enemy (since 1980, HabrÃ©).</dd>
<dd>As for my general goals with the article, I may try to make it a GA, but I don't have enough images for a FA, nor really the will to follow all the FA process. Thanks for your advice, and ciao.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 00:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Banyan. I've been recently expanding the sadly neglected article on the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comoros.html" title="Comoros">Comoros</a>.

Now I'm having trouble with further expansion because of the scarcity of accessible English-language sources. In particular, I'm finding it difficult to expand the culture section beyond the Background Notes copy-and-paste. As an editor more experienced in African topics, I wonder if you can lend any help in this section, or the article as a whole.

<dd>Thanks for the heads-up; I've tended to write about sub-Saharan Africa in general (and recently Madagascar in particular, as it was looking rather neglected), but unfortunately, Comoros is one of two or three countries which I've really struggled to find good information on. The others, incidentally, are Angola and to some extent Somalia - although the current war there is quite well covered. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 23:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I took a look at the New York Public Library and Library of Congress catalogs, but it appears that as anticipated, many of the most promising sources are in French. Is there a French speaker on en who contributes to the Africa articles, or alternatively, has anyone looked at the fr-wiki articles on Comoros for material that could be imported and translated?</dd>
<dd>One issue I'd like to see discussed is why there was a strong independence movement in the Comoros but appears to be little or no pro-independence sentiment in nearby Reunion, which is the one country/territory/department that seems to have been bypassed by the whole African independence movement. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:35, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you three. I'll have to return to the research in a few days after I've finished moving. I've already been using mostly journal sources and no books because of the lack of published material, so I guess it is to be expected. I think the article needs some more images, too, if anyone is interested in looking for some free ones. I'll go ping Ezeu about this too, since I think (?) he might be a French speaker as well. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>Â·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 10:24, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi. I'm a relatively new contributer to Wikipedia, and recently stumbled across an article that interested me about the Revolutionary War. I looked up more sources on the subject and posted them, along with the facts stated in those sources. The article is now tagged as a possible hoax, and I am searching for objective analysis of it from multiple users. If you could please take a look, and urge others to take a look as well, I'd be very grateful.</p>

<p>Hi - the template there should work fine, and any listed peer reviews should be transferred automatically (when I activate the bot). As for the one being missing, could you direct me to it? It's possible that my internet connection broke before the listing could be made, or that another editor removed it. Thanks, <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 21:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm OK - we're probably equally confused&#160;:). It should all be fine. The bot is now running, so it should archive at around 2300GMT, if my internet doesn't drop. What you're desribing seems to be fine, so it's probably just best to see how it pans out. Thanks! <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 22:17, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
