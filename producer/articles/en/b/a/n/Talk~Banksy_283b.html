<p>It doesn't look great to have "citation needed" so early on in an article; does anyone have any evidence that Banksy was actually born in 1974 (I couldn't find any). If so, cite it, if not, then we should get rid of the assertion 62.25.109.196 14:17, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In his book Wall and Piece theres a long-winded disclaimer where he "reluctantly" asserts his right to be recognised as the author of the work, but states that he does not assert copyright.

<p>I'm not really sure where to post this comment as I'm new to this wikipedia malarky, but I saw Banksy on the Community Channel on Sky Digital a few weeks back doing a short feature on street dancing. I was really quite surprised when I saw him on it; he simply stated his name as 'banksy' and that he was a street dancer. He then went on to show some dances he had choreographed, one where he was with another guy dancing in a scrapyard, and another in a studio with a red backdrop with three guys in top hats and street wear doing another routine. He seemed quite a pleasant chap. The feature was part of a programme about street dancing, and filmed circa 1997ish. Then I looked his name up on here and that article about unmasking him from the Evening Standard, and lo and behold it was the same fella! On the show he had a goatee beard and kangol beret and was much younger. I don't know if this information's of any use, but maybe someone more capable could research it?</p>

<p>The parenthetical clause <i>(although many newspapers assert that it is Robert or Robin Banks)</i> was recently removed by User:70.179.75.87 for the reason <i>if he doesn't want it published i think wikipedia should respect that.</i>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Wikipedia need not respect such wishes. If the initial assertion were cited, then it should stay. I'm leaving it here for discussion. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 19:23, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, that's fine then. It's in the public domain with a verifiable source, so it can be included and referenced properly. Well done on research. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 04:53, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I once tried (unsuccessfully) to do some research about Banksy for something I was writing. What I can comnfirm is that there was no-one called Robert (or Robin) Banks born in Bristol in 1974. So either the name, date or place is fake (or perhaps all three!). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluewave_f9db.html" title="User:Bluewave">Bluewave</a> 09:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am sure you are right, and well done, but, unfortunately, wiki policy is that only secondary sources can be used, and, further, these should be used, even if they're wrong, until proved wrong by another secondary source. Wiki is a collection of what other people have said in the public domain. Check <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">VERIFY</a>. It is something one might imagine would appeal to Banksy. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 09:49, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not actually true. If you refer to the original source so that anyone could check it, and that showed that nobody called Robin or Robert Banks was born in that year, that would be acceptable under NOR. The NOR only kicks in when you try to synthesise conclusions from knowledge. Flatly saying that nobody could be found in record X of building Y isn't synthesis of any kind, so is permissible. But if you tried to work out who it *was* such as a trivial misspelling, that's not going to be allowed, because at some level you're guessing.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 20:27, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, agreed, and that is why I haven't edited the article - I think someone tried to do so, but it wasn't me. Just really flagging the fact that we should be aware that some of parts of the article are in error (although we don't know which). Incidentally, if I had found Robert Banks in the birth registers, I would have accepted that as something that could be added to Wikipedia as it is a public source that can be verified by anyone. Would you disagree? And yes, you're right, that this misinformation would probably appeal to Banksy himself.<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluewave_f9db.html" title="User:Bluewave">Bluewave</a> 12:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that so long as there is mention of his actual name, the section regarding "Real Identity" should be removed. Otherwise it's just redundant and possibly confusing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have moved the name piece to the Real Identity section - simply because it's one newspaper source. And as someone has said above, there is no record of a Robert/Robin Banks born is the Bristol area in 1974 - so there's fair reason to questions all "facts" from the singular source.

<p>I currently believe that the article is biased; obviously others disagree.</p>
<p>At the moment I think it's obvious that some people think that "Banksy" is considered to be talented; some of those people are here on Wikipedia. We can see them.</p>
<p>I don't really know if it could be said that he is "widely considered to be a talented artist" though. Certainly that isn't backed up by any references, or surveys of exactly what percentage of people consider him to be talented.</p>
<p>In addition, the "so-called "Criminal Damage"" can definitely be removed; it is criminal damage, not so called. The law in most countries is very much against vandalism, and that's what this is. No, illegal is not the same thing as immoral. No, vandalism is not always worhtless; indeed, I think that in this case at least it's provocative and that's what art, and especially meaningful art, needs to be. This doesn't change the fact that objectively what "Banksy" does is both against the law and vandalism.</p>
<p>This is also an encyclopaedia and should represent the views of all people, not just of one. While some people obviously think that "Banksy" provides a voice to the urban unheard (was this article created just for this page or...?) I'm sure we can all think of at least two people who would disagree, and claim that his work is just simple un-representative vandalism and in my day we respected authority, yada yada yada. Just because we (and yes, I do include me here) disagree with those people doesn't mean that their views do not exist.</p>

<p>I agree. I mean I'm a big fan of Banksy's work myself but the article's quite obviously POV - phrases like "great" popularity are usually reserved for Beatles-level stuff.</p>
<p>As for sources, hmmm how about the Wired article that's linked to this very article? For example: "... But critics see him as nothing more than an overhyped vandal. Peter Gibson, a spokesperson for the Keep Britain Tidy campaign, says graffiti has become an epidemic: "How would he feel if someone sprayed graffiti all over his house?" There are dissenting opinions. It's wrong to revert an honest attempt at NPOV. <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwidly_3350.html" title="User:Swidly">swidly</a> 03:58, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're claiming that against the law == criminal damage? And that it is clearly vandalism? Sorry, but I would class the construction of freeways in that class.</p>
<p>It's perfectly okay to make the article more neutral, I agree it's kinda fanboy mode right now, but if you just put "some people say" in front of every statement, it comes out sounding like crap. It's just clumsy writing. Say what you will about the views of the current article, at least it reads alright. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShermozle_a420.html" title="User:Shermozle">Shermozle</a> 07:29, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Qoute " You're claiming that against the law == criminal damage? And that it is clearly vandalism? Sorry, but I would class the construction of freeways in that class."</p>
<p>Construction freeways is not against the law, nor is it criminal damage. Criminally damaging property, is against the law. It is criminal damage, in the UK punishable by upto 10 years in jail. Hopefully the police will catch this child, and the courts will impose the maximum sentence. Before someone catches him damaging their property, and inflicts criminal damage to his body.</p>

<dd>What you call bias I call shoddy writing.

<p>There is a legitimate controversy surrounding Banksy's graffiti. A lot of people are of the opinion that some of his works, like spilling paint all over various stone statues in London, were not works of art, but rather, simple acts of vandalism. His defacements ended up costing thousands of pounds to repair and clean up and pissed off <i>a lot</i> of the people living there. The article at least needs to addresses more of the negatives of Banksy's work. Personally (and I'll admit my own bias here) I think a lot of Banksy's work is brilliant, but some of it really just missed the mark and ended up being plain old costly vandalism. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 22:44, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lets not beat ourselves up. It really is harder to find newspaper articles criticizing banksy than praising him. Probably because I live in the states though, and we couldn't care less about international property damage. the controversy section should have that animal rights (nonsense) and other things. The main thing that it's poorly written.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is not encyclopedic: "Some of Banksy's fans believe that his <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stencil.html" title="Stencil">stencilled</a> graffiti provides a voice for those living in urban environments that could not otherwise express themselves, and that his work is also something which improves the aesthetic quality of urban surroundings; many others disagree," " or that his (apparently <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_wing.html" title="Left wing">left wing</a>) beliefs are not shared by the majority of the inhabitants of the environments that he graffitis." is mildly encyclopedic, but what some people say is inherently unverifiable. We need a newspaper guessing that people believe that or someone important saying it. You know what? Lets beat ourselves up. This is written shoddily. I suggest we agressively take out what cannot be proven right away. Even my edit sucks, because somebody saying Banksy's work is vandalism isn't really controvertial, I mean, I love the guy, but look vandalism up in a dictionary. 66.41.66.213 03:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The dictionary defines "vandalise" as "to destroy or deface". Clearly you cannot "destroy" a wall or any other structure by painting on it; "deface" is defined as "to mar the surface or appearance of...". It then comes down to personal opinion - is a grubby wall or the inside of a dirty railway bridge actually "marred" (damaged or spoiled) by having a picture painted on it? Is posting up an advertising billboard onto a wall any better? Yes, I know advertising billboards are not illegal, but the end result is the same - the appearance is changed. The only difference is that advertising billboards are deemed legitimate because money is involved. In other words, yes, it may be illegal to do what Banksy does, but so what? The law is only someone (albeit an influential person's) opinion in any case, its not a universal truth. SimonUK 08:58, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we need some discussion about this latest photo of Banksy. First, it is currently sub-titled with 'unconfirmed', but if the Daily Mail printed it, isn't that a verifiable source (even though they may well be wrong)? Secondly, if the Daily Mail printed it, how can it be in the Commons with the statement "the copyright holder has irrevocably released all rights to it, allowing it to be freely reproduced, etc etc"?

However, the final reference made within the article (#14) is actually connected to the third reference (Random House), which is already used in the article beforehand.

<p>It might be worth mentioning, the graffiti of a naked man hanging from a window on the wall of a building in Bristol which 96% of the public voted to keep, was actually on the wall of a sexual health clinic <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5346822.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5346822.stm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<p>It was a pleasure to pass this article. A great deal of material is sourced, it was fun to read, well-illustrated and well-organized.</p>
<p>I'd improve it, if it were up to me, with a longer intro (there's enough detail in the article to do so) and some more sourcing. The Technique section in particularly could do with this, as with the Peter Gibson complaint. And I bet you could write more (and probably will). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 03:42, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is his opinion of Banksy really all that important?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, but it's _a_ opinion. One could use the same argument to get Charlie Brooker off the comments section as well, and then we don't have much of a comments section.</dd>

<dd>Yes, it was by an artist called Mr Yu<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22mr+yu%22&amp;s=int" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22mr+yu%22&amp;s=int" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

<p>Do magazine articles/interviews count as verifyable sources? Because I have an interview with Banksy that says the quote he put in the penguin enclosure is "We're bored of fish - we wanna go home". Same article mentions him tagging the steps of the Tate with "Mind The Crap" the night before they announced the Turner Prize, which could go under Stunts? They included one of his stencils too, for you to use yourself. They also mention how he's only been caught once, in NYC. And there's a picture of him too (face obscured), but I'm guessing that wouldn't be fair use?</p>
<p>I didn't want to just edit, and piss of the regular contribs, so I put it here first to see if people thought any of that was worthwhile to add.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, although it might depend on what the magazine was! i.e. if it's a reliable source, well known for its journalistic integrity etc. but if it's a b&amp;w self-published zine, maybe not. Check <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, although it tends to concentrate on scientific journals and stuff like that, doesn't really mention magazines.--<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 09:10, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's the UK mag Bizarre, which does cover some..off color topics, and feature nudity and such, but they've been around for 10 years (I think), and I'd imagine that they'd keep at least some journalistic standards. What should be added, and what should not? Can we use the picture of Banksy if we credit the photographer?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe I have a copy of the issue in question, from a few years ago? I'd say that's reliable enough to be used here. My understanding is we won't be able to use the image.--<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 12:33, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there some sort of conspiracy within the media to keep "Banksy"'s identity secret? When you think of some of the people the press have managed to track down over the years, it's not as if they couldn't find and "expose" this guy if they <i>really</i> wanted to. When you consider how high-profile his work is, it's pretty absurd that he hasn't been splashed all over the papers.</p>
<p>Photographs turn up now and again, but they are always low quality, of dubious veracity and do not always appear to be of the same person. His real name also seems to be in doubt.</p>
<p>Some of his works seem to defy belief, e.g. the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad stunt. How did he manage to gain access without attracting suspicion? Were the ride operators in on it?</p>
<p>Has anyone explored the possibility that there's actually a collective of people doing this stuff? 217.155.20.163 14:56, 6 November 2006 (UTC) --Its an intreguing idea, and I've oft wondered if indeed Banksy is a many rather than a one, but Wikipedia is not meant for original research dude. 58.7.0.146 05:58, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
