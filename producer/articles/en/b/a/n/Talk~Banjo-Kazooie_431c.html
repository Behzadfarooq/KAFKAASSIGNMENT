<p>I think it's better to have actual screenshots of the game... and if promotional renders are included, they should be described as such. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrik_8a6d.html" title="User:Fredrik">Fredrik</a> 17:24, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>And then another one&#160;:P I don't think this is such a good idea. Rare can promote the game themselves, the article benefits much more from having actual screenshots of the game. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrik_8a6d.html" title="User:Fredrik">Fredrik</a> 19:19, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just didnt think the screenshot that was there was very informative, perhaps we should try to find a better in-game render that is more closeup and doesnt have that intro text all over it. We should however make a note that these are not in-game screenshots but rather art, However i think it adds very much especially to the story Grunthilda can be seen chasing the duo and in the latter they are picking up a Magical Jigsaw. --<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason">Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason</a> 21:03, 2004 May 18 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Frederik, your placement of the image to the right would have been right except that there is one exception to that rule, that is if the content of the picture faces to the right, in that case images should be on the left side, the 'face' in the picture should always face inwards, see for example the <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee.html" title="Bumblebee">Bumblebee</a> article. --<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason">Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason</a> 22:48, 2004 May 18 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This image doesn't really point anywhere. There's action in both ways; Kazooie, whose face is the most prominent in the picture, is facing left. It looks good either way, as far as that issue is concerned. But I'm of course not primarily concerned about the direction, I'm concerned about the fact that breaking text justification on the left side is highly distracting for a reader. Having it on the left side additionally breaks the balance of the page layout (it all ends up on the left).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the image is facing right, it should preferrably be mirrored to face left. This can't be done here since the image contains a logo that can't be mirrored, but since the direction is only vaguely pronounced in this image, it isn't a problem. I don't like the layout at <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee.html" title="Bumblebee">bumblebee</a> either, but for some reason I find the image there less distracting. Ideally that one should be mirrored and moved to the right. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrik_8a6d.html" title="User:Fredrik">Fredrik</a> 22:59, 18 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Banjo is going left, so is the witch and the whole thing climaxes in the right-bottom corner. I think that if anything it adds to the balance of the page, what layout problems are you having exactly? Text should wrap equally well around images regardless of whether the image is to the left or right.</dd>
<dd>And about starting to turn images i havent heard any other complaints about it being distracting, but dont start turning pictures because of that because consensus has been reached on that images can go on both sides of an article. --<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason">Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason</a> 23:14, 2004 May 18 (UTC)</dd>

And the text on the left after the intro disappears under the image, which is distracting. I still hold that the direction of the image is too vaguely pronounced to justify the current position. In either case, there's another solution: swapping the two images. I'd still like to see both images on the right, but this one will do less harm if placed on the left a bit down.</dd>

<dd>I think i've fixed your image problem by forcing a break after the intro ( the reccomended thing with such float problems ), About where those guidelines i have not been able to dig them up, however i do remember reading them.. somewher, but i tend to loose things. --<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason">Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason</a> 23:37, 2004 May 18 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I figured this would be the place to ask, but what are peoples thoughts on Stop 'N' Swop getting its own article? It's a pretty big mystery, for gaming at least, but it would probably only interest B-K and B-T fans.

<p>Given the fact that this is one of the only things that keeps people still talking about the game it is indeed appropriate that it receives its own article. Briton</p>

<p>"While the game did recieve good reviews at the time of it's release, it is often critiqued by gamers as "not aging well"--or the fact that the game looks like just another "archaic" platformer by today's standards. While the series does pertain a critical fanbase, it it also perceived by a select few to not be any innovative movement in gaming, simply because it was so much like Super Mario 64. While the game did feature a select amount of elements that were new to the 3D platformer genre, it is true that many similarities can be made between the two games, such as a similar control scheme, and the camera control scheme. Another problem gamers had with the game was the amount of objects the player was required to collect in order to progress through the game, and the game's stages. Banjo-Kazooie is infamous for creating the notorious term "collect-o-thon" which is a term used to mean that a game features a vast amount of monotonous object collecting through non-linear environments."</p>
<p>This whole paragraph is nonsense. I'm deleting it, it can be put back when it has some citing. I've also never heard of the term "collect-o-thon," and its obvious to anyone who has played Banjo Kazooie that it is not linear.</p>
<p>Agreed. The perspective seems slanted and inobjective, besides. Nice revision: let's try to keep this article as informative and neutral as possible, folks.</p>
<p>--AaronOfAbsalom 19:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree with you on this. That critique of the game shows both possible opinions on it, and if you have not heard of the term "collectathon" then clearly you do not take enough interest in gaming communities.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It still doesn't have a reference attached, thus making the whole thing a bunch of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> that can't be included in the article. Also, watch what you say here and never make assumptions. I am an avid gamer and I had never heard the term "collect-o-thon" until I read this paragraph and, even then, google hits for "collect-o-thon" cap out at 25, "collect-a-thon" gets less than 900, and "collectathon" doesn't even reach 3,000 so I wouldn't even say it is a very widely used term, outside or inside the gaming world. Your assumption about this editor is baseless. --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 21:36, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. First of all, they arent a "Guide" to the game. It doesnt list what Jiggies are where, its just a general summary of each level so people who aren't familiar with this game can learn about them. Although it would be a good idea not to simply remove them, but to shorten them to just give a very brief general summary of the levels. I'll do that now. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDietLimeCola_5161.html" title="User:DietLimeCola">DietLimeCola</a> 13:20, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I've made a HUGE change to this section. I've left the two primary, and most important, worlds and I've drastically reduced the extra worlds. I think the information on the eggs and the keys should go under a seperate section as then we start getting into a game guide sort of thing. Plus, it wouldn't hurt to have it as a "mystery surrounding these items" sort of thing as they were never really given explained. Anyway, tell me what you think, but please don't revert it without discussion as I think this could be a way to solve the problem of it being too lengthy and out-of-place to the article, but not making it disappear either. --<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPIrish_95cc.html" title="User:PIrish">pIrish</a> 17:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Err, I'm not sure prose would be the best way to go. A list shows it clear-cut, this is exactly what this is. Prose was sort of what we already had. I think.

<dd>I think lists are good for some things, but, for the most part, one should stay away from them. I'm thinking this may be one of those cases where there really isn't any other way to put forth the information without making it seem weird. I also tried to find something about lists being discouraged, but I came up empty-handed. Maybe this mostly applied to articles that are purely lists? Like the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nintendo_64_games_2a3b.html" title="List of Nintendo 64 games">List of Nintendo 64 games</a>.

<p>--65.54.154.46 02:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)Ok, this is the single biggest mystery of any game that I've ever played in my life: A long time ago, I remember playing in Treasure Trove Cove when, as I passed by one side of the Hippo's half sunken boat, Banjo's arms suddenly and spontaneously became like classic pirate wooden stubs. There are no kind of items or power-ups around there that may have done this, nor do I remember getting anything, but I do remember that a song like when you use golden feathers or power-ups started as soon as the change happened. It seems to have been a power-up, as I also remember that I could kill those jumping clam enemies in a single strike instead of 3 normal punches. In fact I even remember that it sounded differently when you punched, like "Cha-Cha-Cha." In all this mysterious experience only lasted around 30, maybe a little more or less, and then Banjo's arms returned to normal and the song stopped. If anyone knows ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING about this please let me know here. I have a good memory and this is a mystery that has been on my mind for years now.</p>
