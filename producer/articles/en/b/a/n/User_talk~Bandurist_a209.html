Please <b><a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7Ebe_bold_3a70.html" title="WP:be bold">WP:be bold</a></b> in making corrections and improvements, especially in topics where you are specialist. One word of caution though, please be a little careful with creating of categories and stub templates and in the beginning better ask for advise. The reasons for that may be a little to long to explain, but, it all comes down, to the difficulty to correct and undo a mistake in the cat creation. Thanks again for your work.

<p>Hi. Thanks. I have been primarilly working in the Ukrainian vesion of the Wikipedia, basically putting in all the information I have aquired for my doctorate, and am now porting over most of it into the English version. Bit by bit. Thanks for the support and advice.

<p>Hi! I noticed, you recently renamed articles about Ukrainian bandurists, listing surnames first. For example, you moved, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andriy_Omelchenko_9622.html" title="Andriy Omelchenko">Andriy Omelchenko</a> to <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omelchenko_Andriy_d6ad.html" title="Omelchenko Andriy">Omelchenko Andriy</a>, etc. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=Bandurist" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=Bandurist" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. While in Ukrainian language it's common to give the family name first, in English it's common to proceed the other way around, that is listing the first name, following by the last name. For example <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, etc. Please see the wikipedia naming convention: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28people%29_db33.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)</a>.

<p>Greetings. A far as I know the current English version for the Ukrainian Capital is Kyiv. Kiev is the Russian transcription and is being phased out. I would like that reflected in the articles that I have done. I will refrain from changing Kiev to Kyiv, but I would appreciate not having Kyiv changed to Kiev in my articles.</p>
<p>By the way, I spent a couple of weeks in Krasnodar touring with the Kuban Kozak Choir, Viktor Zakharkchenko and Yuri Bulavin performing in a number of Stanytsias, festivals and on television in Krasnodar. How come you don't speak Ukrainian. I heard more Ukrainian in the Kuban than in Kyiv in 1991. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBandurist_6fc0.html" title="User:Bandurist">Bandurist</a> 05:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well its true that our balachka is a hybrid between 17th century Malorossian and modern Russian. However its a dialect with no grammatical structure and actually if you listned closely would contain words that are not even found in Russian or Ukrainian, particulary amongst those living in the Karachay-Cherkessia (the north - is Cossack homeland). I am from Central Kuban west of Kransnodar (we call it Катькодар). However politics seem to influence the choice, and I might dissapoint you, but we Cossacks are still loyal to the Pereyaslav Treaty that our ancestors signed more than 350 years ago. And we are proud of it. So if Ukraine is going to turn its back on us, well what can I say so be it, but in the current political spectrum, we are less likely to give an oath of eternal loyalty to Ukraine than Lviv will to Moscow... I for one am proud to be born Russian (although I must stress that we Cossacks:Kuban, Don, Terek have never actually considered ourselves ethnically Great Russians, but instead consider ourselves as a separate Ruthenian entity - Cossacks (Казаки). I will not blame you, but I think that its wrong to assume that there are only three East-Slavic super ethnicities, instead there are a dozen of them, and Great, Small and White Ruthenians only form the largest groups, in addition there are Pomorians, Lipovians, Cossacks, Rusyns and so on... As for the genetic composition...my mother is from Polotsk, and combine with all the war brides that were brought back, plus interhost marriages... ethnically the Cossack population of Cuban is a Kasha...but spiritually...we made up the Emperor's private guard and are now the largest part of the Presidential Guard in the Kremlin... that says something about our loyalty... In the Second World War, whilst some of our Don brothers chose to collaborate, we fought for our motherland <a href="http://www.rkka.ru/uniform/images/kaz_08_bw2.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.rkka.ru/uniform/images/kaz_08_bw2.jpg" rel="nofollow">here is my grandfather third row fourth from the left at the famous victory parade in 1945</a>, (actually he can play a Bandura at 82 years of age).</dd>

<dd>Now then wrt to Kiev/Kyiv then really its a parrallel to Moscow/Moskva. The Russian name of the city would be Kiyev or Kijev based on the transliteration, and nobody is using that one anywhere. Think of it as Dnieper river. In Russian its Dnepr in Ukrainian its Dnipro... in English its Dnieper. Hence we use that throughout. Same with Kiev/Kiyev/Kyiv. Only the first one is an English word, and unfortunately <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28UE%29_41c6.html" title="WP:NC(UE)">WP:NC(UE)</a> leaves little space for the alternative names. Why? Because think about the audience reading wikipedia, the majority of whom are only familiar with the words they see, and you cannot deny that in the course of 15 years there is a still an absoloute majority of people using Kiev over all other versions and its irrelelvant if Kiev is derived from Kiyev or not. I mean I am not offended if someone calls my capital Moscow and I don't even know on what language was that based on.</dd>

<dd>Anyway good job on the bandura related, but don't get too picky with such minor tweaks.

<p>Thanks for the kind words but I disagree regarding the use of Kyiv.</p>
<ul>
<li>With regard to a comparison with say words Moskva, Varshava, Roma, Praha - English doesn't like the a ending and tends to go for a closed syllable ending for the names of Cities.</li>
<li>Kyiv come from Kiy - the apparent founder of Kyiv. The -iv ending is the Ukrainian pronounciation of the yat'. Thus we have Chernihiv, Lviv, Mykolayiv, Zhdaniv. Once upon a time Ukraine was part of the Russian empire. It made sense to call it Kiev then, however Ukraine today is an independant country and it is cementing its own traditions and changing the legacy of the past to refelct its own perceptions. It is interesting that the Ukrainian governement has chosen that it prefers the spelling of Kyiv in English and the fact that the US government has also chosen this particular spelling. I think that Wikipedia should follow suite and should not be stuck in the past.</li>
<li>As time is progressing more and more sites are choosing the Ukrainian transliteration rather than the Russian one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>www.kyivpost.com</li>
<li>www.ves-kyiv.com.ua</li>
<li>www.kyiv-obl.gov.ua</li>

<p>This didn't exist before and it is a growing trend.</p>
<p>Anyway - I will be posting a whole slew of article on the bandura in the Kuban and in general and a mass of photographs. Hope you will enjoy the articles. Have you read the Minister and the Massacres by N. Tolstoy? 20:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well growing or not is something that will not influence wikipedia. What does influence wikipedia is that both CNN and BBC use Kiev, and a lot more people in the English speaking world read those than US or UK state let alone Ukrainian state publications (in English)... just google the two names against each other and you have a 34 million vs. 5 million preference of Kiev over Kyiv. And its not that the five million is insignificant... it's the fact that 34 million hits is a LOT! Here is a recent discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Irpen#Question_on_Kyiv_spelling" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Irpen#Question_on_Kyiv_spelling" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and Irpen fully summarises it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for historical versions, then prior to 1990s Kyiv was not known anywhere outside Ukraine and its diaspora...And as for history its best not to even dive into there. We have <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Kharkov_47bb.html" title="Second Battle of Kharkov">Second Battle of Kharkov</a> and the city is <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharkiv.html" title="Kharkiv">Kharkiv</a>; <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Lw%C3%B3w_%281918%29_f216.html" title="Battle of Lwów (1918)">Battle of Lwów (1918)</a> and the <a href="../../../l/v/o/Lvov-Sandomierz_Offensive_4297.html" title="Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive">Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive</a> and the modern city is called <a href="../../../l/v/i/Lviv.html" title="Lviv">Lviv</a>. We have the <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Dynamo_Kyiv_548c.html" title="FC Dynamo Kyiv">FC Dynamo Kyiv</a> and the city is called <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>.</dd>

<dd>I have not read the book, on the contrary I despise historical literature, particulary on controversial matters, because in my opinion its impossible to write history with no bias, sad but true. Since people will simply give you the sources and refrences taht they want you to believe. On the other hand I love Gumelyov because instead of following the boring historian approach of focusing on a narrow event he launches into everything and I must say I find his theory on "passionarity" convincing. As for other literature then its classical Russian:Leo Tolstoy, Bulgakov...its something you can read over and over again and still each time find it amazing and wonderful... --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 21:36, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope you don't mind my attempts at clean-up, and fitting the articles you write into more standard formats. The transcription issues are hot-button, and will most likely remain so with the diverse views present at WP. But I hope they don't discourage you with any further articles you wish to write.

<dd>It's a learning experience. I'm just sitting on my own bandura stuff, and going over and correcting the materials over and over again and gradually learning all the tools. Everyday something new is learned. The transcription thing is a bit of a shocker but I'll get over it. Some people are very passionate about it. I guess the most important thing is to get the information together and out there.

Hi. The stamps were published by the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus in Detroit USA bu Peter Honcharenko. They were used as a method of fund raising. He would send out small sheets of the stamps each year and received $5 - $? as adonation for the group. Their were a couple of hundred types of stamps issued.--01:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBandurist_6fc0.html" title="User:Bandurist">Bandurist</a></p>
