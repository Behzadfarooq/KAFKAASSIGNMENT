<p>Zora added the section cited below as her compromise to present Muslim perspective of the issue, but the section is deleted by Pecher because according to him it is unsourced. I am putting the section for reference only, and when the source can be substantiated, the section can be put back to the main article. I have reference for the third point from a published work by an Ahmadiyya Muslim scholar <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maulana_Muhammad_Ali_bfd7.html" title="Maulana Muhammad Ali">Maulana Muhammad Ali</a>, so I might put the third statement back into the main article.

<dd><b>(Written by Zora, May 2006)</b>Muslim responses</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Non-Muslims may find this story disturbing -- so too do many Muslims. The Muslim view of Muhammad is that he was mild and just, avoiding violence unless it was absolutely necessary. How then would he have allowed the killing of hundreds of men? Why were the Banu Qurayza not exiled, like the other Jewish tribes of Medina? Muslim scholars have approached this event in several ways.
<ul>
<li>1. Some scholars believe that Ibn Ishaq is not a reliable source, and that his account may be embroidered or exaggerated. They note that some elements of his story could only have come from descendants of the Banu Qurayza, and that those descendants may have lied.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Opponents would say that there are hadith that confirm Ibn Ishaq's account.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>2. Some scholars say that Muhammad had given authority to Ibn Mu'adh to settle the affair, and had confidently anticipated that Ibn Mu'adh would sentence the Banu Qurayza to exile. When the arbiter ruled for death, Muhammad felt that this was the will of God and that he should not use his authority to challenge it. The blame for the killings belongs to Ibn Mu'adh, not to Muhammad.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Opponents say that Muhammad had the power to prevent massacre and should have used it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>3. One scholar has argued that Moses had directed the Jews to kill all the men of some tribes encountered during the conquest of Israel. If this was Jewish law, then it was only fair that Jews be treated according to Jewish law.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Opponents say that this was not Jewish law and not codified in the Talmud.</dd>

<p>According to Muslim writings, there was no punishment in Qur'an at that time, which means that they chose a similar punishment in Torah. If Muslim accounts say this, why to completely nullify it using strong words like "in fact". Maybe non of them is right, but it important to write it down. Maybe Arabian Jews were following slightly different version of bible, which we don't have or they changed afterwards, or maybe it has nothing to do with treason at all, as the directive in Torah is regarding believers attacking someone else, I am not suggesting, I am just making assumptions. Hence, I believe that both views should be presented without pushing one more than the other. This is according to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:18, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The passage linked to does not say anything about the treatment of traitors, but about the treatment of a city that refused a peaceful settlement and was then conquered. Hence, any claim that it did is factually incorrect and hence must be reverted. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 15:47, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Al-Tabari is one of the main sources for early Islamic history, but no academics trust it to tell the whole truth all the time. There are too many demonstrable errors in it. For example, the al-Muqawqis who is said to have sent Maria the Copt to Muhammad is identified with Cyrus of the Caucasus, but he didn't take office in Egypt until years after the 627-628 date on which Tabari says Cyrus sent tribute to Muhammad. Examples could be multiplied. Citing Tabari doesn't prove anything. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:02, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He is still a vitally important primary source. Citing the Quran doesn't "prove" anything either.

<p>Your re-addition of the work is marginally better, in that it doesn't claim reliability, but I'm not sure that this work should be singled out over Waqidi, Baladuri, Ibn Sa'd, and other early works. Why is this particular work is being stressed? Do you think that I'm a Muslim dedicated to proving that the massacre didn't happen? Far from it. My concern is historiography, not apologetics. I'm not sure that one should trust DETAILS in works written so long after the fact, but I think most historians would agree that the Muslims drove out the Jewish tribes of Medina. It would be great if we could do a proper archaeological dig in Medina and confirm or deny some questions re early Islamic history but I think that the chances of that happening are just ... about ... nil. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you wish to add citations to Waqidi et al, then do so, by all means. to take ibn Ishaq out because Muslim apologists don't regard him as reliable (because... gasp!... some of his assertions contradict the Quran) is ridiculous. I never accused you of being any kind of apologetic-writer. Whether you are or are not a Muslim is entirely your own affair, and of no material weight in determining what should or should not be included in this article.

<dd>Please stick to the topic in question. I'm already tired of repeating that views of Islamic scholars on the Torah are irrelevant.

<dd>It is happening the other way around, because Muslims believe in Torah but Jews don't believe in Qur'an. Simple!

<dd>Ulema do believe that Torah is currupted, but not completely. And I have given you opinions.

<dd>TS,</dd>
<dd>The Torah has objectively nothing to do with Saad's verdict, as the Torah does not state that traitors should be summarily executed and their women made captive. That's like saying US law states that thieves are punished by death because the law punishes some other crime like murder this way.</dd>
<dd>If Saad however wrongly thought this way or used the Torah in a manipulative way (which ever) this must be clearly referenced. However, your statement "it is a POV of some Islamic scholars, because the statement by Sa'd ... matches exactly with the punishment of Torah in similar circumstances. They consider it more than a coincidence" indicates that there is no basis for attributing Saad with such claims: what we have is the verdict given and then opinion (and hence a POV) of Islamic scholars. It is the scholars that draw a link between the verdict and the Torah. That they are wrong is another matter as the two do not match exactly, as explained above. Still, this view can be mentioned and I think the best place would be a footnote saying "Some Islamic scholars have opined that Saad took this punishment from Deuteronomy which states ...". It must however be clear that this verse has nothing to do with treason.</dd>
<dd>As for your statement "I believe that adversaries of Israelites 2000 years earlier were persecuted for denying or opposing a Messenger of God and hence they were punished." is peculiar. First of all, you change the alleged crime - suddenly we are concerned with "dennying or opposing" a prophet. If this was Muhammad's accusation then he was the one that breached the Medina constitution. Secondly, of course you are wrong as no one ever was punished legally (as opposed to some act of God) for denying or opposing a prophet. Prophet was no legal position but a calling from God. More often than not it was the prophets that had to endure punishment. And of course this is entirely logical as you cannot legally prescribe a prophet. A prophet will prove a prophet in time, when his prophecies come true.</dd>
<dd>I cannot tell how notable these scholars are, but I completely agree with BeitOr that Islamic scholars cannot be quoted to explain what the Torah (or the Gospels) - two books they effectively reject - mean. They may use it occasionally but since they have been allegedly corrupted and superceded by the Quran, this is rather inconsequential, since how are they to know that they are not dealing with a "corrupted passage". What they are doing is still arguing within the Islamic sphere. Hence their view and their interpretation is entirely Islamic.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your lengthy comment. Qur'an clearly says it doesn't disregard previous books but confirms them. Hence, previous books are considered currupted but not invalid and this is why Islamic scholar think that there is some truth in these books about previous incidents, to which Qur'an sometimes only alludes in a very concise way. The thing, which is really bothering me is that Jews and Christians will always say that Muhammad was not a prophet and hence, he was incompatible with Hebrew prophets and Islam would always assert that he is the last in these prophets. This is exactly, why I quoted Esposito, which is a very relevant quote as it compares Muhammad with Hebrew prophets (which you might not agree). I would never say that people were killed because of betraying. They were killed because of denying a prophet or his message. If I can still remember, according to Qur'an and Bible both, people who worshipped <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_calf.html" title="Golden calf">Golden calf</a> were persecuted, as it is not betrayal but challenge to God infront of his designated messenger. And these things make people like Esposito and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Armstrong_ba0b.html" title="Karen Armstrong">Karen Armstrong</a> to think that there is no difference in basic philosophy of Hebrew prophets and Muhammad.</dd>
<dd>I think, the comment "such punishment is not in Torah" needs to be presented properly and sourced, otherwise it simply shows your conclusion that such punishments doesn't exist but not of any scholar in particular. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 11:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of whether your points are relevant, I will address them:
<ul>
<li>The Quran confirms the existence of previous books but disqualifies the actually existing previous books by calling the subject to corruption. In the words of some promiment Muslims (don't know who it was): if they disagree with the Quran they are wrong, if they agree with it they are superfluous. In any case, Islam revolves around the Quran and around the Torah or the Gospels (not that Judaism or Christianity revolve around these - these are not book religions).</li>
<li>That Muhammad is not accepted by Jews and Christians might bother you but you can't be helped on that. And we do no reject him and because of that declare him incompatible - no, we think him incompatible and therefore reject him. How Esposito helps is beyond me.</li>
<li>I know of no one in the Bible who is punished for denying a prophet. The Golden Calf worshippers were not actually persecuted (it was a one time event) but punished for idolatry. I can't remember hearing about Isaiah killing people for not accepting him - rather he was killed by the King according to extrabiblical sources. Jeremiah had a lot to suffer from both the people and the King. Muhammad is quite different on this: the worst case is I think that of Beni Qunayqa, the first Jewish tribe he attacked ... for refusing to convert to Islam. In the end, they were exiled because of Abdallah's intercession. In case of the Qurayza, they had at least really broken faith (though I can only understand too well, why they did it).</li>
<li>The point about such a punishment for treason not being in the Torah is already sourced, as the verses referenced by your scholars do not talk about treason. If you (OR rather your scholars) can come up with a verse linking treason and that punishment then provide it. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 14:25, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The worst thing is ALM's unashamed POV pushing by writing "Although Sa'd judged according to his own views, <b>his ruling coincides with <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Deuteronomy&amp;verse=20:10-14&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Deuteronomy&amp;verse=20:10-14&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Deuteronomy 20:10-14</a></b>. His ruling does not coincide with Deuteronomy. I guess doesn't mean that the two appeared alongside without causal connection (which is what the sentence actually means, which is ridiculous given that the two events are apart at least 1200 years) but that Sad's verdict agrees with these verses. Which, as I said, is clearly not the case. At best it is a Muslim POV.

The main reason why the Qurayza are known today is that they lost a war against the early Muslims and were massacred.

<dd>"Undue weight" means not giving excessive coverage to a marginal view. If anything in the article is given undue weight, it is your false contention that Sa'd's judgment comported with Jewish law. At best it comported with a single sentence in Deuteronomy, taken entirely out of context and distorted beyond its intended scope (as that scope had ALWAYS been defined in Jewish law.) <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 19:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here it is: <i>"Undue weight applies to <b>more than just viewpoints</b>. Just as giving undue weight to a viewpoint is not neutral, so is giving undue weight to other verifiable and sourced statements. <b>An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject</b>, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements."</i></p>
<p>If you cut out the hadith quotes and move them to the appropriate section, that is the siege section, then the seige will get have even more text and details than the entire history of the entire tribe, including post-Islamic times. This is clearly to my "quantity of text" and "depth of detail" and should be split out per Undue weight. But it is also very true that the tribe is most prominent due to this event. Both issues can be solved to every bodies content without violating the guidelines, can't it? How about we put a prominent link to the siege in the intro and then put some picture on the siege summary section of the main, making it more prominent. Wouldn't that solve your concerns? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 20:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just think about this: The "Campaigns of Muhammad" campaign box is at the top of the article of a tribe article - now, is that really reasonable? Then the article start by giving the history of the tribe.

<p>i just wanted to comment: i think it's entirely logical to split the siege, its events and the scholarly analysis of it (and there is much) into another article. it also seems to facilitate an important addition for this 'Campaigns' template as Striver suggested. Qurayza is not merely known for its supposed bloody end, it did indeed have a significant role and history in pre-hijri Medina and during its time in post-hijri Medina. <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaybar.html" title="Khaybar">Khaybar</a> seems to set a logical precedence for this. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 20:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Per Itaqallah's agreement, i have expanded the siege section and moved it to its own article that now spans twice the content of the main article. It's not reasonable to have a battle take 2/3 of the entire space of tribe article. To make sure that nobody misses the article, it has been linked to 3 (three) times, two (2) of them in the lead - and it has been prominently depicted as killing of many men. Im sure nobody will miss the article now and nobody alleged any motives of hiding the article, something that is done in good faith in order to follow wikipedia guildlines. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 05:20, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And as an added bonus, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Template%7ECampaignbox_Campaigns_of_Muhammad_bbb1.html" title="Template:Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad">Template:Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad</a> now linkes directly to the siege article, going right to the killing, ensuring that nobody gets bored reading the tribes history. And would they want to read it, then they are more than well informed about this article, all in accordance with efforts to please those who want to ensure that nobody misses the event. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 05:24, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think this article should be split. The name "Sieg of Banu Qurayza" already indicates that it is centred around this tribe. I don't see a problem with the Campaignbox, but if you don't like it we can remove it here and link to this article from "Battle of the Trench". Undue weight also is not a problem since IMHO a people's demise is an important part in its history, especially if it did not "die a natural death" but was massacred. And Itaqallah, whxy is the tribe's end only "supposed" to be bloody? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 09:34, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Neither Daniel Pipes is an authority on Quran, Islamic Law etc. nor is Puya an authority on the Torah. Puya, however, must have studied the Torah (to become a scholar of Islam) as the Quran relates many events in the Hebrew Bible, that however, doesn't make him a scholar. I think the best we can do is state that "such and such" scholar writes "such and such". Note, however, Daniel Pipes isn't even a scholar (on niether Islam nor 7th Century Arabian history), so he doesn't deserve to be quoted as such.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 02:33, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is absolutely ridiculous. Daniel Pipes has a PhD in medieval Islamic history and has authored many peer reviewed articles and papers on Islamic jurisprudence. He is eminently qualified to discuss the Quran. Your assertion that Puya "must have studied the Torah" to become a scholar of Islam is likewise ludicrous; at best it is OR for which you have provided no support. There is no such requirement for an interpreter of the Quran. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 04:48, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> You do not need to be a scholar of Y to say "X is like Y", but you need to be a scholar of X in order for your view to be relevant on an article about X.

<dd><b>Self-correction</b> As has now been established that Pipes indeed does have qualifications to scholarly talk about Islamic history, so I'll adapt my above comment. Anyway, Pipes is not the subject of this article.</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Puya however has no qualifications to scholarly talk about the Torah, which does not prevent him from talking about it anyway. BUT: it is not scholarship! What he says he says in the context of the Islamic religion. That his statement is factually wrong is another indicator for this. Still I do not object to this view being included IF put in the proper context.

<p>I am going to review all the sources, that talk about using Torah in judgement of Banu Qurayza:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghamidi.html" title="Ghamidi">Ghamidi</a>: Ghamidi's contention is that Qur'an is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/saga" class="extiw" title="wikt:saga">saga</a> of Muhammad. Hence, absence of prescription of this punishment for Banu Qurayza at that time gives him a good excuse to believe that the decree came from Torah as Ibn Ishaq's statement matches with a ruling in Torah (which talks about treatment of inhabitants of a city at a particular time and space). There is a mistake in his English translation, the original <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> version doesn't give *treason* as the reason and I have pointed this mistake to the webmaster of the website with the translation.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahdi_Puya_e557.html" title="Mahdi Puya">Mahdi Puya</a> can be merged with <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghamidi.html" title="Ghamidi">Ghamidi</a>'s sentence.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Esposito_c4cf.html" title="John Esposito">John Esposito</a>: His quoted comments are just after the persecution of Banu Qurayza, hence, these comments by Esposito are not *out of context*. His comments might not be related to the decree from Torah, but definitely related to the judgement of Banu Qurayza. Actually, he even goes onto giving the examples of Hebrew prophets who took arms with the permission of the God e.g. <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua.html" title="Joshua">Joshua</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel.html" title="Samuel">Samuel</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehu.html" title="Jehu">Jehu</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saul.html" title="Saul">Saul</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a>. Secondly, discarding a cruitial source from <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_Press_e785.html" title="Oxford University Press">Oxford University Press</a> will not be a good idea, especially when it talks in the context.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Angered by the betrayal of the Banu Qurayzah in the violation fo their oath, Muhammad submitted them to trial by the chief of the Aws whom they had requested to pass judgement upon them. Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, the chief, decreed all fighting men of the Banu Qurayza be put to death. This was in keeping with the Jewish law (Deuteronomy 20:12), which decreees the killing of every male in such situations, He was convinced that they would have meted out similar judgement on the Muslims had they and their allies triumphed instead. None but four would forsake Judaism for Islam as a price of survival.</p>

<ul>
<li>Even *if* the persecution was done according to laws in Torah, I believe that Banu Qurayza would not have accepted it as a punishment of Torah by the Lord. Hence, I believe that it is irrelevant that what is Jewish interpretation of this law, as the decree was *simply* promulgated by an old Jewish ally.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I believe that it is important to write that Ibn Ishaq doesn't explicitly state that the punishment was given from Torah. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC) December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first thing is that giving an example of the interpretation of Torah does not prove that Jews of certain time and place also had that interpretation. Secondly, even *if* the punishment was given according to Torah, it was simply promulgated rather consulted with any of the Jewish tribes, hence, I find it useless and also <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original research</a> to say that Torah was *always* interpreted this way. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 14:37, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's simply your original research that the Jews at that time and place may have interpreted the Torah differently. The interpretation given in the article is a standard one, and it's referenced to standard sources on the Jewish law. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 20:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Original research is to introduce a "standard interpretation". If it is really that standard, i am sure you will find some scholar that refutes or disagrees with the multiple scholars who have cited the Torah. Just bringing it up yourself is the very definition of OR. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 20:42, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Multiple scholars" apparently stands for the two modern Muslim scholars, who are, of course, uniquely qualified to interpret the Torah. You've apparently failed to notice that the current interpretation is referenced to a tractate from the Talmud and to Maimonides: it's difficult to find more widely accepted references on the interpretation of the Torah as these two. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 20:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I note again that the "scholars" cited themselves cite to no source for their assertion of what is or is not Jewish law beyond quoting verbatim a couple of cherrypicked lines from Deuteronomy. Farah's allegation that Sa'd judged based on what he thought the Banu Qurayza would have themselves done is ludicrous and is Farah's opinion; it is perhaps the most unscholarly of all the many dubious assertions made by him in his tome. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 21:26, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Massacre is a completely accurate term. If you are ashamed of your prophet's actions that is your problem and not WP's.</li>
<li>According to what I have read, the Qurayza did not chose Sad as judge (arbitrator is really a wrong term, given that the Jews had already surrendered - if the was arbitrator it was between Muhammad and the Aws). From what I read, the Aws interceded on behalf of their old allies, the Qurayza, and Muhammad proposed (according to what I read terminally ill) Sad, one of their chieftains, as judge. The Aws agreed and Sad pronounced his deathly verdict. The Qurayza, not being part of the negotiations, were not in the position to chose.</li>

The Qurayzah men were separated from the tribe's women and children and ordered by the Muslim general Sa'd ibn Mu'adh to be put to death; the women and children were to be enslaved. This tragic episode cast a shadow upon the relations between the two communities for many centuries, even though the Jews, a “People of the Book” (that is, like Christians and Zoroastrians, as well as Muslims, possessors of a divinely revealed scripture), generally enjoyed the protection of their lives, property, and religion under Islamic rule and fared better in the Muslim world than in the West. Moreover, <i>Muslims believe that the Prophet did not order the execution of the Jews of Medina, but many Western historians believe that he must have been, at the very least, informed of it.</i>"--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, does that quote help.

<p>I just received the email from Ceaser Farah, as I inquired about her sources and this is what she responded:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Mr, *****:</dd>
<dd>I am puzzled by your inquiry. Yes, the book is scholarly; the publisher was the first back in 1965 to commission this study as a part of a series on religions. Secondly, the chief (Sa'd) judged the banu Qurayzah by their own laws as per their agreement in the document they signed at Yathrib with the rest of the tribes settled there.</dd>
<dd>Farah</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am even ready to reveal the original email. The point is very clear. She didn't make a blind opinion. Jews had the agreement with the Muhammad, that they can only be put on trial according to their own laws. This is not <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">Original research</a> and book is scholarly.

<dd>So Farah thinks that the book is scholarly. Great.

<p>Well, the letter doesn't add anything to our discussion that we didn't know (or could safely assume). Farah doesn't give her sources and from what I gater the agreement of the Qurayza she is talking about is the agreement to the Constitution in which Muhammad was made final arbiter. And hence, they had in advance agreed to abide by his judgement. He transferred this to Sad. However, are we expected to believe that the Qurayza agreed to their own death? All other claims about "their own law" are unsourced here as well. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 20:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What do you mean by unsourced! <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Medina_75b9.html" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a> says very clearly <i>"The Jews of the ... are one community with the believers. To the Jews their religion and to the Muslims their religion. [This applies] to their clients and to themselves with the exception of anyone who has done wrong or committed treachery, for he harms only himself and his family."</i> It was not Banu Qurayza who would have agreed with Muhammad to their own death but other Jewish clans, who were left with no other choice but to obey their old ally who (Sa'd) had converted to Islam by that time. Even common sense asks for the explanation of this peaceful handover of this clan to be persecuted, which would show that they didn't have any honor and they handed over one of their clans to be persecuted, which is very difficult to assume in Arabian societies, especially if you look at their previous dialogues with Muhammad. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 01:41, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do respect your analysis, but it is Original research to suggest that Farah has a blind comment. If the book is scholarly, it wouldn't have passed through just like that! I don't want to discuss it further its actual implementation because we are never going to come to the same understanding, otherwise we will be in trouble of legitimizing all the bloodshed (rightly or un-rightly) by Hebrew prophets. My only concern is the trivialization of Farah's comments and removal of Espositos comments (which are said in this particular context in his book). It is not our job as wikipedians to assess that what is right or wrong, but rather reputation of the author and the publisher determines the quality of the quote. If we don't understand, leave it to the scholars.

<dd>The reputation of Esposito as a Saudi-sponsored propagandist not known for any independent research on Muhammad is pretty low.

<dd>Exactly, I have encountered this in some many Muslim apologists: replies like "your bible contains contradictions/errors etc too" (to criticism of the quran) or "your prophets killed people too" (to criticism of violence by Muhammad) or simply "crusades". Well, even if all this counter-criticism were true, this would not in any touch the matter of criticism of Islam or any of its elements. It might be that all three religions are not true (obviously not my view, but there you go). Just one more thing: "all the bloodshed by Hebrew prophets"? which prophets are we talking about? Well, Moses did spill some blood as did Elijah. Elisha probably too. Phineas comes to mind too, but he was no prophet as such. And that's about it. (It is noteworthy that none of this happened merely because someone refused to believe a certain prophet - there are many prophets that were disbelieved in their day without resorting to violence and many prophets were also killed. Unfortunately, Islam cannot give other examples as it has only one prophet.) But I guess those uttering that reply are not actually interested in discussing this but only in silencing criticism of their prophet. I agree with TS that it's not our job to assert what is right or wrong but to report events, facts and views. However, we do report events truthfully even if this results in "bad press". Saying that that something was evil would violate NPOV but hiding some fact would be an even worse violation. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 10:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Opiner, it is indeed possible that he or she (I don't know which right now) did sign this way. Sometimes a signature has only the second name. I see no reason to doubt TS claim. However, the letter is completely irrelevant as it doesn't help us. It doesn't help anything scholarly and, since it is not a published source, it could only give a hint as to how understand a certain wording in her/his book. But that is not our situation.

<p>Then don't lecture me about a "scholarly source". It was obvious to me all the time that her stone killed a Muslim ("a believer" would be POV) - otherwise it wouldn't have been mentioned - so obvious that it didn't occur to me that anyone could not understand. And I think Muir thought the same when he wrote what he wrote. And yes, under the premise of the massacre, the woman's death is only logical.

<dd>You also wrote that <i>it was clear</i>. Don't tell me that it was clear. The punishment was only for adult males. You are giving a wrong impression to the readers by censoring the information. The woman was punished for killing a person, not for the reason Qurayza was killed. Unfortunately, if Qurayza wouldn't have signed the treaty with Muhammad, they wouldn't face this problem. As R.B. Serjeant gives a complete agreement which was exclusively between Muhammad and Banu Qurayza, just prior to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_trench.html" title="Battle of the trench">battle of the trench</a>. Muhammad even raised the status of Qurayza against other Jewish tribes by making blood money of Qurayza equivalent to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Nadir_4eb2.html" title="Banu Nadir">Banu Nadir</a>.</dd>

<p>I said it was clear <i>to me</i> and I thought it would be clear to everybody else too. You can hardly use the "The punishment was only for adult males" against me, when I was the one that added the one exception. You could have merely posted the clarification that she was killed as a combatant, to use modern language. If the Qurayza and the Nadir would have supported their brethren against their ultimate slayer they wouldn't have faced this problem. It was M. who first broke his part of the compact by exiling and robbing the Quanayqa (though he would have rather killed them, if Abdallah hadn't prevented this). So again (and this time clearly) you are justifying the slaughtering of a complete tribe.

Muhammad raised their status and made them equal to Banu Nadir, and blood-money is a very important measure in those days to see that what is the status of each tribe. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 14:12, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>TS, could you please be so kind and actually read what I have written! Where have I said that this were not relevant? (What is irrelevant is your and my moral consideration of Muhammad's deeds.) I have asked for an explanation on what this means - no more and no less. Please do so now or do research to find out. In which way were the BQ inferior to the BN, who originated this and how etc. And please, no mere repitition of what you have already written but so that we all may understand. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 16:19, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is what serjeant says:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The person who made the pact (~ti~ib 'a.qd) and treaty on behalf of Banii Qurayzah was the chief Ka'b b. Asad. Qurayzah disliked the coming of Meccan Quraysh and their tribal allies; they were at peace with the Prophet (silm-un li-'l-nabiyy) ,87 and on good terms with the Muslims who even borrowed implements from them to dig the Trench to defend Yathrib. It looks as if Muhammad had established friendship with Qurayzah by backing them up against the Banii Nadir with whom they seem to have been on bad terms. Qurayzah was of inferior status to the Banii Nadir since the blood-money for a man of Qurayzahwas only half the full blood-money payable for the slaying of a man of Banii Nadir. Muhammad raised the assessment of Quray~ah to the full amount of blood-money.88</p>

<li>"According to the <i><a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a></i> collection, the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a>, this was the second time the Qurayza had broken the peace treaty and allied with the Banu Nadir against the Muslims; the first time, Banu Qurayza suffered no loss and were allowed to stay in Medina" - if this refers to the events that led to the Nadir's exile it should be covered there, with the necessary disclaimers to keep it NPOV. We want to report facts and not justifications for the massacre like "the Prophet forgave them the first time". This is the imoression created if this is narrated here.</li>

<dd>In response to your last post, relating Serjeant's quote:</dd>
<dd>The quote is in really bad English - please check whether the transcript is accurate.</dd>
<dd>However, I still can understand what he is saying.</dd>
<dd>There is a contradiction between Serjeant's statement that BQ and BN were on bad terms and M support the former and the Hadith referred which claims that BQ shared in the BN's treason. Which one is it. My nose tells me that the former is correct and that the latter is merely slander but I cannot tell. We can include both with side by side while stating the contradiction. I will post a wording including this, as the relationship of the BQ to the BN is definitely relevant and makes the BN passage much more topical as well.</dd>

<dd>I am not going to rationalize any of the sources again. But F.Y.I. both of your assessments are right. Muhammad initially supported B.Q. to have a political ally (most probably), but when B.N. would have told B.Q. that they can defeat Muslims by joining with Meccans, they could take over Muslims easily.

<dd>Such a detail is surely should be discussed here. There is certainly controversy over that and it should be discussed.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't care whether they were discussed elsewhere. I have not the entire M discussion page in mind. Anyway, I brought some order into this, retaining the content you added. Here are my changes:
<ul>
<li>I consistently separated scholarly analysis (Watt, Scholler, Stillmann) from the narration according to the various sources. Therefore I moved the Watt etc. bit down and and the the conclusion of the siege up. For the same reason I moved the the bit about the surviving boys up and the "minority of scholars" down (they are dealing with the massacre account, not with the siege).</li>
<li>I placed the M. became suspicious bit after the passage dealing with the negotiations, as there were first negotiations, then M's suspicion. Also, the suspicion is a good bridge to the scholarly analysis of the actuality of the treason.</li>
<li>I integrated the scholars into the flow and simplified the bit from Watt. We really do not need to report any variation on what he says here or there ("almost certainly" vs. "probably")</li>
<li>Nasr was lost due to the edit conflict (as you didn't heed my advice). However, I don't think he is needed (he merely tells us what Watt has already told us and he gives no analysis) - also he have already quoted several specialist encyclopediae, so we don't need the Britannica.</li>

<p>Aminz, are you trying to be disruptive? Before you add something could please have a look whether it is alreay included somewhere? Or is that too much to ask for. The Watt view you included in early history is almost verbatim already mentioned in the section "arrival of pagan tribes", where it belongs chronologically. Please, be more careful. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 17:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is POV. "Nearly all of the tribe's men, apart from a few who converted to Islam, were taken prisoner and then killed at Muhammad's command"</p>
<p>It was Sad who issued the decree. EoI writes: " On this ground, as soon as the besiegers withdrew, Muhammad attacked Qurayza and besieged them in their forts for twenty-five nights. After negotiations they agreed to surrender unconditionally. Sad b. Muadh, chief of the clan of #Abd al-Aê9hal, with whom they had an alliance, was brought to give judgement on them. He decreed that all the men (who numbered between 600 and 900) were to be put to death and all the women and children sold as slaves."</p>
<p>So, I suggest we write: "Sad b. Muadh, chief of the clan of #Abd al-Aê9hal, with whom they had an alliance, was brought to give judgement on them." and he made such a decree. The lead as it is now is certainly POV (see Britannica Encyclopedia quote above). Nobody disputes that Sad made the decree. But according to Encyclopedia Britannica, there is a variety of views, the minimum of which is that Muhammad at least was informed of it. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 17:25, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sad is too obscure a figure to warrant an inclusion in the intro. Also, you ommit that Muhammad did indeed order that they should be killed. He merely yielded the judgement to Sad. After Sad had spoken Muhammad confirmed it, calling it the judgement of God and ordered the execution of the verdict. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 17:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Str, Muhammad didn't issue the decree and he didn't oppose it afterwards. You are adding your own beliefs to the facts. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 18:10, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aminz, while you are edit warring again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad explicitely endorsed the verdict. And he was the main man in what came to be Medina. If he had not wanted the Jews dead they wouldn't have been killed. It is you who are closing your eyes before the facts. Okay, do so. But don't close everybody else's eye.</li>
<li>Sad is certainly not too obscure for this article. That's not what I said. Again you are (very annoyingly) not reading what I said. I said he's too obscure for the intro.</li>

<dl>
<dd>There is no contradiction between Sad issuing a decree and Muhammad issuing the same decree. As Str1977 observes, Muhammad immediately endorsed it and ordered its execution, obliging his followers - not Sad's followers - to carry it out.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 01:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sad was appointed as a judge and it is possible that Muhammad partly didn't want to change his word on appointment of Sa'd.

<dd>Maybe my last attempt on the intro will statisfy you. It does not mention Sad for the reasons given above but also removes the statement that Muhammad commanded the massacre. There is no doubt that he wanted it but the exact details cannot be covered in the intro. I do not know what Hodgson says in his book (and according to your principles, Aminz, it would have to be included even if unsourced and contrafactual) but I will settle for this version now. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 21:38, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hold on a second. If we are including unsourced opinions that Sa'd judged according to the Torah, which is factually absurd, we must also include the scholars who say that Muhammad commanded the slaughter. Here is what Hodgson says: "Muhammad now allowed no ransom but insisted that all the men, about six hundred, be killed."</dd>
<dd>Hodgson is a very well known and respected academic and his work can hardly be considered Islamophobic (if anything, he falls over himself trying to show what a great guy Muhammad was.) As Aminz and others have pointed out, it's irrelevant whether he cites sources or not, the information MUST be included. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 22:48, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm ok with taking the Hodgson ref out if the Farah reference (that Sa'd judged according to how he believed the BQ would have judged the Muslims), which is of far lesser reliability in my opinion, is also removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">contribs</a>) 22:54, 21 December 2006 (UTC).</small>
<dl>
<dd>I totally agree with you on the subject content, as you know.</dd>
<dd>I guess by unsourced you mean "reference to a scholar who gives no sources for his assessment" and not unsourced claim. I could be argued that a work not sourcing its claims is not scholarly (I know of one historian who once refused to have a work of his published without footnotes, terming such an edition "worthless").</dd>
<dd>I am very much in favour of including Hodgson, but I think a detailed treatment is more in order in the main body. Of course, it can be in the intro as well, if it can be worded in a simple way. In any case, I would not accept any wording of the intro that tries to shift the responsibility for these events away from Muhammad. My wording does not do this IMHO.</dd>
<dd>I oppose trading in Hodgson for Farrah, because a) it is trading in gold for lead, and b) because I think it better to retain the Farrah view (as ridiculous as it is) with a proper discussion. The current version makes it clear that it is fringe and supported by a single scholar. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 23:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

How on earth whould you know what BQ viewd on those parts of the Torah? Rememer that unorthodox and deviant variation of both Christianity and Judaism existed in 7th century Arabia, some of those chritians went so unorthodox that they included Maria in the trinity... And also remember that Jews who had extramarital relations were stoned in accordance to the Torah and the constitution who stated that they would follow their own rules. Im not arguing that this <i>must</i> have been the case, that Sad´<i>must</i> have based it on the Torah, but i am stating that it is OR to dissmiss a scholars view that might be possible, and doing so without a single source. You are not a scholar, you are not qualified to dissmiss his views. Find one how is qualified to dissmiss it, or let the reader make their own judgment. The longest you can go is to say that contemporary orthodox scholars do not view those parts as being something to follow, and even that is OR, but to start presuming what BQ belived, that is going to far. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that we cannot a priori assume that the BQ held the same view as Tosefta and Sanhedrin. However, if there is no case made for them holding a different view - and thus far this case has not been made, neither by Farah nor by anyone else - then we must conclude that they did not disagree. Note, our Muslim friends are claiming an affirmative statement in two ways: that there was a "heterodox" view and that the BQ held it. The disputed statement above, labeled OR, is merely a summary of the sources and the scholarship.

<p>Once again, whoever claims "No contemporaneous source says explicitly that Sa'd based his judgment on the Torah." should provide a reliable source for that. Will believe it only when see it myself in a reliable source. Either source this sentence or please remove it. As to the Deut. passage, so far we have a quote from Mainmoind. We can say Mainmoind says X about the relevant verse. If Mainmoind says that all scholars say this about that verse, we can say it and attribute it to Mainmoind.

<p>Some one inserted the false claim that the BQ men were put on trial. They were not. A trial consists of prosecutors and defendants making their case, evidence and witnesses being considered and a verdict given by a judge. Nothing of this kind happened here. Muhammad accused the tribe, besieged them. After they had surrendered, some of the Aws pleaded for leniency and Sad was chosen arbitrator not between Muslims and Jews but between those pleading mercy and those bent on killing the Jews. And even if this had been a trial, a summary trial of an entire tribe can hardly be presented in such a way. Socrates tried to veto a summary trial of half a dozen generals and here we are expected to let it slide for 700 men (most of which had not decided on tribal politics)?

<p>Or complete disregard for the rules of English grammar:</p>

<p>It is also nonsense to write:</p>
<p>"Arrival of Muhammad transformed the political landscape and the longstanding enmity between the Aws and Khazraj tribes was dampened as both embraced Islam and accepted Muhammad's leadership."</p>
<p>Both tribes did not emrace Islam. Some of their members did, increasing numbers and finally all of them (how sincere is another matter). But that was a long process. And the enmity did remain afterwards, as can be seen after Muhammad's death in the question of his succession.

<p><i>Reply:</i> Str1977, That point is already included in the article as Stillman states that. Watt states that the reason Sa'd made such judgment was not because Muhammad knew who to choose. Sa'd being close to death, according to Watt, didn't meant any anger at Banu Qurayza. According to Watt, Sa'd was close to death. He therefore was concerned with his afterlife. As such, he didn't want to prefer tribal values over Islamic ones, since in Sa'd's eyes those values were forgotten. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Stillman and I agree on this. Still, no one claimed that M. put pressure on S. The sources also speak of Sad praying that he would only live long enough to take his revenge. Of course, the massacre of an entire tribe for a arrow wound might seem overkill but that is what he did. The sources also speak of Sad rejecting the pressure put on him by the Aws pleading for for leniency. I agree with what you wrote about Sad's considerations about the afterlife, tribal and Islamic allegiance, but of course I strongly disagree with the Islamic tradition that has Sad immediately enter the gates of paradise. IMHO, the gates he passed led elsewhere. However, unlike so many of the first generation Muslims that were quite easy to talk about others being in hellfire, I leave that judgment to the Lord Sabaoth. However, I have my opinion. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 20:40, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Stillman does not state that Muhammad pressured Sa'd, only that Muhammad had made his decision long before Sa'd's verdict. This is pretty clear from ibn Ishaq's texts, and anyway it makes no sense to pressure a dying man. The current, condensed version of Watt's argument is entirely appropriate; previously, Watt took up half of the paragraph.</li>
<li>Aws reasoning is adequately explained in the article. I'm not sure what Aminz is objecting to.</li>
<li>Britannica is usually not a good unless it is used for some straightforward material. Here, the author of the article makes an unsupported, off-the-wall claim, not found elsewhere. Per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, opinions of a tiny minority do not belong to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>There is no basis for the claim that any expert supports Arafat's reasoning. Aminz seems to argue that someone <i>might</i> agree with Arafat, but there is no evidence of that.</li>
<li>What Esposito thinks on Hebrew prophets or Indian yogas is irrelevant to the topic of Banu Qurayza. This quote only serves to sling some mud at the Jews.</li>

<p>The only evidence we have is that Arafat suggests a theory and we should include that. We don't know if there are others who accept it or not. And Esposito's quote (followed by that of Watt) is important. Banu Qurayza incident wasn't anti-semitism for example. It was a political thing.

<dd>haven't had much time to follow the discussion here, but simply assuming that nobody supports Arafat because you know of no one who does is argumentum ad ignorantiam. another academic would be Barakat Ahmad (who holds a doctorate in Arab history from the American University in Beirut), about whom Leon Nemoy states: "Dr. Ahmad states that he is, to the best of his knowledge, the first Muslim scholar to deal with the Jews of Yathrib in the spirit of 'independant study and research (p. 4).' As far as this reviewer is aware, he is indeed such a pioneer, and it is to be hoped that other Muslim scholars will follow his example." he wrote the book "Muhammad and the Jews: A Re-examination" (which received a number of positive reviews), in which he opines similar to Arafat in his questioning of Ibn Ishaq's narrative, suggesting that it is likely that the leaders were killed, but not the rest. here are some reviews outlining Ahmad's position:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahmad, focusing on the B. Qurayzah, also considers the nature and consequences of the events themselves. He argues first of all that Medina, during the time of Muhammad, was not equipped to execute 600-900 people in one day. He deals with the effect such an act would have had on the performers and spectators in that cultural context. Such a massacre is all the more inconceivable since Ali, the fourth caliph of Islam, whose reputation is one of compassion and honesty, is supposedly one of the main executioners.</p>
</blockquote>
<i>(Harold Kasimow, Journal of the American Academy of Religion,Vol. 50, No. 1 (Mar. 1982), p. 158)</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Leon Nemoy, speaking in generally positive language of the book, says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, Dr. Ahmad concludes, the Prophet has on the whole exercised remarkable restraint in his final solution of his Jewish problem: two of the Jewish tribes were merely expelled, while the alleged wholesale massacre of Banu Qurayzah is, for a number of logical reasons (e.g., the mass execution of the tribe and the burial of some 600 to 900 corpses in a trench dug in the center of a small town like Medina would have been physically a colossal undertaking and would have constituted an obvious menace to public health), highly improbable- very likely only the leaders of the tribe were actually put to death.</p>

<p>The accounts of the Banu Q, are <b>shrouded in mystery</b> according to the very sources provided in this article, quite simply not enough is known about them by <b>any one source</b> for a proper account to be transcribed. When we touch on any topics covered by <b>Islamic historical scribes</b>, there is going to be allot of <b>debate</b>. I propose the only thing we can do is <b>cut back</b> on as much information as possible simply presenting a well formed <b>stub</b>. When one looks at all the conflicting reports from all the diff sources quoted here, we can see they clearly <b>not reliable</b> in the simple meaning of the word. They are mostly <b>contradictory</b> and <b>poorly chronologised</b>. The accounts depicted in the sources provided here, if anyone cares to read them, make no sense at all.

<p>I don't dare edit in this obviously very controversial article on a topic about which I really know nothing but what I read here, but just as a piece of prose:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't agree at all with the tag complaining about too many quotations, but I think that the issues about historians' disagreements are, in some cases, too threaded through the article. The general comments on reliability of the sources more or less contemporary with the events could go in one place, not mixed into the narrative.</li>
<li>There is a sentence fragment: "but gives only eight intermediaries between Aaron and the purported founder of the Qurayza tribe"</li>
<li><i>kahinan</i> is a very odd way to write the plural of "Kohen"; <i>kohanim</i> would be much more normal.</li>
<li>Seems to me that we should not assume that the reader has any idea who Al-Samhudi is, and should say "15th century Sunni scholar Al-Samhudi". Similarly on others who are mentioned: one could easily be confused as to which accounts date from what era. Ibn Ishaq is introduced without so much as a link.</li>
<li>This sentence doesn't parse: "According to William Montgomery Watt, the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and maintained that the Jews retained a measure of political independence." <i>Who</i> "maintained"? I'd presume Watt, but the grammar clearly doesn't allow that.</li>
<li>"The continuing feud was probably the chief cause…": "Probably" is according to whom?</li>
<li>There seems to be no consistency about when the word "Banu" is used before the name of a tribe</li>
<li>There is at least one stray angle bracket.</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect there is more, but as a reader, at about this point, having really read only half the article, my patience was exhausted. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:01, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was a good article once. Between the ardent detractors and just as ardent defenders of Islam, it has degenerated into mush. It is no longer an article, but a battlefield. Optimistic believers in the wiki-way seem to think that, barring a few dips in quality here and there, articles will just get better and better. This article is proof that they're wrong.</dd>
<dd>I've become a wiki pessimist. If there's going to be any stability in the battlefield articles, they have to be closed to edits by newbie editors with strong opinions and no specialist knowledge. Perhaps editors should have to <i>earn</i> the right to edit contentious articles. The more edits an article has logged, the more experience -- or perhaps qualifications? -- should be required of anyone who wants to edit it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:51, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Jmabel and Zora, instead of saying "it's all rubbish, I'm so disgusted at reading it", you can roll your sleeves and edit, just like other editors have done. Jmabel, you could have fixed your objections yourself within five minutes. Zora, I'm afraid you should raise your problems all the way to Jimbo because he envisaged Wikipedia as an encyclopedia that <i>everyone</i> can edit. This article has indeed been turned into a battlefield, and you know very well who is waging the war to push "the Jews deserved it" view into the article. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 08:43, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Do we aim to confuse readers with irrelevant material, so, like our frustrated visitor above, they might walk away without understanding what occurred?

<p>Apart from a few stylistic tweaks</p>
<p>I had to implement some necessary corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very annyoing that some editors do not consider whether the same stuff has been said somewhere else, even some lines futher down or up or even with the same reference. Hence I had to merge the two statements about Sad's conflicting allegiances. I also removed the hagiographic "far-sighted".</li>
<li>I moved the bit about the "disquieting results" up, to its proper chronological place.</li>
<li>Once again I removed the inaccurate and apologetic Esposito bit.</li>
<li>I reinstated the full discussion of the "according to Jewish law" issue. I retained the bit about the command not practised after David, despite certain misgivings: the last time I know of this command being demanded was by the prophet and judge Samuel - in conflict with King Saul. Note this is no matter of time but a question of who the enemy is: Samuel demanded it in case of the Amalekites but in the case of other peoples.</li>

<p>I am looking forward to see the changes you propose. But regarding far-sighted, I think it explains it well. As what explains, if the old allegiances had come before Islamic allegiances, this could have ruined the new hopes they had. That was the place where the conflict happened and the decision was important for the future of the community. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 12:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, "far-sighted" is too lauding a term to be squared with NPOV. Actually, Sad had his eyes set on two things: his afterlife and his revenge. The conflict you, Aminz, are talking about is not a necessarily existing conflict. Sad could have well stayed loyal to Islam and his tribe's alliance. Abdallah ibn Ubay managed to do that. However, Sad could not square his vengeanc with his tribes's loyalty. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 13:04, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many of the changes are very good. I haven't read them all yet. The sentences:"It is reported that as Sa'd was coming to Muhammad's presence, he made a remark to the effect that since he is about to die, he must consider above all doing his duty to God and the Islamic community, even at the expense of former alliances.", it should have support from Ibn Ishaq or other early sources. Maybe we can use that instead. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 12:59, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"consider above all doing his duty to God and the Islamic community" or similar words. "former" alliances BTW is POV. Just because M. and some Muslims think their new religion somehow dispenses them from earlier bonds of family, friendship and alliances doesn't mean that these bonds were factually dissolved. If the non-Muslims of Mecca (be it Abu Jahal or Abu Talib) had thought this way the son of Abdallah wouldn't have made it very far. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 13:48, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please do not re-add this stuff on "disquieting" results. "Disquieting" is by definition POV; in this case, it's Muhammad's POV. Furthermore, Watt refers to a minor episode in which Muhammad sent a representative to enquire whether the Qurayza had negotiated with the Meccans. If they had indeed negotiated, the representative was supposed to give Muhammad a secret sign. These are irrelevant minutiae; ibn Ishaq's account of the negotiations is already discussed at length. Also, please refrain from re-adding these "opinions of scholars". Essentially, they just rehash the same story of negotiations as told by ibn Ishaq and have no encyclopedic value. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 13:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aminz, are you talking about "additions" or "editions" or "edits"? I think this constant carelessness (on talk and in articles) disrespectful to others and unhelpful to WP.</dd>
<dd>This "tactful" passage is highly problematic as it assumes that there was a problem. We don't want to word this in a anti-Muhammad way (and we very well could) but neither should we lapse into laudatory phrases.</dd>
<dd>And we have the bloating and duplication of the "Sad put the Umma before the clan" issue. We need to include this ONCE and in a NPOV fashion.</dd>
<dd>Whether we should really include speculations, even if referenced to Watt, is also a contentious subject. Certainly it should be discussed beforehand.</dd>

<dd>Both are ungrammatical, and needlessly confused: The Qurayza not committing any overtly hostile act is the mere lack of action, and need not be mentioned. The only pith here is that Watt speculates that they were negotiating with the Meccans, and that's all that must be stated. The "although...overt" clause suggests that there is something sinister in the mere fact of negotiating, which is only true from Muhammad's anti-Meccan POV.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 08:09, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. I don't mind including M's perception if it is clear that is his subjective perception and not objective fact.</dd>

<dd>3. "come into M's presence" is an akward (possibly hagiographic) wording, "made a remark to the effect" is circumstantial. Most of all, the information is already included. Don't duplicate information, this is no hadith collection.</dd>
<dd>4. "The motivation for Muhammad's actions was political rather than racial or theological." is a factual statement though this matter could indeed be contentious. Esposito's claim, though referenced, is entirely false (massacre was foreign to Arab customs), partly off topic (Hebrew prophets are of no consequence 2000 years later in another country), and even nonsensical (massacre is mass killing - treason is a crime committed by certain individuals - it is not uncommon or barbaric, even in our day, to kill traitors via the death penalty, but are you saying that every member of the Qurayza was engaged in treason? Furthermore, there was no form of trial, hence massacre is correct. The correct analogy would not be "massacre of traitors" but "massacre of a vanquished foe", but again this was uncommon in Arabia before "Muhammad (saw)" introduced it.</dd>
<dd>5. What actually is the purpose of the fifth item? Apologetics? If so, against whom? At least it should be attributed to someone stating that at the time.</dd>

<dd>"Sa'd dismissed the pleas of the Aws, according to William Montgomery Watt, because he put what he considered "his duty to God and the "Muslim community" before tribal allegiance."</dd>
<dd>Why isn't that enough.</dd>
<dd>As for "he didn't want to take revenge because of being wounded" - regardless of whether Watt actually say this (I can't see where, certainly not in our much discussed quotes), the sources explicitely say that he wanted to take revenge and asked God to live long enough to achieve it. Oh, Lord have mercy on his soul. Also, again you speak of "former alliances", which is pushing the Islamic POV that Islam has voided older ties. Many Aws obviously thought differently.

<dd>There are actually two issues involved here, corresponding to the two sentences: M's motivation, and the claim that masssacres was common.</dd>
<dd>I think the former statement is correct, BUT it is a defense against a criticism never made, and actually itself based on fallacy: that a massacre for political reasons is somehow better. The reasoning goes like this: someone says M killed Jews and that this is anti-semitism. This creates shock because anti-semitism is commonly today considered the pinnacle of abomination. Then M is defended against this charge either by the silly reply that Arab as Semites too (when Anti-Semitism was never about Semites but about Jews) or by the above, that M had no "racial" reasons to kill the Jews (correct) or no theological reasons (partly correct). However, so far this doesn't get into this pseudo-ethical debate and we needn't present one side without the other.</dd>
<dd>As for the latter statement, it is factually inaccurate: massacres (for whatever reason) were not common practice in Arabia. What information is Esposito's claim based on, I wonder? As for the Hebrew prophets, the claim is not actually false (there were some prophets that did kill enemies - Moses, Samuel, Elijah - but that makes it hardly common, when one browses through the list of prophets) but also completely irrelevant: Maleachi, usually considered the last of prophets, lived 400 BC or, in other words, 1000 years before Muhammad's time (and for Elijah, who was involved in killings, you can add another 300 years). How is this supposed to be relevant for Muhammad's time (and place)? Not at all - Esposito's claim is rather a common rhetorical ploy, the critics are equated with Christians or Jews who supposedly can be shut up by the claim: your people did the same! Well, the claim is still inaccurate and irrelevant, it does not actually counter any criticism, and is essiantly a fallacious ad hominem argument. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 08:42, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For the first one:I see what you're saying. However, when one reads the article, anti-semitism is bound to enter one's mind. In any case I'll keep this quote in mind as I'm editing <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_antisemitism.html" title="Islam and antisemitism">islam and antisemitism</a>.</dd>
<dd>For the second part, if something is sourced to a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">scholar</a>, then we don't need to worry about factuality. Second question is about relevency. The part about Arab customs is <i>definetly</i> relevent (how can it not be relevent?). I think it is relevent considering that modern Muslim scholars argue that the judgement was in accordance to Jewish Law, because the tribe was Jewish. But once again this argument is more of a counter-argumett against a possible charge of cruelty, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a>, or something else.

<dd>For the second part: nonsense and intellectual laziness. Are we supposed to include David Irving's view (expect as a fringe view) in the Holocaust article? After all, he is a scholar and hence your reasonings forbids us to even consider the content. The harm is that this is used to smother any possible misgiving anyone might have about this cruel event - and it remains cruel no matter how you put it. The Jewish law bit is not the topic of this subsection but if I may use it as an example: we do not put the absurd view that the punishment was in line with the Torah in the article as the definite and universal explanation of the massacre. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 08:31, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Number 5</b> Watt says: "It is clear that those of Muhammad's actions which are disapproved by the modern West were not the object of the moral criticism of his contemporaries. They criticized some of his acts, but their motives were superstitious prejudice or fear of the consequences... If they were amazed at the mass execution of the Jews of the clan of Qurayzah, it was at the number and danger of the blood-feuds incurred."</p>
<p>In Cambridge History of Islam, Watt writes that in Arab eyes, the massacre "wasn't barbarous but a mark of strength, since it showed that the Muslims were not afraid of blood reprisals."</p>
<p>Its purpose is to show that according to Watt "His contemporaries did not find him morally defective in any way." --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:36, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Scholars of course do have moral views too but in the case of historians (we are not talking about ethicists or moral theologians here) that is not part of their scholarship (though it might - or sometimes must - be included in their works) - history does not want to issue judgement but to elucidate and explain what actually or essentially happened (Ranke).</dd>
<dd>A Moral Evaluations section, if we were ever to create one, would have to begin with an outright condemnation of the massacre, as this is what Watt and Esposito respond to.</dd>
<dd>However, what they write is plainly inaccurate. Massacres were not the common thing in pre-Islamic Arabia. And as for Arabs not regarding such things as barbaric? Well, what about the criticism of Muhammad in Jathrib? If I am not mistaken, this partly consisted of protests against M's new practice of assassination orders. So saying that Arabs thought M. spotless and therefore had no problems with the massacres is misrepresentation of reality. Of course, once a few people have been murdered for speaking up, protests will die down. Also note, that the more people converted to Islam, they could not possible issue such criticism. And thirdly, if anyone spoke up, why should our sources include this? Why should say Ibn Ishaq contain a balanced discussion of M's moral character (I am not blaming him for this but we shouldn't expect this either.) So Watt's "were not the object of the moral criticism of his contemporaries" is just plainly false and even self-contradictory when he then goes on to say "They criticized some of his acts ..." What is it now, Mr Watt? It is cheeky to call the basis for all criticism "superstitious prejudice or fear of the consequences", unless one calls the idea that murder is bad a superstition too (and I don't think that in Watt's day people - himself included - were that deranged in general).</dd>
<dd>On "barbarous" vs. "mark of strength", I see no need for any contradiction. I guess that it was seen as a mark of strength, but still it was barbarous as well. So the "mark of strenght" part bit I think can be included, since blood feud was an important factor (after all, it saved M. in Mecca).</dd>
<dd>Finally, Aminz, thanks for your statement <i>Its purpose is to show that according to Watt "His contemporaries did not find him morally defective in any way."</i> Thanks for your open admission of what you are trying to bring across in the article (even if it's defintely flawed). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 10:45, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Aminz, well, I alluded to the examples of contemporaries that stated their opinion about his moral defects - Not counting those that did not speak up. Do you think Abu Sufyan thought Muhammad a model of morality after he had under the threat of force accepted M. as a prophet - an act with the tacit approval of M. himself?</dd>
<dd>Come to think of it, your quote may refer to strictly personal morality, e.g. his not sleeping around, his truthfulness in business matters - if it is that, you and Watt may have a point - but only that. We cannot use that for a justification of the massacre.</dd>
<dd>"And we can start the section with a criticism." But you don't do it. You never do it. You never post anything that could possibly put Mr M in a negative light and you are going to great length to put him in the most positive light imaginable.</dd>
<dd>And finally, I don't think you are really interested in this, as you are immediately narrowing down what you will accept: I agree that, depending on the topic, a scholar must be serious (note however, that for criticism you do not have to be a scholar at all, let alone reliable - you just have to be notable) but there is nothing that absolutely demands his being recent. And, are talking about "reliable" all the while defending the inclusion of Esposito, long bereft of credibility? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 08:05, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"His contemporaries didn't find him morally defective in any way." So, why did the Quraysh prefer him out of Mecca? The members of his own tribe were shocked and enraged when Muhammad executed several prisoners of was after the Battle of Badr and threw the bodies of the dead into a well. "Contemporaries" apparently includes Jews; if Watt wants us to believe that the Jews did not find Muhammad in any way morally defective, then this claim alone is a big black mark on his credibility. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 08:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I said above, I am more and more convinced that Watt referred to M's personal morality.

<dd>First of all, I think we don't know we can too quickly judge about the moral standards of people back then. Please see the following quote from <i>William Sanford LaSor, Old Testament Survey: The Message, Form, and Background of the Old Testament, 2nd ed., (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1982), 147-48.</i> about Joshua's conquest(I am adding the whole quote since it might be useful in other articles):</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>“The suggestion that God could command anyone to kill another or require the complete extermination of every living being in a city seems offensive or outrageous. To dodge the problem some have proposed that the God (Yahweh) of the Old Testament cannot be the same as the Father of jesus Christ of the New Testament. This, of course, runs counter to the teachings of Christ and the apostles, who clearly identify their God with the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and with the God who revealed himself to Moses and the prophets.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>“A partial answer to this puzzle is the fact that religious “devotion” was a part of the culture of the day. Ancient Near Eastern people’s “devoted” persons and possessions and captives to their gods. That such action was customary does not, of course, make it right, '<b>but it does help explain why the Israelites did not think it necessarily wrong.</b> God takes the people where they are, and leads them step by step until at last they will be where God is. Divine revelation is progressive. At this point, the Israelites did not have as their Torah the Sermon on the Mount (“love your enemies”). This understanding of love had to wait for the New Joshua (Jesus) to make it known in his life and death.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>“But this is not the whole answer. The biblical position regarding the Canaanites is not simply “Exterminate them!” There is good reason behind the command. In Yahweh’s eyes, the Canaanites with their culture and religion were exceedingly evil sinners, who not only committed abominations against God but also sought to entice Israel to join them in these “religious” acts. The discovery of Ugaritic documents at Ras Shamra in Syria has opened up detailed information about Canaanite religious practices. Religious prostitution, child sacrifice, and other features of this religion plagued Israel for centuries, as the books of Kings and of the early prophets bear witness. Yahweh, the Israelites were often reminded, is holy, a God who does not tolerate such abominable practices, especially in the name of serving a deity. This was idolatry against both creation and Creator. The Canaanites merited punishment. Further, the purity of Israelite religion had to be preserved.”</p>

<dd>Str, Re:"Well, what about the criticism of Muhammad in Jathrib? If I am not mistaken, this partly consisted of protests against M's new practice of assassination orders. So saying that Arabs thought M. spotless and therefore had no problems with the massacres is misrepresentation of reality.", I haven't studied these parts of Muhammad's life from reliable sources nor have I checked with their historicity. In Mecca, Abu Sufyan opposed Muhammad who was preaching against many social evils. I don't see Abu Sufyan as a good reference for moral judgments. I haven't done any significant research on any other above-mentioned instances. I don't know how people viewed killing others back then. I know they some were killing their daughters finding girls shameful and useless back then. I don't think Watt writes something unreasonable either. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 04:24, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Aminz, the ritual invocation of Joshua whenever a Muslim atrocity is discussed will not help your argument. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 10:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that invoking Joshua is not relevant here. We have discussed the "Torah punishment" issue elswhere. Joshua is not relevant to how M was perceived by his contempories (that really didn't care that much for Joshua).</dd>
<dd>As for your last paragraph, Aminz, Abu Sufyan I presented only as a last example. Your perception of him is wrong: he was not the main opponent of M. (whose preaching is only inadequately summed up with "preaching against many social evils") in Mecca but only after the Hijra and most leading Quraish had been killed during or after the battle of Badr. His own moral qualities do not preclude him from being a good reference for moral judgements (which I didn't do). Finally, you will not be able to deny that Abu Sufyan was coerced by Umar to acknowledge M as a prophet (after he had already voluntarily conceded that there was no god but God but expressed his doubt towards M's prophethood) and that the present M did nothing to stop this. You as a Shiite will know what came from this act of forced conversion: your "friend" the Caliph Muawiya.</dd>
<dd>The people assassinated were al-Harith b. Suwayd b. Samit, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_%27Afak_ea84.html" title="Abu 'Afak">Abu 'Afak</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/m/Asma_bint_Marwan_4557.html" title="Asma bint Marwan">Asma bint Marwan</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/27/Ka%27b_ibn_al-Ashraf_90d8.html" title="Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf">Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf</a>.</dd>
<dd>And Aminz, you might not yet have realized it, but pointing out faults in others is not a valid argument to defend someone. But this is not actually the issue here: the issue is whether any contemporary found any fault in M. Your usage and interpretation of Watt denies that in face of the fact that various people (rightly or wrongly) did find fault in M. And that is the problem: you are not prepared to even acknowledge criticism. I hope you will never follow the example your prophet gave in the cases cited. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 09:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maududi is a very well-known and influential Islamic scholar.

<dd>I concur with the removal. Regardless of whether Mawdudi is reliable (and I have my doubt about this), this information is clearly included to somehow put the blame on the Jews. However, the chain of thought is illogical: Jews might be blamed for contacts with the enemy, thereby violating the treaty (we have discussed this numerous times and covered it in the article), but not for piling up arms. There was nothing that banned the BQ from having arms. How where they supposed to contribute to the defense of Yathrib without any arms. So, the claim is clearly ridiculous, even if it were accurate. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 08:37, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, part of the problem is that Mawdudi is not actuall facts, at least in a reliable way. Add to that that this is really a detail that adds nothing substantial we can leave it out. Unless, the intention is to blame the Jews after all. It is always Muhammad and Islam that are blamed for things? Maybe on certain websites but not around here. Here and also in the spheres of Watt we are practically bending over backwards to provide all possible explanations for why Mr M did this and that. It is not us that make him look bad but his actions when confronted with modern sensitivities. As for always blaming: blaming everything on outsiders is unfortunately a trademark of many people in many countries in the Middle East. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 18:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And how does Mawdudi add anything to the treatment of the battle. The Muslims besieged the BQ, in the end the latter surrendered. I know of no battle where we tell about the remaining weapons the vanquished side still had at the moment of its surrender (unless when the possession of weapons is given as a reason for the war as in the last Iraq war 2003).

<dd>The number of weapons helps us have an idea of the military strength of the Banu Qurayza. We also know whether the Banu Qurayza were a military threat to Muhammad or not.

<dd>This is not the same as enjoying respect as an academic historian.

<dd>BlessSins brought up an article on Pakistani arms. Well, if you can gather enough material you can write an article on Banu Qurayza armament. Or Early Muslim armament?

<dd>No, BS, I am not saying "that what Maududi is saying is obviously true" but that the BQ obviously had weapons. However, Maududi also claims that they were intending to use them to help the Quraish - a speculation which no one has the possibility of knowing. So Madudi consists of a problematic, unsourced claim and a truism, neither of which need to be included. If we want to include Madudi's problematic claim than certainly not in the narration of the events.</dd>
<dd>"(E)very truth about Muhammad isn't necessarily in Ibn Ishaq etc." but a) he is the earliest source, and b) we would like to know from which source Maududi takes his information. Is this too much to ask for?</dd>
<dd>Is Maududi a historian? Or is he a Islamic theologian? Where is he nottable? And please, use the English language when you describe him - no tafsirs please.</dd>
<dd>You ahve provided nothing comparable to this situation here. I already asked you to create an article on weaopons of the Banu Qurayza.

<dd>I'm sorry, but your usage of the word "knowledge" is in no way warranted. We do not "know" what happened at that place and time. All we have are certain sources, mostly it's Ibn Ishaq and some other early Muslim historians, like Tabari. Ibn Ishaq is the accepted Muslim biography of Muhammad and his narrative is broadly accepted by historians. Citing Ibn Ishaq is thus usually safe as far as NPOV is concerned unless some historians do not accept the historicity of a certain event; in this case, the disagreement is noted. However, even among Muslims, Maududi does not have nearly as high standing as Ibn Ishaq. Therefore, any editor who wants to include something sourced to Maududi must bring proofs that Maududi is at least not alone in his views. Otherwise, this is a tiny minority view that does not belong to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 14:57, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We don't know anything if you put it like that. Did the Crusades really happen? Certainly there is evidence that suggests that, but what is the proof that establishes thier existence beyond doubt? This is a whole different argument. Our job is not to determine the truth but the verifiability, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>.</dd>
<dd>On a more relevent note, <i>Maududi has a very high standing, maybe not as high as Ishaq, but still very high</i>. You will find it difficult (if not impossible) to prove this wrong. Secondly, does Ishaq actually contradict Maududi?? If he does, then I agree that the view would not be mainstream. But realize that Ishaq is not the only source, not even the most authentic one, on Muhammad. <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunan_al-Tirmidhi_849d.html" title="Sunan al-Tirmidhi">Sunan al-Tirmidhi</a> and the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_major_Hadith_collections_13e6.html" title="Six major Hadith collections">Sahih hadith</a> are also very authentic sources though they weren't written by Ishaq, Hisham etc. Finally, Maududi is not "minority". He is often quoted by Muslim, and Western scholars alike on the topic of Islam, and his works are famous throughout the Muslim world (not just in Indian subcontinent). Infact, I don't know of a scholar more influential than him in the 20th century.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 23:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I must admonish Beit Or not to sidetrack the issue. It is not about "can we know something" but about "what do the sources say?" The situation is difficult in regard to early Islamic history as the earliest sources are from the 8th century (excepting the Quran) but still these sources do count. In our case: if Maududi is the source and noone else, his claim has no basis at all and shouldn't even be included anywhere. If he is basing himself on an actual source, bring it on.</dd>
<dd>The history of Muhammad might be important to Islam but being a scholar of Islam (and it is debatable whether Maududi is that) does not make one a historian. Maududi has absolutely no expertise on these events.</dd>
<dd>Finally, if <b>One can't be a scholar of Islam without having sufficient knowlege of the life of Muhammad</b>, why do Muslims object to the term Muhammedan? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 00:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

We should put this discussion on hold until someone can tell us what Mawdudi actually says, and where he says he got it from.

<dl>
<dd>There might be a reference section at the end of the chapter(?). In any case, it is highly unlikely that an scholar like Maududi has forged this himself. He might be refering to one of the thousands traditions in some collection recorded after the Ibn Hisham's biography etc etc. Hence the reliability of the tradition might be controversial but apparently Maududi accepts it. So, we should attribute it to himself. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 19:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>BS, finally you come across with the long sought for information. This is enough to settle the matter. Maudidi has no footnote or reference for his claim. Hence it is completely worthless. He might be a scholar but this is not scholarship if it is not referenced (as he is not able to have witnessed it himself.)</dd>
<dd>Also, I remove your audacious form for the "Main Argument against Maudidi". Both BeitOr, Pro and I have already stated ad nauseum our objections. You yourself have now given evidence to the nature of the claim.</dd>

<dd>Material on wikipedia should be verifiable not necessarily true. As I said before Maududi says that and we say Maududi says that. Maududi has all the credentials to qualify as a notable Muslim scholar. Maududi doesn't follow the style of referencing. This doesn't mean he doesn't have any source. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 19:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is probably the most abused sentence on WP: "WP is about verifiability, not truth". This means we can put side by side conflicting views verifiable from reliable sources without having to decide what is true. It certainly does not mean that we can put up lies (and yes, by now I believe Madudi to be liar) or that our ultimate goal is not truth. Maududi has all the credentials to make up a desktop thug (onyl read his article) an I pray that God will have mercy on him (and me). But even for him, standards of scholarly writing matter: either he conforms to them or he doesn't, in which case his books are not scholarly, certainly not as it pertains to history (a field he has zippo qualifications in anyway). Aminz, I would ask you to reconsider whether you really want to uphold this your statement and sacrifice your intellectual honesty just for the sake of blackening the BQ? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 22:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Source criticism is used on his work to use him. Maududi lived in the 20th century and could have used modern methodologically and academical style. He hasn't. His claim is worthless. Stop pestering us. BTW, where is the usual call for RS from certain editors? Editors inimical too Islam will next be able to use vast material to push their POV thanks to this reasoning (if it stood, that is). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 21:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bless sins, "laugh out loud" is far past cliché, but that argument literally made me do exactly that. How did Maududi learn this fact, through commune with the dead? That would make him a primary source, wouldn't it? First you equate Maududi with Ibn Ishaq, a primary source, then you state that it's superior because it's a secondary source; ergo sources fabricated of whole cloth today are the best sources of all, combining as they do the virtues of both primary and secondary sources.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 21:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't iknow if you are unable to read my comments properly, or you are doing this deliberately. But clearly, you are accusing me something I didn't say. Maududi is <i>not</i> a primary source, but a secondary one. A primary source would be the Sahih Hadith, Quran, Ibn Ishaq etc. I said wikipedia encourages us to use secondary sources, and thus we should use Maududi, Watt etc. instead of hadith, Ibn Ishaq etc.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 22:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bless sins, when you wrote, "Niether does Ibn Ishaq, Hisham etc." you equated Maududi with a primary source in this regard. Ibn Ishaq could not cite his sources because there <i>were</i> no other sources. Secondary sources are supposed to critically evaluate and draw inferences from primary sources, not make up their own material (down to the number and type of weapon.) Maudidi is <i>not</i> a historian and has even less business doing this than would Watt.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 22:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely. Either Maududi is a primary source about the event (but he is too young for that) or he produces scholarly historiography for that event (but he doesn't cite sources) or he is plain worthless. I don't know either whether BS is doing this deliberately or whether either his admiration for that man or his hatred for Jews so is so great that he cannot order his thoughts any more.

<p>Pls. make your arguments against the scholarship of Maududi in the field of events directly related to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, (in this case: the Siege and execution of the Banu Qurayza). Please make clear and concise arguments, and <b>cite the relevent wikipedia policy</b> to support your arguments.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 20:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>1. Maududi may be a scholar on the Islamic religion (may, as even that is not undisputed), but he is not a historian. He makes his claim without providing any reference where he got it from (as per admission of BS), hence it is just as worthless as me making up any claim about that or any other event. Maududi, as a man of the 20th century, must be measured on 20th century standards in regard to scholarly writing. He cannot be compared with a primary source like Ibn Ishaq. Also, Maududi is known as havin been involved in incititing violence, hence any claim uttered by him against a group must be treated with extra care. As for the substance of his claim, it serves not real purpose in the article and is only intended to blame the Jews and condone Muhammad, even though it even fails in that as everyone knows that the Qurayza had weapons and as there was nothing illegal about it. The intended purposed (help the Quraish) is pure speculation on Maududi's part, even more so since he does not cite a source. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 22:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BS, you might not have noticed but you are not the ruler of this page and are in no position to order around fellow Wikipedians. Despite the fact that the case against Maududi was already well stated many times you put up this form above. I initially objected to replying at all but then changed my mind and provided one last explanation, stating everything clearly. However, you keep on pestering and pestering, issueing orders and demands. Stop it.</dd>

<p>Bless is insisting on me stating the obvious, citing from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (quotes will be in bold).</p>
<p>First the question: is Maududi's work cited here a piece of scholarship or is it a non-scholarly book (which is not the same as asking whether Maududi is a scholar)?</p>
<p>Let's assume it is scholarship and look at point 2.1:</p>
<p>Does Maududi's claim - that the Jews wanted to uses these weapons to help the Quraish. Not wether they had weapons (a triviality) or how many those where (dealt with other references) - conform with <b>"The material has been thoroughly vetted by the scholarly community. This means published in peer-reviewed sources, and reviewed and judged acceptable scholarship by the academic journals."</b>?</p>
<p>Also, take note of the following sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>In articles on religions and religious practices, religious scholars (recognized authorities on the religion) are considered reliable sources for the religion's practices and beliefs, and traditional religious and academic views of religious practices should generally both be cited and attributed as such when they differ.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>It says that such scholars (scholars on a religion, not scholars espousing a religion) are RS <b>for the religion's pratices and beliefs</b> and NOT for details of history.</p>
<p>But maybe M's writing is not scholarship (either because he is not a scholar or because he steps outside his field).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Attributability—The more we know about the originator, either organisation or individual, of source material, the better. This helps us measure the authority of the content.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, we know some unpleasant things about Maududi. See his article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Expertise of the originator about the subject—An academic expert in one subject is more reliable when writing about that subject than when writing about another. For example, a biologist is more reliable when writing about biology than when writing about nuclear physics.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>And an Islam scholar is more reliable when writing about Islam (see the definition above) than when writing about history.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bias of the originator about the subject—If an author has some reason to be biased, or admits to being biased, this should be taken into account when reporting his or her opinion. This is not to say that the material is not worthy of inclusion, but please take a look at our policy on Neutral point of view.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, would we say Maududi has a bias against groups divergent from Islam? Read his article.</p>
<p>And now look at this gem:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Declaration of sources—A source which is explicit about the data from which it derives its conclusions is more reliable than one which does not. Ideally, a source should describe the collection process and analysis method.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note, this is included under non-scholarly because citing your souces is a must for scholarly writing. For non-scholars it is a bonus.</p>
<p>This also solves our question above: Maududi's writing - on this point at least - is not scholarly. He does not cite his sources and hence cannot be considered reliable on this.</p>
<p>One last bit, unrelated to the RS issue: if other sources relate that the BQ had so and so much weapons (which they apparently do) and we include this, there is no need for Maududi's problematic claim. The other half of the claims (what the Jews intended to do with these arms) is nothing more than a restatement of the overall accusation of treachery, will is fairly well covered in the article already. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 19:32, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>this analysis consists of mainly an appeal to WP:RS (and some irrelevant ad hominem); yet, as i'm sure Beit Or will tell you, RS is merely a guideline, the general principle of which is to be followed. it is certainly not to be enforced in the way policies are, and plenty of editors believe that certain specifications need ironing out for it ever to become policy, which isn't remotely likely in the near future. regardless, WP:RS is irrelevant here: Mubarakpuri/Maududi are established Islamic scholars, and their opinions (in representation of Muslim/Islamic POV) are worthy of note where appropriate, as i have mentioned below. what cannot be ignored is WP:NPOV, and there should be no problem with including a few words about how Islamic scholars assess the existence of this cache. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can hardly think of anything to add to Str1977's excellent analysis of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as it applies to Maududi's claim. Itaqallah, I agree with you that there is not a problem with "including a few words about how Islamic scholars assess the existence of this cache." <i>Islamic scholars</i> is a <i>notable</i> class if not reliable - that is, they are not reliable sourcse for findings of historical fact, but their views are inherently topical and informative in the context of Islam-related articles. However, I've see no indication that Maududi's view represents any widespread belief or well-established tradition, or even a major issue for Maududi himself. The belief that the Banu Qurayza were conspiring with Mecca against Muhammad is very widespread, and is made quite clear in the article, starting with the third sentence. That is not, however, equivalent to the seized weapons being intended to aid the Quraysh.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 09:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<b>1.</b> <i>Is Maududi's work cited here a piece of scholarship or is it a non-scholarly book (which is not the same as asking whether Maududi is a scholar)?</i></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Firstly, if Maududi is a scholar, then it generally (though not always) follows that his work is reliable. Wikipedia puts in emphasis on the scholarship of the author.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[6]</a></sup> I will be answering this question in more detail below.</p>
<p><b>1.1</b> <i>The material has been thoroughly vetted by the scholarly community. This means published in peer-reviewed sources, and reviewed and judged acceptable scholarship by the academic journals.</i></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Many other scholars have read Maududi's work and deemed it acceptable. One <a href="../../../t/o/w/Towards_Understanding_the_Qur%27an_ebfa.html" title="Towards Understanding the Qur'an">translation</a> was made and endorsed by Professor Zafar Ishaq Ansari, the Director General of the Islamic Research Institute and the International Islamic University, Islamabad. Other translations such as that from Muhammad Akbar (the one I own), were published under the supervision of Professor Muhammad Ameen Javaid.</p>
<p>Maududi is also often cited, as searching "maududi quran" with <a href="http://scholar.google.com" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google scholar</a> would show. For example he is cited by a paper published by Islamic Research and Training Institute (of the Islamic Development bank).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[7]</a></sup> A journal considered Maududi's work in question as "Mawdud'i's magnum opus" and further says "Apart from setting the verses/Suras in the circumstances of its time...", <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[8]</a></sup> which is directly related to what we are talking about (the circumstances under which <a href="../../../a/h/z/Ahzab.html" title="Ahzab">Ahzab</a> was revealed).</p>
<p><b>1.2</b> <i>In articles on religions and religious practices, religious scholars (recognized authorities on the religion) are considered reliable sources for the religion's practices and beliefs...It says that such scholars (scholars on a religion, not scholars espousing a religion) are RS for the religion's pratices and beliefs and NOT for details of history.</i></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Notice it says "articles on religions and religious practices". Is this article on religion and religious practices? Also, where does WP say that a "scholar on a religion" is "NOT for details of history."</p>
<p>The Banu Qurayza incident has been reported to us primarily through ibn Ishaq and other medieval Muslim sources. Moreover, the incidents weren't reported historically by Ibn Ishaq, rather they were details to ibn Ishaq's <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sira.html" title="Sira">Sira</a>, which is a religious piece of work. Ibn Ishaq himself wasn't interested in history, rather only Islam. We know about Ibn Ishaq's work primarily through Ibn Hisham and <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Jarir_al-Tabari_70f7.html" title="Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari">Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari</a> an <a href="../../../t/a/f/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">exegetes</a> of the Quran. Thus the story of Banu Qurayza falls in the category of Islam (amongst other categories).</p>
<p><b>2.1</b> <i>Attributability—The more we know about the originator, either organisation or individual, of source material, the better. This helps us measure the authority of the content.</i> Unfortunately, we know some unpleasant things about Maududi. See his article.</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> There are unpleasent aspects of every human's life! No human is free of sin and error. You'll have to be more specific if you want to discredit Maududi. However, this point is totally irrelevent since Maududi is already a scholar. This is shown explicitly on <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_notes_fff8.html#Maududi" title="User:Bless sins/notes">User:Bless_sins/notes#Maududi</a>.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2.2</b> <i>And an Islam scholar is more reliable when writing about Islam (see the definition above) than when writing about history.</i></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Maududi may not be a scholar on Near East history but he definetly is one on Muhammad's life. Consider <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbab_al-nuzul.html" title="Asbab al-nuzul">Asbab al-nuzul</a>, and discipline in <a href="../../../t/a/f/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsir</a>, which is the interpretation of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a>. Thus a scholar who has written a tafsir (such as Maududi) will definetly be an expert in this field. Asbab al-nuzul means "<i>occasions/circumstances of revelation</i>". This studies the life of Muhammad while he was said to have been receiving revelations. The Surah <a href="../../../a/h/z/Ahzab.html" title="Ahzab">Ahzab</a> was revealed to him during and after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ahzab_7fa4.html" title="Battle of Ahzab">Battle of Ahzab</a>, which saw the end of Qurayza. Thus as far as the historical events in Muhammad's life are concerned Maududi is an RS.</p>
<p>By analogy, a scholar on Christianity is an RS on Jesus' life (as it is known).</p>
<p><b>2.3</b> <i>Declaration of sources—A source which is explicit about the data from which it derives its conclusions is more reliable than one which does not. Ideally, a source should describe the collection process and analysis method.</i> Note, this is included under non-scholarly because citing your souces is a must for scholarly writing. For non-scholars it is a bonus. He does not cite his sources and hence cannot be considered reliable on this.</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Again, this criterion is for non-scholars. I doubt wikipedians are about to challenge the way <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawkings_06b5.html" title="Stephen Hawkings">Stephen Hawkings</a> reaches his conclusions in Physics and Mathematics. Infact, any wikipedian doing that will be accused of OR, since Hawkings is world famous expert in his field. Similarly Maududi is a scholar in his field (Islam and Quranic exegesis).</p>
<p>Besides I'm not quoting a fact from Maududi, rather an analysis of the situation. That the Qurayza wanted to use their weapons against Muslims is not a fact - nor is the conclusion made by Donner that Muhammad turned against the Qaynuqa because they were in close contact with Meccan merchants (see <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qaynuqa_294f.html" title="Banu Qaynuqa">Banu Qaynuqa</a> article). Scholars have the right to make analyses and speculations. Challenging such specualtions is OR. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 03:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. "If Maududi is a scholar, then it generally (though not always) follows that his work is reliable." - no, if the scholar writes beyond his expertise.</dd>
<dd>1.1 Which historians have found Maududi's historical scholarship acceptable? Tell me. We are talking about a detail of history here - not about theology or Islamic law or exegesis or whatever. A classification of a opus magnum does say anything if it is beyond the field in question.</dd>
<dd>1.2. No, this article is neither about a religion nor about religious practices. That is the main problem with you and your friends. You treat anything as relevant only in regard to Muhammad and Islam. This article however is about a group of people called Banu Qurayza. A scholar on a religion is per definition not the same as a scholar on history - a person might be both, but they are not identitical. Ibn Ishaq is a primary source, hence we take him as he is and apply our analysis.</dd>
<dd>2.1. If you want me to be more specific: Maududi is one of the fathers of religious intolerance, persecution (and subsequently terrorism) in Pakistan. Sorry, if that hurts, but you asked about it.</dd>
<dd>2.2. I cannot accept his, unless the scholar in question has had training in the methods of the historical craft. Did Maududi. And no, a Christian theologian is no historian either (he might be one, by extra qualifications).</dd>
<dd>2.3. No, this is the criterion for non-scholarly writing. Stephen Hawking might be a great physicists (though in fact, he is terribly overrated) but once he steps beyond his expertise he is just as good as you or me, maybe even worse.</dd>
<dd>You say: "Maududi is a scholar in his field (Islam and Quranic exegesis)" - partly correct: Maududi is a scholar in Islam and Quranic exegesis - but this is not "this field". If he interprets the Quran to say that the BQ stockpiled weapons in order to use them against Muhammad, then says so? Which Sura is this based on? ... I am curious. ....</dd>
<dd>Nothing! Because he is not indulging in exegesis but issues claims about historical facts. His numbers are based in fact, we know that from other writings. His speculation is a logical conclusion given the view we have already covered (BQ were traitors). Still, it is speculation. Worse, a pointless speculation. I see absolutely no reason why we should include this. And no, scholars from another field have no right to have their speculations propagated by Wikipedia.

<dd>i disagree. Maududi and Islamic scholars in general <i>are</i> required to be competent in issues of the life of Muhammad, because it is through the latter that they explain the Qur'an and formulate rulings. i don't see how what Maududi forwards can be dismissed as speculation: it seems a rather logical deduction to me. it is known that the Qurayzans had stockpiles of weapons in their stronghold. it is also known that they planned to backstab Muhammad. that Maududi doesn't cite his source (and there are plenty to cite bar Tabari, Ibn Ishaq et al.) does not mean <i>at all</i> that this rather simple deduction originated with him. there are plenty of academic scholarly works that use citations rather sparsely. besides, we are in no position to dismiss those academic views we believe to be 'speculation.' <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:59, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heck states that upon the defeat of Qurayza the Muslims reportedly seized large numbers of weaponry. Maududi opines that these were to be used against the Muslims. that is certainly plausible, when you have numerous academics like Serjeant stating that the Qurayzans intended to betray Muhammad. furthermore, Islamic scholars (especially <a href="../../../m/u/f/Mufassir.html" title="Mufassir">mufassirs</a>) are required to have competence in the field of early Islamic history (especially if, as mufassirs, they are to engage in implementing <i><a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbab_al-nuzul.html" title="Asbab al-nuzul">asbāb an-nuzūl</a></i> - context of revelation). <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:24, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had thought that the Banu Qurayza were weapons makers and traders. The disputed sentence currently reads, "Upon entering the strongholds of Banu Qurayza, Muslims found that the Banu Qurayza had accumulated stockpiles of arms (1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armor, and 500 shields), which Maududi states, were to aid the Quraysh against Muslims." This suggests that the Muslims were not aware of the "stockpile" or were surprised by its extent, and that there was something surreptitious or nefarious about the Qurayza's "stockpile." That is what Maududi is saying, but does Heck say anything like that?

<dd>A case can be made that "backstabbing" Muhammad was a meritorious thing to do. By that time, he had, among other things, expelled two Jewish tribes and had several people assasinated. There is nothing reprehensible in rebelling against a brutal tyrant. In any case, the discussion whether the Qurayza intended to use their weapons against Muhammad is superfluous. Of course, had the Qurayza decided to join forces with the Meccans against Muhammad, they would have used the weaponry that was at their disposal. The same is true for their able-bodied men, by the way. There no need to state it unless one wants to drive home a certain message to readers. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 21:09, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Proabivouac, i am responding here. it's pretty obvious that he means that the punishment was deserved based upon the Jews' intention to actually use them. moreso as earlier in the narrative, according to Mubarakpuri, Gabriel informs Muhammad of the impending betrayal, and this is the general impression that Mubarakpuri provides throughout the whole narrative. it is reasonable to assume that the amassing of weapons which Mubarakpuri says was a justification for punitive measures, is related to this. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 23:20, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Were it otherwise, we could simply state that Muhammad was God's last prophet, and the Qur'an is the literal word of God; academic historians generally avoid engaging such claims.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>well, it has been shown that Mubarakpuri and Maududi forward this claim (i wouldn't discount the possibility of others doing so either), so i don't see the issue in inserting a sentence attributing a relevant opinion (and a logical deduction) to Islamic scholars. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:28, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Where has this been shown? We know about Maududi (but his work is not scholarly) but we don't even know what Mubarakpuri is (unless there are other forums of communication on this).</dd>
<dd>Citing your sources is required in scholarly writing or else it's worthless. Read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as quote by me above.</dd>
<dd>Also, I don't know how Aminz can talk about an accusation of forgery. What Madudu did was merely stating his "common knowledge" that the BQ were traitors. This is not forgery. But it is not scholarship either, especially when no source is involved. Regarding the number of weapons, now sourced through Heck, is it really the fault of those calling for a reference that the reference was not provided sooner or that MadudI's unscholarly handling of the information seemed to blacken even what turned out to be sourced? Are we now the bad guys because we pushed others to finde a proper source? As for "shameful" or "strange" accusations: there are a couple of (indeed shameful) things I could accuse Maududi of. His scholarship or lack thereof is not an item of top priortiy in this. But these things need not concern us here.</dd>
<dd>In any case, the number of weapons is now sourced through Heck (Pro, do you have any source for the "I had thought that the Banu Qurayza were weapons makers and traders"? It would help including this information in a NPOV way), who actually only illustrates how many weapons were around at the time. What Maudidi adds, that the BQ wanted to help the Quraish with these, is merely a restatment of the overall Muslim view that they planned treason. This is alreay well covered in the article. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 19:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Proabivouac stated that Maududi is a "partisan/religious source". However the relevent section states that we should use such sources "with caution". This is exactly what we are doing when we attribute Maududi's claim to himself and not treat it as fact.

<dd>I agree that this alone is no reason for exclusion, but I see no "caution" in here. Caution does not mean that the view is to be attributed (it is anyway). Madudi's view on this is not scholarly and it adds nothing to our current covergage of the view that the BQ were traitors. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 00:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>some comments:
<ul>
<li>"<i>Where has this been shown?</i>" - see above.</li>
<li>"<i>we don't even know what Mubarakpuri is</i> " -not sure who "we" refers to, but everyone else on this discussion page is well aware of al-Mubarakpuri and his <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sealed_Nectar_22e9.html" title="The Sealed Nectar">popular biography</a> of Muhammad. in case you don't know: he is a trained Islamic scholar who specializes in the sira and primary source verification.</li>
<li>"<i>Citing your sources is required in scholarly writing or else it's worthless</i>" - RS does not state that those works which don't employ citations are unreliable. there are plenty of books from high quality scholarship which don't make frequent use of citations. we still use them, and rightly so. one example would be Watt's 'Muhammad: Prophet and statesman,' same with some of Schimmel's books, Forward's books, and so on. if you frequent scholarly literature, you'll know that citation usage is mixed. citations usually tend to be used far more heavily in journals. as i stated before, we cannot dismiss academic material if they don't cite where and how we want.</li>
<li>i have also explained how and why it is not unusual that mufassirs such as Maududi would discuss matters of early Islamic history. Islamic scholars of all types are required to have competence on the sira; it is a basic requirement. i don't agree that the sentence is already summarized in the rest of the article, nowhere does it express the link Islamic scholars make between the existence of a weapons' cache and its relevance to the wider dispute- which is of course worthy of note. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:03, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Itaq, "see above" is no meaningful reply to my question, but your second item is. So you are talking about This "sealed" writing, which is still not a scholarly source. Citing sources (which doesn't necessarily mean footnotes and stuff, merely "I got it from ..." might suffice) is essential, otherwise it is simply not scholarly. I have already explained this often enough, as well as why the view is already represented. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 01:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>well, pointing you to the above discussion, where we analyse what Mubarakpuri has said, is more than enough to substantiate my point. as for your second point: 1) whether or not it is a scholarly resource is debatable (and we've had plenty of those); 2) regardless, it represents the traditional Muslim account, and the observation which is mirrored by multiple Islamic scholars is worthy of mention. demanding scholars use cites for their every assertion is unreasonable and has no basis in WP policy, and doing such eliminates a large number of <i>scholarly</i> books available, such as the ones i mentioned above. this specific view is represented nowhere in the article, as i have argued previously. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>this is not a matter of negotiations, rather a matter of stockpiling wepons (for which we have an undeniably reliable source). Stating the Muslim view on an event that has to do with the founder of Islam is definetly relevent, if not crucial.

<dd>i see no problem with the sealed nectar as a representation of a substantial POV (i.e. traditional Islamic narrative). this particular and prominent opinion is not covered anywhere in the article. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 23:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am inclined to agree with you, Itaqallah, that Sealed Nectar can be a source for traditional Sunni POV (it is decidely anti-Shi'a.) As history, however, it doesn't approach the primary sources in an appropriately critical manner, and makes no attempt to verify its conclusions with sources outside the Islamic sacred corpus (e.g. no consultation of Byzantine or Sassanid records, archeology, population genetics, etc., even though non-trivial assertions are made about each of these fields.) What is considered authentic or not is entirely predetermined by the POV it is intended to represent. Its primary virtue is to assemble the primary sources into a readable, coherent and ideologically reliable narrative, and is richly deserving of the awards from Muslim groups it has received. I also see no problem citing it in conjunction with primary sources where the material is uncontroversial, as you've suggested (other than the risk that its appearance will be taken as an acknowledgement of its academic virtue.)</dd>
<dd>However, as discussed, it doesn't say anything specific about what the weapons were for, and as it doesn't cite Maududi, there's no basis for construing it in light of Maududi's claim.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 23:39, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>when the whole chapter is read then the quoted passage is clarified somewhat. we can all deduce that their possession of weapons was considered blameworthy according to Mubarakpuri. the reason for this seems rather clear in the context of his discussion (at least to me), as i attempted to explain earlier. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 17:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Str1977: Please don't bring up "freedom of speech". As far as I am concerned if Saudi Arabia doesn't respect complete freedom of speech, neither does China. However, your argument would lead us to conclude that Chinese scholars are somehow not RS, because of their government. This is ridiculous, since Chinese comprise of around 1/6 of all mankind. Wiki doesn't discriminate against universities based on the country they are in. Also, please refrain from making sarcastic comments.

<dl>
<dd>But it is an important factor. If certain institutions publish crappy research (now stating just the principle, not yet applying it) we must take that into account. If a university operates under a government with a certain ideological bent (i.e. a government that endorses and propagates a certain ideology) we must tread carefully. That doesn't mean that all scholars are crappy or that you cannot produce good scholarship but the problem of interference and propaganda persists. Some fields are less prone to that (e.g. computer science, electromechanics etc.) than others and humanities are unfortunately very vulnerable in this regard. The PR of China espoueses Communism and hence works related that ideology can be flawed. The same goes for Saudi-Aurabia and Wahabi Islam. No outright disqualification but caution is required.</dd>
<dd>In any case, where are the scholarly works rigidly citing their sources?</dd>

<dd>the claim that scholars like Mubarakpuri do not critically analyse the primary sources is categorically false.

<dd>if Str finds the arduous process of dispute resolution tantamount to "pestering" by another editor (and this is an uncivil remark he has espoused several times now), then Str should reconsider whether he is defusing or in fact escalating the dispute. Proabivouac, i have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABanu_Qurayza&amp;diff=105439090&amp;oldid=105436936" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABanu_Qurayza&amp;diff=105439090&amp;oldid=105436936" rel="nofollow">explained earlier</a> why i think Mubarakpuri rather clearly expresses the same view as found in Maududi's work. Beit Or, this specific assertion forwarded by Muslim scholars merits inclusion. the general prose simply says that the Banu Qurayza intended to rebel (according to Muslim sources). very few specifics, which should rightly be included, are given from what i can see. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 15:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bless, not only do you ignore my reply - you also ignore my reply pointing out what my ignored reply was. So one last time: you asked me to point out the relevant passages in WP:RS. I have done so, after much "pestering", in the section "Arguments Madudi". After having requested this over and over again, you have chosen to simply ignore it. For this reason I think it futile to meet your requests, especially if they are as irrelevant as your question about "how many sources" (to which I also have already replied by asking you to bring any source you got) as it completely ignores the nature of the sources as well as the nature of the claims and the topicality of them in this article (in other words: are they details of larger issues already covered?) <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 01:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again we are getting lost in the argument. If users would have made use of the templates I provided earlier, there would be no "I know by now that you will ignore my replies" accusations, as all comments woudl be correctly categorized. Anyways, I'll restate my arugment:</p>
<p>Some other users and I are currently trying to add some analysis. What do I mean by "analysis", here's an example.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fact</b>: Muhammad besieged the Banu Qaynuqa.</li>
<li><b>Analysis</b>: Donner says, he did so because the tribe was in close contact with Meccan merchants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, I'm trying to add some analysis, to facts.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fact</b>: By the end of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Ditch_6eb1.html" title="Battle of the Ditch">Battle of the Ditch</a> Banu Qurayza accumulated large numbers of weaponry (x number of swords...).</li>
<li><b>Analysis</b>: Maududi (and others) say that they did so to aid the Quraysh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Donner and Maududi are scholars (though Maududi is by <i>far</i> more noted for his scholarship), who have added their analysis. About sourcing statements. In Donner's case, he bases his analysis on several facts (i.e. Muhammad besieged Qaynuqa, the Qaynuqa was in contact with Quraysh), <i>yet the analysis itself may not be sourced</i>. This is because the source for the speculation may be the scholar him/herself.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is what "speculation" is defined as: "opinion reached on some matter by consideration of that subject". Scholars have every right to speculate and form opinions - wikipedians do not.</p>
<p>The same is with Maududi. He is considered a major (<i>if not the greatest</i>) Islamic thinker/scholar of the 20th century. You know that. Islam <b>by definition</b> includes Muhammad, his life, his actions, his sayings etc. And, ofcourse, no biography or study of Muhammad's life can be complete without mentioning the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Ditch_6eb1.html" title="Battle of the Ditch">Battle of the Ditch</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a>. Then there is Mubarakpuri. Again, acclaimed in the Muslim World for his notorious seera, he is a researcher at the Unviersity of Madina. The University of Madina is more scholarly in the field of Islam than the University of Chicago, where Donner teaches.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 15:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are both wrong. Writing a book from hagiography does not necessarily produce more hagiography, if the sources are dealt with properly. If one wants to write history, that is. If one intends to write hagiography (which is what the Sealed Nectar is about) then it will be just that. Hence, Arrow's remark is neither accurate nor is it complete nonsense.</dd>
<dd>Bless, "If users would have made use of the templates I provided earlier, there would be ..."</dd>
<dd>If everyone just obeyed the commands you issue and fulfill your every wish, we would have no dispute and the article would fully support your POV, probably just copying the Sealed Nectar (that's an exaggeration meant to illustrate, folks, so don't shout "straw man").</dd>
<dd>"... there would be no "I know by now that you will ignore my replies" accusations" - then why didn't you address my long-sought after presentation on RS? Why did you simply ignore it?</dd>
<dd>Also, you call it a "Fact" that "By the end of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Ditch_6eb1.html" title="Battle of the Ditch">Battle of the Ditch</a> Banu Qurayza accumulated large numbers of weaponry (x number of swords...)" - who actually is saying this? Thus far, I have only seen evidence for the BQ being in possession of many weapons when they surrendered, not that they accumulated them at that specific time. This is a specific interpretation (and actually OR, as your cherished writers do not tell us that) and your calling it fact casts doubt on your willingness or ability to distinguish the two. Finally, the view that the BQ meant treason is already included and well covers any aim regarding weapons.</dd>

<dd>1) <i>a lot</i> of scholarly works are based solely upon (the assessment of) Islamic primary sources. that doesn't mean to say they accept everything found in them. Arrow's argument is thus utter nonsense. 2) a number of Muslim scholars opine that the possession of such weapons was blameworthy as they were to be used against the Muslims. we should represent that opinion. the claim that the article already covers general Muslim narrative seems to reflect an attempted shoehorning of Muslim scholarly opinion out of the rest of the article. the sentence is relevant, neutral, precise, accurate, and attributed. there is, therefore, absolutely no reason to be constantly removing it. when the Banu Qurayzans acquired their weaponry is irrelevant. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:01, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bless sing, "though Maududi is by far more noted for his scholarship" - actually, Maududi is famous for his extremist political views.

<p><b>To Proabivouac</b>: I disagree. Maududi is noted for his scholarship. His tafsir of Quran is widely respected. In any case those who criticse him, never do so for inaccuracy, rather that he doesn't agree with their views on maulid etc. Infact his politics has nothing to do with how he views Muhammad or Jews, since there are no major Jewish groups or anything like that in Pakistan (where he was active). In Pakistan 95%+ are Muslims who respect Muhammad just as much as he does, hence I don't see any connection between his political activities and his writing on Muhammad.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 23:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>To Str1977</b>: Please calm down, and respond in a clear and civil manner.</dd>
<dd>"why didn't you address my long-sought..." I have repeatedly asked you to point me to the <i>sepecific</i> comment you are talking of. In your next post, instead of accusing me of "ignoring" you, please point me to your question tha you think I should answer.</dd>
<dd>About the weapons: It is clear that the Banu Qurayza had accumulated x weapons by the end of the Battle, what's there to doubt. This process of accumulation could've preceded the battle, we don't know. But we do know that by the end they had x weapons. This is referenced by numerous (10) sources, check out the post on (14:14, 3 February 2007) by Itaqallah.</dd>
<dd>Finally I don't thiink there is any analysis in the article about Banu Qurayza and the weapons, so we should include this.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 23:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am calm and don't see where my alleged incivility lies.</dd>
<dd>The "sepecific" (sic) comment I am talking about begins with "Bless is insisting on me stating the obvious". This is the last time I will point you to it. Any further claim of ignorance I cannot accept as good faith.</dd>
<dd>About the weapons: it is clear that the BQ had accumulated them by the end of the battle but not they had done all this just now (how dod you supposed they got these weapons during a siege?), just to do what Madudi &amp; co. claim. Since Heck we know that the existence of the weapons is properly sourced (but Maududi didn't help uns in this)</dd>
<dd>You decry a lack of "analysis in the article about Banu Qurayza and the weapons" - I disagree. We do cover the Muslim acusation that the BQ were traitors. If they were, it follows that they would have used these weapons against Mr M. If not, then not. Hence, this is no sperarate view but the very same accusation of treachery. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 01:21, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, thnks for pointing the edit out (I actually wanted a date and time, but that'll do), I will respond to it soon. I never said the tribe "got these weapons during a siege", infact we don't know when they got them. But is is clear they had them. I'll repeat: <b>there is no analysis currently in the article on Qurayza's possesion of the weapons</b>. Most analysis that the tribe committed treachery doesn't take into account the weapons. Sure, this may be an accusation of treachery, but it is an accusation taking into account circumstances different from before.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 14:40, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i think it's been stated several times: we should include how Muslim scholars interpret the existence of this weapons cache. it really is as simply as that. your relocation was a little off also, the only reason the cache is relevant or notable is <i>because</i> the Muslims seized it, and thus the sentence belongs where it previously was. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:56, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A still better place for it might in the discussion of spoils seized by the victors. Re Muslim scholars, as I've stated, I agree this would be notable were there any widespread tradition related to this. However, as Bless sins has not yet produced the third source, and as Sealed Nectar doesn't give us anything specific in this regard, all I see is one line (?) in Maududi.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 05:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Like I have said, analysis is different from fact. That the Qurayza wanted to use the weapons, is analysis of scholars not a fact.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 14:44, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, "the only reason the cache is relevant or notable is <i>because</i> the Muslims seized it, and thus the sentence belongs where it previously was." or, in other words, it is only meant to push the POV that the Jews only had themselves to blame. Reactions that are indeed revealing. For those who are still unclear about this: this article is about the Banu Qurayza and anything that pertains to them. It is NOT about the Banu Qurayza as far they are linked to Muhammad.</dd>
<dd>I don't mind proper arguments for the placement of the information but not this condescending "it is only important because Muslims seized it" attitude.</dd>
<dd>My placement of this information has the advantage that we could include a short reference (but no more) to the "the weapons were intended for" claims in the treatment of the supposed treachery of the BQ. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 09:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The only thing we know of Banu Qurayza (esp. in their final days) is through Muslim sources. Thus the Muslim componenet cannot be forgotten. Also, we don't whether the Banu Quryaza had the weapons at the beginning of the battle or not, thus there is no point in mentioning that there. We do know they had weapons by the end of the battle.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 14:58, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>the problem here, Str, is the fact that had the Muslims not seized the weapons, there would then be nothing noteworthy about the Qurayzans actually possessing weapons. it has nothing to do with directing the blame to anyone. you mention the seizure in its correct chronological place, not anywhere else where it seems obscure and irrelevant. the relocation also falsely assumes that they were in possession of those numbers of weapons at the beginning of the battle, whereas we only know of the number when the muslims actually seized it, after the battle. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 15:18, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Keeping in mind that self-defense is here defined as treachery. As with Saddam's Iraq, the only use of these would-be weapons of mass-destruction that we know of was to defend themselves against the attack which exterminated them. Even if they intended to rebel (and who could blame them?) that is not equivalent to meaning to "aid the Quraysh," any more than Iraqi insurgents mean to "aid Al Qaeda" rather than simply fight foreign occupation. How is it "treachery" to reject the rule of a self-appointed dictator hailing from a distant place? Lewis makes it clear that they rejected this arrangement from the start.</dd>
<dd>The traditional narrative reduces the Jews of Medina to pawns of the Quraysh, instead of accepting them as real people with their own interests and agenda. This included trading with Mecca, not due to any shared polytheistic evil (for they were hardly polytheists, and I'm not convinced anyhow that polytheism = evil,) but because this was their livelihood - one at least as legitimate as <i>raiding</i> Meccan caravans and divvying up the spoils. These people were in Medina doing what they were doing before the Aws and Khazraj moved in, and long before Muhammad was born.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 10:02, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Pro, I think this is not completely on topic, but since the relevant discussion is not happening, I may as well respond to what your said:</dd>
<dd>I used treachery as a short wording for the view espoused in the Muslim sources. I distinguish two things: was it treason/treachery and can I understand why they did what they did? I personally tend to agree that the BQ were indeed in treasonous relations with the Nadir (and through them the Quraish), though they probably did not intend this from the start but were won over by the Nadir and did not act in treason as they had no opportunity. Having said that, I can very much understand why they had ill feeling towards Muhammad who had expelled two tribes from their city (after all, the Qunayqa were the original settlers of Jathrib) ultimately because they didn't accept him as prophet. Furthermore, Muhammad on learning about the treason did nothing to stop it but indeed encouraged it through his moles. However, keep in mind: contrary to what some Muslims write, the treason was not against Muhammad but against the city of Jathrib. The Quraish and allies besieged not "the Muslims" but the city of Jathrib. Aiding the besiegers is indeed treasons, no matter what their motives were. And they definitely had their motives.
<dl>
<dd>The Quraish too had their motives and it is not just polytheism and enmity towards Muhammad. Some clinged to their customary religion, while others feared for the economic repercussions of giving up the pagan cult with its pilgrimage and market (Muhammad later addressed this by retaining the cultic centre of the Kaaba), others had political reasons, as yielding to Muhammad's claim practically would have made him ruler of Mecca (who can contend with someone who can speak in the name of God Allmighty). There were also several reasons and motives for the wars between Meccans and Muhammad, who - lest we forget - started the hostilities by raiding Meccan caravans. What ever happened to "Thou shall not steal". The caravan raids certainly were the main reason for the ongoing battles. I agree that polytheism is not to be equated with evil (excluding the issue of worshipping false gods) - some of these pagans were likeable or virtuous characters (e.g. Abu Talib, Abu Sufyan for instance seems to be, well not the paragon of morality but certainly not an evil man) while others clearly were not (Ummaya, Abu Jahal). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 14:31, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Str1977, your last comment doesn't help the discussion one bit. I am not arguing here whether Muhammad "started the hostilities", though he was thrown out of his home city for proclaiming one God. Please keep your opposition to Muhammad, to yourself. I really don't care if you think polytheism is "not to be equated with evil".

<dd>You now sh*** about my views on Mr M and polytheism. That Muhammad started the hostilities by sending out raiding squads is a undisputable fact of history. Muslims commonly justify his acts but that he did it is undisputed. And finally, Mr M wasn't thrown out of Mecca, he fled. Not without cause, but he fled ... to the company of those who had promised to protect him like their kin. One can understand that separation ... but that doesn't give him the right to steal other people's property just because he wanted to be wealthy again soon. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 15:30, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will let bygones by bygones and not comment on things I found objectionable above and instead try to refocus that on the topic, restating my proposal.</p>
<p>As you well know I have moved the weapons reference to another place, where I think it is more neutrally informative. I know perfectly well that the weapons were counted after the end of the siege but if they had many after it they also had many before that (and my version states no more - the exact figures are given as of the time of the seizing by the Muslims). Chances of gaining weapons during a siege are few.</p>
<p>The advantage of my posting is that we could include a short reference to the weapons in the passages dealing with the view that the BQ were traitors. (Otherwise, we would have to deal with weapons we hadn't yet mentioned.)</p>
<p>This would end the endless debates about the quality of Maududi's claims as the overall accusation is clearly notable and therefore already included.</p>
<p>So what do other think? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 22:32, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So you are saying that if we include weapons in the beginning of the battle, then Maududi/Mubarakpuri's view can stay? Otherwise, I don't think I understand your proposal.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 00:00, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Can we please stop calling it the "Maududi/Mubarakpuri" view? I've read Mubarakpuri, and it <i>does not</i> second Maududi's claim that the weapons were intended to aid the Quraysh. You can say it's not inconsistent with it, and that the tone is similarly condemnational, but that doesn't make it the "Maududi/Mubarakpuri" view.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 00:10, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Seen on its own, the Maududi view is neither scholarly enough or notable enough. However, when we put it in its proper place - the widely held view about the BQ's treason - it becomes clear that Maududi just went one step further. It might unfounded speculation but at least it is not illogical (though I can hardly see it as something that the BQ could be blamed for additionally), when seen this perspective. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 00:26, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are giving me a yes and no answer. I and afraid I don't understand your "proposal". You are clearly comprimising fair representation of the sources by placing the quote earlier.

<dd>Scholarship? Here is the Maududi quote in all its splendor:</dd>
<dd>"When the Muslims entered their strongholds they found that the treacherous people had collected 1,500 swords, 300 coats of mail, 2,000 spears and 1,500 shields in order to join the war. If Allah's succour had not reached the Muslims, all this military equipment would have been used to attack Madinah from the rear right at the time when the polytheists were making preparations for a general assault on the Muslims after crossing the Trench. After this disclosure there remained no doubt that the decision of Hadrat Sad concerning those people was absolutely correct."<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/maududi/mau33.html#S33" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/maududi/mau33.html#S33" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></dd>
<dd>Oh, <i>no doubt.</i> Perhaps my favorite line (among many) is, "...the anti Islamic Jewish mind prevailed over every moral consideration and the Bani Quraizah were persuaded to break the treaty." If Maududi's speculations are worthy of inclusion, why should this not also be included? It would constitute a very important insight upon the reasons for the conflict, were there any basis for it.</dd>
<dd>If, as you say, Muslims around the world revere his scholarship, that is their mistake which we're obliged not to repeat.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 01:00, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

I dont' mean to be difficult, but sources which state things such as "the anti Islamic Jewish mind prevailed over every moral consideration..." may not be taken seriously as academics. What research do you suppose underlies that statement? I believe the answer would be <i>none.</i> Everyone has their biases, but Maududi is unapologetically partisan at every turn. I reiterate that we must be willing to include historically significant Islamic beliefs on the ground of <i>notability,</i> as the article currently does in good measure, but Maududi alone does not suffice in this regard. I want to see a geniune tradition, not just Maududi carelessly mouthing off.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 04:29, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ok I see what Maududi has said. But what about those who say that the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a> is "laced with anti-Jewish pronouncements" and anti-Jewish declarations? Are they not "extremists"? Or is it somehow okay to accuse 20% of mankind of antiSemitism but not okay call one tribe of 700 men as "anti-Islamic"? <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 04:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Being fairly familiar with the Qur'an (albeit in translation,) I believe the difference would be that one can point to specific passages <i>in a book</i> which support that finding, and as a matter of historical fact have been used to justify persecution, while Maududi's charges against the Jews are mere projection, and blatantly racist at that. There is no such thing as a "Jewish mind," anti-Islamic or otherwise. As for 20% of mankind, they didn't collectively write the Qur'an, did they? Muslims are people who believe in some version of Islam; they are not equivalent to the religion itself, much less its central text, which has only one author, not 1+ billon authors. I am constantly astonished that people fail to distinguish between the dignity of human beings and the validity of the ideas to which they subscribe (in most instances, quite inconsistently.) I don't believe <i>ideas</i> have rights, actually, except the right to be discussed, debated where they are debatable, promoted when they serve us and discarded when they're no longer of use. Even were Islam utterly false in every respect (an extreme position, but for the sake of argument,) Muslims would still have the right not to be collectively denigrated as human beings, a consideration Maududi doesn't extend to Jews, whom he clearly despises.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 08:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maududi's charges are against the Banu Qurayza, not all the Jews in the world. Thus they are not racist. It is common to refer to the Banu Qurayza as "the Jews". "Jewish mind" simply means the attitude of Jews. Remember what you are reading is a translation, and Maududi's Urdu metaphors will not mean the same thing when translated in English.</dd>
<dd>One of the things about mainstream Islam (medieval or modern) is that it has never produced a racist movement. It is has produced terrorists, extremists, dictators, but never racists. Any Jew who converts to Islam is as good as a Muslim. There is nothing inherently/biologically bad about Jews. Infact, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, Saul, etc. are all revered in Islam. the Jews are only criticized for rejecting thier own religion.</dd>
<dd>20% of the mankind hold the Quran - to the last verse - to be true. IF the Quran is "antiSemitic", then so are these one billion people who agree 100% with the Quran. To say that these 1 billion people are antiSemitic, is clealry an extremist position.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 16:30, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

I must further point out that those editors, including BS, who insted on including Maududi consistently misconstrued his writings by claiming that Maududi speculated that those weapons were specifically intended to aid the Quraysh and for no other purpose.

<dl>
<dd>Firstly, one thing is clear, like you said, your "proposal falls apart".</dd>
<dd>Secondly, Heck says, "<i>Upon the Muslims' subjugation of the banu Qurayzah...</i>". Thus the weapons were found <i>after</i> the surrender of the tribe. Please don't say "common sense tells us...", especially since your sense isn't "common". We don't whether they acquired the weapons before the battle or during it. Both are equally likely.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, I have already said that Maududi states that the Qurayza accumulated weapons "in order to join the war". Maududi <i>does</i> say that they had thier weapons in order to aid the Quraysh, who were at war with Muslims.</dd>
<dd>Fourthly, about you bolding all your replies...never mind.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 15:05, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Re your "secondly". Stop creating straw men. Yes, the Muslims found the weapons at that point in time. I agree. It doesn't say that they collected them at that time. I have stated my common sense observation (and at least I believe my sense to be sensible and not merely common) but have not made it the basis of anything in the article. But you cannot argue from Heck that the the reference must be placed later.</dd>
<dd>Re your "Thirdly" - you have said but that but that doesn't make it true.</dd>
<dd>Re your "Fourthly" - who began with massive bolding?

<dl>
<dd>2. So if we don't knwo whether the banu qurayza had the weapons at the beginning of the battle or not, why put it there. The article should be arranged in chronological order, which means we must mention the weapons after the "Muslims' subjugation" (Heck) of the tribe. You really have no argument for mentioning them before do you? Your proposal, like you said, has fallen apart.</dd>
<dd>3. If you <i>really</i> insist we can change "aid the Quraysh" with "in order to join the war [against Muslims]" (which Maududi says). Then there will be no accusation of misrepresentation of sources. It is also clear (from Maududi's passage) that the Qurayza wanted to join the war from Quryash's side, against the Muslims. Thus "against Muslims" would, although not be what Maududi said, but would clealry represent his view.</dd>
<dd>4. Can you also please use common <i>English</i> words. I am sorry, but I don't understand what"<i>Eik benek, eik blavek</i>" and "<i>Sapere aude</i>" mean.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 16:33, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>2.I placed it there because it talks about the tools the BQ gave for the digging of the ditch. We also could place it anywhere else. But I think it fits there. And if you really argue for a chronological order (which we cannot totally adhere too, but let's assume we could) we couldn't place it at the end of the siege of the BQ as they didn't acquire but lost the weapons there.</dd>
<dd>3. Repeating what you said before will not convince anyone.</dd>

<dd><small>&lt;reset&gt;</small>1) can we tone down the boldface please guys? 2) the mention of the weapons is appropriate when they were discovered. <i>when</i> these weapons were acquired by the Qurayzans is irrelevant, and quite frankly unknown. the rationale for including them where Str proposed is rather flimsy, and certainly not sound. Maududi and Mubarakpuri (among others, according to Bless sins) should certainly be represented here.

<dd>Beit Or, Mubarakpuri has an exceptionally high standing in the Islamic world, and this particular work of his is one of the most popular Muslim biographies of Muhammad today. Str, that's not particularly relevant here. Muslims seized the stockpile of weapons from Banu Qurayza. that's a fact. that's not, however, an inherent implication of guilt on the part of Banu Qurayza. it is only considered so by numerous Muslim scholars, and that's what we are trying to represent here. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 20:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not commenting on the supposed standing of Mubarakpuri, I want to say that I am asking the basic question because I have become anxious that not all share this basic fact. It might not be particularly relevant in the end, but still. I agree with you about the "implication of guilt". However, a) Maududi uses it that way, b) avoiding such implicit POV pushing is ONE of the reasons for my alternative placement. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 00:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bless, if you accept that fact we will at least base our discussion on reality. Where will it lead? I don't know. I do not plan discussions beforehand, calculating an outcome. What I was talking about is indeed my presentation posted on 19:32, 4 February 2007. Is the question relevant here - only in so far we discuss the same questions. What is relevant is your way of handling discussions. You do what you call "requesting" (bordering on pestering other editors) but than you don't care about it at all. "I don't care if you do" - you can take it or leave and if you have nothing to say (as you seem to) don't bother.

<dd>I thought the issue of Maudidi was solved way back. There was accusations of forgery against him because Ibn Ishaq doesn't say what Muslims found. Maududi has spent much time studying early Islam and Qur'anic exegesis. The exegesis of the Qur'an requires studying the "occasions of revelations"(meaning early Islam). So, his views are notable to be presented. Even if one believes his views are "biased", "false", ... etc etc they represent "a" Muslim POV. When we write "Muslim scholar X says Y", we have already made it appropriate for addition.</dd>
<dd>Muslim scholars were traditionally the Islamic historians as well. Now, we have some non-Muslims who have started studying history of Islam with whatever "anti-bias", or "biases" they might have. They call themselves "historians" and exclude others. These are just words. As far as the policies of wikipedia are concerned, both views could be mentioned. Wikipedia is supposed to just report whatever notable and expert people say, not to choose and decide the true pieces of information and represent them. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:29, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Str1977, please respond below this argument. Firstly who are you referring to here "<i>main problem with you and your friends</i>". Who are my friends? Realize that banned user Patchouli used to accuse others of "working for the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Islamic republic</a>".</p>
<p><b>1</b>. No but if a person is a scholar in XYZ, then it follows that his work about XYZ is also scholarly. Do you agree with that much?</p>
<p><b>1.1</b>. See the list above under "1.1".</p>
<p><b>1.2</b>. This is covered in 2.3.</p>
<p><b>2.1</b>. I'll repeat. This is only for unscholarly sources. BTW, "father of terrorism" is not the same as <i>unqualified and self proclaimed scholar</i>, which is what you need to show to discredit him.</p>
<p><b>2.2</b>. Maududi (as far as I know) is not a scholar on near East history. But he is a scholar on Islam and Quran, and above all a writer of a scholarly <a href="../../../t/a/f/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsir</a>. Do you agree? See 2.3 when you do.</p>
<p><b>2.3</b>. "<i>once he steps beyond his expertise</i>". I agree. But I am not saying Maududi is a scholar on history in general. However, Maududi is an expert on Muahmmad's life. Like I mentioned before <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbab_al-nuzul.html" title="Asbab al-nuzul">Asbab al-nuzul</a>, meaning "<i>occasions/circumstances of revelation</i>", is a branch of tafsir. All exegetes are experts in this, and need to be expert in this in order to write a good <a href="../../../t/a/f/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsir</a> (which Maududi has written). And this makes perfect sense, if you think about it. One can't comment on the Quran without knowing what Muhammad was going through. The Quran and Muhammad's life are very deeply weaved togethor - you can't seperate the two and still expect them to make sense.</p>
<p><b>Look, I'm not even asking you to accept Maududi's statements as facts. I'm just saying to accept Maududi's opinion (that the Qurayza intended to aid the Quraysh) as notable analysis, and put it into the article on that basis.

<dd>Bless focuses on the issue of RS, but he ignores one thing ... or rather misread it, when he says that all POVs are to be presented. That is true and actually that is what we are already doing. The view that the weapons were to be used against Muhammad is, though not explicitely stated, already present in the article, as the view that the BQ were planning treachery is included (so much for Bless' "that the Qurayza intended to aid the Quraysh" - we long ago included this interpretation and personally I even agree with this allegation to be factual, though I can relate to the reflections of the BQ). I have no objection, <i>from the perspective</i> of POV, accuracy, undue weight <i>against the inclusion of a note about the weapons in the place that talks about the treachery. My only objection is a stylistic one, as this is really hitting home a triviality (that the BQ would have used the weapons they had for whatever they had in mind, including treachery) and hence would be redundant.</i></dd>
<dd>As for the numered points above, these are mostly repetitions of statements already addressed. Moving it down here makes it difficult to reply. Just this: yes, Maududi is a scholar for this and not for that. That was my point. Maududi is an exegete and yes, he is supposed to know about circumstances of suras, as the Quran doesn't provide a context for the suras as e.g. the Gospels do for sayings of Jesus. However, I don't think that this makes him a historian or that he is in the position to critically examine the veracity of the traditions. And that is fine and dandy, as such an examination is not required for his exegetical purposes. For his purposes, the guilt of the BQ is clear, as Gabriel confirmed it and drove Muhammad to laying siege to the tribe. Okay for exegesis but not for history and this article is about the BQ and their history and not about Quranic exegesis.</dd>
<dd>In any case, the view that the BQ were traitors is prominently included in a NPOV manner.

<dd>I fully agree with Str, except that I object to using the word "traitors". It's hardly a treason to seek outisde help against a usurper who violated his own Constitution of Medina multiple times. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 11:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just to make this perfectly clear (I was thinking of including a disclaimer regarding this but then thought I needn't bother): when I wrote BQ as traitors/treacherous I was "in shorthand" referring to that view and interpretation of historical events. I never wanted to suggest putting such statements as facts into the article. However, I think it is technically treason to seek outside help - treason towards (and I note this as important) the city of Jathrib and not simply to M. That M. broke the agreement (the historical reality behind the later Constitution of Medina) himself - and there is a case for this - is one thing but two wrongs don't make it right. We may relate to the BQ's motivations or even justify their actions (or we don't) but that doesn't change the fact that treason is treason.</dd>
<dd>I repeatedly voiced my personal view on this (which is not really important for the article, therefore the smallprint) <small>that the BQ cooperated with M. for a long time, despite his actions against the Qaynuqa and the Nadir but then were persuaded by the exiled Nadir chief to an agreement that indeed was treason to (and I note this as important) the city of Jathrib and not simply to M. I think they were uneasy about this but were won over in the end, but the course of events never made any action possible. I also note that M. through his moles encouraged the treachery. I do not condone treachery but I can also understand the BQ's motives. And though M. was "legally entitled" to inflict a massacre, given that they had surrendered unconditionally, I think that the massacre tells us something about him in this situation. It is understandable from a 7th century Arab (though massacres were not common at that time) but not from a man of God.</small> I do not want to debate this (here) as it does not pertain to the article in the least. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 13:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Response to Str1977 (11:09, 26 February 2007):</p>
<p>"<i>The view that the weapons were to be used against Muhammad is, though not explicitely stated</i>".</p>
<p>Yes I am including the view explicitly. When we say that the Qurayza comitted treachery, we have to provide readers with greater explanation. If wikipedia is a quality source, it will not only present a perspective but also present the reason that perspective is asserted. For example consider the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_antisemitism.html" title="Islam and antisemitism">islam and antisemitism</a> article.</p>
<p>"<i>I have no objection, from the perspective of POV, accuracy, undue weight...My only objection is a stylistic one,</i>"</p>
<p>That is itself a trivial reason to continue debate that has taken up thousands of words. Wiki strongly enforces "POV, accuracy, undue weight", but not style.</p>
<p>"<i>However, I don't think that this makes him a historian or that he is in the position to critically examine the veracity of the traditions.</i>"</p>
<p>A person cant claim to be a "historian" of Middle east military history, without any knowlege of Islam and jihad. Ofcourse, that doesn't make the historian a theologian, but such a historian is considered an RS on general principles of how Islam and jihad were practised by Muslims.</p>
<p>Similarly Maududi is not a historian, save the history related to Muhammad's life as a prophet (only about 23 years). <b>You must understand: Islam BY DEFINITION is the teachings and actions of Muhammad</b>. The two fields (1. Muhammad's life, and 2. Islam) are unseperable!</p>
<p>"<i>In any case, the view that the BQ were traitors is prominently included in a NPOV manner. Why push for more?</i>"</p>
<p>The object (of many editors) is to show that Islam is an antiSemitic religion. This object can easily be achieved in one sentence: Islam is antiSemitic. But that would be unencyclopedic, no one would come to wikipedia to just read that. Instead reasons must be provided, arguments must be presented and attributed to the schoalrs who make them.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 20:09, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bless,</dd>
<dd>"That is itself a trivial reason ..."</dd>
<dd>But that's not our debate. I said I don't object, except for style, against a a note about the weapons in the current two paragraphs about the treachery. To be clear, this would read: "but decided to support the Meccans <b>with their arms</b>" Anything more I do object for the stated reasons of NPOV and undue weight. Apart from that, it is you who is continuing this debate.</dd>
<dd>I am not claiming that one can be a historian of that period without knowledge of Islam. Maududi is an expert on Islamic tradition and that's it. He is not a historian and you cannot simply turn him into one.</dd>
<dd>"The object (of many editors) is to show that Islam is an antiSemitic religion." Whose object is this? It is not mine and I don't care about those who want to show this. BTW, we already have two paragraphs entirely about the alleged BQ treachery. And no, Maududi doesn't provide any reason, neither does the inclusion of a reference to the weapons.</dd>

<dd>"<i>Upon entering the strongholds of Banu Qurayza, the Muslims reportedly seized large numbers of weaponry (1,500 <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">swords</a>, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armor, and 500 shields).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[9]</a></sup> Maududi and al-Mubarakpuri speculate that these were intended to aid the Quraysh against the Muslims.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[11]</a></sup></i>"</dd>

<dd>As for the statemtent, no I don't accept it in this way. The numbers of weaponry - given by Heck as general information about the BQ - I think better included in another spot. A reference about the speculation can be included (and this I stated above) in the passage dealing with the (alleged) treachery, as Maududi and Mubarakpuri are simply fleshing out the treachery allegation.

<p>Str1977, I really wnat to get this dispute over with. it has been several days and you haven't responded. Can you please visit the page more frequently?<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 15:25, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bless, my watchlist is long and substantive posts on this page unfortunately not very frequent. Now, as for your next to last post: No, that is exactly not what I want. That is what you want. What I want is nothing, but what I suggest as a compromise would be a short note referring to the speculation, e.g. "Ka'b was, according to Al-Waqidi's account, initially reluctant to break the contract and argued that Muhammad never broke any contract with them or exposed them to any shame, but decided to support the Meccans <b>with their arms &lt; ref &gt; Maududi, Nectar &lt; / ref &gt;</b> after Huyayy had promised ..."</dd>
<dd>Now, I know this looks awkward but this is all we can do.</dd>
<dd>However, I personally would also allow another alternative (but I am pessimistic about the others). We once had a reference to Watt's speculation that the BQ were lacking the opportunity. This was removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banu_Qurayza&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100828262" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banu_Qurayza&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100828262" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> but if we could restore it, we could include your references with that sentence, e.g. <b>"Watt however opines that they were lacking the opportunity to act&lt; r e f n a m e = "CambrWatt" / &gt; Maudui (...) and al-M, Nectar (..) concur and place emphasis on the weapons of the BQ &lt; r e f /&gt;</b></dd>
<dd>As I said, I am pessimistic, but let's see. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 23:09, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly, I for my part never had a problem with that if the speculation is accurately labeled as such.

<dd>e.g. "According to the Qurayza did not commit any act overtly hostile to Muhammad" is incomplete and should remain in the main text. "Muslim scholars justified the treatment of the Banu Qurayza with reference" does not belong among "scholarly views", as this is a religious issue of ethical judgement on the whole event, not one of scholarly research. - So maybe it is better to reintegrate the scholarly (and other) views back into the text, where the passage intro can classify them better. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 09:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
