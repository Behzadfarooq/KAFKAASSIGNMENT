<p>Although it is true that Banja Luka is the "de facto" capital of the RS, this explanation is inappropriate for the first sentence of the entry as it raises the question of why it is so and what is the "de iure" capital of the entity. This is why this discussion should be left to the page concerning Republika Srpska and just deal with blatant facts. Other countries/autonomies have administrative seats or capitals so there is no confusion there (South Africa, The Netherlands etc.).</p>

<p>"Recent attempts to reconstruct the Ferhadija mosque resulted in mass riots by Serbian nationalists on May 7, 2001. Some 4,000 Serbian rioters beat and stoned three hundred Bosniaks, who were participating in a ceremony commemorating the laying of the cornerstone for the reconstruction. At least eight Bosniaks were taken to the Banja Luka hospital for medical treatment. One of them died on May 26, 2001, of head injuries. While many mosques in Banja Luka are being rebuilt the reconstruction of Ferhadija still has not started, even though Serbian authorities in Banja Luka have issued all necessary documents, and permissions. According to the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the reconstruction should begin in 2006, ."</p>
<p><br />
I dont know where this came from but I am an American who lives in Banja Luka and was there the day of this alleged "riot". Your "4000 rioters" were about 30 rural thugs imported to Banja Luka specifically to create problems in front of the TV cameras. They threw some rocks and burned one old bus, but no one, to my knowledge, died of injuries. This was also staged during noon, when downtown is full of people normally, and the commotion drew a crowd to see what all the noise was. I was one of them, and can assure you there was no "riot". no one was "beaten". no one was "stoned", except, perhaps whoever authored this story.</p>
<p><br />
Here is a source to (at least one) author of the story <a href="http://hrw.org/wr2k2/europe5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hrw.org/wr2k2/europe5.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and few images <a href="http://www.ferhadija.com/bl07052001.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ferhadija.com/bl07052001.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> . I don't know where you were but whoever reported on this story knew very well what was going on as can be seen from the images. The report by HRW is only a stripped down version. I have read much more disturbing ones. Also if you knew what you were talking about you would know that site of ferhadija is not exactly downtown but rather some 200-300 meters from downtown and there is not so much pedestrian traffic around the area as there is perhaps on the main square. Whoever came to this area knew very well what was going on and if they perhaps did not take part in the riot they certainly did nothing to prevent it. I don't know what you are doing in Banja Luka but if it pertains to observing events like these and than reporting on them than you are doing a poor ass job.

<p>I am quite certain that what is described in this article as "ethnic cleansing" is usually described as "property exchange", which also explains absence of heavy fighting. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 19:03, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Property exchange is defined as a trade of objects of equal value under contractual obligation of both parties involved. It has been proved beyond any doubt that no such contracts existed in Banja Luka or if they did they were executed in ill faith and under compulsion. Compulsion under definition of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> was proven and in case of Banja Luka expanded as destruction of sustainable existence, namely expulsions from work places, confiscations of personal property, rapes, personal and physical attacks. Most Banjalukans who were expelled from Banja Luka left with little or no personal property. Taking in account that great number of Banjalukans were also deported to concentration camps a "genocide" may be even more appropriate term. I am sure that you would not consider expulsion of Jews from Germany during WWII a "property exchange". I see no further argument to dispute the neutrality of this article. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 02:54, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The objects do not need to be of the equal value, though that is irrelevant. No such thing has been proven - who proved it, when and how? It is true that most of the people who have exchanged their property were under pressure to do so, but so did those with whom they were exchanging. And there is no similarity with WWII Jews whatsoever. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 02:14, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ethnic cleansing in this region and in the city of Banja Luka was proven at ICTY. The tactics employed by authorities of RS were evident and proven through testimonies of people that lived in Banja Luka during Bosnian war and who were subsequently forced to leave the city. It is incorect that property of majority of Banjalukans was exchanged for anything of equal or close to equal value in period of 1992-1995 when ethnic cleansing took place. This was also proven later in RS court when the law was passed to return the properties to their rightfull owners.</dd>
<dd>It is completely irrelevant that people who were taking the property of Banjalukans were under pressure as their situation did not justify ethnic cleansing or retaliation.</dd>
<dd>In my personal opinion I think that there is a striking similarity of what happened with Jews in pre WWII period and what happened with non Serb Banjalukans during Bosnian War. This and ultimate consquences of evident ethnic cleansing in Banja Luka are yet to be studied.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 16:01, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Results of 1991 census in Banja Luka that are presented in this article are open for correction. The population of approx. 195000 and composition of 54% Serbs 13% Bosniaks and 12% Croats included the entire Banja Luka municipality (opstina). Given that Banja Lukas municipality is the largest in BH this breakdown does not give the the clear picture of the actual ethnic composition of the City of Banja Luka. It is widely agreed that majority of Serb population from Banja Luka municipalty were living outside of the City of Banja Luka. I am very confident that this can be proven by looking at the city census data rather than municipality census data. It is also an intresting fact that major Serb immigration into the city occured after the 1969 earthquake when the Banja Lukas population doubled due to explosion in housing construction. Before this urbanization influx Bosniaks and Croats were actually the majority populations of the city--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 07:15, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, well known facts, its just that its virtually impossible to obtain data for actual settlements in 1991 on the internet. I know some people who can provide the information though, so hopefully by the end of the week. By the way, since this is about the city and not the municipality, I think it would be better to just have a little dot on the municipality instead of coloring it all. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 03:38, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Less then 40000 muslims and Croats lived in Banjaluka in 1992, so it was inposibile to expel 70000 of them.</p>
<p>It is estimated that about 70,000 predominantly Bosniak and Croat residents were forced to leave the city between 1992-1995 as part of ethnic cleansing campaign of Republika Srpska.</p>
<p>In 1991 in Banjaluka lived 20,000 Croats and 19,000 Muslims. There is about 15,000 Muslims and Croats living in Banjaluka today.</p>
<p>Per 1991 census approx: 27300 Croats, 25350 Muslims (Bosniaks), 23400 Yugoslavs (Equally Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks) Total: 76050. Add also a good number of Serbs who left not taken in account here. Some of Banjalukans returned but (less than 5000) which still does not negate the fact that the nearly 70000 left the city in 1992. These numbers are based on percentages that are presented in the article.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 16:37, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There were never 70,000 Muslims and Catholics in the city or commune (opstina) of Banjaluka to begin with. The fact that you claim that the Yugoslavs are Muslims and Catholics and that they left is ludicrous. Following the war in 1996, 12,600 Muslims and Catholics were counted in the commune. Addition and subtraction laws thus dictate that some 45,000 left the commune, 30,000 the city itself.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's try to do this again. Per 1991 census approx: 27300 Croats and 25350 Muslims (Bosniaks) lived in Banja Luka municipality. I think it is fair to state (and I hope you agree) that those who declared themselves as Yugoslavs before the war were equaly represented by all three ethnic groups so that means 7800 Croats, 7800 Bosniaks and 7800 Serbs. If you add all this up you will get 68250 Croats and Bosniaks who lived in Banja Luka municipality in 1991(these are all approximations).</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, that is your assumption, first of all that 2/3 of Yugoslavs in Banja Luka were Catholics and Muslims and second of all that they no longer live there. First of all, if we are to divide the Yugoslavs that can only be done proportionately and the proportion is 4 Serbs, 1 Croat, 1 Muslim (proportionately according to non-Yugoslav 1991 population in Banja Luka). You cannot assume that there is one 1 Serb Yugoslav to every Muslim Yugoslav if Serbs outnumber Croats and Muslims 4 times each or twice put togethere. Where did you learn your math? BUt that is all assumption, we have no indication that the Yugoslavs were evenly spread, that there were even Serbs, Croats or Muslims among them or that they left Banja Luka. Maybe they were all Serbs, maybe they were not but say they are Serbs today, anything is possible if you assume. Your assumption in this case can not be proven true.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I did not count in many Serbs who left the city after 1992 for reasons of not agreeing with the politics or war or for dodging the draft but it is important to keep it in mind too.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What does that have to do with your idiotic, dim-witted and illiterate accusations about alleged ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Information that at least 12600 B and C's lived in the Banja Luka Muni. in period from 1992-1996 is a news to me. My information tells me that less than 3000 remained in 1995 and another 2000 returned since.</p>
<p>If you can prove your numbers I am willing to change the number to 55000 people who left the Banja Luka Muni. during the 1992-1995 war. Otherwise a number should be about 65000 --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 22:45, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your political ramblings have nothing to do with factual information, 30000 becomes 55000, then 65000 and the article ends up with 70000.</dd>
</dl>
<p>1991 census: 25350 Muslims, 27300 Croats, 1996 census UNHCR 220407 inhabitants: 5401 Bosniaks, 7236 Croats, 207770</p>
<p>Math 27300 + 25350 - 5401 - 7236 = 40,000. That's 40,000 Muslims and Croats less, some might have left of their own accord as you said (did not agree with the politics, draft-dodging etc.) some maybe traded in their property with Serbs from the other side of the border, some might have been chased out. Again, no assumptions can be made, and BTW, the 40 thousand figure is for the whole commune (municipality), 30,000 is proportionate for the city.</p>

<dd>Destruction of mosques in Banja Luka is the culture of nationalistic hatred that is apparently still prevalent in Banja Luka. Apparently there is still a clear systematic doctrine that tends to undermine one culture over another and death of one person and head injuries of others are a clear result of it. Hence noting both the destruction of mosques and the subsequent recent riots is relevant. It is clear that systematic riot such as happened in 2001 is merely an outward expression of an underlying contemporary culture of the city and region. This is not a taboo topic to discuss and note in the article.</dd>
<dd>It is laughable to claim that authorities of RS had nothing to do with the destruction of mosques. In the time of their destruction RS authorities were in charge of security in the city and had logistical authority that could enable such events. They are responsible for creating and encouraging the conditions where such acts could take place and they organized the subsequent clearing of some of the sites where mosques stood.</dd>
<dd>16 mosques were razed, destroyed, blown-up… pick a word. <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferhadija.html" title="Ferhadija">Ferhadija</a> was protected by UNESCO others weren’t.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I don’t think I ever claimed that 40000 Banjalukans were killed in concentration camps between 1992-95. Up to 30000 are still missing from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosanska_Krajina_0429.html" title="Bosanska Krajina">Bosanska Krajina</a> region and they are presumed dead. 900 bodies were recently discovered near <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omarska.html" title="Omarska">Omarska</a> concentration camps of which 500 are being identified. Further mass graves are still being uncovered.</dd>
<dd>In either case I don’t know how this relates to crimes committed in Jasenovac during WWII if that is what you are implying. If you are trying to justify the killings of non Serbs in Bosnian War of 1992-95 with crimes in Jasenovac you may want to rethink your reasoning.</dd>

<dd>Dado, never 16 mosques in Banja Luka existed. Please give a relevant and exact link about&#160;:</dd>
<dd>- number of mosques existed in Bajna Luka</dd>
<dd>- 30000 missing from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosanska_Krajina_0429.html" title="Bosanska Krajina">Bosanska Krajina</a> region</dd>
<dd>- how much of that people were from Banja Luka.</dd>

<dd>And again, I let you know that ONE dead Bosniak because of nationalism after the 1995. is not relevant to culture and also it don't show EXTREMLY nationalism in the city. Can you find page about any other city in Wikipedia were one prior unknown men refers in the culture section&#160;? Or to history of that town? No, I don't believe that there are such facts. Don't mix the culture and the politics.</dd>

<dd>I am glad your raised these questions. Following is the list of mosques in Banja Luka distroyed by RS authorities during 1992-1995 most of them built in 15 and 16 century most of them part of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Cultural Herritage since 1950 and one of the (Ferhadija) part of the World Cultural Heritage (UNESCO):
<ul>
<li>Dolacka</li>
<li>Vrbanjska</li>
<li>Arnaudija</li>
<li>Ferhadija</li>
<li>Seferija</li>
<li>Gazanferija</li>
<li>Pervizija</li>
<li>Salimija</li>
<li>Mehdija</li>
<li>Mehmedija</li>
<li>Sabanija</li>
<li>Kurtija</li>
<li>Zulfikarija</li>
<li>Behramija</li>
<li>Sahatkula (Actually not a mosque but a clock tower near Ferhadija built at the later date after Ferhadija)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If you wish I can even furnish a map where they stood for you so you can vist the sites yourself.</dd>
<dd>There were around 70000 Bosniaks and Croats living in Banja Luka in 1991. About 3000 remained in 1995.</dd>
<dd>Arround 3300 Bosniak and Croat civilians many of them from Banja Luka region, were murdered (executed) in Bosanska Krajina mainly in concentration camps but in some other detention facilities as well. See <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_Genocide_8469.html" title="Bosnian Genocide">Bosnian Genocide</a> for data taken from <a href="../../../i/c/t/ICTY_337a.html" title="ICTY">ICTY</a>. 3300 is the number of bodies discovered. Estimates are much larger.</dd>
<dd>I guess the "prior unknown" man that you are reffering to is now "unfortunately known" and is the stain on the culture of the current residents of Banja Luka. I hope you are not implying that since he was no one famous it does not need to be mentioned. I would reccommend you to explore your convictions about that.</dd>
<dd>I think I was more than convincingly clear in my prior response why all this should be in the culture section. I know it looks bad for RS but it is the truth and they should deal with it.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 21:51, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Did you think that writing about nationalism in culture of the city might look discouraging for the muslims who want to come back in the City? Official statistic nowadays shows that 7% of its inhabitans were muslims, and I would be glad that that number increase to the number before the war, but I think that your propaganda looks discouraging to them. --</dd>

<dd>There are some lists of people from Banja Luka who ended up in Omarska and Manjaca camps that Merhamet humanitarian organization has provided. I have seen some of them but I doubt that there is a link on the web site to see it. What I have seen there were about 200 to 300 people from Banja Luka who were killed in these camps, however many more passed through the camp (3000-5000). I am certain that these records can be found with the Commission for the Missing Persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</dd>
<dd>I would let muslims or croats make their own mind if the data provided is discouraging for them to return to the city. In fact I find it quite usefull if they care about their own security and human rights.</dd>
<dd>It is irrelevant how many people muslims and croats returned to the city in the point that I am trying to make. I commend the efforts by current government to allow these people to return but the fact still stands that these people were prosecuted and their lives were disrupted and for many it has caused irreperable damage. I have provided facts in this article and once the facts are laid out everyone can make their own decission and conclusion on this matter. Unless you can present stronger counter-arguements I see no point in further objections to this article other than trying to hide and deny of what happend in Banja Luka --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 14:04, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>www.un.org/icty/ . See Milosevic trial among others. As I said you may not find the list of victims but in the transcripts you may find some numbers, if you care to go through them.

<p>1. ethnic cleansing and genocide is not the same thing, and not treated the same by ICTY and other organization. 2. Two months ago you claimed that "all 20 mosques in Banja Luka were protected by UNESCO", later you find out that just one was protected by UNESCO. I claim that never 20 mosques in Banja Luka, existed, as one of Banja Luka's citizen. I'm really sad that all three former Banja Luka's mosques don't exist still, but I don't want that some incorrect data stay still on this wikipedia page. 3. About dead people from Banja Luka you didn't give EXACT link. Just to say ICTY don't prove anything. I must remind that ICTY also have and senteced some cases against Bosnian <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniak.html" title="Bosniak">Bosniak</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croat.html" title="Croat">Croat</a> population. 4. I think that official website data is more relevant about demografic shift then Crotian book with small amount of print copies you mentioned. Also, some facts from the book use "city" data and some "municipial" data so book's data are very confused. So, I think that official website data is more relevant. 5. About involvement of RS in destruction of mosques - please give exact and relevant link that shors it. 6. I think that YOUR edits, not mine are done in bad faith. --Oldadamml</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here we go again</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. I never claimed that genocide was proven in Banja Luka specifically. Ethnic cleansing as a component of the genocide in greater context of BiH did take place in Banja Luka. You may want to investigate the definition of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. I am begining to think that you may some schizophrenic issues or you may be confusing me with someone else. I have never claimed that there were 20 mosques in Banja Luka in 1992 (although there were even more 100 years back but that is irrelevant). I even gave you a list of them. Maybe because you moved to Banja Luka after 1995 is why you have not seen a single one left. I was born and grew up there and have seen them all or are you claiming that I was wrong and that those were not mosques. Get you facts straight. Actually I will correct myself and say that there were 15 mosques and a clock tower (it was located when you exit your ETF in that small back alley between the shops)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. I did give you exact link where you can find those information. What, do you want me to read it for you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. Official data from 1991 is included (or maybe I am missing your point). Claiming that book has no merit because it had low number of print copies is ludicrous. Provide a descending opinion about Agrarian Reform of 1918 and we can discuss it then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5. Provide a link with credibility that they were not invloved and we can discuss it than --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:29, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. You said before "20 UNESCO protected mosques" yesterday you reliaze that "15 mosques" and clock tower. Well, well, later you might find that also some another one weren't mosques, in fact some were another types of building.</p>
<p>2. Ethnic cleansing don't have correlation with genocide as in Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>3. I know that one of them was located when I exit my Faculty of Electrical Engineering, also know where some other was.</p>
<p>4. To say www.icty.org is not proof for your statements. It is a web link for one organization. Milosevic indictment also. So itself don't prove anything.</p>
<p>5. You asked for me to provide link "that they were not involved" but I must remind you about one law stetement "the accused is not guilty until it is proved". I didn't say they weren't involved or they were involved, I say "if you provide me relevant link that shows they were allowed</p>
<p>6. About movement of citizens in 1918-1981. I read Prosveta's Encyclopedia printed in 50,000 copies and there aren't facts such that.</p>
<p>7. Again, ICTY's call Manjaca camp or sometimes detention camp but not concentration, i.e. <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-ai040421-e.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-ai040421-e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-ai040421-e.htm</a> . --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldadamml_c181.html" title="User:Oldadamml">User:oldadamml</a></p>

<dd>4. ICTY is good enough for 95% of the population in this world but it is not good enough for you?! Good luck with that.</dd>
<dd>5. Occam's Razor principle applies.</dd>
<dd>6. Sure. You know what, I cannot find any information about the Agrarian Reform of 1918 in "War and Peace" book either. Maybe because the book is about something else. As I said find a descending view on those facts and than we can discuss it.</dd>

<dd>I think you should change names "Bosniak" into "Muslim (South/Balkan/Bosnian...) Slavs" or something like that (with "Bosniak" under parenthesis) when history before WWII is described, and to "Muslims" (with "Bosniak" under parenthesis) when history between the end of WWII and mid 1990s is described. I think it is the most correct formulation... Until the constitution of modern nations (in 19th century), I think that the most important fact was not "nationality", but religion. (In general, I think that Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks should be described as "Orthodox/Catholic/Muslim Shtokavians"&#160;:) before national constitutions. But I don't think that it would be accepted by others.) --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 16:22, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, please include (relevant) links (or quotes; maybe references to Wikiquotes) for all claims like "Agrarian reform", not only inside of talk page, but also inside of section "External links" and/or "Bibliography"; list names of mosques or at least put some reference, etc. Look, I am not historian and I can trust you (or anybody else). But, there are some claims which can be treated as nationalist propaganda (in this case Bosniak) if it there are no relevant links or quotes. Also, if <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarajevo.html" title="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> (as much bigger article) doesn't have statistics about ethnicities through the time, I don't realize why Banja Luka should have? It also gives very nationalist taste of the article ("Bosniaks tries to give arguments that Banja Luka was Bosniak city in the history.") --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 00:36, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, try to present facts (destruction of mosques and ethnic cleaning are the facts) with arguments inside of External links and/or Bibliography, but try to make distance of nationalist propaganda. Again, I prefer not to act as policeman who would say "that, that and that are not good parts and there should still stay POV". I am wandering does other articles about cities in Republic of Srpska have the same nationalist taste: Bjeljina, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prijedor.html" title="Prijedor">Prijedor</a>, <a href="../../../z/v/o/Zvornik.html" title="Zvornik">Zvornik</a>, etc...

<p>Almost every Banjalukan that I know supports the notion that Banja Luka used to have a Bosniak majority in last 100 years until last 40 years. This is the first time that I have actually found proof and academic research that supported those claims and that was one of the reasons why I included the data in the article. However, as I see this as a learning tool, I am willing to consider other credible sources that have descending views regarding the Agrarian Reform as I noted them above. I am always open for discussion with anyone who can bring eaqualy credible information to light. After all, aren't we all here to learn.</p>
<p>Other reason is that there is curently a clear perception that Banja Luka was always a "Serbian city" and such perception trivializes Bosniaks and Croats that used to live there before 1992 and especially the ethnic cleansing that took place in Banja Luka from 1992-1995. I hardly find factual information nationalistic as they are putting the city's demographic dynamics in context. Maybe I will revise that part of the article a bit so that it is not misunderstood.</p>
<p>Finally, I will gather up the links and references and place them in this article before the NPOV is removed. If additional information come to light we can continue this conversation.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 01:13, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any attempt to argue that some place was (not) (always) Serbian/Bosniak/... is nationalist. Situation in article about Banja Luka opens (at least) the same questions about Serb population in Sarajevo or Mostar; or Croat population in Central Bosnia. And there is no end. It is better to make general article about facts of ethnic history of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to add links about that in Template:Bosnia and Herzegovina. If that article grows up, it can be divided into separate articles (by regions or by towns). --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 03:30, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, as I said, my knowledge about history of BiH is not so good. For example, for the first time I heard about Agrarian reform.

And if you are working according to NPOV, you should try to find Croatian and Serbian sources, too. I am sure that people from Croatian and Serbian Wikipedia would find sources if you ask them. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 03:30, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Banjaluka's Kastel is much smaller then i.e. Smederevo castle. Kastel is ugly and there were found traces of Roman empire.

<dd>This "dispute" makes the least sense to me. "Impressive" may be taken out, but other than that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the sentence. Banja Luka, in medieval times, is not mentioned on the same level as prominent bosnian cities such as Visoko, Bobovac, Blagaj, or even Vrhbosna. On the other hand, during the Ottoman empire Banja Luka became the most important city in the west balkans and the seat of the bosnian pashaluk. Asides from the Kastel, I am not aware of any pre-Ottoman era buildings in Banja Luka's old town. To make an analogy, saying that Banja Luka's old town isn't Ottoman in character because of the Kastel is like saying that Belgrade's old town isn't baroque in character in because of the Bajrakli mosque. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 18:51, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be a good idea to explain better why Banja Luka "grew significantly in terms of importance" as well as to confrontate demographic facts (but not only demographic!) before the rule of Ottoman Empire and after it.

Also, it should be described what of the city core Banja Luka doesn't have before Ottoman Empire and it had after it. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 21:14, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Asim pointed out forced change in ethnic make-up of the city in last 100 years is perhaps the most dramatic change that city has seen. Some adjectives such as "dramatic" should be perhaps toned down or rephrased but I don't see why we should hide this information. If there are such data for Sarajevo I would be OK to include it. Comparison to New York or Berlin is irrelevant.

<dd>If you want to write about historical demographics in the sense of NPOV, you should add into article more then 100 years. However, all of that data should stay inside of History of Banja Luka or Historical demographics of Bosnia and Herzegovina or... with reference from this article to that data. I think that Asim and you know what do I mean when I say that it is nationalist propaganda. I don't say that that data should be deleted, I say that it should have another context. This context "shows Serbs from RS that their capitol <i>was not always</i> a Serb city". Claim that Banja Luka "was always a Serb city" or that it "was not always a Serb city" is nationalist (propaganda). But, describing the facts in the context of historical demographics is something else. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 19:33, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that you will agree that it is nationalistic that the half of the Banjalukans were expelled from the city based on their nationality. Are you now claiming as a <i>fait accompli</i> that current and past ethnic structures of Banja Luka are irrelevant, once the absolute Serb dominance has been established (don't you think that is a bit simplistic, to say the least). Exact claim that Banja Luka "was always a Serb city" or that it "was not always a Serb city" is not mentioned in the article, although you can conclude one or the other if you look at it from the nationalist point of view as you may be doing. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 20:46, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Even the first one is separate article and should contain more data.

<li>Expelling inhabitants of some place based on their nationality <i>is</i> nationalist act, but this is not the place for <i>nationalist confrontation</i>. It should be mentioned that ((almost) exact) number of inhabitants are expelled because of their nationality, but... Your and Asim's representations of facts are different when you are talking about Sarajevo. And this is hard nationalist POV. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 21:43, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you <i>want</i> to present <i>your POV</i>, it should be at least presented as <i>your POV</i> and not as the facts. However, I think that we are working on NPOV article, not on the article which should describe each POV. Again and again you are talking here not as encyclopedist, but as nationalist. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 21:43, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, there should be no differences when someone describes some city in France (or wherever) and some city in Bosnia and Herzegovina. If someone can't treat geographic description of some regions at the same way, (s)he should not write article about some of them. If it is emotionally too hard for you to write about places in Bosnia and Herzegovina, please write about the places in South America. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 21:43, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know for what reason I am attacked here as a nationalist if I am only presenting the information to the best of my knowledge after I collected the sources of facts (and listed them in the article). I have not included my POV in this article. Would you also call me nationalist or racist if I pointed out that Americans have committed genocide over Indians or if whites have prosecuted blacks in the US. I have presented the truth to the best of my knowledge. If some construe it as damaging to their political goals than tough.</p>
<p>I guess what you are trying to do is to hide or obscure the fact that particular ethnic groups have been expelled from Banja Luka by someone (god forbid if we call them out by their name). It is as if we said that one race in the US has been prosecuted by another race, but we can't tell you who. It only adds ambiguity to the article.</p>
<p>I have not created the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_population_of_Sarajevo_2117.html" title="Historical population of Sarajevo">Historical population of Sarajevo</a> and I don't know what is the source of those information, nor will I make edits on it until I do. I was only pointing to the organizational structure of the article.</p>

<li>I said that it should be mentioned as it was and I don't see why did you try to say that I want that it should be forgotten. This expelling did Serb nationalists and I don't see any reason why not to say that. This can be easily found in my previous comments. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 00:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I said that you are a nationalist (not racist) because <i>you said</i> that <i>you want(ed)</i> "to show that Banja Luka was not always Serb city". And not only that. (I can quote all of your nationalist statements.) This <i>is</i> <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> position. And you are continuing to defend position that presentation of historical facts (you are talking about 100 years, not about last 15 years) inside of article about Banja Luka is <i>one thing</i> and that the same presentation of historical facts about Berlin is completely different (etc.). Also, you started to do that inside of article which describes the city with major Serbian population (as well as the capitol of RS), not inside of article which describes some city with major Bosniak population. This <i>is</i> nationalist intention. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 00:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I came here to stop edit wars. Banja Luka is not the article of my interest. It is the article <i>of your interest</i>. And as I can ask Google for the facts about Banja Luka, you can do it, too. There are no excuses like "I don't know" or "I didn't find". You <i>can</i> find enough of data only if you want. And the question is what do you want: to write encyclopedic article or to work on nationalist propaganda. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 00:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>For me it is important to see that you are working according to encyclopedic ethics because I would have possibility in the future to say that you are doing good job and that I don't need to check it and waste a lot of time in discussions like this -- only to prevent edit wars. I hope you would understand my position. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 00:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have started my edits about Banja Luka because it is the city where I come from and where my encestors come from and because I have a genuine interest and knowledge of the subject.

Also, I am not seeking politically correct statements if they are factually wrong, nor am I looking for "political" endorsements of a kind that you are offering.

<dd>OK, I went and removed the first sentence, which didn't give any real information anyway. IMO, it's a bit better now, but it still has substantial problems that I don't know how to correct myself:
<ul>
<li>The simple listing of changes in the ethnic composition of the growing city obscurs the fact that in 1879, Muslim population of Bosnia was mostly urban, while Serb population of Bosnia was overhwelmingly rural. When the city grew and the population from surrounding countryside moved in, the ethnic composition was bound to change naturally, without any program or policy. Data from 1914 or 1918 would be great help here.</li>
<li>The whole issue of the agrarian reform, as it is presented now, is suspect:
<ul>
<li>The study on which it is based <a href="http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> is written by a sociologist, not a hystorian. It references just 6 other sources - 1 of them is an anonymous study, 3 of them are newspaper articles by the author of the study, 1 is a newspaper article by someone else and 1 is another, not directly applicable, hystorical study on the same website, written by a geomorphologist (IANM), of even more dubious scientific standards.</li>
<li>The study fails to take into account that the agrarian reform in Bosnia was more radical than in other parts of the then kingdom because the old feudal estates there were already dismantled in the 18th and 19th century, unlike in Bosnia where first the Ottomans and then the Austrians maintained the medieval status quo. The fact that the majority of population (Serbs and Croats) owned less than 10% of the land in Bosnia is a good explanation of why it was so. Note also that this landless population was overhwelmingly rural.</li>
<li>I have no doubt that the royal government used and abused the agrarian reform for ethnic engineering, but claiming that it was its only or primary motivation is very likely wrong and certainly controversial without credible references.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is even less basis to the claim that the communist party used military appointments for ethnic engineering. Military officers were assigned and reassigned all over Yugoslavia and in all major cities or strategic towns this influenced the ethnic composition, reducing the share of the locally prevailing nationality.</li>
<li>The claim that Muslims had to chose between declaring themselves as Croats, Serbs or undecideds until 1971 is false. See <a href="http://www.fzs.ba/Dem/Popis/NacPopE.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fzs.ba/Dem/Popis/NacPopE.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</li>

Regarding the ethnic engineering by the communist government, I could agree that it was not their intention but a by-product of the reassignments. The sentance should clarify that. The link that you provided notes data from 1961. I admit that I may have gotten the year wrong and that can be corected.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 00:14, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Generally speaking it is clear that there was a sharp drop in Bosniak population natality in the City of Banja Luka since 1879 until 1991 with only slight recovery in period from 1981 to 1991. It is also clear that there was a sharp and consistant increase of Serb population in the City of Banja Luka from 1879 to 1991. Croat population remained relatively the same in the City of Banja Luka with a gradual decline starting after WWII.</p>
<p><br />
On the municipal level numbers tend to stay relativelly the same. It is noted that Serb population has declined as some of the rural parts were included in the City of Banja Luka proper and also because of in-migration after the 1969 earthquake. There is a sharp drop in Bosniak population on the municipal level noted on 1910 what can be attributed to several factors, including massive emigration (partly due to Agrarian Reform) and includeing the fact that many Bosniaks had to declare themselves as Croats, Serbs or undecided Muslims until 1971 when their national identity was restored.</p>

<p>I can see where the statistical mistake was in the article I removed those numbers as they can be seen properly at the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_population_of_Banja_Luka_34c9.html" title="Historical population of Banja Luka">Historical population of Banja Luka</a>. I would urge you to look at the data that the person before you provided and analize it before making decisions to remove the entire section. Note also that data provided was only statistical. There was no analisys to why the numbers changed so much through time. The previous information regading the Agrarian reform, urban expansion of the city and dismanteling of Bosnian feudal system that is stated in this section is still valid and usefull and it paints a clear picture of the nature of the city's history. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 8 July 2005 14:40 (UTC)</p>
<p>You showed the data which used abuse of statistics as shown. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldadamml_c181.html" title="User:Oldadamml">Oldadamml</a> 07:05, 11 July 2005 (UTC). Previous statistic information didn't consider municipaly data. They used city data before 1948, and municipaly data after 1948 and concluded something. As it is shown difference in the municipaly population don't show imigration of 25000 militarity personal from Serbia and Montenegro. In fact, the whole Republic of Srpska didn't have so much professional soldiers. Agrarian reform didn't have a lot influence of the number of Muslims living in Banja Luka municipaly as we shown the facts. Also, it wasn't possible to do ethnic cleansing of 70,000 Bosniaks and Croats from Banja Luka as the 1991 census shown that there were about 36,000 of them. Nowadays statistics show that only 5% of Banja Luka citizens are Bosniaks and Croats. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldadamml_c181.html" title="User:Oldadamml">Oldadamml</a> 13:23, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think I quite clearly split up the statistics from the municipality and the city in <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_population_of_Banja_Luka_34c9.html" title="Historical population of Banja Luka">Historical population of Banja Luka</a>. Regarding the number of refugees from Banja Luka see my previous comments&#160;: "Per 1991 census approx: 27300 Croats, 25350 Muslims (Bosniaks), 23400 Yugoslavs (Equally Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks) Total: 76050. Add also a good number of Serbs who left not taken in account here. Some of Banjalukans returned but (less than 5000) which still does not negate the fact that the nearly 70000 left the city in 1992. These numbers are based on percentages that are presented in the article.--Dado 16:37, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)" Per HRW only 3000 non-Serbs remained in 1995 There was a steady movement of significant number of military personell since 1969. Perhaps the number should be eliminated to avoid further statistical mistakes. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 05:54, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you take away someone's means to sustain their existance on a certain teritory by eliminating their economic existance as was done through Agrarian Reform while doing it with consideration to the ethnicity it is an abuse of human rights and property rights in order to change an ethnic make-up of the region and subsequent political organization of the region. The data supports the claim that many left the region because of the Agrarian Reform along the ethnic lines. In fact the monarchy admited to some mistakes in the reform in 1922 after it was politicly pressured by the Croatian side. It was a clear (while misguided) case of retribution for harsh treatment of Serbs by Ottoman invadors.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 18:27, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is nonsense, the Land Reform gave land to those who tilled it. Therefore it favoured according to class not religion. Poor Muslim peasants also recieved land. Land-owners from the Ottoman era (which is known for its unjust treatment of religious minority and a judicial system based on religious discrimination) were compensated economically. Thus they could no longer earn money from exploiting peasants but still had a good pay-off which they could use and most did, to buy into another profitable venture. And landowners, as in any country, are a minority not a majority. Most of that land was grabbed during Ottoman times, complaints by Dado today are just sour grapes. The leading Bosnian Muslim party of the times - the JMO - Jugoslovenska muslimanska organizacija - was very often in the ruling coalition and voted the new constitution in 1920.</li>

<p>Also, when we see the statistics it cannot be seen. Percentage of ethnic group in the municipaly level stayed the same in the past 100 years until 1991.--<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldadamml_c181.html" title="User:Oldadamml">Oldadamml</a> 07:05, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Drop of percentage of Bosniaks people was partly influenced by Agrarian Reform of 1918 that ordered the land owned by Bosniak landowners (?????---who got the land stolen from the native orthodox and cathlolics people in the Ottoman_Empire---???)???? What is this????</p>

<p>143 rainy days per year on average in Banja Luka seams a lot. That is, it rains nearly half of the year. Can someone confirm this. The previous number (53 rainy days) made a lot more sense. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 03:15, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I agree that the unjustice to the Moslem people of Bosnia that was committed was huge and that that should be pointed out. However, I am asking you to help note ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Croatia. The entire people was anihalated. I will help you in this, if you offer me help in that. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 14:59, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know much about Banja Luka, so I'm only talking about Wikipedia policy, not taking sides about ethnic cleansing.

<p>I fully agree but instead of citing each and every statement can we at least start with ones that seam to justify the tag. Otherwise the tag is a blanket statement that serves no good other than to discredit what may be a perfectly good article. I especially don't like when people blanket the article without a specific explaination or specific suggestion on how to improve it and than abandon it and avoid actually working on it by looking for sources themselves. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 23:53, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
