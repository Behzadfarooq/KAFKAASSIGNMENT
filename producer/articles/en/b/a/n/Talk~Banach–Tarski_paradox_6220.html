<p>Can this construction (perhaps the one using five pieces) be shown in a picture? Can it be animated on a computer screen (in simulated 3D)?</p>

<p>What about the series of pictures in Scientific American magazine some years ago that showed how a ball can be sliced up and rearranged to become something else? (I forget what it was.) I believe that example involved non-measurable pieces as well. I think non-measurable pieces can be visualized, just not realized in nature because they may be infinitely thin or whatever. In any case, the pictures were interesting. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_spector_3e6f.html" title="User:David spector">David</a> 17:05 Sep 17, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>A piece which is infinitely thin has <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebesgue_measure.html" title="Lebesgue measure">Lebesgue measure</a> 0. Non-measurable pieces are much worse than this, and cannot even be explicitly described. I still maintain that a useful picture of a Banach-Tarski dissection is not possible, especially as it's impossible to even specify such a dissection (rather than merely prove one exists). I can't comment on the Scientific American pictures, as I haven't seen them. --<a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZundark_7566.html" title="User:Zundark">Zundark</a> 18:27 Sep 17, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>How about a full name for <a href="../../../h/a/u/Hausdorff.html" title="Hausdorff">Hausdorff</a> so it can be linked?</p>
<p>Is this "doubling the interval" thingie related to the fact that on the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_line.html" title="Real line">Real line</a> there are the same number of points in any interval of any length? Or am I simply showing my ignorance? Seems we need an article on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity.html" title="Infinity">infinity</a>. --Buz Cory</p>

<p>I've put in <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Hausdorff_3ca5.html" title="Felix Hausdorff">Felix Hausdorff</a>'s first name, but there's no article for him yet.</p>
<p>Doubling the unit interval would be impossible if the doubled interval didn't have the same number of points as the original. But there's more to it than that, because only countably many pieces are used, whereas breaking it up into individual points would involve uncountably many pieces.</p>

<p>Can you please clarify (in the article) the following basic points:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the article should explain what it means by saying that the two balls are of the "same size" as the original, since it implies later in the article that "size" is not meant in the "usual" sense of measure theory.</li>
<li>Second, it should clearly distinguish the theorem from the "ordinary" fact that any infinite set (e.g. two spheres) can always be identified bijectively with a similarly infinite subset (e.g. one sphere) of itself.</li>
<li>Third, there seems to be in a contradiction: in the introduction, it talks about a "solid ball" (which sounds like a sphere-bounded volume) whereas the proof talks about S2 (which usually denotes a spherical surface).</li>
</ul>
<p>Steven G. Johnson 04:07, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It means size as in Lebesgue measure. Which part of the article do you think implies something different?
<ul>
<li>It says something about the pieces not being measurable, so combined with the fact that it never defines "size" I found this confusing. The main point is that it should clearly define "size". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">Steven G. Johnson</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It says at the beginning that the decomposition is into finitely many pieces. This clearly distinguishes it from a decomposition into uncountably many pieces. If you don't think this is clear enough, perhaps you could add a clarification yourself.
<ul>
<li>I don't think the article as it stands is clear enough, simply because people might be confused into thinking that the mere identification of two spheres with one is the paradoxical part (most people aren't familiar with the fact that infinite sets can be identified with subsets of themselves). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">Steven G. Johnson</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The proof talks about S<sup>2</sup>, but at the very end it shows how to extend this to the ball (with a slight fudge). This is also explained at the beginning of the proof sketch, so I don't think it requires further clarification.
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I didn't notice the last sentence. My bad. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">Steven G. Johnson</a></li>

<p>I've tried to clarify the above points; please check. I'm still a bit confused by your saying that "size" is meant in the sense of Lebesgue measure, since later in the article it talks about there being no non-trivial "measure" for arbitrary sets. I guess the point is that the pieces are not measurable, but their combination is? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">Steven G.

<p>As I understand the definitions of <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i>(<i>a</i>)</span> in the section about paradox decomposition, we mean <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/4/3/b4375bf7ba4fc4a23a449c12f8e39380.png" alt="S(a) = \{af | f \in F_2\}" />.

<p>The usual argument against the idea that the BTP genuinely undermines the plausibility of the axiom of choice, is that the axiom of choice allows one to construct non-measurable subsets, which it is wrong to regard as "pieces" of the original ball: instead they interleave with each other to an infinitesimally fine degree, allowing a trick rather similar to Russell's Hotel to be carried out. What's puzzling is the intrusion of a paradox of the infinite into what at first glance appeared to be a statement of geometry.</p>
<p>I'm not applying an edit directly, because this issue has ramifications elsewhere, and I haven';t time to properly formulate the text right now. Changes are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>cut it up into finitely many pieces</i> -- very misleading description</li>
<li><i>it is a paradox only in the sense of being counter-intuitive. Because its proof prominently uses the axiom of choice, this counter-intuitive conclusion has been presented as an argument against adoption of that axiom.</i> -- needs counterargument here</li>

<dd>I think I've maybe not made my complaint clear: the article begins with an description of the TBP that is couched in intuitive but contentious terms: people who say the resolution of the paradox is that our intuitions about cutting up solids and applying spatial transformations only applies to measurable connected subsets (as indeed I do) will object to the way the topic is framed; the reversion hasn't changed much.

<p>I wonder if replacing "cut it up into" with "divide it into" would be clearer, since the division isn't a knife cut style topological division. I also think the last sentence of the introduction starting "actually, as explained below" is confusing and arguably not neutral, since the previous sentence provides both points of view. Any objections to replacing that phrase and deleting that sentence? Warren Dew 23:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The fact that the free group can be so decomposed follows from the fact that it is non-amenable. I think we should put this in - It makes the discussion a little more transparent.</p>

<p>Banach–Tarski paradox is indeed counter intuitive but I'm not sure that what makes it counter intuitive is related to the axiom of choice. I would say that by using the axiom of choice one can get a counter intuitive result from another one which is already counter intuitive&#160;:</p>
<p>Think about a subset of the ball as something "covering" some part of the ball. The intuition tells us that when you move by a rotation a subset of the ball into the ball you will "uncover" some points and also "cover" some points which where "uncovered" before applying the rotation, but that these two phenomena will compensate each other. In fact this is not true in the non measurable world and this is the heart of the Banach–Tarski paradox.</p>
<p>More precisely the intuition tells us that it is impossible to find a subset X of the unit sphere (the sphere bounding the ball), apply a rotation to it and get a subset strictly included in X.</p>
<p>Similarly intuition tells us that it is impossible to find a subset X of the unit sphere which is strictly included in the sphere, apply a rotation to X and get something which stricly contains X.</p>
<p>This is nevertheless true&#160;:</p>
<p>Using the same notation as in the article take some x lying in the sphere (not on the rotation axis) and consider the subset of the sphere <span class="texhtml"><i>X</i> = <i>S</i>(<i>a</i> <sup>− 1</sup>).<i>x</i></span>. If one applies the rotation <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i> <sup>− 1</sup></span> to it we get something stricly included in X and if one apply the rotation <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span> to X one get something that strictly contain X. This is due to the fact that</p>

<p>You should realize that the Banach-Tarski paradox is only somewhat more strange than the fact that e.g. applying a shift to the left by 10 units of length to the set of all integers greater than 10 on the real line (and labeling corresponding points with their new values) produces a strictly bigger set - the set of all positive integers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, new to wikipedia so not totally sure how to talk in here, apologies. Just to pick up on this; the set of all positive integers is not a bigger set than the set of all integers greater than 10. Intuitively it seems to be, but there is a bijection between the two sets given by the function, i.e. f(x) = x - 10. So you can pair off one number from each set together: (1,11), (2,12), (3,13),... etc. In this way, the two sets have the same size. So the Banach-Tarski result is actually much stronger.

<dd>To expand on that, it's only with the Axiom of Choice that you can create those nonmeasurable sets that seem to become 'three times larger' when rigidly rotated. Without the Axiom of Choice, those sets don't exist, and the problem doesn't arise. Warren Dew 19:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, that's a little confused. Axioms aren't something you use to create sets, nor do they have any bearing on whether sets exist. Without the axiom of choice you can't <i>prove</i> that the sets exist.

<dd>Hey. Without the Axiom of Choice, you cannot show that nonmeasurable sets exist. This whole Banach-Tarski argument was originally intended (I believe) to show that the Axiom of Choice (AC) can be rejected as it does come up with such seemingly nonsensical consequences. Although nearly all mathematicians nowadays use AC, some do not accept it.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This is why the existence of these sets is in contention; if you do not accept AC, such sets cannot be shown to exist, so you do not accept the existence of such sets. I, on the other hand, assume AC is true, and so accept the existence of these sets. So it does make a big difference as to which mathematical perspective you look at this from!</dd>

<dd>I see your point that in that such sets existing <i>ought</i> to not be a matter of opinion, but whether or not you allow AC gives two different mathematical "worlds" - one where such sets can be shown to exist, and one where there is no reason at all to assume the existence of such sets. In this second case, you would assume that they do not exist, unless you could find a way to prove that they do without using AC. The article on Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory gives more information about all this. I hope this makes sense...&#160;:)Bobmonkeyofdoom 22:03, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, you're conflating epistemology and ontology here. Axioms don't give you worlds; they make <i>assertions</i> about those worlds. Now formalists will not accept the existence of those worlds at all, and that's fine; but even from the formalist point of view it's not accurate to speak about the axiom "creating" the sets. What the axiom does is enable a formal proof of a formalization of the claim that they exist; that formalization, for the formalist, is strictly speaking an uninterpreted string.</dd>
<dd>Of course this sort of syntax-only formalism is not the only alternative to realism; there are more nuanced intermediate views, like some sort of fictionalism, where the objects are considered not to exist in reality, but to be used by humans as a convenient guide to thought. Even in that view you shouldn't speak of assertions creating objects, though; it's a bad metaphor and therefore a bad guide to thought. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 22:38, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with everything you say here! I don't ever talk about axioms "creating" sets (or at least I didn't mean to give that impression), just that whether or not such sets exist is predicated on whether or not you accept AC as true. Is this a fair comment? I bow to your superior knowledge as having a PhD in Set Theory&#160;:) But as AC is not dependent on ZF, can you not either accept or not accept the existence of nonmeasurable sets based on whether you accept AC?Bobmonkeyofdoom 00:07, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I moved it back to a hyphen. I don't know what "current WP standard" you're referring to, but I've never seen an en dash used in this type of case anywhere else. In particular, in <a href="../../../t/e/x/TeX_cfe6.html" title="TeX">TeX</a> it's terribly easy to make an en dash (just type --), but even in TeX people use just a hyphen. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 12:01, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the case has been made that endashes are the correct way, so that we can know that Banach and Tarski are two people. I have come round to agreeing, despite the potential inconveniences. Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer then uniquely parses to two people. So, please don't move back like that.

<p>This is a popular paradox, and I believe that there are (relatively) many laypersons who may have a passing interest in what this thing is all about. In my opinion, it would be nice if there was a section here that would require very little background, intuitively explaining what the thing is about and wouldn't require much time to read (no equations!).</p>
<p>Sketch of how such a section could be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size comparison. Explain that if there is a one-to-one correspondence (a bijective function) between two sets, they aren't necessarily of the same size in the ordinary sense. Example about [0, 1] &lt;--y=2x--&gt; [0,2]. This is why <a href="../../../m/e/a/Measure_theory.html" title="Measure theory">measure theory</a> is necessary. Measure theory gives a notion of size (measure) that works much like <a href="../../../r/i/e/Riemann_integral.html" title="Riemann integral">Riemann integrals</a> do (I assume the layperson knows some basics about integrals, if he doesn't, all explanation is futile), but is more general. Even so, the "problem" with measure theory is that not all sets are measurable, just like not all functions can be integrated. These non-measurable sets are <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-measurable_set.html" title="Non-measurable set">weird beasts</a> for which our intuition does not work. (Are all/most fractals measurable? Would be good example either way, as they're also famous "weird geometry" beasts) See also <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantor_set.html" title="Cantor set">Cantor set</a> for a set with infinite number of points but measure of 0 (infinite amount of "Cantor dust" is still just dust; similarly, a curve has measure of 0 in two dimensions, because it does not have area, except for <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-filling_curve.html" title="Space-filling curve">weird beasts</a>).</li>
<li>Show that a set of points can easily be duplicated, if there are no restrictions as to what you can do with it. E.g. take a unit cube, cut it in two at x=0.5, then (translate and) multiply x of each point in the set with two, giving two exactly same sets of points as the original cube. This works the same way as one-to-one correspondence way of comparing set size: you might think that scaling x this way would leave "gaps" in the end result, but this is not so. Infinite sets are weird enough as they are. But the Banach-Tarski paradox is more paradoxical than just this.</li>
<li>The paradox in Banach-Tarski paradox is that if you take a (solid) sphere, cut it in 5 pieces (although non-measurable, weird beast pieces), then move and rotate these to their places, you get two exact copies of the original sphere. Being exact copies, they of course have the same measure, too. Note that there is no scaling here, and no carving of the curve to infinite number of pieces, or anything. All the "funny stuff" is in what the 5 pieces look like. Being non-measurable, such pieces of course can't exist in the real world, as all real world objects are measurable (we can't even carve things up to infinite precision, much less somehow invoke the axiom of choice).</li>
<li>Of the five pieces, one is for "fixing up" a small (<a href="../../../c/o/u/Countable.html" title="Countable">countable</a>) amount of gaps in the actual construction done with the other four pieces. The idea is to split the sphere in 4 parts in such a way that you can reassemble the original sphere from two of them, thus getting two original spheres. This reassembly is possible, because two of the pieces, which are supposed to be one-quarter of the size of the original sphere, actually become 3/4ths of the sphere when rotated by about 70.5 degrees. By performing this rotation on both of them, we get two 3/4ths of the sphere, and still have two 1/4 pieces to match. Combining these, we get two full spheres. However, this is merely an intuitive description, as the pieces are in fact non-measurable, and thus a notion that they are "quarter" or "3/4th" of the original sphere has no meaning. The construct thus escapes from the common fact that rotation preserves size by rotating pieces that do not <i>have</i> size. It just so happens, that when these pieces are combined to again produce measurable objects, the total size has magically doubled in the process.</li>
<li>For details, see the actual proof.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how exactly to phrase this, and my knowledge of the matter is rather superficial (I'm pretty much a layperson myself!), so I didn't dare actually try to modify the article.</p>
<p>The goals I was thinking of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not require much knowledge. (high school math is enough)</li>
<li>Provide (non-obscure!) references for further reading, to connect all this to a larger background.</li>
<li>Be clear in what is paradoxical and counterintuitive. This means explicitly pointing such things out.</li>
<li>Be clear in what is not paradoxical or counterintuitive. This means explicitly stating what part the paradox is restricted to. "At least I don't have to think about these parts" makes for easier comprehension.</li>
<li>Be clear in what the Banach-Tarski paradox is about, as opposed to what other (semi-)counterintuitive results there are.</li>
<li>Try to keep reader's interest instead of merely stating the facts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Too much to ask? Maybe. But in my opinion, an explanation like stated above would exist in an ideal encyclopedia entry, as not all interested readers know much of anything about modern math. (and an ideal encyclopedia is for everyone, right?&#160;:-)</p>
<p>It may be that some of the above would be better to put in a general article about geometrical paradoxes (and a link from here to that), but I think that merely referring to the articles about measure theory, related paradoxes, etc. would scare many away. Reading a layperson's section should require just about the same amount of effort as reading a popular science magazine article, and chasing hyperlinks in search of comprehensible and relevant information is a far cry from that.</p>

<dd>The pieces themselves are still infinitely convoluted and cannot actually be constructed physically (atoms are of a finite size, after all). So this still doesn't get anywhere near doing the decomposition "physically". But the fact that they can be translated, rotated, and reassembled without ever intersecting may be worth the mention.—<a href="../../../t/e/t/User%7ETetracube_a714.html" title="User:Tetracube">Tetracube</a> 06:01, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
