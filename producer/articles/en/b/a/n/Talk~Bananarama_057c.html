<p>What exactly is a "SAW" approach to music production, and is this article somewhat not NPOV? <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 11:00, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't write any of this article, but I'll chime in. My guess is that "SAW" refers to the producers <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock%2C_Aitken_and_Waterman_e2d0.html" title="Stock, Aitken and Waterman">Stock, Aitken and Waterman</a> mentioned earlier in the sentence; they must have some kind of distinct method for producing dance hits, but this article doesn't explore it further. While the article isn't scrupulously neutral (e.g., "dance enticing beats"), there's nothing there that would be out of place in mainstream music journalism. At the very least, it's not an advocacy article, such as an article that might say, for example: "Bananarama is the greatest girl group ever to come out of England, putting the Spice Girls to shame." That would be non-NPOV; this article is reasonably neutral. <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadder_9569.html" title="User:Vadder">Vadder</a> 22:26, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>New tags were added to this article today but I see that no explanation was offered on this talk page.

<p>Only one person said it was cool. I hadn't seen it before. It's not cool. Its not very badly off, but it does need sorting. I suppose perhaps the copyedit tag is enough... Or maybe actually it needs a 'style' tag instead. It is a terrible article and needs lots doing to it, I think it is two tags worth of badness, I agree that it is debatable which two tags it needs. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamiancorrigan_d621.html" title="User:Damiancorrigan">Damiancorrigan</a> 20:51, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So should it be "Bananarama ARE a British girl group" or "Bananarama IS a British girl group"??? I'm in favour of "are" being the correct grammar, as most other bands on Wikipedia are also styled this way. We also wouldn't say "In 1999 it released a new album", or "It's first number one" we would say use the plural, "In 1999 they released a new album", "Their first number one" so I think the opening statment should be in the plural. Anyone like to discuss?? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul75_3357.html" title="User:Paul75">Paul75</a> 23:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Grammatically I believe "IS" is correct. Although made up of three individuals, the article is describing ONE (singular) group. Its a common mistake people make and ultimately it would take forever to find all the instances of it on Wikipedia, but technically speaking, it should be "IS". -- <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 16:34, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, I can see your point. But would we say The Supremes is a Motown group or The Spice Girls is a British girl group? Is there an English professor in the house?! <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul75_3357.html" title="User:Paul75">Paul75</a> 18:53, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think in this situation it is "IS". Due to the fact that "Banarama" is clearly singular, where as the likes of "The Spice Girls" and "The Supremes" are clearly plurals, so would become "ARE".Redcar987 18:50, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is a horrifying justification. The style guidelines dictate that this particular grammatical atrocity be allowed to stand in articles dealing with North American bands (The Dolphins score! Miami wins!) , but it is quite definitely illiterate in UK English. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 19:02, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The Wow album peaked at number one in Australia, not number two, although it only held the top spot for one week. The placing of The Greatest Hits Collection at number 23 is also erroneous as it made the Top 10, although I am unsure of it's final peak.. As for Every Shade Of Blue, I understand it did indeed enter the Australian singles charts and peak at the dizzy heights of number 99. It was widely available for purchase in Australia, as was the Ultra Violet album. Can anyone verify??</p>

<p>Hi all: Should "Waterloo" be included in the discography somewhere? I don't know if it was ever actually released as a single, but they did make a video of it. (It is mentioned in the Career section but not in the list of singles/songs.)<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzaiboy_8f53.html" title="User:Banzaiboy">Banzaiboy</a> 04:31, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My vote is no. It was a one-off recording and there was no single made available for it. Was it played on the radio or anything? Mentioning it within the article is sufficient, I think. -- <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 11:16, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One option might be to create a list or section for non-album, non-single recordings such as:
<dl>
<dd>1. "Riskin' a Romance" from <i>The Secret of My Success</i> soundtrack</dd>
<dd>2. "Cairo" (can't remember which soundtrack that was on)</dd>
<dd>3. "Love, Leave, Forget"</dd>
<dd>4. "Waterloo"</dd>

<dd>I think there are some other songs as well from their early days. Any thoughts or suggestions? --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzaiboy_8f53.html" title="User:Banzaiboy">Banzaiboy</a> 05:45, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd agree with something like that... perhaps even a full list of B-sides? If we get that detailed, I'd suggest sticking it on the discography page rather than in the main article. -- <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 11:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Correct English grammar for numbers for single numbers to be indicated by the word (i.e. number eight) whilst double or more digit numbers are indicated by the number itself (Top 40, 26th) NOT written as twenty-sixth, top forty etc. Can anyone else agree or disagree?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe standard English has the spelling-out of numbers lower than 100. Abbraviations such as 26th (as far as I know), may not be a standard internationally, which is why I personally don't use them, but I may be wrong about that one. -- <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 02:17, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've never heard of a guideline that numbers be spelled out below 100, I would normally use numerical values for anything which obviously represented a statistical value rather than a mere observation. I'm rather more concerned about the undiscussed change to US English, which I've now reverted. Not only was it piecemeal (leaving all sorts of plural pronouns), Bananarama are English and the style guidelines dictate that this means the article should preferably be presented in UK English. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 19:00, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Standard English in England spells put numbers below 10, every thing else is indicated bt the number. 26, not twenty-sixth etc. As it is an Englsih band I propose we stick to correct English grammar</dd>
