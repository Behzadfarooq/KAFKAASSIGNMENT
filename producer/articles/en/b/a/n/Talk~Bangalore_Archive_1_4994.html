Wikipedia is not a Telugu blog / web site to advertise baseless arguements about the origin of the name "bengaluru". The arguements found in the article "telugu history behind name of Bengaluru" does not help foster harmony and peace in India's most cosmopolitian city. I have taken the liberty to delete the article. Some of the arguements betray our inherent disunity and lack of knowledge about our history.</p>

<p>"The document describing the city as he conceptualised it, written in Telugu the commonly spoken language of this region, is still preserved. This language is still spoken in the villages of Bangalore, Yelahanka, Devanahalli, Doddaballapur, Hoskote, Anekal and Hosur districts."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Theories on origin of name and Conclusions therein</span></h2>
<p>I see several hastily put together theories to the origin of the name "Bengaluru". I happened to go thru a blog site linked to this page at the bottom. The blog is called "Telugu origins ...." something. My question is how come nobody ever brought up these issues prior to the government's decision to change the name. To me the answer is simple. Now that the government is giving a "Kannada" identity to the name, people from outside Karnataka but settled in Bangalore are all too eager to link Bangalore's name to their own roots (be it Telugu or Tamil). A few years back many people were all too sure that other cities like Hyderabad would surpass Bangalore in IT (which could still happen). I think this is a natural reaction. One inscription from 17th centuary in front of a temple or one document in Telugu supposedly written during Kempe Gowda's time does not mean anything, just as a 9th century Kannada Inscription in Jabalpur. Madhya Pradesh (dated to the Imperial Rashtrakutas) does not mean that Jabalpur had majority Kannada population. It only indicates that Kannada had spread as far north as Jabalpur. This period in history is called the time of "imperial Kannada". It is very easy to come to hasty conclusions with a knee jerk reactions. Bangalore itself is located at the junction of 3 states (Karnataka/AP and Tamil Nadu). Kolar which is the district right next to Bangalore was the battleground for countless number of wars, especially between competing Kannada and Tamil kingdoms and was called Kolahalapura (city of destruction). Parts of South Karnataka as been keenly fought over by these two great competitors for ages, mainly over Kaveri river. It is not surprising that one can find Hoysala/Chola/Vijayanagar/Nolamba structures/monuments in this part of Karnataka. Even today Bangalore is a mixture of Kannada/Telugu and Tamil people. It makes no sense for Kannada and Telugu people to battle over whether "Bengaluru" is a Kannada or a Telugu name because both languages emerged from "old Kannada" that was the main spoken language across the deccan possibly from 7th century - 12th century during the rule of the mighty <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalukyas.html" title="Chalukyas">Chalukyas</a> of Badami &amp; Kalyana and <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakutas.html" title="Rashtrakutas">Rashtrakutas</a> of Manyaketha who ruled from what is today Karnataka, just as it makes no sense for Marathi's of Belgaum to claim it has to be a part of Maharashtra. The earliest Marathi inscriptions dated 981 AD were discovered in Hassan district, just like the earliest Kannada inscriptions from Halmidi dated 425AD -450AD, a village in Hassan. What we call today as Karnataka has given India a lot, a lot of action has always happened here and still continues that tradition. This region we call Karnataka is the origin of carnatic music, udupi cuisine, haridasa movement, Vesera style of architecture (also called the Karnata Dravida or deccan style or chalukya-hoysala style), home to some of India's mightiest empires (Chalukyas/Rashtrakutas/Vijayanagar Empire), Indias oldest silk culture (mysore silk)&amp; our IT revolution. Hence its no wonder that people of different languages and cultures want to share our successes as their success too. What matters most is that the people of Karnataka create an eclectic atmosphere so that talent from other parts of the country can add to our own achivements and embellish the name of Karnataka. This is what the world sees. Lets all be proud of that and call it peace.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ORIGIN OF NAME</span></h2>
<p>Telugu closely resembles 'OLD KANNADA or HalaGannada". The Telugu script itself was derived from the "old Kannada" script over a prolonged period starting from around 13th century AD.The Ganga inscription/vir gal(hero stone) indicating the earliest name of Bangalore is probabaly "old Kannada", NOT Telugu. The Ganga dynasty of Talkad (western Gangas) are a proven Kannada kingdom, as all their inscriptions are in old Kannada. Please refer to history of Kannada and Telugu languages for better understanding of the issue. In <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada_literature.html" title="Kannada literature">Kannada literature</a>, the <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> classic "<a href="../../../k/a/v/Kavirajamarga.html" title="Kavirajamarga">Kavirajamarga</a>" (9th century AD) makes references to earlier Kannada works written by Ganga King Durvinitha around begining of 6th century. Please refer to "History of Karnataka By Arthikaje" at <a href="http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm</a> to better understand history of Gangas of Talkad.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shopping in Bangalore??</span></h2>
<p>I was surprised to see that a shopping section does not exist for Bangalore. With the rise of the Mall culture in India, Bangalore is becoming one of the major shopping hubs in India. If no one has a problem, I don't mind starting a section on this topic.</p>

<dd>A section for shopping will not be appropriate here.

Info about shopping can probably go under <i>culture</i>. Right now, there is an <i>urban life</i> section, which needs to be merged with culture.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">House rules for nicknames</span></h2>
<p>I would like everyone to look into some house rules as far as monikers and nicknames go. We've seen many nicknames for Bangalore like City of Lakes, London of Asia, Fashion Capital of India and now Pensioners Paradise, and so on. I think it makes sense to consider just a couple of nicknames, since, even on a national scale no one really equates them to mean Bangalore straight off the bat. Silicon Valley of India is now an "established" nickname and Garden City is what Bangalore was historically called. I can't think of any reason to keep adding nicknames. They contribute little to the overall understanding of the city itself and are often very misleading. Furthermore, they may not necessarilly be accepted by everyone in the region, let alone the nation. Comments welcome. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 02:33, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>While i agree with the gist of your comment, I disagree that we need to include nicknames that bangalore is known for at the international level and that they don't contribute to the city's overall understanding. For eg, Bangalore was called 'Pensioner's Paradise' because it did have a large no. of people who were working in PSU's,Defence forces,etc., who preferred to settle here and which in turn explains the large educated middle class.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'city of lakes' nick isn't far fetched, since Bangalore had atleast a 100 lakes, most of which were taken over by land sharks &amp; the corporation. Heck, my layout in b'lore was an old lake &amp; the tank bed still passes thro my outhouse.(me going into nostalgia&#160;:-D ). To summarise, we should not make blanket policies, but rather decide on a case by case basis. <a href="../../../p/a/m/User%7EPamri_2da3.html" title="User:Pamri">pamri</a> 13:47, 2004 Sep 13 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for replying. Just saying "Pensioners Paradise" or whatever dosen't really tell anyone about Bangalore, especially if those people have never been to the city and want to know more about it. I makes more sense to elaborate and say why it was/is a pensioner's paradise (as you have indicated above), etc. If I've never been to the city and I visit this page and I see "Pensioner's paradise", I'd want to know why it is called that. Merely citing nicknames dosen't add to the understanding of the city. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 15:45, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll tell you why "Bangalored" should be left out. I was born and partly brought up in Bangalore and I live in the United States. There are lot of things that have made Bangalore prominent -- "Bangalored" is not one of them! "Bangalored" if anything, is a reflection of the paranoia of a bunch of slackers who just couldn't keep up with the competition than anything else. I do not consider it to be hommage (in disguise or otherwise) to Bangalore. I consider it to be hurtful and insensitive. If you want to talk about "Bangalored", take it to the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outsourcing.html" title="Outsourcing">outsourcing</a> article.

<p>While not remotely an expert, I first read the entry on Bangalore recently, and was surprised to find it described as India's third largest city. Looking around at several web sources (including Wikipedia itself), it seems pretty clear that Mumbai, Delhi, and Calcutta/Kolkata are each over 15M (the first two close to 20M), while Bangalore is less than half that. The sources I have seen may not be 100% current or accurate, but they are not <i>that</i> far off. Actually, Chennai/Madras appears to be a bit larger, and Hyderabad just about the same as, Bangalore. But the last are within the likely inaccuracies of population estimates. --<a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 04:03, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The statistic you are quoting from is accurate, but reflect "major urban agglomerations" (what they call "metropolitan areas" in the United States) rather than the actual size of the city. An agglomeration includes the city itself, plus surrounding suburbs and sattelite cities. However, if you check the statistic for the size of the city (the link is provided at the end of the sentence that says "third largest city.."), you'll find that Bangalore is larger than both Chennai and Calcutta. Also, the term "agglomeration" dosen't really hold much meaning for Bangalore, because this is an area where most of its people live within the city itself. I'm not sure what the statistics are on that, but if you check the population of Bangalore city vs. the population of Bangalore urban agglomeration, I think you'll find the city accounts for about 75-80% of the agglomeration population. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 16:20, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I put in a parenthetical noting urban areas. The size of a "city proper" is often a somewhat arbitrary political/historical issue that does not reflect real demographic and economic trends. For example, in a USAian context, we pretty universally (and correctly) speak of Minneapolis/St.Paul, even though they are legalistically separate jurisdictions. OTOH, Los Angeles is quite a ways down the list of "largest US cities" according to administrative boundaries, but in a everyday language sense is the "2nd largest US city" (and pushing at 1st largest). --<a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 01:22, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I'm trying to get at with my argument here is that unlike other cities in India which have satellite townships/suburbs, Bangalore dosen't. Therefore, within the context of your argument, the term "city" (and any statictic therein) clearly articulates the "real demographic and economic trends" of Bangalore. You are right when you note that in an American context, urban areas warrant a discussion. A discussion of Chicago, for example, and its suburbs correctly identifies the demographic trends of "Chicagoland" (city and suburbs) because of the number of people that live in the suburbs, but contribute, economically to the city of Chicago. Also consider the wide divergence of the population of Chicago as a city and Chicago as an urban area (2.841 million vs. 9.418 million). You will not find such a divergence from a Bangalore point of view (4.91 million vs. 6.06 million), simply because the people that identify demographically with the city of Bangalore live, and work within the city. The term "urban area" really has no meaning for this city. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 14:41, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aaggh! What AreJay writes in "disagreement" with my point is actually <i>exactly</i> what I'm trying to include in the entry! Some urban areas (population density clusters) correspond with city limits pretty well, other urban areas do not so correspond. Bangalore City==Bangalore urban area; but Kolkata City!=Kolkata urban area. It's not a difference between US and India, a similar distinction occurs in most every country.</p>
<p>When we vernacularly talk about the size of various cities, more often than not we really mean "urban area." <b>No one</b> in the USA, for example would normally say that "LA is the 10th largest US city" without adding something like "in a technical sense, based on city borders." I dare say that no one in India would describe Kolkata as "India's seventh largest city" without similar caveats about "in a technical/legal sense." I'm not against including the stuff about population within the city borders, but it is <b>deceptive</b> to omit any reference to what most folks mean: urban areas. --<a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 21:41, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me be concrete here. I first read the Bangalore entry last week, not having much knowledge about Bangalore. In the first paragraph I read it was the "third largest city in India" with some considerable surprise. Sure, I thought, it's a major city, but what about Mumbai, Calcutta, Dheli, which I know are huge?! (some other cities I knew as major, but not clearly larger than Bangalore). After putting it in the back of my brain for a couple days, it just felt like soemthing wasn't right about what I read. <i>Now</i> I understand the technical/legal sense in which the claim was correct, but the overall impression initially given was certainly wrong. What was wrong is that normal people normally think of "metropolitan area" when they discuss the size of cities, whether or not the city borders correspond very well with a metropolitan area. The point need not belabored in the entry, but it should not be omitted entirely. --<a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 21:57, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know why you or anyone else would be "considerably surprised" to hear that Bangalore is India's third largest city. It was always a major city and is now the fastest growing city in the country and has been for sometime. I doubt you are going to elicit any element of surprise from anyone living in and familiar with India with that statement.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You also go on to say <i>"..but what about Mumbai, Calcutta, Dheli, which I know are huge?!"</i>. Well, what about them??? Two out of the three cities you just mentioned are larger than Bangalore in terms of the population of the city and the urban area. There really is no contest between Delhi and Bangalore or Mumbai and Bangalore. Those two cities are many times larger than Bangalore. You also contend that "several" smaller cities have larger metropolitan areas. This is untrue. Out of all the cities in India that are smaller than Bangalore only Calcutta and Chennai have larger metropolitan areas. <a href="http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1109715919&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;gln=xx&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-104&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=aohdq&amp;va=&amp;pt=a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1109715919&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;gln=xx&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-104&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=aohdq&amp;va=&amp;pt=a" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>I don't know what all that "technical/legal sense" talk was all about. If I say Calcutta is the 4th largest city in India, I mean it is the 4th largest <b>city</b> in India! If I want to talk to the metropolitian area, I'd say Calcutta is the 3rd largest <b>urban agglomeration</b> in India! I don't see the reason for any rider or caveat there. It is only misleading if you don't understand the difference between a city and urban area.</dd>

<p>OK, I'm perfectly happy with the way you phrased it now (almost the same as my first try, in fact). Remember that not all readers of Wikipedia are demographers, legislators, or urban planners. For 98% of readers, the distinction between "city" and "urban area" is fuzzy, and mostly accidental. If the state of CA USA were to change the boundaries of Los Angeles, or the state of West Bengal were to change the boundaries of Kolkata, each <b>city</b> could triple in size overnight without anyone moving in our out (and such administrative/jurisdicational changes are far from unheard of). The ordinary, predominant, sense of "city" that does not necessarily reflect jurisdicational boundaries is really very sensible. Moreover, the entries for a large majority of the cities listed in Wikipedia (at least from the limited sample I've checked), and certainly in Brittanica or the like, give both city and metro-area numbers for clarification. --<a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:41, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Notice also that Wikipedia itself is far from as unambivalent about the meaning of <i>city</i> than AreJay proclaims is self-evident. The definition given in Wikipedia <b>does not</b> say: "A geographic region under common jurisdiction" but rather "A city is an urban area, differentiated from a town, village, or hamlet by size, population density, importance, <b>or</b> legal status." In fact, the first part of the definition claims, contra AreJay that a city <b>is</b> an urban area; the second clause lists legal status as just one of several possible differentiating factors. --<a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:50, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad we're on some sort of agreement. I'd just like to point out though that you don't have to be a demographer, legislator or urban planner (I certainly don't claim to be any one of them) to know the distinction between a city and an urban area. As you correctly point out, most entries on Wikipedia give both city and metro-area numbers for clarification. You will find that the Bangalore article has always displayed statistics on city and metro-area numbers and clearly distinguished the difference.(see right hand side table on article page). They are updated as and when new numbers are available. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 13:37, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no way Bangalore is bigger than Chennai or Calcutta, even including all its suburbs. No data official or otherwise would support this claim. Bangalore is a major city, but please do try to portray it bigger than it actually is.</p>

<dd>Hi Jayanthv86 — according to Wikipedia, the definition of "<a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmopolitan.html" title="Cosmopolitan">cosmopolitan</a>" is "cosmopolitan describes something influenced by many cultures from around the world". By definition therefore, does it not imply, if we are to refer to Bangalore as a cosmopolitan city, that the culture of the city is characterized by various strains of cultures including that of the majority culture? If the presence of other cultures in Bangalore is not evident, as you say, is the city cosmopolitan at all?

<p>Yes,i agree with AreJay that the lists have gotten longer,and moreover the school's name was added by anon ip's.So,i have deleted it.Moreover i am a user against advertisements(see my user page).Mention of technical colleges is good.But mention of secondary schools and PU colleges will make this a mess.Hence,i have removed all school names.i repeat:No advertisements in Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanthv86_60d9.html" title="User:Jayanthv86">Jayanthv86</a> 18:06, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>...silver coins of Roman emperors Augustus, Tiberius and Claudius have been excavated in and around present-day Bangalore, but have not revealed much about its contemporaneous inhabitants.</i></p>
<p>Can the person who added this clarify its validity and / or cite the source? I am not a historian, but for some reason doubt the validity of the statement. Are we saying there was contact between Ancient Rome and India? <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 17:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yes please cite the source,or else you can find me with a spade digging the aldready battered Bangalore roads searching for rare ancient coins.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanthv86_60d9.html" title="User:Jayanthv86">Jayanthv86</a> 18:01, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ghettoization</span></h2>
<p><i>A recent trend in the urban development of Bangalore is the <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghettoization.html" title="Ghettoization">ghettoization</a> of the city's IT and <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge_economy.html" title="Knowledge economy">knowledge economy</a> workforce into self-contained gated communities. Moreover, a bulk of the IT and knowledge economy workers are not domiciled within the state of Karnataka. This has led to a general perception in state level political circles (who derive a bulk of their political power from rural Karnataka) that Bangalore is not a potential vote block during elections, and hence infrastructure development activities within the city do not carry high political weight.</i></p>
<p>Can someone who understand what this paragraph was intended to convey reword it so that it makes sense? I can't seem to understand what the idea behind the paragraph is. What is a "self-contained gated community"?? <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 14:25, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">City Taxi numbers</span></h2>
<p>Would it amount to advertising if we gave the citi taxi phone numbers&#160;? With so many unconnected citi taxi operators, (each mostly operating in one area of Bangalore) it may be worthwhile to give some numbers but then, the list may grow too long. Hmm...
