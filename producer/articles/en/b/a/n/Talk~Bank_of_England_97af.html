<dd>The Bank of England, like the US Federal Reserve, is not a government institution at all but essentially a private bank. While it is mentioned on it's own homepage that the Bank was "nationalised" in 1946, the truth of this is far from certain. It is suspected that the real controllers of the Bank of England have been the Rothschild family since Nathan Rothschild instigated a stock market crash (and then bought up all the dumped stock) on the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. "The Money Changers" by Patrick Carmack is one source, this can be found at <a href="http://reactor-core.org/money-changers.html" class="external free" title="http://reactor-core.org/money-changers.html" rel="nofollow">http://reactor-core.org/money-changers.html</a>.</dd>

<p><i>It was very popular with the City of London, showing a sign of the new government's desire for a strong economy. Following the announcement the FTSE 100 Index leapt rapidly. The pound reached its highest level against the Deutsche mark since Sterling's exit from the ERM.</i></p>
<p>These remarks don't hold up when viewing the data. The FTSE didn't move a significant amount given the volatility of the period. The move in May (2.7%) was smaller than the previous April (4.4%) or the subsequent move in June (3.7%) (Bloomberg). These moves are about 1 standard deviation, i.e. not unusual. Similarly for the pound/mark rate. There appears to be no reaction in May, the peak was reached in the end of July (a reaction to US rates news), and subsequently moved sideways/down. I suggest that at best the reaction "In the City" was mixed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 135.196.109.220 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_135.196.109.220_a96d.html" title="Special:Contributions/135.196.109.220">contribs</a>).</small> on 17 May 2006.</p>

<p>I am wondering: who, exactly, sets interest rates? And what does 'target inflation rate' mean? Is the target a target range? Or a single, precise figure? How often is the bank 'on target'? <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurel_Bush_dd09.html" title="User:Laurel Bush">Laurel Bush</a> 16:30, 30 June 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>The Bank of England does. Note however that the Bank of England is a private institution, therefore the interest rates of this country are not set by government or by fiscal policy, but by a private organisation which has its own profit as its bottom line. Nice, huh?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's how it works. The government, a long long time ago, probably in the late 1600s - early 1700s, gave sole permission for printing money to the Bank of England. Basically the government asks the Bank of England for money, for whatever purposes it has in mind, which the Bank issues at a certain interest rate (set by itself). We the taxpayers then pay our taxes, council tax, VAT, window tax, swamp duty, air tax, water tax, you name it, everything that the government can tax, which money is then used to pay the interest (and if we're REALLY lucky, the principal too) on the governments loans from the Bank of England. So when governments insist on more tax, it isn't because they don't have enough money but rather it is because they have borrowed too much and they can't meet the repayments; this begs the question who gave them the authority to carry on spending in our names, but I won't get into that!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Inflation is basically when there is too much money in circulation and therefore what there is is effectively devalued. Remember that inflation only exists when the money-issuers (in this case the Bank of England) issue too much money; this begs the question of course that if they issued too much, did they issue too much deliberately, or are they just incompetent?! Let's leave out the incompetent - I think it's fairly safe to assume that people in that position are rarely incompetent! Therefore, that only leaves the suspicion that inflation is a mechanism of fiscal control used by Central Banks the world over.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Inflation is something that has only existed in modern times, when gold &amp; silver standards were abolished (by the Central Banks!) for that very reason. It's all about control. As much as people think that the Bank of England (and every other Central Bank) is there to look after a countrys finances, they really aren't. If that were the case, we wouldn't be talking about private institutions who answer to shareholders. They are there to make a profit, and if that means bankrupting entire countries (as has happened, numerous times), then that's just tough for those at the bottom of the pile who habitually lose out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Theoretically, inflation targeting is all about accounting and how the value of money changes from year to year. If a government sets a policy that is going to cost x amount if the 3 years it will take to implement, it helps to have an idea of what the real cost of that policy is, when inflation is taken into account. And if inflation can be controlled and taken into account, those types of accounting practices are made easier. Basically, when they set an inlation target they are betting on exactly how much further your money will have been devalued (by themselves!) in a given time period. How often they are on target is difficult to say; remember that we are effectively talking about people rigging the deck here. They know how much money they are issuing, therefore they know how much it is worth in real terms at all times, therefore they know exactly what rate inflation is running at at any given time. You could therefore extend that to mean that inflation only ever exists at the behest of the Central Bank (the Bank of England in the UKs case), and therefore it is totally irrelevant whether or not they are on target. Does it really matter to you whether inflation over the whole year ran at 2.15%, or at 2.2%? You can't do anything about it, and you can't avoid using your money, so you just have to take it on the chin.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>The inequities of the world banking system are without a doubt responsible for more death, destruction and misery on this planet than anything else, with the possible exception of the mosquito, and one doesn't have to dig very far at all to see how glaringly corrupt the whole thing is. The fact that the Bank of England is a private institution should be enough to get every working man in the country on the streets in minutes; what is even more amazing is that so few are aware of these facts, and that there are even those who will argue tooth and nail that the Bank of England is a first-class democratic institution ran by perfect gentlemen with no regard for themselves. What becomes even more incredible is when one finds out that not only is the Bank of England a PRIVATE institution ultimately, but that it has in actual fact been controlled by one family since 1815. The same family which effectively controls the US Federal Reserve. Lucky family....!!!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, JFK was assassinated soon after announcing plans to remove the US Federal Rserve from the American money-issuing system under Executive Order 11110 in order to get the US budget deficit under control. Suffice to say, this was not a popular idea among the real rulers of the country. Coincidentally, Abraham Lincoln was trying to do exactly the same a hundred years before. At no other times have any similar suggestions been made about who issues money in America...</dd>
</dl>
<p>Err, i think your argument falls down in the first paragrpah you are approximately 60 years out of date, the bank of england was nationalised in 1946, as such it is part of the government.</p>
<p>Here is a link to a copy of the 1946 Act, <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/legislation/1946act.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/legislation/1946act.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/legislation/1946act.pdf</a></p>
<p>And here is a link to all the key legislation from 1694 onwards <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/legislation/legis.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/legislation/legis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/legislation/legis.htm</a></p>

<dd>If you wish to believe that, then that is your right. The Bank of England SAYS it was nationalised - but then, the Federal Reserve purports to be part of the US Government. It is not. The Bank of England started out as a private institution for which there was a share floatation; check the history books. If it started out life as a private, for-profit institution, why one day should it nationalise itself? And more to the point, why would it expect us to BELIEVE it had nationalised itself. Key legislation? Don't make me laugh out loud!! Would that include anything about the initial floatation by any chance - which was never even paid in full? Get that, would you?! A private corporation which owns the whole country - and the full price was never even paid! Come on now, open your eyes and look around you. The government SAYS there is a War on Terror - but all there REALLY is is a war on liberty and dissent. The US government says its only philosphy is democracy - and both you and I know nothing could be further from the truth. So why would you believe the word of the very institutions who are BEHIND our lying governments?!</dd>

<dd>Nationalising the Bank of England in 1946, which might seem at first sight to be a far reaching measure, made no difference in practice. Yes, the state did acquire all the shares in the Bank of England - they now belong to the Treasury and are held in trust by the Treasury Solicitor.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, the government had no money to pay for the shares, so instead of receiving money for their shares, the shareholders were issued with government stocks. Although the state now received the operating profits of the bank, this was offset by the fact that the government now had to pay interest on the new stocks it had issued to pay for the shares. Therefore, "nationalising" the Bank Of England made no practical difference whatsoever and was in effect nothing more than a paper exercise to give the illusion of legitimacy.</dd>

<dd>It is suspected by serious economists that the Rothschild family control around 55% of all the world's wealth, and they are rumoured to be worth in excess of $400 TRILLION. Yes, it makes a mockery of Bill Gates $45 Billion. What power to be ON the rich lists. What incredible power to be THAT wealthy and yet appear on none... The latter part of the 19th Century was known as The Age of the Rothschilds. Even in the early 1800s they were known as "The World's Bankers", and it was also said in that time that "the wealth of the Rothschilds constitutes the bankruptcy of nations". It is strongly suspected that they control the US Federal Reserve via their control of a majority of the banks that make up the Federal Reserve System. It is also suspected that, because they control the wealth of at least the UK, the USA, France, Germany and Russia, they have overall control of the European Central Bank and the World Bank.</dd>

<p>If it's the UK's central bank, then I think that there should be a note explaining why it didn't become the "Bank of Great Britain" and "The Bank of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" in the 1707 and 1800 acts of Union respectively. Does anyone know why this is the case? Thanks <a href="../../../l/o/f/User%7ELofty_b59b.html" title="User:Lofty">Lofty</a> 17:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Scotland_e5c3.html" title="Bank of Scotland">Bank of Scotland</a> is historically Scotland's national reserve, and was established by an act of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Scotland_b6d1.html" title="Parliament of Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> in 1695, the year after the BoE, (which incidentally was founded by a Scotsman). However, post the 1707 <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Union_0d44.html" title="Act of Union">Act of Union</a>, all fiscal, economic blah matters were centralised on the BoE. Similarly the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Ireland_2787.html" title="Bank of Ireland">Bank of Ireland</a> was established before the 1800 Act of Union in 1783. The BoS still to this day, has the power, along with other banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland to print its own money, the bank of Ireland however, along with other financial houses based in the Republic deal with Euros rather than Sterling now. Prior to the various acts of union, the BoE acted as a clearing bank much like its counterparts and only in the 19th c. did it drop private clients to concentrate on the economy of the Empire. Interestingly enough there are one or two private account holders left with the BoE, as the accounts are passed down heriditarily. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendandh_25f1.html" title="User:Brendandh">Brendandh</a> 02:18, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBank_of_England_97af.html" title="Edit section: Centrist views">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Centrist views</span></h2>
<p>"There is a notion -- widely believed in the mainstream media -- that while there is propaganda of the left and propaganda of the right, there is no such thing as propaganda of the center. In this view, the center doesn't produce propaganda, it produces straight news. Mainstream journalists typically explain: "We don't tilt left, we don't tilt right. We're straight down the middle of the road. We're dead center."</p>
<p>When mainstream journalists tell me during debates that "our news doesn't reflect bias of the left or the right," I ask them if they therefore admit to reflecting bias of the center. Journalists react as if I've uttered an absurdity: "Bias of the center! What's that?"</p>
<p>It is a strange concept to many in the media. They can accept that conservatism or rightism is an ideology that carries with it certain values and opinions, beliefs about the past, goals for the future. They can accept that leftism carries with it values, opinions, beliefs. But being in the center -- being a centrist -- is somehow not having an ideology at all. Somehow centrism is not an "ism" carrying with it values, opinions and beliefs."</p>
<p>But instead of belaboring the point that the centrist media are currently tilting rightward, I'd like to address some elements of centrist news propaganda that are somewhat constant.</p>
<p><b>Centrist Cliches</b></p>
<p>If, for simplicity's sake, we define the left as seeking substantial social reform toward a more equitable distribution of wealth and power, and we define the right as seeking to undo social reform and regulation toward a free marketplace that allows wide disparities in wealth and power, then we can define the political center as seeking to preserve the status quo, tinkering with the system only very prudently to work out what are seen as minor glitches, problems or inequities.</p>
<p>How do these three positions play out journalistically? Unlike left-wing or right-wing publications which are often on the attack, centrist propaganda emphasizes system-supporting news, frequently speaking in euphemisms. If scandals come to light, centrist propaganda often focuses less on the scandal than on how well "the system works" in fixing it. (This was the editorial drumbeat in the papers of record following both Watergate and Iran-Contra.) When it comes to foreign policy, centrist propaganda sometimes questions this or that tactic, but it never doubts that the goal of policy is anything other than promoting democracy, peace and human rights. Other countries may subvert, destabilize or support terrorism. The U.S. just wages peace.</p>
<p>If propaganda from the center only emphasized the upbeat, pointing so much to silver linings that it never acknowledged the existence of clouds, there'd be a credibility problem. The public wouldn't believe such bland, euphemistic reporting. So, in selective cases, centrist propaganda does talk tough about government tyrants -- especially if they're foreign tyrants or U.S. officials already deposed. (J. Edgar Hoover was one such tyrant, whose 50-year reign at the FBI was rigorously scrutinized by the mainstream media only after he was dead and buried.) And centrist propaganda can take a tough look at a social problem -- especially if it's deemed fixed or on its way to being fixed.</p>
<p>Another hallmark of centrist propaganda is to affirm, no matter what the evidence, that U.S. foreign policy is geared toward promoting democracy. Journalists are not unaware that the U.S. helped overthrow democratic governments, for example, in Guatemala in '54, (Iran in '53), Brazil in '64, Chile in '73 -- but these cases are considered ancient history, no longer relevant. (In centrist ideology, since the system is constantly fixing and renewing itself, U.S. abuses -- even against democracy -- become distant past overnight.)</p>
<p>Mainstream journalists respond to such criticism by explaining that articles for the daily press are not history texts and cannot include everything. That's true, but centrist propaganda finds space for certain histories and not others. Many if not most of the reports on Hungary's transition from Communism traced human rights abuses to the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956. By contrast, reports on Guatemala's current human rights situation rarely traced events to the U.S.-sponsored coup of 1954.</p>
<p><b>Good Guys Caught Between Left and Right</b></p>
<p>Besides consistently promoting peace and democracy overseas, according to centrist propaganda, the U.S. also consistently supports the good guys abroad. Not surprisingly, the good guys are always "centrists" on the political spectrum. At least that's what the media make them out to be. And there's another media cliche one hears about our good guys, the centrists: They are perpetually hemmed in by the bad guys of left and right.</p>
<p>For years, as El Salvador's armed forces and allied death squads murdered thousands of civilians, media pundits told us that massive U.S. aid to Salvador's military was needed to bolster "centrists" such as Jose Napoleon Duarte. In the media mantra of the time, Duarte was "hemmed in by death squads on the right and guerrillas on the left." In using that cliche, centrist media chose to promote a dubious State Department line, while ignoring groups such as Americas Watch and Amnesty International that had documented that the security forces of the Duarte government worked hand in glove with the death squads.</p>

<p>I should welcome a Wikipedia entry on the dollar premium. This was the premium which (at least) UK-resident private investors had to pay to purchase non-sterling quoted securities. The level of the premium was determined by supply and demand, since the amount of foreign currency available was finite.</p>
<p>The premium must have disappeared automatically when UK exchange controls were abolished in 1979. I do not know when it began. My guesses would be 1931, 1965, start of World War II, and 1949.</p>
