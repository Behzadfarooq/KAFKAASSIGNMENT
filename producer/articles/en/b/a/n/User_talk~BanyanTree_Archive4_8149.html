<p>Hi again BanyanTree,<br />
I don't know if a) you're still watching the page or b) I've understood you correctly, but following your comments about the <a href="../../../w/u/e/Wuerzburg_radar.html" title="Wuerzburg radar">Wuerzburg radar</a> page where you suggested a page move might be necessary, I added a Requested Move to <a href="../../../w/%C3%BC/r/W%C3%BCrzburg_radar.html" title="Würzburg radar">Würzburg radar</a>, which is currently a redirect. There's been a vote open for 3 days now and the only opposition so far has been the page author, but there hasn't been any support either - if you've got a moment would you mind having a look at the <a href="../../../w/u/e/Talk%7EWuerzburg_radar_2c04.html" title="Talk:Wuerzburg radar">talk</a> page? If on the other hand that wasn't what you meant about a page move, feel free to correct me! Cheers again, -- <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYummifruitbat_2d22.html" title="User:Yummifruitbat">Yummifruitbat</a> 10:23, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Yummifruitbat,</dd>
<dd>I did think that you might want to move Wuerzburg to Würzburg, since that is what you had been using. There is clearly no consensus to move so it looks like it's going to stay unless you get another vote or two. Alternatively, you can continue trying to convince Philip to drop his objection since you seem to have a point about the search algorithm.</dd>
<dd>While this is no longer an option in this case since a vote has been started, most users will just move pages without putting it up for a vote unless they actually don't know what they think about the potential move or the page is prominent enough that running it by the regular contributors would be polite. You certainly run the risk of somebody getting irritated and moving the page back this way, but being bold helps avoid unnecessary discussions. There is certainly nothing wrong with trying to determine the consensus of a page move though. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 15:19, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I did try to move the page myself without putting it to a vote, but because 'Würzburg radar' has a previous edit history the move wouldn't go through. Then I followed the "page could not be moved" instructions and put it on Requested Moves - Philip Baird Shearer started the vote. He was the original author so perhaps it's not surprising he opposes! I'll work on him and see what transpires... <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYummifruitbat_2d22.html" title="User:Yummifruitbat">Yummifruitbat</a> 16:59, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw you mentioned that he was engaging in discussion in your comments on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. A note on this: if you notice the timestamps on his updates to his talk page and the timestamps on the articles he created, he was promising to stop at the same time he was still creating nonsense articles. In any case, he's gone for right now, so the point may be moot, but I just wanted to let you know.

<p>Hi, BanyanTree,</p>
<p>The Wikipedia project with the undergraduate Intro to Women's Studies students I taught during the spring semester has come to an end. The results were mixed; I'm pleased with what some of the students accomplished, but there are two postings that I'm eager to have you look at and make suggestions as to how they could be improved (or perhaps if they should instead simply be removed). Thanks for your warm welcome when I was getting started on this!</p>

<p>Hi, BanyanTree</p>
<p>I have contributed some historical material to <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chop_Suey_390d.html" title="Chop Suey">Chop Suey</a>, which by general consent was a Chinese American invention, not Armenian. There are many reference of Chop Suey to Li Hong Zhang connection.</p>
<p>After some research, I located an important reference to Chop Suey and Li Hong Zhang from the Complete Works of <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liang_Qichao_afdd.html" title="Liang Qichao">Liang Qichao</a>, who later became professor of Chinese Literature at Tsin Hua University. Liang travelled to Americas (Canada/USA) in 1903, he published his travel notes in "Travel to Americas", in which he provided some hard to find data about Chop Suey Restaurants in America in the turn of 20th century.</p>
<p>I also find out the earlist Chop Suey menu was a 1879 menu of Hong Far Low in Boston, now on display at Museum of Chinese in Americas in New York.</p>
<p>All these are relevant and important to history of Chop Suey, yet was repeatly deleted by certan Muchosucko.</p>
<p>Can you take a look at the article <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chop_Suey_390d.html" title="Chop Suey">Chop Suey</a> and put a protection on it to prevent Muchosucko from deleting it again.</p>

<p>He has just vandalized today's featured article! <i>(note by Rbarreira)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>One edit doesn't make a pattern, and he was not warned after he was recently reverted. <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> is mainly for people who are at {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} after a series of recent vandalism. Note the criteria:
<dl>
<dd>"2. Make sure you've warned the vandal with the {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2_cdb7.html" title="Template:Test2">test2</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2a_c489.html" title="Template:Test2a">test2a</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} templates as appropriate."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And the guidelines for administrators:
<dl>
<dd>"check if the users have been sufficiently warned and whether they've continued to vandalise after being warned."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In other words, for normal vandalism - the admin will be looking for at least tests1-3 in a short period of time and then vandalism after the vandal has been warned that he/she may be blocked. For chronic vandals with a talk page filled with warnings, I will expect at least one message warning that the vandal will be blocked if he vandalizes again, and then a subsequent vandalization in the edit history.</dd>
<dd>The anon listed had one current vandalization and no recent warning. You are free to relist User:12.214.195.245 at one of the other pages listed at AIV if you feel that I have handled this inappropriately.

<dd>Not at all, I just thought you hadn't noticed the latest vandalization. I'm kinda new here so I haven't yet got a feel of how processes like this usually progress (excuse the <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleonasm.html" title="Pleonasm">pleonasm</a>&#160;:))
<dl>
<dd>No worries. I was bewildered for months when I started. And Wikipedia wouldn't function very well without editors willing to list vandals at AIV.

<p>Hi, Many users have warned this individual about discussing content changes on the discussion page. He does not listen and keeps on deleting content and posting non-referenced commentaries, which makes wikipedia's article look very unprofessional. Please look at his initial actions, where he tried to simply delete all contents from the Robarts library and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks on behalf of wikipedia users. <i>(note by <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.191.200.1.html" title="User:216.191.200.1">User:216.191.200.1</a>)</i></p>

<dd>If you look at the talk pages for the IP addresses you listed, you will see that I am the only one who has left him a message. Nor has a conversation been started on the talk pages of the disputed articles. If by "warning" you mean the edit summaries on the reversions, these are never sufficient to carry on a discussion and calm things down in a revert war. Looking at the content he is introducing, and you (and others) are reverting, he appears to be an <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">inexperienced user</a> who is not aware of NPOV and is attempting to carry on an argument in the article space. I would highly suggest that you contact him on his various IP talk pages and start a conversation at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUniversity_of_Toronto_810a.html" title="Talk:University of Toronto">Talk:University of Toronto</a> to inform him of the relevant policies and see if a compromise is possible. Note that <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> requires the lister to have at least made the standard warnings before an administrator may block, so your listing was not actionable in any case.

<dd>Hi Manik Raina,</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your note. The relevant guideline is at <a href="../../../m/a/k/Wikipedia%7EMake_only_links_relevant_to_the_context_57f1.html#Other_considerations" title="Wikipedia:Make only links relevant to the context">Wikipedia:Make only links relevant to the context#Other considerations</a>: "Avoid duplicate links on a page. Redundant links clutter up the page and make future maintenance harder." No wonder you couldn't find it. &#160;:) I'm pretty sure I saw it on another policy page several months ago but can't remember where.</dd>
<dd>There's obviously some tension between this and <a href="../../../b/u/i/Wikipedia%7EBuild_the_web_9cc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Build the web">Wikipedia:Build the web</a>. See the discussion and arguments about the trade-offs between the two on the talk pages of those pages. Generally speaking, only the first mention of a term gets linked. Speaking for myself, if I'm editing a very long article and a term that is being used a lot has not been linked in a while (e.g. several "page down"s), then I may make another link just to help readers who now want to know more but would have to search for the first occurrence.

<p>It seems that no-one here is interested in doing as the rubric says, and actually investigating the case. if they di, they'd find that it's not a matter of content (as one person said when deleting my entry), nor of style (as another said, though he's kindly apologised), nor is it too complex. It's a straightforward case of persistent, low-level vandalism about which I can do nothing as an admin because I'm too heavily involved in the articles. I'd hoped for the consideration and help from fellow admins that I'd be prepared to give them... --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 22:16, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Mel, Sorry if you feel slighted. If you are 100% clear that this is vandalism, you really should do the block yourself. Your adminship vote was a vote of confidence in your judgement. I normally only ask for input from other admins if there is a real question in my mind that vandalism is being carried out.</dd>
<dd>This probably isn't what you want to hear, but I did investigate and do spot checks of diffs for some of the articles, and I couldn't make a definitive judgement. The sort of vandalism you describe is very difficult for newcomers to notice as it requires long-term involvement or a thorough digging into edit histories that is better suited for <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a>. I had a similar situation at a biography recently and eventually decided that I would have to be the one to be dictatorial and draw a line about the pattern of edits, as it would take forever for a new person to evaluate the situation.

<p>"Do not spam the CSB task template" Sorry if my addition offened you - I believed that you added todo's to that article, but it would seem that this was mis-judged. However I wouldnt have prefered if I had had a more full explaination to my offence, its own section (rather than on the end of a seperate ongoing discussion), and a signature so I knew who it was from rather than having the scan the history. <a href="../../../k/i/p/User%7EKipper2258_47a0.html" title="User:Kipper2258">Kipper2258</a> 18:13, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You added a link to <a href="../../../p/y/t/PythonMOO_df35.html" title="PythonMOO">PythonMOO</a>, when your user page states "I tend to spend most my time keeping PythonMOO above water", onto a template for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias</a>. Placing links to an article in which you have a stake in inappropriate places is the definition of spamming. You obviously didn't bother to check what CSB is, and apparently still haven't since you still need to be informed why your addition was inappropriate.</dd>
<dd>I had assumed from the detail on your user page that you had been around for a while and knew what you were doing, so was quite short in my original message. If I had looked at your contribution history and seen that you're relatively new, I would have been less abrupt, so I apologize for that and forgetting to sign.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is a community in which credibility is gained by making high-quality edits to articles; your history contains a lot of arguments on discussion pages and ViPing another user by your 12th edit (!) for getting community consensus through VfD. It's quite normal for new users to make articles that are put up for deletion (three of mine were) but that's a signal to step back and see what sort of contributions will stay, not attack other users and try to get CSB to recreate your speedy deleted article. It doesn't look like anybody has dropped the welcome message into your talk page, so I'll do so now. There are some very useful links for new users.</dd>
<dd>I assume by the "temporary" header above that you intend to remove your edit as you have on other user talk pages. Note that User talk pages are considered "personal" and removal of content without the explcit permission of the relevant user is considered very unfriendly and is most often reverted. Please do not alter or remove any of your edit or my reply, and if you wish to continue the discussion, add to the bottom of the discussion.

<dd>Okay, well sorry once again, and I ViP'ed a user because I felt that links to a page should not be removed as soon as a VfD is set, but after it has been finally deleated - to stil inable people interested in the topic to visit, who may wish to have put forth a Save vote. And sorry, but I felt this was a personal attack. I also appoligise if it is wrong to modify others User Pages - once more I presumed that once a discussion was over, there was no need to keep the conversation, and that is was allowed to remove your comments and the article tree decended from it like in many other communities I have used. It would seem I am mearly uninformed (and a "Green" user I believe its called). <a href="../../../k/i/p/User%7EKipper2258_47a0.html" title="User:Kipper2258">Kipper2258</a> 20:18, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just curiosity how do these {Talk} warnings work? do the expire after 2 weeks? I saw your comments on the change to the vandalism page. When someone already has 9 warnings on their page and they wait 2 weeks this exempts them from being banned? I understand that the fellow has some valid edits however he has <b>9 prior warnings</b> at this point the policy should be <i>no more free strikes</i>! --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkfred_e4f9.html" title="User:Darkfred">Darkfred</a> 21:15, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The thing about anon IPs is that it is quite difficult to be sure that it is the same person who is doing the vandalism. There are certainly any number of curious newcomers who delete something or garble a word just to see how the wiki works, and it would be very unfriendly to block them because they share an IP address with someone whose vandalized before.</dd>
<dd>Regardless, when I am looking at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, I expect to see two vandalisms and one warning of {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} level in between, so it is clear that the vandal made a decision to continue after being warned. This also allows anonymous users who were not the prior vandal to look through the old warnings on the talk page and understand why they are being threatened with a block. This of course does not apply to identified stable IP addresses, but a lot of IPs with a lot of vandalism are school or library IPs with a large number of students making a mix of good and bad edits. Note that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/152.163.100.203" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/152.163.100.203" rel="nofollow">152.163.100.203's contribution history</a> shows a similar mix, which makes me think that it is a multi-user IP. Blocking an IP is the last resort for a problem user after attempts at communication have failed, and even IPs with a history of vandalism should get one warning.</dd>
<dd>If you are worried about long-term problem contributions mixed with good, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress</a> would be more appropriate to get some indepth examination.

<p>Hey BT, hope you are well! Just an update on the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museveni.html" title="Museveni">Museveni</a> article. I know I've dumped a load of stuff from journals recently (I've discovered the joys of <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a>) and there's more to come. Some of this is too detailed/isn't centered on M7 but will have to be moved to other articles eventually. My idea is to do the dumping and then 'carve' a featured article out of all the detail.</p>

<dd>Hi Xed, I didn't know that admins could find see the IP addresses of registered users, and can't seem to find any guidelines on how to do so. I had thought this ability was restricted to developers, and maybe stewards. I have asked a more experienced admin about it. The last time I had checked, the users you listed had stopped, but I'll check again once I know if I can investigate the IP you list.

<dd>liableous? Not sure what that is. But you should certainly look at FilePile anyway. The logo image has been vandalised. Most of the edits to the main page are disingenuous (see FilePile talk). Also, someone is vandalising the acronym <a href="../../../f/p/_/FP_4eba.html" title="FP">FP</a> (where I first came across the FilePile article, after Gozar's addition of Force Publique).

<p>Please continue this conversation on your own talk pages or to Talk:FilePile. Note about "Wikipedia is about notifying the public of different topics through discussion": Wikipedia is about making publically available what is verifiable, and then deciding what of this is notable. Ideally, discussion should not be necessary at all and only should be resorted to when there are questions of fact. Opinion has nothing to do with it at all. As I'm already involved in FilePile, I've brought the dispute to the attention of some other admins, who will hopefully take whatever action is needed. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 14:58, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi TreveX. I don't really know how usage of "Second Ugandan Civil War" started, as I've never seen it in human rights or politico-military analyses. And all the 2nd Civil War works state that it started in 1995, by which I assume that they are dating it from circa beginning of Sudanese support, which is quite arbitrary. A redirect as you describe seems like the best course of action. Thanks! <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 21:37, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

To be perfectly honest, I don't reckon we'll get a lot of feedback here, principally because the article is quite long (the 870th longest article in fact!) and also because this is very much in <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">WP:CSB</a> territory. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreveX_ae5c.html" title="User:TreveX">TreveX</a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreveX_97ec.html" title="User talk:TreveX">talk</a></sup> 11:03, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Another great work vote from me, could you write up a factoid for <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html" title="Template talk:Did you know">DYK</a> as a great new article it should definately appear on the main page.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 02:32, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I took a stab at it. That was my first edit on DYK, so hopefully I didn't do anything bizarre. I do have a question though: While I had saved my half done draft in my user space, I had cut and pasted it into the article space because it seemed weird to have a version in the history that ended abruptly in sentence fragments and factoids. There isn't a special rule about "creation date" on DYK, is there?

<dd>Thanks. Articles on the suggestions page are listed by date of creation, they aren't sorted by time. The only requirments for DYK are the the article be under 5 days old (main namespace), be interesting and be over 1000 characters long- I will bend the first rule if someone suggests a great article that might have started as a stub sometime in the past, but has been significantly improved in the last 5 days, like Marks <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languages_of_Uganda_5860.html" title="Languages of Uganda">Languages of Uganda</a> which I put on DYK in September.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 03:32, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
