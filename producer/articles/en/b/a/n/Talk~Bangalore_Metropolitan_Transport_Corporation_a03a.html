<p>Pushbak busses are not that fast. They claim to be limited sops but are not. They have almost as many stops as the regular busses.</p>
<p>Volvo bus fares are too high for the common man to afford. Only people working with high pay can afford. But the irony is that those section of people seldom travel in the busses. Result the common man has to pay high rates to travel in these busses.</p>
<p>BMTC charges around approx. Re.1 per km which is same as the well maintained private bus services charge for travel between inter city.</p>
<p>So the travel fares are unacceptably high compared to other public transport corporations in India. So with these kinds of fares wont they make profit. Their claim might of the 'only public transport service in asia to make profit' might well be true.</p>

       Completing the grid
</pre>
<p><a href="http://bangalore.metblogs.com/archives/2006/04/completing_the_grid.phtml" class="external free" title="http://bangalore.metblogs.com/archives/2006/04/completing_the_grid.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://bangalore.metblogs.com/archives/2006/04/completing_the_grid.phtml</a></p>
<p>Happy news for bangaloreans! Today's newspapers beamed the announcement of BMTC to completely switch over to a direction-based grid-based system by November 1. What is direction based grid-based system? And how is it different from the radial system?</p>
<p>In a radial route structure, all of the routes originate from a common point and extend to the outlying areas. The central location serves as a transfer point, and is frequently located at a destination with high transit activity. Historically,this is where the business concentration is - for example the three traditional hubs of Bangalore K.R.Market, Majestic (Bangalore Bus station) and Shivajinagara.</p>
<p>In a grid route structure, all of the routes function along a two-way direction (north/south or east/west). The routes are normally spaced equidistantly if the roadway structure permits. This structure has no central transfer location. Instead, the transfers are conducted at intersections of the routes. This type of service is mainly used in urban areas where the population density is greater and equally distributed across the area.</p>
<p>This has already been introduced on a pilot basis on 25 routes. More details here and here. Now this will be completed throughout the city by November.</p>
<p>The advantages to the commuters will be reduction in waiting time, convenient short distance transfer points etween long distance destinations. A commuter can take a bus from "anywhere to anywhere". Future plans include convenient parking facilities near terminals in order to encourage car users to use bus transport thereby reducing the pressure on road traffic.</p>
<p>Another changes that would need to be introduced to increase the efficiency of the system is a synchronous traffic signal system. Considering the effort involved in implementing such a system, as a short term measure, there should be a priority for public buses at signals. And the final challenge is to persuade the public to shift from cars to using public transport by fine- tuning the sytem to its optimum efficiency.</p>
<p>The scheme would reach its optimal level with the implementation of the proposals of the draft Master Plan 2015 for Bangalore, the revised Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) unveiled by the Bangalore Development Authority, moots a grid-wise development of roads across the City. With this, there will be 'blocks' that the City is divided into based on intersection points of any of the ring roads with any of the radial roads.</p>
<p>And add the grid based bus transport system and life in Bangalore will not be a bumpy ride but a smooth sail. Soon, very soon!</p>

Metro Bus System introduced on all 25 grid routes

<p><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/2006/03/13/stories/2006031321310300.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.thehindu.com/2006/03/13/stories/2006031321310300.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehindu.com/2006/03/13/stories/2006031321310300.htm</a></p>
<p>Encouraging response from commuters; 250 more buses in three months: BMTC</p>
<ol>
<li>Metro Bus System was conceived in 2002 to provide uninterrupted public transport facility</li>
<li>First service announced on June 3, 2002</li>
<li>Survey conducted to record time taken for journey, route length, etc.</li>
<li>Outer Ring Road circular services were part of the system</li>

</ol>
<p>BANGALORE: Upbeat over the encouraging response from commuters for its Metro Bus System on grid routes, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has not only extended the system on all 25 grid routes earlier identified by it but has also announced its intention to augment the number of buses on these routes.</p>
<p>The system was conceived in 2002 to provide uninterrupted public transport facility to various points in the city without covering the central business district.</p>
<p>The scheme had sought to change the existing "destination-oriented" operation to "direction-oriented" operation and the first of the system's services was announced on June 3, 2002.</p>
<p>Though the corporation had identified over 25 grid routes for the system, it had introduced it only on a few routes awaiting response from commuters.</p>
<p>A survey was conducted to record the time taken for the journey, the number of obstacles, the route length and the like on each route before finalising them.</p>
<p>Now having received encouraging response from commuters, the corporation has introduced the system on all 25 routes.</p>
<p>The Outer Ring Road circular services from Hebbal and Banashankari, introduced in March 2003 were a part of the Metro Bus System and are now named MBS 23.</p>
<p>New routes</p>
<p>The new routes include MBS (Metro Bus System) 2 Marathahalli-Yelahanka Satellite Town; MBS3 Kamala Nagar-K.R. Puram; MBS6 Vidyaranyapura-CV Raman Nagar; MBS7 Hoskote-Kengeri Satellite Town.</p>
<p>MBS9 ISRO Layout-Vidyaranyapura; MBS10 BTM Layout-Sunkadakatte; MBS11 Jambusavari Dinne (JP Nagar)-Vishwanatha Nagenahalli.</p>
<p>MBS12 Annapoorneshwari Nagar-Marathahalli; MBS13 Arakere Mico Layout-Hennur; MBS14 JP Nagar III Phase-Ramakrishna Hegde Nagar.</p>
<p>MBS15 Nagarbhavi Circle-Marathahalli Ring Road; MBS16 Jalahalli Cross-Kasturi Nagar; MBS18 Sunkadakatte-Bommanahalli; MBS19 Marathahalli-Hebbal; MBS20 Bhuvaneshwarinagar-Laggere.</p>
<p>MBS21 Chandapura-MEI Layout; MBS22 Mysore Road KSRTC Terminal-Marathahalli; MBS24 Rajarajeshwari Nagar-Marathahalli and MBS25 Sunkadakatte-Kalyan Nagar.</p>
<p>Earlier routes</p>
<p>The routes initially introduced included 373C Bommanahalli-Kengeri Satellite Town; 400 Hebbal-Ramamurthi Nagar; 401M Yeshwantpur-Kengeri; 410 Bommanahalli-Jalahalli Cross; 411 Banashankari-Marathahalli; 411A Jayanagar-HAL Main Gate; MBS1 Konanakunte Cross-Hebbal; MBS4 Magadi Road Sunkadakatte-B. Channasandra.</p>
<p>MBS5 Banashankari III Stage III Phase-Jalahalli Cross; and MBS8 Banashankari-Kalyan Nagar. It had deployed 80 buses on these routes.</p>
<p>Though operations on the new routes have commenced, the number of buses is yet to increase.</p>
<p>According to BMTC Chief Traffic Manager Dastagir Sharief, the corporation would add 250 more buses within three months to augment the bus services.</p>
<p>He told The Hindu that every route would have 10 to 15 buses plying with a minimum frequency of 15 minutes.</p>
