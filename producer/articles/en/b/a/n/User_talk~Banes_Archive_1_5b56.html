<p>Banes, you're welcome. I have annoyed one WikiPerson and helped another today, so the karma must have evened out. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrequinda_4a6b.html" title="User:Brequinda">Brequinda</a></p>
<p>Hi Banes, good to see the Capetonians outnumber those from Jhb for now (some minor rivalry always spices things up)&#160;:). A pleasure (adding the templates) - I see you've also experienced your first raging hothead on the apartheid pages. Welcome to Wikipedia&#160;:) For me, the best way is of course not to feed the troll, and accept I'm likely to be wrong as often as not, and not take it too seriously. Others not sharing my ideas need not shatter my sense of identity&#160;:) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenman_c61e.html" title="User:Greenman">Greenman</a> 20:30, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>That mistake on the Bush talk page is fine - we all make them. I've probably padded my edit count with about 100 edits to add my signature to comments, or remove random symbols from within words, so I'm far from perfect. Anyway, I'm a Year 11 student at <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caulfield_Grammar_School_6987.html" title="Caulfield Grammar School">Caulfield Grammar School</a> (blatant cross-promotion for my <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a>&#160;:p), so my second-last year of high school. I hope to see you contributing to lots of articles and making many good contributions. We teens add a lot to this site - just look at <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a>'s contributions!

<p>Yes, it was I, Xiphon who wrote that message. Sorry if I scared you&#160;;) .

<p>I see that we have both been active on the apartheid talk page. A word of friendly advice, if you indent your replies using a semicolon (:), it makes them easier to read (use more to indent further). I was impressed by your contributions on the Bush page, what the blazes is all that stuff about archiving etc??? I do not blame you in any way for the treehouse incident, mostly because you tell the tale with such flair! I got several laughs. If you could add more humorous details that would be great too--<a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXiphon_f273.html" title="User:Xiphon">Xiphon</a> 18:05, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>By using the semicolon you indent your paragraph, such as I have done here. I would love to write an article, but everything interesting has been taken. You going firm on your resolution to write about the heroes of apartheid resistance? Maybe I could get onboard with that? I have been active recently in the ancient history section, discussing Alexander etc. It is my little niche area.--<a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXiphon_f273.html" title="User:Xiphon">Xiphon</a> 18:32, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow Banes! Long have I said this (read this as if I am an old man with a flowing white beard seated by a roaring fire), but your location has gone downhill. Many a time have we joked about the "colour wars" but now it is time for the diplomats to step aside and let the army come through (Rome TW style).I must say that I am impressed by your cool-headedness in dealing with the would-be escapee, however the outcome might have been very different if he had been armed and not just a petty thief. There wasn't really much point in pursuing, at best he would have spent a coupla' months in Pollsmoor, but more likely his case would have been dropped as being just toO insignificant - the whole system is swamped. Have you looked into the landmine option? In other news I have recently discovered that it is possible for me to select and lift segments of a DVD's sound track on my machine for personal use. The catchy tune from "Pirates of the Caribbean" has already been stored and adjusted (Pump that bass!). If I had e-jay in my possession I could incorporate catchy numbers into the tune for variety. Just a thought. (LOTR will be my next project). I have dispatched the info you requested, your weekly postal-runner should bring it in soon. Apparently I have been invited to a massive LAN in CLairmont on Sunday, so I'm not sure that it is a good idea to take off Monday as well, but if that doesn't materialise (you know LAN's), then I'll give you a call.-END TRANSMISSION</p>

<dd>On a more serious note, I would like to create something, a joint project is sounding better all the time, any ideas?

<p>Banes, I noticed that you made a spelling change in the article <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptists</a>, but also put question marks as if you weren't sure. The original spelling was "as is" from the older English as Thomas Helwys wrote it - "comaund what of man he will, and wee are to obey it,"</p>
<p>I'm not sure if there is a Wikipedia rule or standard on this. Your change makes it easier for the average person to read. But since it is a direct quote from Helwys' writings, perhaps it should remain as he wrote it? Not sure. - Rlvaughn</p>

<p>Never let anyone intimidate you on Wikipedia...that is the way to survive some of the attacks. Continue to create and edit articles you care about and go into the "war zone" articles only when you feel up to it. It took me awhile to develop a cool head....a few still try to push my buttons to little avail. Just follow the rules and you'll do fine. I have doubts as to whether Agriculture will return...he seems fairly pissed off. I tried to calm him down, but don't think it worked.

<p>Re: Your question on <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a>'s user talk page</p>
<p>Here's my educated guess at an answer. Violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> once will probably just get a warning, but repeat offences, like with any other issue, can lead to blocking and banning. The following is from the WP:POINT guidline page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Egregious disruption of any kind is blockable by any administrator--for up to one month in the case of repeat offenses that are highly disruptive. If you are ever involved in arbitration, doing things against the spirit of this guideline may also be a factor in the decision of the Arbitration Committee. See <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_Precedents_ab58.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Precedents">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Precedents</a> for examples the Committee's views on various types of disruptive behavior.</i></dd>

<dd>Banes, yes, if someone has signed up with purely the purpose to disrupt, then they can be warned. If they disrupt repeatedly it becomes vandalism and can also be a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> which can get them blocked. Repeated violations beyond that can result in a Rfc and if that fails, Arbitration.

<p>It appears that MONGO or sockpuppets of his (it looks like the IP addresses of some anons are clustered) continually reverts the WfD project page to remove any good faith contributions from me or others. I think s/he thinks it's her/his own private sandbox, and none of us barbarians may contribute... but that's not how WP works. I suspect we're not in 100% agreement on the project and its goals; but you are clearly someone committed to the WP consensus project, and I could use your help in watching for vandalism.

<p>Well, the sore losers over there went and renominated it for deletion then it was quickly denominated. I've been accused of vandalism, trolling and sockpuppetry (all lies). A few only want to discuss imagery and the issues go beyond that.

The <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven%27s_Peak_3ea3.html" title="Heaven's Peak">Heaven's Peak</a> article should probably get an infobox template such as this one: <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gannett_Peak_9b69.html" title="Gannett Peak">Gannett Peak</a>. Thanks again, I'll do the metric conversion unless you want to.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn't know how to do the conversion either and had another user help me...the way I do it is to use Google <a href="http://www.google.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>...simply write out what you want to convert such as: 10 kilometers to feet or vice versa...also works well for area such as: 10 square kilometers to acres, etc. then at the top of the page, it'll give you the conversion. You might want to check out <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven%27s_Peak_3ea3.html" title="Heaven's Peak">Heaven's Peak</a> now and see what I mean by the template...it's used to standardize all mountains and make them look more like encyclopedic articles.

<p>This message has been posted on the talk pages of all users actively editing the Decency project. The RFAr has now been completed, documenting an extensive range of disruptive edits by Hipocrite and Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters, and is available on request.</p>
<p>Before the RFAr is submitted, I think a conversation on Noitallâ€™s talk page <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoitall_4fa7.html#Arbitration" title="User talk:Noitall">User_talk:Noitall#Arbitration</a> should be read, where Hipocrite seems to indicate he might be open to mediation. Perhaps the mediation process might be productive on this occasion, and I am willing to extend an olive branch before banning is contemplated. I will file a mediation request in the next few days, unless there are any objections on my talk page. Of course, if Hipocrite and/or Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters do not agree to mediation, the case will go immediately to arbcom. <b><a href="../../../e/r/w/User_talk%7EErwin_Walsh_ed05.html" title="User talk:Erwin Walsh">Erwin</a></b></p>

It's a blessing and a curse, you can easily spot malicious changes is the good part, the bad is that it's hard not to monitor it and make articles at the same time, since the new changes appear fast.
