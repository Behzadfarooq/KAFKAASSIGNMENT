<p><b>Bannerman High School</b> was built in the early 1970s on the eastern side of the grounds of what was the Baillieston House estate, which was burned down by vandals in Dec 1963. It was owned by the Maxwell and then Scott-Maxwell families and the entire estate was purchased by Lanarkshire County Council allegedly for around Â£2M. The school was officially opened in 1974.The remainder of the estate becamr the council housing estate of Huntingtower.</p>
<p>There was fierce debate as to the naming of the school. The names put forward were</p>
<ul>
<li>Garrowhill High School</li>
<li>Baillieston High School</li>
<li>Scott-Maxwell High School</li>
</ul>
<pre>
The Scott-Maxwell's who were local benefactors were a popular choice and were viewed as a name with good solid links to Bailliestons past. However the school was eventually, and extremely controversially, named after Charles Bannerman the schools architect. The layout and grounds of the school has become a bit of a mystery in recent years and a website <a href="http://geocities.com/baillieston@btinternet.com/bannerman_mystery.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://geocities.com/baillieston@btinternet.com/bannerman_mystery.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> covers this in great depth.
</pre>
<p>Also on this excellent site is another fine article done by several of Bannerman's pupils in the 1980's which also contains historical information relating to both the school and Baillieston in general. <a href="http://geocities.com/baillieston@btinternet.com/bhs_view_of_the_past.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://geocities.com/baillieston@btinternet.com/bhs_view_of_the_past.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>The school was viewed by many as the replacement to Baillieston Junior Secondary School which burned down in 1972. This was only partly true as it was on the drawing board in the late 1960s and had been proposed by Lanarkshire County Council in the mid 1960s.</p>
<p>Many teachers who were displaced by the BJS fire were temporarily relocated in other schools with the Old Monklands District with their pupils, and then returned to the new school. One year later in 1975 the school was transferred into Glasgow with the rest of Baillieston and Garrowhill as local government reorganisation.</p>

<p>Bannerman High School is a non-denominational , co-educational, comprehensive school taking pupils from S1 - S6. It has a capacity for 1400 pupils and a current roll of 1344 made up of:-</p>
<p>~ S1 - 270 ~ S2 - 266 ~ S3 - 274 ~ S4 - 275 ~ S5 - 187 ~ S6 - 72</p>
<p>The school was opened in 1973 and is essentially composed of 3 linked buildings - a 2-level classroom block, a single level Administration / Physical Education / Technical and Music block and a dining and pupil support block to the rear of the school. The school is attractively set in its own grounds, including playing fields. The school has its own Workshop Theatre and a large games hall, as well as the usual academic and practical classroom areas. All areas of the school have undergone a major refurbishment in 2001.</p>
<p>The safety and security of all who attend the school is enhanced by a video camera surveillance system and a security entry system which became fully operational during the session 2000-2001. Facilities for pupils with physical disabilities are in place. The school was fully refurbished and upgraded during the course of 2002, as part of a City wide PFI project. A Unit for young people on the Autistic Spectrum opened in the school in August 2000.</p>
<p>A self-service cafeteria operates pre-school, at morning intervals and lunchtimes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bannerman_High_School_08c8.html" title="Edit section: The Bannerman Autism Unit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Bannerman Autism Unit</span></h2>
<p>The Autism Unit caters for pupils at present from S1-S6. The pupils are on the autistic spectrum, most having a diagnosis of <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a> and who by nature of their difficulties may display challenging behaviours. They have the cognitive potential and level of comprehension to benefit from a mainstream secondary curriculum.</p>
<p>The Autism unit provides support for pupils in mainstream classes and in smaller groups within the Unit.</p>
<p>Support in the Unit provides pupils with practice in core skills, language and communication skills, as well as providing opportunities for consolidation of classwork.</p>
