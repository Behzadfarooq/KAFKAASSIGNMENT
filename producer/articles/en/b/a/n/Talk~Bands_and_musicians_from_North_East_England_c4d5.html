	    <p>why is mark knofler on the list? he was born in scotland, and this is about bands and artist FROM (birthplace) the north east. we are just adding random artists to this list because they have spent a considerable amount of time in the place, but theres a difference between a considerable amount of time and being born there. I will remove all wrong entries - adi kurian</p>

<dd>I agree. I don't think it's fair to include someone who was not born there. If they 'formed' their band or act in this place then I would say it was acceptable. I think those who simply 'grew up' here should be removed. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStealthychimp_a37e.html" title="User:Stealthychimp">Stealthychimp</a> 19:03, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What does birthplace matter? Surely where somebody grows up (and spends their formative years) has a more lasting effect on them than where they were born? Pete Doherty, born in Hexham, but travelled around a lot as a child and has little identity with the area. Granted, Mark Knopfler wasn't born in Newcastle, but he grew up in the area. Listen to his solo lyrics and the odd Tyneside reference in the lyrics of Dire Straits. I know he feels a close affinity with the area (just as much if not moreso than his birthplace) and still lives in the region. I think he should stay in. Also, Alan Clarke (member from Love Over Gold onwards) is from the region, the bare basics of Dire Straits are Tyneside/Wearside in character. Also, why were there no dissenting voices when Dire Straits as a band were included even though only one member was born in the area? Finally, why have that chart puppet Robson Green in the list? We may as well put Gazza in there also! -- <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedpeguyuk_4f20.html" title="User:Hedpeguyuk">hedpeguyuk</a></p>
<p>The name of the article is Bands and musicicans FROM North East England. There is no mention in the title of their place of birth. OK, "from" is slightly ambiguous, but I think it's fair to include anyone who was born, grew up or began their musical career in the North East.</p>
<p>Regarding Robson Green, as much as I detest rubbish, throwaway pop music, I think he has to be included. He has had chart hits, and who's to say that certain members won't think, say, Neil Tennant has produced awful pop and thus deem his removal necessary? It would be impossible to work out where to draw the line. For this reason, the likes of Green, Donna Air and Ant and Dec surely have to stay.</p>
<p><br />
Joe Strummer was born in Turkey, Freddie Mercury was born in Tanzania, but The Clash and Queen are definitely English bands; most of The Pogues were born in England, are they not an Irish group? Surely the point of a list of North Eastern bands/artists should be that they are all musicians who have been raised in, and therefore influenced by the area in some way - a list of musicians simply born in the North East wouldn't have much value - Ezy Rider 11:10, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe.... but he's still had a hit record, so I think he should be included. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.52.162.226 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.52.162.226_07c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.52.162.226">contribs</a>) 15:18, 10 August 2006.</small></dd>

<dd>I'd be inclined to agree, although a look through the categories seems to suggest that "Music from &lt;wherever&gt;" is quite a popular option. So I'm going to sit on the fence on this one...<br />

<p>This page needs some cleaning up. There are a lot of non-noteworthy "vanity" entries on here. I propose someone with some time sorts the wheat from the chaff.</p>
