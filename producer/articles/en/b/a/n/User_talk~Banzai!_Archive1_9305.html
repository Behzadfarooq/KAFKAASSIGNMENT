<dd>You could make a separate category for non-wikipedians, but read <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">this</a> first to make sure it qualifies as notable. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrumbsucker_df4f.html" title="User:Crumbsucker">Crumbsucker</a> 01:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Mac users" would seem to be a much more natural and appropriate name for such a category. Would it be possible to rename the existing "Mac users" category to "Wikipedian Mac users"?

<dd>Hmm, well, the page specifies exactly who created the content (me) and the precise copyright status of the image (public domain). I looked extensively into the requirements prior to uploading, and I believe the image description page contains more information than necessary to justify its presence on Wikimedia servers.

<dd>Please understand that simple cropping of a given image does not confer to you rights to the cropped image. You've not specified who the original source for the image was nor demonstrated that the original source (your friend) released the image into the public domain therefore the image is a candidate for speedy deletion.

<dd>Yeah, I know. But <i>as I already described on the page itself</i>, the image was released into the public domain yesterday, specifically so I could edit it and freely upload it to Wikipedia.

<dd>What more is necessary, indeed possible, than what the image description already offers? Should I ask Clare herself to create a Wikipedia account using her full name and personally add some kind of testimonial to the image page?

<dd>Indeed all details of the image should be included. The full name of the photographer, the date (and preferrably the time) and location where the image was taken.

<dl>
<dd>I've never seen these requirements on any other public domain image on Wikipedia. Please point to some kind of policy, or even evidence that this constitutes some kind of consistent existing practice, and then I'll consider asking Clare for her "full name... date (and preferably the time) and location... actual statement from the photographer."

<dl>
<dd>Come to think of it, even if these requirements were standard policy, they would be entirely useless. What's to stop someone from just making up these details? What's to stop me from making them up for Claire right here, right now?

<p>Her name is indeed Clare, not "Claire." And as I've stated repeatedly, she agreed to release the image into the public domain before I ever touched it. There would appear to be no more appropriate tag for this situation than {{PD-retouched-user|username}}—your suggestion of {{PD-self}} would be appropriate had I made more modifications than a simple crop, but as it is, my changes aren't substantial enough to warrant the reassignment of copyright (as you yourself seem to have noted, albeit in a gross misinterpretation of applicability, above).

<p>Look, Netscott’s concern about the image’s source is just plain <i>wrong</i>. It’s tantamount to reverting every edit ever made (text <i>and</i> images) because, well, you can’t know for sure the contributor didn’t rip it off some copyrighted source.

<dd>OK, I’d appreciate it. Thanks for taking the time to look into this dispute. Could you recommend a way—not necessarily blocking, but maybe some sort of administrator intervention—to make <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">User:Netscott</a> aware of the resentment and ire his behavior inspires among contributors? I read in the <i>New Yorker</i> that Wikipedia can be hostile to new users, but in my experience most people have been really nice; it's probably only the rare exception, like Netscott, who gives Wikipedia its reputation. If I may pontificate. <span style="font-size: small;">&#160;—<i>Banzai!</i> <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanzai%21_b2ab.html" title="User talk:Banzai!">(talk)</a> @ 22:04, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</span></dd>

<p>I have unblocked you.

<dd>Thank you. I'll hold off on WP:DR for now. <span style="font-size: small;">&#160;—<i>Banzai!</i> <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanzai%21_b2ab.html" title="User talk:Banzai!">(talk)</a> @ 23:12, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</span></dd>

<p>Whilst I may not have agreed with some edits you made to Mel Gibson, I do support you with regards to the image thing. I suffered the same, continuous obtuse opposition to the insertion of a valid image on the basis that in a prior discussion regarding fair use vs free image Netscott "lost". His aproach however is unhelpful in the extreme (see <a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKoncorde_e0fe.html" title="User talk:Koncorde">user talk:Koncorde</a> ). I believe your image fulfilled all requirements (as I saw it) but was 'blocked' through and by overboard, and targetted bureaucracy.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKoncorde_5338.html" title="User:Koncorde">Koncorde</a> 17:59, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Koncorde—thanks for saying so.&#160;:-) FWIW, I disagreed with his vendetta against <i>your</i> image, too. I've decided for the time being to steer clear of <i>[wonderful, beautiful people]</i>, and that includes Netscott. <span style="font-size: small;">&#160;—<i>Banzai!</i> <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanzai%21_b2ab.html" title="User talk:Banzai!">(talk)</a> @ 19:09, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</span></dd>
