<p>BanyanTree, I noticed that you deleted an image I uploaded yesterday (JBG_IMG_0011.jpg). I assume that it was because some information about the image was missing. I uploaded a new image: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:JBGAgo06.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:JBGAgo06.jpg" rel="nofollow">JBGAgo06.jpg</a>. I clicked the Submit button before the description was complete (sorry!). I added the correct description in the Discussion section of that image. If you have the chance, could you copy the correct description and paste it into the image's summary, please? If you deleted the first image for any other reason, please let me know. I'm sure I could conform to Wikipedia standards. Thanks. <a href="../../../c/i/m/User%7ECimon38_da3a.html" title="User:Cimon38">Cimon38</a> <a href="../../../c/i/m/User_talk%7ECimon38_68ea.html" title="User talk:Cimon38">talk</a> Tuesday, 2006-10-10 T 11:50 UTC</p>

<dd>Hi Cimon38, I'm not sure why you had problems modifying the text. <a href="../../../j/b/g/Image%7EJBGAgo06.jpg_6b3d.html" title="Image:JBGAgo06.jpg">Image:JBGAgo06.jpg</a> was not protected in any way. In any case, I have pasted in the description from the talk. I couldn't figure out what you intended for the first license and simply removed it. Also, images are not categorized except in special cases. Since CC-BY is allowable under the GFDL, you may wish to consider uploading the image to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="commons:">Commons:</a>, which does have an extensive categorization system.

<p>Greetings, I noticed you reverted my request to delete my user talk page. According to the policy here, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_page#How_do_I_delete_my_user_and_user_talk_pages.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_page#How_do_I_delete_my_user_and_user_talk_pages.3F" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], User talk pages can be deleted if there is no policy violations that may need to be kept or if the user is leaving. Also <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a> states you can have your user talk page deleted. In addition, many editors here also had their user talk page deleted. I would appreciate it if you would delete my user talk page. Please respond here. Thanks. DarKnEs5 WaRr√≠0r</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please note that there is a difference between User pages and User talk pages, and that the former does not include the latter. The "no policy violations" line applies only to user pages and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html#How_do_I_delete_my_user_and_user_talk_pages.3F" title="Wikipedia:User page">the policy you quote</a> further states "User talk pages are generally not deleted, barring legal threats or other grievous violations that have to be removed for legal reasons". The rationale behind this is that, while a user page is the product of the user who created it, a talk page is a collaborative document that causes holes to appear in other people's contribution histories when deleted. The <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">Right to vanish</a> is concerned specifically with the self-imposed duty of the community to honor attempts by a user to disassociate themselves with past edits. You are not attempting to vanish; in fact you are continuing to edit actively, resulting in at least two more positive comments on your talk from other users since your last deletion request. I also see no personal information or legal threats in your talk history. I am aware that other users have had their user pages deleted and, in most of those cases, I believe the admin was in error. You are free to seek out an admin with less knowledge of the relevant policies, but I have never deleted a user talk page and I see no reason to make an exception in this case. Sincerely, <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 19:39, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am actually attempting to vanish and have decided to no longer actively edit here. Could I restore the deletion request on my talk page and seek out an admin who would honor my attempts to vanish without somebody reverting it? DarKnEs5 WaRr√≠0r
<dl>
<dd>Your best bet would be to contact an admin with whom you have had previous interaction and make a personal request. Alternately, you might contact an admin who has carried out a similar request in the past. Placing the speedy tag on the page places it in <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>, where admins tend to churn through a lot of pages in order to get ahead of the constant flood of requests and may not spare the time to read an involved explanation. As I stated above, I am uncomfortable with carrying out the deletion request myself. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 20:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, You talked to me about my @ sign, but is it really a problem? Because I don't want to change my pseudonym, I didn't choose it randomly, it has a precise meaning and I want to keep it. So can tell me more about this probleme and possible solutions. <a href="../../../1/6/40/User%7E16%40r.html" title="User:16@r">16@r</a> 15:35, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi 16@r, Wikipedia recently stopped users from creating accounts with "@" to keep people from using email addresses as their account name. People with @ are encouraged to change their username per <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a>, but it's not a requirement. If you are attached to your username, please just ignore my message and keep it, especially as it doesn't appear to be an address. You are quite unlikely to have any access problems unless policy changes again. Thanks and happy editing, <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 15:46, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BanyanTree; thanks for your offer of nomination. It means a lot coming from someone with such profilic contributions. I've thought vaguely about adminship in the past, but I don't think now is quite the right time, as I expect to be quite busy writing a thesis for the next few months. I hope to be more active in future, and I'll reconsider adminship then.</p>

<p>(re-indent) Now that's a complicated question. If you don't mind me going into some personal judgments, I'll give you an honest answer with some disorganized points to reflect my disorganized thoughts. I'm too lazy to go find all the pages that I had open during my review, so I'll just go on possibly erroneous memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>As far as I'm concerned, anything that happens in your first month on the wiki is not grounds for an oppose by itself, unless of course you're one of those people who wants to be sysopped in their third month. As far as I could determine, you created your AUTO articles before anyone had pointed out the AUTO guideline, so fair game. You did manage to cross just about the worst users you could have, but that's not your fault and the characterization of your RFC draft as an "attack page" is frankly disturbing.</li>
<li>You've got lots of housekeeping-ish edits, which is good for an admin, as it often requires churning through the equivalent of paperwork.</li>
<li>FAs: FA authorship is possibly be only easily identifiable credibility currency that has not been debased on the wiki. In my opinion, your claim to two FAs on your user page is disputable at best, and misleading at worst. In the first, a Polish cryptographer I believe, your substantive edits start around the nomination and your main source was mildly disputed on the talk page there. I do not recall seeing your name on that FAC; further reducing your claim to have been highly involved. The Lost FA: You received a ringing endorsement from at least one other Lost editor that your claim is deserved because of your aggregate efforts in the topic. I have no reason to dispute this, but your actual edits to the article during the FAC did not seem particularly significant. You would be better served by getting rid of the userbox and simply stating a claim with context, e.g. "I edit extensively on the Lost articles and am part of the team that got the main article featured."</li>
<li>Subpages: Both of the subpages that were mentioned, the account of the dispute with DreamGuy and the cone of silence, showed either an ignorance of norms or policy, both revolving around issues of privacy. Wikipedia user pages and subpages are personal, but they are not private. Similarly, the keeping of a page naming users who you wanted to take a certain action is unprecedented in my experience. I understand that you asked for the cone of silence page to be speedy deleted, but that either implies that you couldn't keep track of your own userspace or felt caught out and were trying to hide the evidence, neither of which indicates a great quality.</li>
<li>Lots of issues of tone: The first paragraph in the third answer at your RFA (now looking at it) just seethes with resentment. The use of {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUserblock_9579.html" title="Template:Userblock">userblock</a>}}, as if reporting a problem user to an admin, is a dead giveaway. That, combined with the DreamGuy subpage, seems to indicate a willingness to harbor a grudge, or at least of not knowing when walking away is in your best interests. This at least leaves open the possibility that the opposers' argument that you do not have the personality that we wish to endorse with the mop is correct, though I did find many opposers' reasoning flawed. I spent a lot of time, after deciding definitely to support or oppose several times, looking at the sentence "My own goal as an admin is to be sensitive to the nuances of Wikipedia culture, and to adapt to the norms of this particular community." This is written as someone who is not a member of the community, and the very fact that it is written this way shows that you are not sensitive to the nuance that we expect our admins to have already drank the Kool Aid, and then get embittered later.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I just spent a lot more time on the negatives than the positives, which are that you are highly knowledgeable, have put in the time and edits, clearly have a thick skin and, with the mediation as proof, are clearly capable of productive cooperation with users that you disagree with. A statement to be open to recall as a prerequisite to being adminned would have pushed me towards support, but probably not over the line. I'm sure that there are some other things that crossed my mind at the time that I've since forgotten. On the whole, it was a lot of little things that added up to a wash for me. I was thus not neutral because I thought I lacked information. Just a note, when going for your next RFA, make sure your nominator has credibility to spare.

<p>Dear Administrator,</p>
<p>Where did the original Political Asylum page go? The link to our nationally recognized agency was originally included on that page. What happened? Why didn't you keep the links when revising the entries for Political Asylum? It's quite frustrating. Many asylum applicants and immigration attorneys did benefit from the way the page was originally structured. And now you're reverting the changes I had proposed. Do you really believe that asylum-related information on our website (<a href="http://www.pards.org" class="external free" title="http://www.pards.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.pards.org</a>) is not relevant for these discussions?

<dd>Yeah, I noticed Merope deleting that one. A far more liberal interpretation of G6 than I have. I tend to see deletion as getting rid of something actively harmful or confusing. Since nobody is arguing that they are harming anything, and the permanent deletion of a page that is not harmful seems IMO to be outside the ambit of G6, I won't delete them. Besides that, if it's useless/harmless why would one spend time tagging it to ask an admin to spend their time checking it out? Note that if you had stated in your speedy reasoning that you are a member of whatever wikiproject handles those templates and thus had some standing on decisions of that type, I probably would have just deleted them. As for unrelated users tagging harmless redirects for deletion under a housecleaning rationale?-I would never oblige, but I occasionally am told I'm grumpy.

Surely these redirects take up some amount of space on Wikipedia's servers, space that could be better served hosting articles or images, or at the very least, useful redirects to help users find content. If the space they take is negligible, then ignore that point. Still, these kind of redirects irk me personally - but that's probably just me.

<dd>I'm not disagreeing with you that it's nice to have things cleaned up. But as CSD G6 is phrased currently, I do not see it as giving explicit sanction to the sort of deletion you requested. It's in a grey area - certainly some admins won't think twice about it, while some (or at least me) err on the side of caution and want some assurance that the person actually knows what they are talking about and are not looking at some generated list somewhere and blindly sticking tags on. As far as I know, the amount of space used is the same. All the copies are kept on the servers, which is why admins can still access all the versions of deleted pages. It used to be that images disappeared forever, but now those are kept too.

<p>The page was created mainly as a sublink page from hypercolor and photochromic. There isnt any information on existing companies producing apparel with leuco dyes. I was working on a Del Sol article and an article on Generra. Albeit these companies are not well known they're producing a rare unique type of product something i believe makes them notable. I'm taking a class on screen printing right now and came across these types of inks and then it took awhile to find these companies. I was wondering what you thought now that i've explained what i'm doing here. Perhaps I could recreate the article and focus more on the chemistry and less on the design philosophy. I used the American Eagle template as a foundation for the Phallacy one but perhaps a stub would be better suited for that company.</p>

So I'm back to the ridiculously long references sections as well. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 15:38, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A Terry Ward page appeared long ago and I was rather flattered since it was about me. It mentioned flag designs and municipal seals I've designed. The designs are government-use emblems. The page is gone now. The log says it was deleted by BanyanTree and it says 'attack page'. Was it edited by someone into an attack? Couldn't a pre-edit page have been restored. I'm puzzled over who you are and where you get off deleting the page. Explain please. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 134.126.60.217 (<a href="../../../1/3/4/User_talk%7E134.126.60.217.html" title="User talk:134.126.60.217">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.126.60.217_6ac7.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.126.60.217">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I have undeleted the non-vandalized versions of the article <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Ward_184d.html" title="Terry Ward">Terry Ward</a>. At the time of its deletion, the article had for over a month consisted of sentences such as "Terry is known for not knowing what he is talking about, abusing various students and chavs (such as the boys) and being extremely offit", which I assume you would not find flattering.</dd>
<dd>As for me, I'm a volunteer <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_f252.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator">administrator</a> who occasionally wades through the <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">hundreds of articles nominated daily for immediate deletion</a>. I have no memory of deleting this article but, if I was following my normal process, I would have checked versions going back several weeks and the original version. Since all the most recent versions were vandalized and the original version was in extremely non-standard formatting (and the article is still in need of formatting to Wikipedia standard) I probably judged it to be an earlier version of the attack page. I apologize for not checking the earlier revisions more carefully, but I imagine that you would have preferred it to be gone rather than to have the version I describe distributed across the internet for the past six months. If you set up an account, you can create a watchlist for articles that you have an interest in so you can see when changes like this occur. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 16:07, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry. Didn't realize fresh content appears at the bottom of the ppage. Thansk for the advice. At first, your restoration appears to be the old article.

<p>I've at least nominally returned from my three week adventure in California, but I've decided I'm not quite ready to begin editting again. Prior to resumption however, I have some concerns in regard to the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum_in_Nigeria_8a00.html" title="Petroleum in Nigeria">Petroleum in Nigeria</a> article.</p>
<p>While there's certainly a large amount of information available on the topic, some of which has been injected into the article, I don't think I grasped the scope and complexity of the issues involved prior to commencing this project nearly a year ago. As a result, the process has been largely characterized by iterative evaluation and constant evolution of the "planned" final product as I acquired new information via perusal of related texts; generally this resulted in disorganization and poor management. I also had a strong desire to create a Featured Article in the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" rel="nofollow">eventualist</a> manner; I also bought into the idea that article length equates to quality or status.</p>
<p>I wont articulate article plans here, but I've decided to read through comprehensive texts on Nigerian post-independence history, which will hopefully preclude attempts to edit using bits and pieces of information. When I'm done with those texts, I will return to editing. This introspective has provided the realization that I'm still something of a novice despite 1.5 years on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Finally (I apogolize for message length, I blame my hiatus), could we <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-protect.html" title="Semi-protect">semi-protect</a> the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> page. Even when I was editing, keeping pace with the anonymous and red-link editors was virtually untenable. According to the page on semi-protection, Nigeria should qualify: "semi-protection may be used in cases of "minor bios of slightly well known but controversial individuals" which are not widely watchlisted, if they are "subject to POV pushing, trolling [or] vandalism." Granted this article is not biographical in nature, but I believe the above quotation should apply. thanks for your time, I apologize for this message's superfluous length.--<a href="../../../g/o/z/User%7EGozar_9ff3.html" title="User:Gozar">gozar</a> 00:55, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey gozar, Good to see you back.</dd>
<dd>Last things first, the quotation from <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy</a> is directly related to legal concerns about living individuals, all going back the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a>. Protection of <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> would definitely fall under a prohibited "pre-emptive measure". I'm happy to field any requests you may have for blocks or temp protections, in cases of spree vandalism, but there is no way a semi pro wouldn't be quickly removed as being contrary to policy. You might ask at <a href="../../../a/f/r/WP%7EAFR_c6db.html" title="WP:AFR">WP:AFR</a> if more people can watch the article. Sorry.</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum_in_Nigeria_8a00.html" title="Petroleum in Nigeria">Petroleum in Nigeria</a>, you've basically stated my attitude toward almost everything on my watchlist.&#160;;) I recently started working on background articles to the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur_conflict.html" title="Darfur conflict">Darfur conflict</a>, after removing the article itself from my watchlist, and have entangled myself in a mind boggling amount of detail that makes me wonder when I'm ever going to return with enough knowledge to do the ruthless pruning needed to make a really good article. I've thought of opposing as a matter of course every <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> over 40kb as being the obvious result of either editor indecision or ego stroking, but I'm not up to dealing with the resulting controversy.</dd>

<dd>It would be ideal, but there are so many protected pages and some of them are not listed at <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a> and have been protected for weeks or months, and the bad ones will be re-protected. It would of course be best not to unprotect ones protected recently, and to watch them all, but sometimes you have to take the bad with the good, and unprotecting the pages categorically is a net good; it has to be done some time, just shouldn't be done regularly. ‚Äî<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>‚Üí<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;‚Ä¢ 02:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict)Sometimes very poor reasons. The longest protection I've found so far is 8 months, followed by a few four monthers, quite a few over one month and maybe a bare majority in the past month. Clearly nobody has gone through <a href="../../../s/e/m/CAT%7ESEMI_df89.html" title="CAT:SEMI">CAT:SEMI</a> in a very long time. Semi-proteciton appears to have become so "normal" that people are clearly using it to prevent run-of-the mill vandalism - e.g. admins giving "vandalism" as the reason for semiprotecting an article that has had ten reversions over the previous three days; weeklong blocks on articles that were the target of half-hour spree but are otherwise quiet, or articles protected for elections that ended weeks ago. I may be unprotecting a few articles that won't work out and will require reprotection, but there is so clearly a bias towards protection that I figure this is the barest hint of a correction.</dd>
<dd>I am passing over articles that people have tried multiple times to unprotect without success, especially if the protecting admin basically says in the edit summary that it is an IAR exception to the SEMI rules. I am also passing over pages protected in the last few days. I have been thinking that the German version control is desperately needed but, as far as I can tell, nobody has passed policy stating that protection can be used as a kludge for stable versions.</dd>
<dd>As for your question, no - or at least not as a process. I do not see how a review of articles to make sure they fall within the semi guidelines obliges the reviewer to take on responsibility for articles that other admins have either forgotten about or have given reasons that do not warrant indefinite protection. Like I said above, some of the articles are sufficiently high profile that they may require reprotection if it overwhelms the anti vandal crew. However, protection tends to happen much more quickly than unprotection, and another period to see if vandalism has died down may be useful, if only to remind admins that they are specifically enjoined from using semi-protection indefinitely. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 02:59, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just mean that these articles are going to get vandalized (indirectly) because of your actions, some of them quite heavilly, I think regular editors of the articles will appreciate at least some token help with vandalism that comes up, rather than just saying "Here's more work for you guys, I'm not technically obligated to do anything to help deal with the vandalism so I'm not going to". This is kind of related to stuff being discussed on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> to some extent. I'm talking about extending a courtousy to people who work hard to maintain the quality of articles, it's nothing you're required to do but I think it's healthy for the community that people unprotecting articles en masse at least acknowledge the people they'll be creating more work for. I do appreciate the work you're doing though... 8 months of protection is rediculous. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note that I didn't say that I wouldn't help out; I stated that I wouldn't do so as part of a process. I refuse to accept that taking on moppage or editing duties in one area creates a obligation in yet more areas. I've already burnt out once taking that path. I certainly didn't expect to win any popularity contests by removing semi-pros, but you've convinced to take a break on this. I'll review after Thanksgiving week and see if I can get a broad sense of how things worked or didn't.

<dl>
<dd>OK. Fair enough. I admit to not being entirely clear on why this would create a rift, but I agree with the sentiment.</dd>
<dd>As promised, I went ahead and did a back of envelope (literally) review of the articles. I had gone through J, K, L and M and removed semiprotection from 84 articles. Two additional pages were the user pages of a new user who had apparently put the tags on on a lark and hadn't been caught. Of the 84, 11 have been reprotected six days later, including several in which the protecting admin has suggested in their edit summary that indefinite semiprotection may be warranted. Of these 11, two are the targets of a banned user, as mentioned in a section below. One was a user page that was immediately reprotected by an admin with an edit summary asking that any attempts at unprotection be first cleared through him/her first. I don't believe that it was clear from the page history that this was the case, so at least there is now a written record. That leaves 8 pages that have been reprotected due to general vandalism. I also found a template in the wild, {{<a href="../../../s/p/r/Template%7ESprotect-banneduser_a0c1.html" title="Template:Sprotect-banneduser">sprotect-banneduser</a>}}, that was not mentioned at <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy</a>. I have since added it.</dd>
<dd>Of the 73 that remain unprotected, 14 have not been edited at all. Several pages have experienced significant levels of vandalism and I wouldn't be surprised if they too go through a round of reprotection. I was trying to see how I could fine tune my review to reduce the number of false positives for unprotection, but can't quite figure out a pattern. A number of pages that I felt were iffy but hadn't been on and off protection enough for me to make a firm determination, such as <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, remain unprotected with what appears to be a manageable level of bad edits. Others that I felt were obscure immediately launched into full blown wars that required quick reprotection. In many pages, I saw very helpful anon edits. I've pretty much convinced myself that a semi review is both helpful and needed, despite the headache, and will hopefully get back into it shortly.</dd>
<dd>I do feel that admins need to be a bit more descriptive in their edit summaries, e.g. "Page has been the target of long term vandalism probably requiring indefinite semiprotection" or "Page targeted by sockpuppets of ArbCom banned user BadDude", rather than the "lots of vandalism" or "per req" that seem to be common and require subsequent admins to spend inordinate amounts of trying to figure out what is going on with the page. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 03:53, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As is most vandalism. Looking over the page history before it was protected, there is not a continuous heavy amount of vandalism that makes indefinite semiprotection the obvious only option.

<p>Could you please temporarily reinstate semi-protection on "Registered Agent" - I am writing to you direct as opposed to the protect page since you removed. As early as yesterday a spammer attempted to direct traffic (I'm assuming) to some AdWords ads or&#160;?.

<dd>Per <a href="../../../s/e/m/WP%7ESEMI_521e.html" title="WP:SEMI">WP:SEMI</a>, semi-protection is not to be used to prevent run-of-the-mill vandalism. In the history of <a href="../../../r/e/g/Registered_Agent_2d7d.html" title="Registered Agent">Registered Agent</a>, the last 50 edits goes back two months. Considering that many pages go through an average of one bad edit every hour before people start thinking seriously about semi-protection, the article doesn't appear to have reached the level of heavy vandalism for which semi-protection is the only solution. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 13:38, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am contacting you because you are the last admin to have edited <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semen.html" title="Semen">Semen</a> (just to unprotect it).</p>
<p>There is a problem that has been going on for some time. Anonymous users have been removing the semen photo. There has been much discussion and debate about the image, and consensus was to keep it. I have reverted two deletions today, and had noticed a third, but <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErielhonan_4b5f.html" title="User:Erielhonan">User:Erielhonan</a> (who has made it clear that he does not approve of the image, but does not remove it because of the majority opinion) added &lt;!--Three-revert rule in effect until 13:04, 2006 December 3 UTC --&gt;.</p>
<p>I've read <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, and it probably does apply as a revert war, but one may use the justification that the consensus was to keep the image. I'll not revert it, though, until after the 24 hrs is up.</p>
<p>If the removals continue, I will need to take this further. Can you tell me what I should do? I've tried to read through Wikipedia policies and guidelines, but sometimes they are confusing. I appreciate any help you can give. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheusX303_4aad.html" title="User:PrometheusX303"><span style="color:green;"><strong>Prome</strong></span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PrometheusX303_4373.html" title="Special:Contributions/PrometheusX303"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>theus</strong></span></a><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrometheusX303_6257.html" title="User talk:PrometheusX303"><span style="color:red;"><sup>-X303-</sup></span></a> 02:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, if there is a formal consensus for its inclusion, then removal is vandalism and is not subject to the 3RR. My first impression is that the various anons are sockpuppets of a single person, which may be worth pointing out either in an edit summary or talk. In any case, if there is a discussion with an unambiguous consensus to point to supporting the image's inclusion, you are in the clear. Though I would write very clear edit summaries in case someone reports a 3RR violation and an <s>anon</s> admin comes along and has to figure out what is going on.</dd>
<dd>Feel free to link to this discussion if you are challenged on this. I was thinking of giving it a couple of days before making a decision, but I'm very close to reinstating the semiprotection, if this is the quality of anon participation in the article. I'll kick off the reversion and watch the article to see what happens.

<dd>I put forth a stop-gap solution of making a small thumb ('gallery sized' - 150 px or so) at the bottom of the page, and then to seek bureaucrat-sponsorship for a binding decision from a user discussion panel. I hope that you can see the first part of this suggestion as a viable way to calm the controversy a bit. The second part is what I mean by a 'managerial solution'. This image seems to have become a cause celebre among disruptive editors, so a poll would likely result in people coming out of the woodwork to vote in favor of the disruption. A panel with some sort of authority to make a judgment on the encyclopedic quality of the image, without the disruptive input, will probably get us to a mutually agreeable result. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErielhonan_4b5f.html" title="User:Erielhonan"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; background: #00a000; font-family:'andale mono','lucida console',mono; color:black">&#160;Er</span></a><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErielhonan_f7d1.html" title="User talk:Erielhonan"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; background: black; font-family:'andale mono','lucida console',mono; color:#00a000;">iel</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erielhonan_7d5d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erielhonan"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; background: #00a000; font-family:'andale mono','lucida console',mono; color:black">hon</span></a><a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErielhonan_4b5f.html" title="User:Erielhonan"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; background: black; font-family:'andale mono','lucida console',mono; color:#00a000;">an&#160;</span></a> 09:51, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(reindent)And I've re-semiprotected the page after you were reverted. Considering that most of the users on your side appear to be sockpuppets, I wouldn't be so certain that the page should conform to your view. The "panel with some sort of authority to make a judgment on the encyclopedic quality of the image" is a discussion amongst your peers. The most likely candidate for this thus far is the poll against which you are fighting.</p>
<p>Both admins and bureaucrats are required to implement the consensus of editors (whether as policy, guidelines or the result of discussion) when using their special privileges, and otherwise have no authority beyond what they possess an individual editors. My personal opinion, as an outsider, is that there is probably a need for a better designed poll to let people choose options, but that there is a consensus now and that it is against your position. The only relevant managerial solution is a ruling of the <a href="../../../a/r/b/WP%7EARBCOM_80fd.html" title="WP:ARBCOM">Arbitration Committee</a>, and you are not nearly at the stage required to seek one. See <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a> for how many steps you will be required to go through before the ArbCom would consider this issue.</p>

Good luck with the page. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 13:50, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Like the Sudan Black Book article, this article is so amazing. I was especially interested in his ability to give oneself over to the LRA and then wander through the bush and get back to work; it is so unbelievably important. It is very easy to learn about Africa from reading your work. --<a href="../../../m/c/t/User%7EMcTrixie_e744.html" title="User:McTrixie">McTrixie</a>/<a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Accountable_3044.html" title="User:Mr Accountable">Mr Accountable</a> 16:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you very much. I remember Dr. Matthew from the Ebola outbreak, but actually didn't know about the LRA connection until I started writing the article. I enjoyed writing it and am glad you enjoyed reading it. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 16:53, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your comment. I removed the parts stating that the tiger is 'the most powerful cat'. As I, and others not least, have several times written to the discussion page, this is not a statement about the tiger, but is a comparison to other cats which cannot be considered of independent value to an article on the tiger. Moreover, it's factual basis is very much in doubt in two different ways: Both the lion and the liger are serious contenders for that 'title'. And, semantically, it is not a scientific statement on the tiger; 'powerful' how?? Can pull a heavier load than any other cat? Or more successful in combat against other big cats (this is where the male lion may one-up it). In any case, it is not a neutral statement, but one springing from (understandable) admiration for this big cat. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 192.38.17.39 (<a href="../../../1/9/2/User_talk%7E192.38.17.39.html" title="User talk:192.38.17.39">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.38.17.39_7056.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.38.17.39">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Actually, assuming that I understand the situation properly, there are contradicting sources. (The statement you removed was cited to the BBC.) A discussion based on the credibility of the sources may be more fruitful than the "yes, they are"/"no, they are not" nature of the discussion that I've seen. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 13:19, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please see the request in talk to remove the line break from the template, it is damaging usage. Template should look like:</p>
