<p>Who on Earth wants a citation that the Dickies got into the UK charts with a cover of the theme? That's fairly well known, isn't it? Not hard to cite... 86.0.230.142 17:12, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Someone went a bit over the top adding the citation tag <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banana_Splits&amp;diff=87911228&amp;oldid=87084781" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banana_Splits&amp;diff=87911228&amp;oldid=87084781" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Citation tags should generally only be added to dubious statements or facts that can't easily be verified. I added some sources for the Bob Marley reference because that was a <i>claim</i> rather than a fact, and I've left the Shortnin' Bread tag there because I couldn't find a reliable source for it. The other two tags have been removed because they are easily verified by anyone wanting to. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dickies_6ea8.html" title="The Dickies">The Dickies</a> fact is even mentioned in their own article, but whoever asked for a citation didn't bother to look.

<p>According to the Season 2 scripts, his name is spelled "Fleegle." It's also spelled that way on virtually all official merchandise, including the back cover notes on the <i>We're The Banana Splits</i> album.

<dd>Thanks. Of course, after I posted that question, I went and looked around and felt so stupid when i saw that the majority of verifiable references to him are as <i>Fleegle</i>&#160;! Thanks anyway for the explanation. It will likely prevent any future confusion about the spelling.<a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisapollison_fe0d.html" title="User:Lisapollison">LiPollis</a> 08:54, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I was going to add a message on this talk page months ago regarding this because it seems to be a common misconception. I was the editor who corrected the name to "Fleegle" originally, in my edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banana_Splits&amp;diff=84737747&amp;oldid=84344515" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banana_Splits&amp;diff=84737747&amp;oldid=84344515" rel="nofollow">here</a> I was being slightly assertive in the summary because it wasn't the first time a passing editor had decided to change it on a whim. I was going to add an image to the article showing the correct spelling, for example <a href="http://www.fadtoys.com/celebrity/cartoons/fleegle_lg.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.fadtoys.com/celebrity/cartoons/fleegle_lg.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gasolinealleyantiques.com/cartoon/images/Hanna/slurp-fleegle1.JPG" class="external text" title="http://www.gasolinealleyantiques.com/cartoon/images/Hanna/slurp-fleegle1.JPG" rel="nofollow">here</a> but I thought that wouldn't be classed as "fair use".

<p>Thanks to the person who provided clarification on the correct title of that song...may I ask how you verified that information? Are any of these unreleased Splits songs listed in any music publisher (ASCAP/BMI) sources? Do they give the names of who composed them? (For the songs used on the TV show but otherwise unreleased...I'd really like to verify the correct titles and who wrote them, if possible. These include "Adam Had 'Em," "A Place For The Music To Come Out," "You Had Your Chance," "I'd Be A Millionaire," etc. (Mark Yurkiw, webmaster, bananasplits.4t.com) <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.3.67.138_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.3.67.138">63.3.67.138</a> (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.3.67.138.html" title="User talk:63.3.67.138">talk</a>) 04:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Thanks... Hey, I did some looking around and I found that song (and several other Splits songs) at the BMI publishing website: <a href="http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;page=1&amp;keyid=1335171&amp;ShowNbr=0&amp;ShowSeqNbr=0&amp;querytype=WorkID" class="external free" title="http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;page=1&amp;keyid=1335171&amp;ShowNbr=0&amp;ShowSeqNbr=0&amp;querytype=WorkID" rel="nofollow">http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;page=1&amp;keyid=1335171&amp;ShowNbr=0&amp;ShowSeqNbr=0&amp;querytype=WorkID</a> According to the BMI site, the "legal title" is "Show Must Go On." That week's TV Guide listing had it as "The Show Must Go On." So where does "Our Little Show" come from (other than the lyrics themselves)? (BTW, the composers are Jimmy Radcliffe and Carl Spencer.) --Mark Yurkiw, webmaster, bananasplits.4t.com</p>

<p>Several common misconceptions show up regarding the Banana Splits all over the place...most of them have been straightened out in the main article, but I'll try and take a stab at them right here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don Messick did not perform Snorky's voice. (No one did. The character never spoke.)</li>
<li>It's "Snorky," not "Snork." Although the theme song lyrics refer to him as "Snork." (Because "Snork" rhymes with "cork.") (The same way Wally Gator does not live in a swamp, even though his theme song says he does.)</li>
<li>It's "Fleegle," not "Fleagle."</li>
<li>Richard Donner directed all the live-action in the first season, including the Banana Splits segments as well as "Danger Island."</li>
<li>Two seasons of shows were produced and originally aired on NBC, but only the Season 1 episodes have been shown in reruns since then.</li>
<li>The following cartoons were never part of the original show: Atom Ant; Precious Pupp; Secret Squirrel; Squiddly Diddly; Winsome Witch; The New Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn; The Adventures Of Gulliver. No matter what any website claims, these cartoons never aired as segments on <i>The Banana Splits Adventure Hour</i>. Later on, all these cartoons (which originally were separate shows) were thrown together as part of the re-edited syndicated series, called <i>The Banana Splits And Friends Show</i>, which in reality consisted of a bunch of individual shows under that umbrella title. (The Hillbilly Bears--originally a segment on <i>Atom Ant</i>--did air on the original show, during the second season.)</li>
<li>The amusement park footage in the show's opening and closing was not filmed at Kings Island--the series wrapped in 1969, while Kings Island opened in 1972. The commonly-seen Season 2 title sequence, which adorns the syndicated shows, was filmed at Coney Island in Cincinnati--most of the rides and attractions were later relocated to Kings Island. Amusement park scenes filmed for Season 1, including the original Season 1 opening and closing titles, were filmed at Six Flags Over Texas. <i>The Banana Splits In Hocus Pocus Park</i> had scenes filmed at Kings Island, but not the original series. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.3.67.132_1ca6.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.3.67.132">63.3.67.132</a> (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.3.67.132.html" title="User talk:63.3.67.132">talk</a>) 12:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<ul>
<li>Bingo is one of the only known examples of the species <i>gorilla psychedelia</i>, originating in the late 1960s. But to answer your question, Bingo was <i>meant</i> to be a gorilla. <font color="blue">Pufnstuf</font> 19:01, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, what Pufnstuf said. Actually, in show #17 (K-17 REV), "The Great Banana Splits Buggy Race," there is one scene in which announcer Allan Melvin specifically describes Bingo as "an orange gorilla." This didn't stop someone at Marvel Comics from including Bingo in an article about Hanna-Barbera cartoon bears in one of their Hanna-Barbera comic books in the late 1970s.</li>
