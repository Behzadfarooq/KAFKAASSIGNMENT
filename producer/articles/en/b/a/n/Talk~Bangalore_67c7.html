<p>This pertains to the area of Bangalore mentioned in the article as 1280 sq. km. However, the area for Mumbai states it is about 498 sq. km. If this is so, why is Bangalore ranked smaller in size than Mumbai? Am I missing something? - Vayu 12:25, 28 Apr 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The definition of large and small is with regards to population, not city area size. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 13:01, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the Geography section, the conversions between sq km and sq mi are incorrect. It looks like a factor of 1.6 was used to covert, but the proper factor is 2.56 because we're talking about area rather than linear distance.

<p>It's official. Bangalore now has a new name. It is time we update to reflect this new name. I saw on a debate as to what to name Venice. In India, Indian cities are the same for any language, whether you speak Hindi, Tamil, or English. So, I support renaming the "Bangalore" page to Bengalooru. We should also replace words stating "Bangalore" to "Bengalooru." And Bangalore should only be mentioned as a refernce to the city's former name. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmitroy5_fd13.html" title="User:Amitroy5">User:amitroy5</a></p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion about the name. While Bangaluru or any other spelling with diacritic marks are not official, the correct spelling might be Bengaluru or Bengalooru. <a href="../../../u/2E/_/U._R._Ananthamurthy_5ea2.html" title="U.

Can someone confirm with proper links what the correct spelling is? Thanks.</p>

<dd>Hi, the History section as it stands as of now is actually a summary of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bangalore_7a1c.html" title="History of Bangalore">History of Bangalore</a> article. The History of Bangalore article was initially a part of the Bangalore article. To conform to <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> requirements during <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, the history section was condenced and brought to its current state and a separate "History of Bangalore" article was created with the original material. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 18:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But it could easily be summarized more tightly; most such summaries are a paragraph or two. Does <i>Garden City of India</i> belong in <b>this</b> article, for example? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:43, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Right, but I think we need to be very careful as to what to retain and what to move to the other article. Personally, I think this is as concise a summary as I think I've come up with without having to leave out important historical information. For example, the Garden City of India is important because prior to Bangalore becoming what it is today to the rest of the country, it was famously referred to as the Garden City. It is part of Bangalore's history and the moniker is still popular among locals and folks from other parts of the country. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 21:09, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>After placing a link on the Bangalore page and having it reverted by an editor, I would like to propose here that a link to a website called Bangalore Buzz (at [<a href="http://bangalorebuzz.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://bangalorebuzz.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>], be placed in the External Links section of the Bangalore page. While <a href="../../../k/n/m/User%7EKNM_6bb1.html" title="User:KNM">KNM</a> informs me that links to blogs are frowned on, I suggest that an exception be made for this site, as its content is composed entirely of news articles about Bangalore, reprinted from newspapers; it does not contain any personal opinion (except editorials that were printed in the newspapers). It has proven a valuable resource to me as I research Bangalore for a book I'm writing, and I believe others would benefit from knowing about it. Thanks.

<dd>I oppose that link. For starters, even though that blog doesnt cite any personal opinions, it is a hopelessly biased blog. Most of its 'content' is gleaned heavily from the Times of India and many a time quotes articles selectively. It deliberately doesnt quote articles that give both sides of a story and even when it does gives disproportionate coverage to the POV of the blog owner. For example even in cases like the name change, BMIC controversy, the schools controversy etc., the blog heavily quotes only articles that criticise(many a time <i>ad hominem</i>) the government, its policies and many times even 'kannadigas'.</dd>

<p>The Economist has adopted the name Bengalooru: <i><br />
"The capital of the state of Karnataka, home to Wipro and Infosys among others, has changed its name to Bengalooru, following the lead set by Mumbai (Bombay), Kolkata (Calcutta) and Chennai (Madras)."<br />
"They have every right to do so, of course, and it seems discourteous not to use their new names if they expressly ask you to. That is why The Economist adopts Myanmar, Côte d'Ivoire, Kyrgyzstan, Timor-Leste and <b>now Bengalooru</b> (see article) too. But it rankles, for several reasons."</i></p>
<p>Yet some other newspapers claim it's Bengaluru.</p>

<p><b>It is pronounced Bengalooru</b>. The article mentiones the name as <b>Bengalūru</b> (with a ū instead of u) which takes care of the longish 'oo' but it may lead to confusion. I vote for Bengalooru, as there is no confusion. But in newspapers, it is still referred to as Bengaluru which is actually wrong. (Problem with non phonetic languages?&#160;:-) ).

<dd>It is only 'correct' as Bengalooru if you assume that 'oo' is consistently the long 'u' sound in English, which it is not (e.g. door, food, poor). If it is written Bengalooru you can be certain that many non-Indian English speakers, and most speakers of other languages written in Latin characters will pronounce it with the long 'o', instead of the long 'u'. At least with Bengaluru, the main problem will be with the length of the vowel. BTW, Google indicates that Bengaluru is more widely used than Bengalooru. <a href="../../../i/m/c/User%7EImc_99b2.html" title="User:Imc">Imc</a> 10:20, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about adding another 'o' and make it Bengaloooru&#160;? No confusion here.&#160;;-). IMHO, a 'oo' in an unfamiliar word is generally taken to be the long 'u' and hence Bengalooru would be more correct (?!) than Bengaluru whereas Bengalūru is the perfect word when you know how to pronounce 'ū'.

<p>The person thee posts above mentioned he oppses it until it becomes "more commonly recognized." However, we cannot forget that this city will soon have a new official name. Also, we should use the correct modern name of the city. So, we can always redirect Bangalore. And who defines the "official English word?" India has English as one of its official languages, so the country has the right to call what its cities are. When the name change becomes official, then we should change the article name. Otherwise, we are just promoting false information.

<p>I suppose that it is official when the state government changes (or at least initiates the change of) all its name boards, letterheads etc and starts using Bengaluru in all its correspondence. As this has not happened, we can keep the name as Bangalore till it happens. Frankly, I don't think it matters if the name of the page is Bangalore and Bengaluru is redirected to Bangalore or the other way round, as long the page contents are the same. I don't think it amounts to 'promoting false information'. Nobody is denying that the name is proposed to be changed (and in the process of being changed) to Bengaluru. The Wikipedia article clearly states <b>However, the name change still has to be approved by the central government, a process that is expected to take a few months</b>. -- Wiki<i><b>Cheng</b></i> | <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikicheng_419f.html" title="User talk:Wikicheng">Talk</a> 05:22, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<b>Oppose</b> - I oppose of changing the name <b>now</b>. The Government of Karnataka officially announced the new name, and recommended to the Central Government for the name change. This is not yet approved/declared by the Central Government. Any how, the name change is a sure bet, which is going to be declared soon. The delay is due to the technical procedures of the Government missionaries. <b>So, I suggest to wait till the official declaration is given by the Central Government.</b><br />

<dd>Whether the Government of India approves this change or not, the article should stay at <b>Bangalore</b>. The Government of India does <b>not</b> have the right to dictate to English-speakers around the world what its cities should be called, nor does any other Government. English has no regulatory body, so these things are determined by custom and use. If and when "Bengaluru" becomes more commonly used than "Bangalore" in English, whether in India or elsewhere, then the page can be moved, but not until then - that is Wikipedia policy.

<dd>Sigh. Calm down, Kanchanamala. This has nothing to do with rights; as far as I know, anybody has the right to call any city whatever they want, regardless of what country they live in. The issue is what name the Wikipedia article is going to use. There is a <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOL_b383.html" title="WP:POL">guideline</a> on this, and it's not "use official names," it's "<a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">use common names</a>." We're supposed to use the title that the average person would type into Google, not whichever title the local government declares official. This, for example, is why we have the article under <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a> instead of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_the_Czech_Republic_f14e.html" title="Names of the Czech Republic">Czechia</a>, despite the fact that the latter is promoted by the Czech government as the official English name.

<li><b>Support</b> It's official. Bangalore now has a new name. It is time we update to reflect this new name. I saw on a debate as to what to name Venice. In India, Indian cities are the same for any language, whether you speak Hindi, Tamil, or English. So, I support renaming the "Bangalore" page to Bengalooru. We should also replace words stating "Bangalore" to "Bengalooru."

<li><b>Oppose</b> Stick with the common most searched name for now especially since there is no evidence the English usage will change with the Hindi name change just as Bombay and Calcutta have remained the most searched for those respective cities. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 08:39, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> "Bangalore" is by far the most widely recognised name for the city in English, and this is English wikipedia. Moscow not Moskva, Florence not Firenze, Germany not Deutschland - need I go on? The recent "name-change" is irrelevant. Kannada-speakers will continue to call the city "Bengaluru" as they have always done, English-speakers and people from elsewhere in India will call it "Bangalore" as they have always done.

<li><b>Oppose</b> This name change hasn't been concluded. It has been approved by the state government only. That does not mean the change is confirmed. The public has to vote. The Central Government has to decide and the President has to approve the change. This process will take at least 6 months. Until then, the name is Bangalore.

<li><b>Oppose</b> I don't support any of the name changes, as it is a waste of money, and if Gandhi and Nehru didn't think of changing the names, then why should it happen now? There has been very little effort made to change the name of the city by any of its institutions, and they may still revert back to the old name. --<a href="../../../w/2/c/User%7EW2ch00_9180.html" title="User:W2ch00">w2ch00</a> 18:06, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> until such time as the "Bengalooru" becomes <i>more commonly recognised</i> than "Bangalore" by native English-speakers. This might take years, or might never happen at all. Meanwhile, the English-language WP ought keep the name more useful to its readership: Bangalore. -- Lonewolf BC 22:03, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> As of now, a redirect from Bengalooru to Bangalore should suffice.

<li><b>Oppose</b> I oppose the changing of name <b>now</b>. The Government of Karnataka officially announced the new name, and recommended to the Central Government for the name change. This is not yet approved/declared by the Central Government. Any how, the name change is a sure bet, which is going to be declared soon. The delay is due to the technical procedures of the Government missionaries. <b>So, I suggest to wait till the official declaration is given by the Central Government.</b> Remember, <i>the new name is officially recommended and announced by the State Government, but not yet implemented.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBangalore_67c7.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h3>
<p>OK, here is what happened: the poll above was opened after a wider poll on renaming was held <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notice_board_for_India-related_topics/archive18#Article_name_updates_for_some_Cities_of_Karnataka" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notice_board_for_India-related_topics/archive18#Article_name_updates_for_some_Cities_of_Karnataka" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I closed that poll as "move all", with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Bangalore" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Bangalore" rel="nofollow">appropriate edit summary pointing to that poll</a>. Since the entire moving job was fairly exhaustive, I probably missed <i>this</i> poll as well and it seems to have remained opened, and I unlisted it from the <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> page routinely. Apparently, people were lazy to check out what happened (and my move summary) and simply moved it back, and several other articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mangaluru&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mangaluru&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">likewise</a> in an avalanche fashion.</p>
<p>Now, since the dust apparently didn't settle, I think the only viable option is to close whatever polls were left around and start afresh; continuing 3-months old polls is a fairly bad idea. I invite anyone interesting to start a new, fresh, <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> so that consensus can be determined (and I won't touch it with a pole). <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 16:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, the <b>"result of the debate"</b> -- that is, of <b>this</b> "Requested move" debate -- was that consensus to move the page <b>failed</b>, and there was a clear majority for keeping it at "Bangalore". Although there may have been a parallel, omnibus survey-and-discussion, and although it may have had a differing verdict, and although that may explain why, back in November, you moved the page and delisted it from "Requested moves", that does not affect the outcome of of <b>this</b> discussion-and-survey. Please change your statement of "The result of the debate..." to reflect the actual result of <b>this</b> debate. -- Lonewolf BC 17:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>What a bleeding mess: I think that I now see why, on 7 November, you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bangalore&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=86035846" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bangalore&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=86035846" rel="nofollow">moved</a> the page contrary to the consensus here (then as now), minutes later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=86246783" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=86246783" rel="nofollow">delisted</a> it at "Requested moves", but left the discussion here open (and, I assume, unknown to you). This discussion was opened by one party, with the usual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=85001787" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=85001787" rel="nofollow">listing</a> at "Requested moves", properly linked to the discussion here. Afterward, the "Discuss" link in the listing was improperly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=85313525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=85313525" rel="nofollow">re-routed</a> to the omnibus discussion. -- Lonewolf BC 21:50, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly: I wasn't even aware about this poll at the time. Now, the "other" poll was a close call as well (somewhere between "move" and "no consensus"). This article ended up, one way or another, at "Bangalore" so there's no need to exercise <a href="../../../b/u/r/WP%7EBURO_89d3.html" title="WP:BURO">WP:BURO</a> and mess with poll results post mortem. Since "no consensus" is apparently demonstrated at least by frequent moving back and forth, I guess it's best to leave the things as they are at the moment. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 07:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the way, the omnibus discussion, at "Wikipedia talk:Indian Wikipedians' notice board" (as it was then called) was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANotice_board_for_India-related_topics&amp;diff=84855748&amp;oldid=84784293" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANotice_board_for_India-related_topics&amp;diff=84855748&amp;oldid=84784293" rel="nofollow">begun</a> marginally earlier, and seemingly independently of this one. Neither Bangalore nor any of the other cities concerned were listed at "Requested moves" at that time, nor ever, with respect to <i>that</i> discussion (with the arguable exception of Bangalore, and that only through the "re-routing" of the link in its RM listing). That was okay as far as it goes, because none of the proposed moves needed admin assistance at that time. However, there were <i>no</i> discussions on <i>any</i> of the other article talk-pages concerned, nor even any postings thereon giving notice of the omnibus discussion. In other words, there was <i>no</i> indication on the talk-pages of the affected articles themselves that the moves were under omnibus discussion (with the exception of Bangalore, where the discussion began separately from the omnibus discussion). This was simply not an open and proper way of going about things, and it ensured that the discussion was heavily skewed toward Indian editors, whose support for the moves was essentially just a denial of <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a>. Although there may have been more votes of support than opposition, the secretive way the omnibus discussion was carried out (whether or not the secrecy was intentional), and the illegitimate nature of the arguments in favour, render its <i>prima facie</i> outcome invalid. <i><u>No</u> pages ought ever have been moved on the basis of the omnibus discussion.</i> -- Lonewolf BC 08:41, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just rv'ed an edit that changed the lead text from "proposed to be renamed to Bengaluru" to "Renamed to Bengaluru". My understanding is that there is still a process under way that requires the Central Government to accept Karnataka's proposal to rename the city; until such time, the city's name officially remains Bangalore. However, if this is incorrect, please rv back to the other version and provide appropriate in-line citations supporting the change.
