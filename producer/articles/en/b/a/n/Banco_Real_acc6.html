	    <p><b>Banco Real</b> is a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> bank, owned by <a href="../../../a/b/n/ABN_AMRO_bdb3.html" title="ABN AMRO">ABN AMRO</a></p>
<p>Banco Real was founded in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belo_Horizonte_86b8.html" title="Belo Horizonte">Belo Horizonte</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minas_Gerais_4450.html" title="Minas Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> state, on 16 June, 1925 as Banco da Lavoura de Minas Gerais. At that time, Brazil was going through a period of economic readjustment that held back economic development and particularly, industrial production, which had been expanding strongly since <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>. It was in the middle of this scenario of economic uncertainty that the lawyer Clemente de Faria - then 34 years old and quite popular as a result of a one-term mandate as state congressman - started a co-operative. The co-operative's objective was to offer credit to farmers in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minas_Gerais_4450.html" title="Minas Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, thus allowing them access to financial resources that would, in turn, give them the opportunity to develop their activities.</p>
<p>Business at the co-operative grew quickly, despite the general economic uncertainty. In only two years, it transformed itself into a financial institution - the Banco da Lavoura de Minas Gerais (Farmer's Bank of MG) - all the while remaining faithful to its initial goal: providing small farmers with access to farm loans and opportunities to invest their money.</p>
<p>Working with this constituency and adopting innovative solutions for the banking market of its time, <i>"Lavoura"</i>, as it was called in Minas Gerais, began to distinguish itself. It attracted the attention of other bankers, who, laughingly, called the bank, <i>"Clemente's little bank"</i>, thus was the reputation of its success in the market. However, this sense of humour did not keep them from adopting solutions and products pioneered by <i>"Banco de Lavoura"</i> for their own institutions, such as: personal credit, the economic account (very similar to today's savings account) and the idea of a <i>"piggy bank"</i>.</p>
<p>The process of continuous growth at Banco da Lavoura led to its transformation into a [limited liability corporation] in [1928]. Already in the following year, resting on solid foundations, [Banco da Lavoura] was able to survive the difficulties engendered by the international financial crisis (the crash of '29), which in turn brought economic instability to Brazil and culminated in the revolution of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>. Despite all that, Banco da Lavoura continued its expansion, opening its first branch in the city of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queluz.html" title="Queluz">Queluz</a>, later renamed Conselheiro Lafayette.</p>
<p>From then on, the bank grew by opening new branches and acquiring other institutions. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, under the first <a href="../../../g/e/t/Getulio_Vargas_f25e.html" title="Getulio Vargas">Getulio Vargas</a> government, the Lavoura bought Banco Comercial de Bom Sucesso. Two years later, while the economy signalled the shrinking importance of coffee exports for the Brazilian trade balance, Banco da Lavoura crossed the borders of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minas_Gerais_4450.html" title="Minas Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> and opened its first branch outside the state, in the city of <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_Janeiro_d5c5.html" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, already with 25 branches and 14 offices, Banco da Lavoura de Minas Gerais became the 25th largest financial institution in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>The policy of expansion through the acquisition of other banks consolidated itself in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> with the purchase of Banco J. O. Resende and received a strong impulse in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>. That year, Banco Comercial de Alfenas, Banco de Pouso Alegre, Banco de Campanha and Banco Santaritense were incorporated into the bank.</p>
<p>Banco da Lavoura continued to consolidate its position as an active participant on the Brazilian financial market, counting on significant capital increases and the opening of new branches and offices in important locations, in addition to continuing its policy of acquiring other institutions.</p>
<p>The bank arrived in <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_23d2.html" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a>, Brazil's financial centre, in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, when it opened its first branches in the capital of <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_23d2.html" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a> state. At that time, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> was going through a scenario of considerable political turmoil, which led to the removal of <a href="../../../g/e/t/Getulio_Vargas_f25e.html" title="Getulio Vargas">Getulio Vargas</a> and the end of the <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estado_Novo_%28Brazil%29_16e1.html" title="Estado Novo (Brazil)">Estado Novo</a>, established by Vargas in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, the bank came to the north-east of Brazil, opening branches in the cities of <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recife.html" title="Recife">Recife</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pernambuco.html" title="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> state and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador%2C_Brazil_9efc.html" title="Salvador, Brazil">Salvador</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahia.html" title="Bahia">Bahia</a>. At the same time, Banco da Lavoura set up business in <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amap%C3%A1.html" title="Amapá">Amapá</a>, thus helping with the integration of the then federal territory through the provision of credit for a company created to extract manganese, the mineral wealth of that region.</p>
<p>In the same year, <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Aloyisio_de_Andrade_Faria_1eef.html" title="Dr. Aloyisio de Andrade Faria">Dr. Aloyisio de Andrade Faria</a> succeeded his father, who had died in October <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> at the age of 57. Aloyisio Faria managed the bank by closely following his father's project and policies. Only 28 years at the time, he accomplished the goal of transforming Banco da Lavoura into a financial institution present all over Brazil.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, Banco da Lavoura de Minas Gerais expanded its network of branches in São Paulo state and in the north-east of the country. It installed a branch in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul and acquired Banco do Norte do Brasil S.A., Alagoas, adding a network of 180 branches to the organisation. At that time, Banco da Lavoura became the largest private bank in Brazil.</p>
<p>With its position in Brazil consolidated, the bank began its operations abroad. In 1957, it was the first Brazilian bank to open a representative office - which was to become a full agency in 1964 - in New York. Also in 1957, it was the first bank to set up business in Brasilia, even before the inauguration of the future federal capital, thus receiving the "operating license No. 1". During the period from 1958 to 1966, Banco da Lavoura purchased Banco Vera Cruz, with a total of 346 branches, and created Banco Real de Investimentos S.A.</p>
<p>The year 1969 was marked by important events, such as the creation of two additional financial businesses: Companhia Real de Investimentos (The Real Investment Company) and Companhia Real de Crédito Imobiliário (The Real Property Loans Company), in addition to the purchase of Banco Mercantil de Niterói.</p>
<p>On 1 March 1971 head office was moved from <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belo_Horizonte_86b8.html" title="Belo Horizonte">Belo Horizonte</a> to <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_23d2.html" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a> and the bank assumed its current name Banco Real S.A. In 1973 took off an accelerated expansion of the operations abroad, with the creation of Grupo Real del Paraguay (The Real Group of Paraguay), comprised of a commercial bank and three other businesses. In the following year, Banco Real opened a branch on the Brazilian island of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernando_de_Noronha_56af.html" title="Fernando de Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a> and acquired Banco de Minas Gerais, which operated 133 branches at that time.</p>
<p>On its 50th anniversary, in 1975, Banco Real operated 512 branches in Brazil, the biggest branch network in the country, in addition to 12 associated businesses including Companhia Real de Investimentos, then the number one in the domestic ranking. It also had 10 units located abroad - in Bogota, Panama, Grand Cayman, Nassau, Curaçao, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, and Mexico City.</p>
<p>In mid-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, the strategic partnership between Banco Real and Banco ABN AMRO SA - the Brazilian subsidiary of <a href="../../../a/b/n/ABN_AMRO_bdb3.html" title="ABN AMRO">ABN AMRO</a> Bank - was announced. <a href="../../../a/b/n/ABN_AMRO_bdb3.html" title="ABN AMRO">ABN AMRO</a> began its activities in Brazil in 1917 as Banco Holandés da America do Sul, when it opened two pioneering branches in the country: one in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santos_%28S%C3%A3o_Paulo%29_868d.html" title="Santos (São Paulo)">Santos</a>, <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_23d2.html" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a> state and another in <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_Janeiro_d5c5.html" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. Growth came with the opening of new branches and the acquisition of Aymoré in 1963. The merger with Banco Real took place in 1998 and was one of the largest financial operations at the time.</p>
<p>In November <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> and November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> two Brazilian state-owned banks, Banco do Estado de Pernambuco S.A. (Bandepe) in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recife.html" title="Recife">Recife</a> and Banco do Estado do Paraiba (Paraiban) were acquired. In October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Banco Real completed the acquisition of Banco Sudameris.</p>
