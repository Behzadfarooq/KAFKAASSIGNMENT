<p>why cant we believe it..we dont need any sources to believe in the glorific(read horrific) exploits of mohammed.just a look at any islamic country of the intolerance of muslims in general might say what their revealed prophet might have been like....</p>

<li>Don't forget that everything has a source isn't true. There are good and valid sources but also we face hundreds of bad and false sources. In my opinion, the section about Muhammed is a total dust. Muhammed wage many wars against the local tribes(and of course many people died in these wars) but he didn't go and loot anywhere.

<p>"Jewess" isn't an anti-Semitic term. At most it might be considered sexist, as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jewess" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jewess" rel="nofollow">explained at dictionary.com</a>, but then why isn't "Latina" considered offensive? — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2006-06-16 17:16</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Uh... what are you talking about... it says in the link you provided that it is "now a highly offensive term." It's anti-Semitic and most often used by Russians. Latina is a hispanic word. Jewess, like Negress, is an outsider's pejorative epithet. <a href="../../../t/c/h/User%7ETchadienne_58ee.html" title="User:Tchadienne">Tchadienne</a> 17:24, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Did you even read the Usage note? It is <b>not</b> anti-Semitic; it is at most <b>sexist</b>, for the reasons explained in the Usage note on the link that you claimed to have read:
<dl>
<dd>"Like many other English nouns in which the suffix -ess is added to a gender-neutral word to indicate femaleness, the terms Jewess and Negress are now widely regarded as offensive. It is interesting to note that the objection to words formed with the -ess suffix does not apply to words such as Latina and Chicana, whose contrasting forms Latino and Chicano are not gender-neutral but rather refer even in English primarily to males."</dd>

<dd>I cant figure out what you're point is... it <i>is</i> anti-Semitic. Whether or not, it's still "highly offensive" so dont use it. Theres nothing to discuss here. <a href="../../../t/c/h/User%7ETchadienne_58ee.html" title="User:Tchadienne">Tchadienne</a> 17:37, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whether or not it's offensive is not the point; it's that it <b>is not</b> anti-Semitic. It is <b>sexist</b>. You can claim it is anti-Semitic if you want, but you have simply been misled. If you <b><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=-ess" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=-ess" rel="nofollow">read the Usage note at -ess</a></b>, you'll understand why:
<dl>
<dd>"Many critics have argued that there are sexist connotations in the use of the suffix -ess to indicate a female in words like sculptress, waitress, stewardess, and actress. The heart of the problem lies in the nonparallel use of terms to designate men and women. For example, the -or ending on sculptor seems neutral or unmarked. By comparison, sculptress seems to be marked for gender, implying that the task of sculpting differs as performed by women and men or even that the task should typically be performed by a man."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Read the above, and you'll understand why it may be sexist, but it is not anti-Semitic: "Jew" implies either male or female Jewish person; "Jewess" appends a gender to the word, for no particular reason, which is seen by people as offensive because there was nothing wrong with referring to a female Jewish person as a "Jew" in the first place. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2006-06-16 17:47</small>

<p>Brian, are you by any chance a Jew? Maybe not. Doesn't really matter, as falsehood is false even if spoken by an honest man, and truth is truth, even if it is spoken by a liar. Which are you? I believe the former. This article, I'm afraid, mixes fact with opinion, blurring the line between truth and falsehood. I like the fact that you quote alot of Arabic sources, translated by one Mr Stillman. Have you read the original Arabic sources, or relied purely on the translation of one man who seems to have an agenda. The article, I'm afraid is flawed. It is not written in an objective manner at all. It's an article that should not be read seriously. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedahmeid_30ef.html" title="User:Redahmeid">Redahmeid</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redahmeid_a9ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redahmeid">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Brian, are you serious? This is the most blatantly non WP:NPV I've seen in a long time. Even if the facts were completely NPV, which seems extremely unlikely, the article itself is obviously not. Even if "the Jews of Medina, guilty only of hard earned wealth, innocent of any wrong doing throughout, were repeatedly set upon by the dastardly Mohamed and his supporters, murderous and scandalous, motivated always and only by treachery and avarice" were accurate history, which seems inherently implausible, a NPV article would at least have to put such vile criminals in a cultural context. As it is, having this article on the front page is an embarrassment. Some administrator really screwed up here. Oh, it looks like it was you. Might I respectfully suggest that you ask an administrator colleague whose judgement you trust to double check your call that this article is NPV. - Anon <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.30.119.55 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.30.119.55_d41a.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.30.119.55">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>For some reason, it is possible that Norman Stillman has a biased POV. Most of the negative parts came from his worls. It might be good to use info that eceryone agrees is fact, since no one can go back to 622 and say that he saw the looting. The killings during war are obvious.

<p>I thought I may contribute some opinions -</p>
<ul>
<li>The article portrays that the Banu Nadir were innocent of any wrongdoings in their dealings with the Prophet and his followers. However ibn-Hashim stated that the tribe's behaviour had become increasingly insulting/provocative after a particular incident. The incident in question, which occured after the Battle of Badr, happened when a Muslim lady went into the shop of a Jew to make some purchases. The shopkeeper behaved insultingly towards her, whereupon she called for help. Her call was answered by a Muslim man, who arrived on the scene. A scuffle broke out and the shopkeeper was killed, whereupon the Muslim man in question was set upon by some Jewish men and was murdered. Upon investigation, none of those accused of the killing of the Muslim man was ready to admit his guilt. This incident, ibn-Hashim tells us, was not isolated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article states that Ka'b bin Ashraf wrote 'erotic poems' about Muslim women. It is my understanding (and I'm sorry I can't reference this) that he wrote scurrilous poetry, degrading and insulting about ladies in the Prophet's family.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ka'b bin Ashraf also went to Mecca, after the Battle of Badr, and visited the Quraish (who were defeated in the Battle), and roused them into taking an oath, with the skirts of the Ka'bah in their hands, that they would know no rest until they had destroyed Islam and it's Founder. This has been taken from "The English Commentary" of the Qur'aan, a heavily researched, well referenced essay, by Maulawi Sher Ali, Mirza Bashir Ahmad amd Malik Ghulam Farid. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by SafetyFirst (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SafetyFirst_0b99.html" title="Special:Contributions/SafetyFirst">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>here are some reasons why i feel that this article is not of NPOV status</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>... a qualification which provided Muhammad with a convenient pretext for nullifying his obligations toward Jews at a later time.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>POV</b> - i don't think i have to explain why. implication that he would implement this pretext <u>when</u> he wanted to nullify obligations towards the jews, which is inherently false. the jews violated the conditions of the pact that they signed, which resulted in further steps being taken.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>... Infuriated at Muhammad's execution of a number of Meccan notables who had been captured after the Battle of Badr, Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf wrote a poetic eulogy commemorating the slain Quraysh prisoners of war; later, he also wrote erotic poetry about Muslim women, which Muhammad and his followers found offensive.[4] Because the norms of the Arab society of that period demanded retaliation for a slight to a group's honor,[3] Muhammad called upon his followers to kill Ka'b, and Muhammad ibn Maslama offered his services, collecting four others.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>POV</b> - factually incorrect - this is more of stillman's speculative POV. Ka'b went to Quraysh to incite them to fight against the Prophet <a href="http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/archives/2006/false-allegations-of-atrocities-ii/" class="external text" title="http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/archives/2006/false-allegations-of-atrocities-ii/" rel="nofollow">references provided here</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"He went to the Quraish weeping over their killed (at Badr) and inciting them to fight with the Prophet."1</dd>
<dd>(The Prophet said): "He (Ka'b) has openly assumed enmity to us and speaks evil of us and he has gone over to the polytheists (who were at war with Muslims) and has made them gather against us for fighting"2</dd>
<dd>"And according to Kalbi, he united in a league with the Quraish before the curtains of the Ka'bah, to fight against the Muslims."3</dd>
<dd>"And he prepared a feast, and conspired with some Jews that he would invite the Prophet and when he came they should fall on him all of a sudden."4</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>therefore, he himself violated the pact (conditions of which are highlighted in ar-raheeq al-makhtoom), to which he was also required to adhere to, and thus his killing was due to his incitement of war, as well as his insulting. stillman opines that it was merely a matter of honour.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>... Muhammad felt himself strong enough to finally move against the Jews of Medina.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>POV</b>. as said above, the jews violated their pact. there is no citation for this suggestion and is merely speculation of someone's intention.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"As his first target, Muhammad chose Banu Qaynuqa, the weakest of the Jewish tribes, who were the clients of the Khazraj, and forced them to surrender unconditionally after a short siege.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>POV</b>. he went to the marketplace calling upon banu qaynuqa, calling them to accept islam lest they ended up like the quraysh who were just defeated. the implication is that he chose this tribe for the greater aim of expelling all of the jews, so he would start with the weakest first. throughout the article this unfounded notion goes unreferenced to any early or primary source. this was not a threat of expulsion, and neither was it a threat of war, as it can be interpreted in a number of ways due to the indirect and rather ambiguous language. qaynuqa responded with hostility and an open challenge, and due to their hostility they were expelled. from <a href="http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/archives/2006/false-allegations-of-atrocities-ii/" class="external text" title="http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/archives/2006/false-allegations-of-atrocities-ii/" rel="nofollow">bismikaallahuma</a>:<br /></li>
</ul>
<p><i>"Addressing them, he said: "O Jews! Become Muslims before what befell the Quraysh befalls you." They said: "O Muhammad, you seem to think that we are your people. Do not deceive yourself because you vanquished a contingent of Quraysh having no knowledge of war and got the better of them; for, by God, if we fight you, you will find that we are real men, and that you have not met the like of us". Their answer clearly contained a challenge and a threat, despite the fact that they had accepted his leadership according to the terms of the treaty. This report comes through Ibn Ishaq[2]. Ibn Hajar said that it was hasan.[3] But the isnad includes Muhammad ibn Muhammad, the freedman of Zayd ibn Thabit, whom Ibn Hajar himself said was majhul (unknown).[4]</i></p>
<p><i>Even if we accept Ibn Hajar?s suggestion that the report is hasan, that does not mean that the reason for the expulsion of Banu Qaynuqa was their refusal to accept Islam, because at that stage Islam still allowed the Muslims to live in peace with them, and the Prophet did not make entering Islam a condition for any one of the Jews to stay in Madinah. Rather, the Document[5] ensured the religious freedom of the Jews. The reason for their expulsion was the aggression which they showed.

<p>these are a few of the concerns i have highlighted with this article. unfortunately many of the articles concerning early islamic history seem to be a bit misrepresented (i.e. marriage to safiyya, expulsion of qurayza) also, perhaps muslims can spend more time dispelling speculation, POV and factually incorrect material? i propose the language used in this article is reviewed and expressed with neutrality, highlighting stillman's perspective as opinion and not fact. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah">Itaqallah</a> 22:00, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The argument boils down to an editor's disliking the article and proceeding to say "give me time to find sources".

<li>bismikaallahuma does not qualify as a reliable source in and of itself, that is correct. however i have provided the links so that one may take a look at the references they have given where i have quoted from their articles. as stated earlier, the burden of proof is upon the claimant, not on the one trying to refute the claimant. the POV of stillman is of no relevance (and most certainly should not be stated as fact), the correct resources must be referenced, else the POV statements should be removed. secondly, i have not requested time to find sources, i have requested time to re-express much of the article while adding the relevant citations where possible, and i assume that those who have done such understand that it does not occur immediately. similarly, i am not requesting immediate change of the article until a viable alternative is apparent- the point of this discussion is ascertaining whether or not POV is present, and if so to what degree. regardless, a person's argument regarding POV cannot be disregarded on the basis of his asking for some time. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah">Itaqallah</a> 23:56, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Okay so let us see. It is an article written about the history of Islam and Mohammad (PBUH) and the resources quoted include Bearman (who is Jewish) and Stillman (who is also Jewish). Arabic sources that are "translated" by Stillman (Jewish). Very nice! History of Islam written by Jews.</p>
<p>Oh and one more thing, the external resources cited, in fact, seem to give us another POV. This is quoted from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/ma_jews.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/ma_jews.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/ma_jews.shtml</a> which is listed as an external resource.</p>
<p>"At Muhammad's insistence, Medina's pagan, Muslim and Jewish clans signed a pact to protect each other, but achieving this new social order was difficult. Certain individual pagans and recent Medinan converts to Islam tried to thwart the new arrangement in various ways, and some of the Jewish clans were uneasy with the threatened demise of the old alliances. At least three times in five years, Jewish leaders, uncomfortable with the changing political situation in Medina, went against Muhammad, hoping to restore the tense, sometimes bloody-but predictable-balance of power among the tribes.</p>
<p>According to most sources, individuals from among these clans plotted to take his life at least twice, and once they came within a bite of poisoning him. Two of the tribes--the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qaynuqa--were eventually exiled for falling short on their agreed upon commitments and for the consequent danger they posed to the nascent Muslim community."</p>
<p>The other site quoted, managed by Ali Sina who has made it his life's mission to "help muslims leave Islam". <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina/b_nadir.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina/b_nadir.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina/b_nadir.htm</a></p>
<p>The third site <a href="http://www.shodalap.com/Jews_in_Madina.htm#_ftnref4" class="external free" title="http://www.shodalap.com/Jews_in_Madina.htm#_ftnref4" rel="nofollow">http://www.shodalap.com/Jews_in_Madina.htm#_ftnref4</a> quoted says, "The Jews were NOT innocent at all. The punishment they got was an inevitable outcome of their horrendous and heinous crime. The crime was not ‘rejecting Islam’, but something more fatal, homicidal, and severely atrocious. It’s very absurd to claim that the prophet (peace be upon him) maltreated them; rather, the prophet (peace be upon him) was maltreated by the Jews in every step of his life in Medina."</p>
<p>Hmmmmmmmmmmmm, now it should make any intelligent human think that first of all the article is written using the words of Jews. One of the external links is managed by a guy who has made it his life's goal to "help muslims leave Islam." The other two sites CLEARLY tell us another point of view. Mohammad(PBUH) was the one whose life was endanger and Jews were the ones who tried to kill him several times even after he gave them a fair chance.</p>
<p>And just because he took a wife, doesn't say ANYTHING about him exterminating Jews. What kind of logic is that? I take a wife who is "not my kind" and all of a sudden everybody thinks I am trying to exterminate her entire clan. I'll tell you what kind of logic is that. It is called twisted logic, biased logic, more like propaganda. If anything, by taking a Jewish wife, Mohammad (PBUH) was trying to patch things up. He was trying for peace.</p>
<p>Its pretty funny how from literally thousands of books, journals, articles, and various publications (may they be online or on paper), the author of THIS article chose to cite things written by Jews and a guy who has made it his goal to "help muslims leave Islam". The other two don't even belong here as external resources.</p>
<p>Oh and I almost forgot. You don't need to "brag" about those 13 references that are listed. If it is only the number of references that matters, I will provide you with hundreds, if not thousands, references from published works that say otherwise. I know, as impossible as it may sound, there just might be a Jew or two who might agree with me.

<p>Unfortunately Gren, you are right. Scholars are often attacked for their religion rather than for their merit and for a good reason. Usually works are biased even if scholars don't intend do, religion is just so deep and such a sensitive issue within us that it is extremely difficult to stay objective. There is a saying which we have that it takes two hands to clap. I will never believe a Jewish scholar and a Jew will never believe a Muslim Scholar. Jewish scholars give a distorted view of history (in their favor of course) and Muslim scholars do the same. There are very few exceptions. I am a man of science and I try to keep religion and science seperate because they do often conflict BUT I am also a Muslim (alhamudulillah) and I WILL react if there is a pathetic attempt to defame Muslims all over because I am one of them and everything I hold dear is at stake here. But you know what, this battle is an old one. It is at least as old as Islam itself. If anything, history (depends which one) bears witness that Muslims actually treated Jews better than the Europeans/Christians did. We don't even need to go far back. One can just look at World War II. Hitler tried to wipe out the scum of Germany and England tried to throw them into a wasteland of Africa by relocating them there and "finding them a home" which ended up being Israel. Two-for-one...let's take care of Jews and Muslims in one strike and let's get rid of both our problems by making them kill each other and hence the infernal struggle of Palestine vs. Israel was born. 137.78.140.190 23:48, 16 June 2006 (UTC)Ali</p>

<li>i believe that there is a POV issue with the article as well as factual errors, some of which have been highlighted. therefore i added to totallydisputed tag. Pecher suggests that as there is nothing opposing the "high-quality" scholarship of stillman as of yet, there is thus no dispute re: POV. i disagree as a POV is a POV (as has been demonstrated here) and not fact until clear references to the relevant sources (primary, or early) have been given. thus making statements and referencing it to stillman's view carries no weight and no guarantee of NPOV. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah">Itaqallah</a> 01:15, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>From NPOV dispute, How can one disagree about NPOV?
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of neutrality disputes are due to a simple confusion: one party believes "X" to be a fact, and—this party is mistaken (see second example below)—that if a claim is <i>factual,</i> it is therefore <i>neutral.</i> The other party either denies that "X" <i>is</i> a fact, or that everyone would agree that it is a fact. In such a dispute, the first party needs to re-read the Neutral Point of View policy. Even if something is a fact, or allegedly a fact, that does not mean that the bold statement of that fact is neutral. Neutrality here at Wikipedia is all about presenting competing versions of what the facts are. It doesn't matter <i>at all</i> how convinced we are that our facts are the facts. If a significant number of other interested parties <i>really do</i> disagree with us, no matter how wrong we think they are, the neutrality policy dictates that the discussion be recast as a fair presentation of the dispute between the parties.</li>
<li><i>later...</i> To mark a dispute on a page, type <b>{{POV}}</b>...The above label is meant to indicate that a discussion is ongoing, and hence that the article contents are disputed and volatile. If you add the above code to an article which seems to be biased to you, but there is no prior discussion of the bias, you need to <i>at least</i> leave a note on the article's talk page describing what you consider unacceptable about the article. The note should address the problem with enough specificity to allow constructive discussion towards a resolution, such as identifying specific passages, elements, or phrasing that are problematic.</li>

<li>The question is not whether the article can be improved. It is whether it <i>currently</i> meets front page standards. If not, its presence there is a mistake which should be promptly rectified.</li>

<li>When we're talking about single facts like this, judging neutrality becomes much more difficult. So, the test is not as stringent as you make it sound. In practice, the only cases that are obviously biased are those that use a specifically-biased word, like "harshly" or "wonderful", etc. If there is something non-neutral about the fact, the fact can be changed; there's no reason to eliminate the entry altogether. Suggest an alternate wording, and see what others think. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2006-06-17 03:37</small>
<ul>
<li>Is it a wordsmithing problem? Change a few words and it's all better? Or a pervasive failure of intent? Consider <a href="http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/ma_jews.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbs.org/muhammad/ma_jews.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. There are only a couple of possibilities. (1) It represents a tiny minority view which may be ignored. (2) The current article fairly and sympathetically represents the views therein. (3) It doesn't, but that doesn't matter. (4) It doesn't, needs to, and thus is currently a NPOV failure. That's it. (1) is wacko, (2) unsupportable, (3) a misunderstanding or willful disregard of wikipedia policy, and (4) tells you both what needs to be done, and why the article didn't belong on the front page.</li>
<li>Similarly, do you believe the article was written in a spirit of fairness and sympathy for Mohamed and Islam? Fairness can be argued with facts. But sympathy is there as a standard to emphasize that the <i>intent</i> must be righteous. Perhaps the reason this article has drawn such visceral objection, is that the spirit in which it was written is not at all subtle. And had little to do with sympathy.</li>

<p>I don't understand how an article that clearly doesn't meet Wiki standards was not only placed on the DYK page, but also as positioned as the first article.</p>
<p>I think there are some accuracy issues here with not only the sources, but with the verbiage in the article. Someone who unfortunately sounded somewhat anti-semitic made the point that most of the sources stem from Jewish writers, and while he went off on a belligerent tangent, this is a point that should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The Jewish scholars may not have an agenda or be any less than fine academic scholars, but consider a juxtaposition of a similar religious tension: Would Wiki allow a series of Irish Catholic scholars to make up the bulk of citations in an article written about Irish Protestants? The fact that PBS, a relatively reputable source, had a completely different take on the same series of events should have resulted in an immediate removal of this article from the DYK page.</p>

<dd><i>The tribes at Medina were more welcoming, many even converting to Islam. After a military episode, the Battle of Badr, Muhammed and his followers consolidated their power as the ruling party, although much of the population that had remained Jewish was left unaffected. Three of the Jewish tribes - the Banu Qurayza, Banu Qaynuqa, and Banu Nadir - signed a non-aggression pact and military alliance with Mohammed, the Constitution of Medina.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Jews and other non-Muslim people living under the protection of the Muslim authorities were considered dhimmi - in exchange for paying a tax, jizya, Muslims would provide military protection. Such dhimmi had similar rights, and could continue their culture and worship, even being exempted from military action when a military jihad was called by the Muslim group. Female dhimmi were also allowed to marry Muslim males, although the converse was not true without male dhimmi converting to Islam....</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>After a while, a member of the Banu Qaynuqa was alleged to have murdered a Muslim woman, and was killed in retaliation by a Muslim, leading to a chain of revenge killings. Arbitration failed, and full scale war broke out, until Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul, an old ally of Qaynuqa, interceded on their behalf and persuaded Mohammed to send the entire Banu Qaynuqa into exile, consequently confiscating their land and property. The intersession of ibn Salul saved the Jewish tribe but gained him the enmity of Muhammad. The conflict led to a ruling that such future action by any of the other parties to the Constitution of Medina would constitute a voiding of their benefits under the system, and subsequent punishment.</i></dd>

<p>The fact that that entire prelude (which I remember similarly from a different authoritative source which is currently inaccessible to me) was omitted from this otherwise very detailed and apparently carefully sourced article makes me suspicious.</p>
<p>I need to check the edit history -- back in May, this article, although much shorter, made it perfectly clear that the source of the dispute was controversial, with the truth of the matter essentially lost to history. The fact is that the conflict stemmed from a single disputed murder accusation.</p>
<p>This current article, in the "Arrival of Muhammad" section, completely omits these details, making it seem like the Muslims acted unilaterally, without provocation.

Morover, the of the several alleged insults of the Jews, only one (the erotic poems) were mentioned. The intro didn't explain that the Banu Nadir were evicted AFTER a Muslim war with the other Jewis tribe, and it didn't explain that the Nadir had joined forces with the attacking Meccans and Bedouin before they were slaughtered.

<li>in the "arrival of muhammad" section of the current reversion, it implies that the constitution was signed after badr. this is factually incorrect, as the pact with the jewish tribes was made before badr occured when power had already been consolidated in Medinah. this is why ka'b ibn al-ashraf's incitement of the quraysh (after badr) to fight is especially significant as he acted in violation of the pact, especially as he enjoyed a high status. please refer to ar-raheeq al-makhtoom <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:01, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Amongst his first actions was the construction of the first Mosque in Medinah, as well as obtaining residence with <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ayyub_al-Ansari_08d0.html" title="Abu Ayyub al-Ansari">Abu Ayyub al-Ansari</a> (Ibn Kathir, al-Bidaayah wa al-Nihaayah, Vol II, p.279). He then set about the establishment of a pact between the Muslims and the various Jewish tribes of Medinah(Ibn Hisham, Vol. I, p.501), which was to regulate the matters of governance of the city, as well as the extent and nature of inter-community relations. Conditions of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Medina_75b9.html" title="Constitution of Medina">pact</a> included boycotting Quraysh "commercially" as well as abstinence from "extending any support to them", assistance of one another if attacked by a third party, as well as "defending Madinah, in case of a foreign attack".(Al-Raheeq Al-Makhtoom, Saif-ur-Rahman Mubarakfuri; Ibn Hisham Vol. II, pp. 147-150; Ibn Ishaq pp. 231-235). It was later that certain tribes would be claimed to have violated this pact due to supporting enemy forces, such as the Quraysh, against the Muslims."</p>
<p>please discuss the viability (or not) of these alterations. if it lacks NPOV or factuality, please state where and how. i felt it necessary to mention more conditions of the pact relevant to the latter events. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah">Itaqallah</a> 14:20, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>regarding your first point, somewhat agreed. i do concede that perhaps the mentioning of the construction of the first mosque as well as residence with aby ayyub al-ansari may not be relevant. i added these parts to clarify that the formation of the pact does not seem to have been one of his first actions. i also felt the need to expound upon the difference between ansar and muhajir which has been confused in the section, thereby mentioning both but keeping it relatively short. the second point i disagree upon, as i do not think the section is sufficient especially when highlighting the significance of the pact in this affair. it is neccessary to mention other specific clauses instead of citing a general clause (open to interpretation) and then opining that such was offered with the intention of gaining opputunity for deliberate manipulation. the clauses mentioned in my proposal, i believe, are directly related to the latter controversies between the parties involved, and integral to understanding the context of other events within the article. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:00, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>i would also suggest that another section is added after the above which expounds upon the increasing tensions between certain tribes of the jews (not all, i.e. banu 'awf). this is important as opposed to jumping straight from the arrival of Muhammad to the expulsion of banu qaynuqa as the latter does not sufficiently contextualise the event and take into consideration the increasing hostility and emnity between the two parties. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah">Itaqallah</a> 14:33, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>i suggest mention well-known incident of the killing of the jewish shopkeeper and muslim; perhaps also the incidence re: the muslim woman. although the isnaad of this is weak, it is said to be cited by historians as a possible reason for the spiralling tensions although i will try to verify that claim; the statement attributed to ibn ishaq in ar-raheeq al-makhtoom where safiyyah states that her father (huyayi bin akhtab) saw muhammad on his (i.e. muhammad's) entry in madinah and walked home, saying "my heart is burning with enmity towards him" - also in ibn hisham vol. I, pp 518,519; the resent of certain tribes on hearing the muslims' victory in badr; the story of shas bin qays (an elderly jewish man) where he attempted to spread discord amongst the muslims by attempting to reignite tribal differences (narrated in raheeq al-makhtoom, as well as risaalat al-islam p144 vol 8. ch. 30, written by al-ustad ash-shaykh muhammad 'arafah). there may also be others that i have either overlooked or am not aware of. perhaps these can also be divided to pre-badr and post-badr controversies?</dd>

<dd>what has been suggested by myself is not regarding justification of the expulsion, else it would have been proposed to be in the banu qaynuqa section of this article. this is to outline and highlight the presence of a degree of hostility between the communities, which i feel is necessary for readers in understanding the general relationship between the muslims and jewish (i.e. qaynuqa, nadir, qurayzah) tribes at this time. the actual reason/justification for expulsion has been cited above (negative light/reasons section) in fath al-baari and by al-zurqaani which details the exchange between muhammad and people of banu qaynuqa, and this is also something that needs to be added to the banu qaynuqa section in place of the POV material currently present regarding their expulsion. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 23:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>as opposed to the current paragraph regarding banu qaynuqa, of which i have already previously highlighted certain problematic statements, i propose something similar to this:</p>
<p>"It was after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Badr_04cf.html" title="Battle of Badr">Battle of Badr</a> that Muhammad decided to approach Banu Qaynuqa (the allies of the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khazraj.html" title="Khazraj">Khazraj</a> tribe), in the light of previous hostilities, gathering them in the market place and addressing them as follows:</p>
<p>"<i>O assembly of Jews, beware that something from Allah befalls you similar to the curse that descended upon Quraysh, and enter into Islam, for you have known that I am a Prophet that has been sent, due to what you find in your Book and the covenant of Allah to you</i>"</p>
<p>They replied: "<i>O Muhammad, you seem to think that we are your people. Do not deceive yourself because you vanquished a contingent of Quraysh having no knowledge of war and got the better of them; for, by God, if we fight you, you will find that we are real men, and that you have not met the like of us</i>" (declared by Ibn Hajar to be Hasan - Fath al-Baari 7/332; also in sunan abi da'wood 3/402).</p>
<p>It was this exchange which resulted in what is known as the seige of Banu Qaynuqa (al-maghazee lil-waaqidee, vol.1, chapter of ghazwat qaynuqa, <a href="../../../w/a/q/Waqidi.html" title="Waqidi">al-waaqidee</a>; as-seerat an-nabaweeyat, vol. 2, under chapter of "'amr banu qaynuqa" - arabic version, ibn hisham; ar-raheeq al-makhtoom, saif-ur-rahman mubarakfuri), which lasted for fourteen to fifteen days, after which the tribe surrendered unconditionally. Muhammad consented to the Banu Qaynuqa being expelled when <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdallah_ibn_Ubayy_c83f.html" title="Abdallah ibn Ubayy">Abdallah ibn Ubayy</a>, the chief of the Khazraj, pleaded before Muhammad on their behalf. The Banu Nadir remained passive during the whole Banu Qaynuqa episode."</p>
<p>please excuse the current messy presentation of references. one may argue that mentioning the narration is original research. to this i disagree and say that i have provided the references in the books of historians who not only document this incident but relate it directly concerning the justification of the expulsion of banu qaynuqa. this is why i have provided the majority of references after the comment following the quote because the references used this narration in explaining the expulsion of banu qaynuqa. i ommitted the last part of the final sentence (of the original article) due to the previous discussion where i opined that it is neither NPOV nor a verifiable claim.</p>
<p>please also note that the first part of the exchange has been taken from ibn hisham. the version present in al-waaqidee is:</p>
<p>"<i>O assembly of Jews! Enter into Islam, for by Allah you know that I am the Messenger of Allah, before there comes to you from Allah the like of what came to Quraysh</i>"</p>
<p>please discuss the viability (or not) of this proposal. if it lacks NPOV or factuality, please state where and how, and propose the relevant amendments. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 17:54, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>At least two people have reverted back huge amounts of very biased <i>language</i> while claiming to revert because of sources. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>However, it matters not because I have found the following sources which agree on the genesis of the tit-for-tat dispute:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A Muslim woman went (to the market of Banu Qaynuqa) and sat at a jeweler’s shop with her ornaments. A Jewish man approached her from behind and nailed the back of her dress with a thorn. When she arose her garment came off and the Jews all laughed at her insultingly. She called for help and a nearby Muslim leapt at the jeweler and killed him, then the Jews assembled together and killed the Muslim. The family of the Muslim martyr called on the Muslims to punish the Jews, they did so and a fight thus ensued between them.</i> -- "The Expulsion Of Banu Qaynuqa," <i>The Islamic State,</i> published by Hizb ut Tahrir <a href="http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/english/books/state/chapter_19.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/english/books/state/chapter_19.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>and:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A desert woman came one day to the Jews' market in the quarter of Banu Qaynuqa` seeking to remodel some jewelry at one of their shops. They persistently asked her to remove her veil, but the woman refused. Passing behind her without her knowledge, one of them tacked her robe with a pin to the wall. When the woman got up to leave, the robe was pulled down and her nakedness exposed. The Jews laughed and the woman cried. Seeing what happened, a Muslim passerby jumped upon the shopkeeper and killed him on the spot. The Jews gathered around the Muslim and likewise killed him. The Muslims' relatives called for help against the Jews and a general fight between them and the Banu Qaynuqa` erupted.</i> -- "Between Badr and Uhud," <i>Life of Muhammad,</i> by Muhammad Husayn Haykal, translated by Isma'il Razi A. al-Faruqi (1933) <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/MH_LM/default.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/MH_LM/default.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>and:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There is a report which says that one of the Banu Qaynuqa tied the hem of the garment of a Muslim woman who was in their market-place, in such a way that when she stood up, she was uncovered and she screamed. One of the Muslims came and killed the Jew who had done it. Then the Jews attacked the Muslim and killed him. The Muslim's family called on the rest of the Muslims to help them against the Jews. The Muslims became angry, and bad feelings arose between them and the Banu Qaynuqa</i> -- "The Expulsion of Banu Qaynuqa," <i>Madinan Society At the Time of the Prophet,</i> by Akram Diya al Umari (1991) <a href="http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/archives/2005/the-expulsion-of-banu-qaynuqa/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/archives/2005/the-expulsion-of-banu-qaynuqa/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>

<p>Here is an incomplete list of mistakes replaced by reverts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro:
<ul>
<li>Implication that Muhammad expelled Banu Nadir "Shortly" after his arrival; in fact it took several years and a military campaign which took him away from Medina in between the events.</li>
<li>Implication that the eviction was unilateral, and not in reaction to a war with another jewish tribe.</li>
<li>Implication that the slaughter was unilateral, and not in retalliation for the Jews' assistance of the attacking Meccans.</li>
<li>Unsourced "widow of the tribe's slain treasurer" as opposed to "captured Jewish woman"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Background:
<ul>
<li>"Academic historians" claim for unsourced statment(!)</li>
<li>deletion of {{fact}} tag without replacing source</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arrival of Muhammad:
<ul>
<li>Implication that the Constitution was imposed without consent</li>
<li>Very biased claim that "status was conditional upon their not "acting wrongfully", a qualification which provided Muhammad with a convenient pretext for nullifying his obligations toward Jews at a later time."
<ul>
<li>(a) That status was not changed until after provocation by the Banu Nadir's chief (e.g. erotic poetry about Muslim women)</li>
<li>(b) "convienient pretext" -- unsupported subjective conjecture, not encuclopedic objectivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No mention of the equal rights provided by the constitution before it fell apart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expulsion of the Banu Qaynuqa from Medina:
<ul>
<li>Could <b>anything</b> be more biased than this passage? "Muhammad felt himself strong enough to finally move against the Jews of Medina." It's subjective, unknowable, and loaded, pretending to document the motivations, all while <b>completely ignoring</b> the well-documented source of the conflict.</li>
<li>The source being the escallation from the stripped muslim woman in the jewish jewler's shop, which I carefully documented <i>on request,</i> from reliable secondary sources which were falsely claimed to be unreliable -- and reverted away without explanation</li>
<li>Very viased claim: "The Banu Nadir ... failed to grasp Muhammad's intentions at that time" -- this ascribes "intentions" in a subjective, non-encyclopedic way. Just the facts, please.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf:
<ul>
<li>Reversion of sourced detail concerning the legality of the killing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expulsion of the Banu Nadir from Medina:
<ul>
<li>Unsourced "Shortly after" when years passed</li>
<li>Huge amounts of biased language -- you can look at the diff yourself; it's obvious. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 19:43, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am astonished at these claims. Do you also concede that anyone pushing a Jewish POV "is a bad position," or not? On what grounds do you claim that "all authoritative Muslim historians died several centuries ago"? Are modern-day Islamic scholars not authoritative Muslim historians? My POV, frankly, is that both sides of this issue have been acting like bloody three-year-olds for thousands of years, since the moment their respective scriptures, which devote so much space to demands for killing those people who don't believe in them, were written. That is not a POV I have been adding to the article, I'm sure you've noticed. My goal here, has been an experiment, to merely add the opposing point of view to this article from which it had so obviously been scrubbed. I've learned a lot, and in fact, this is the first time in my life I have ever been accused of racism. To be so accused by someone making the claims you are is comical, or would be if it wasn't so sad. There is no question that this article will not have a neutral point of view while it includes only one of the opposing points of view, and not the other. There is no way to take them both out, so they must both be included. My version doesn't remove the Jewish point of view, it adds the Muslim point of view and corrects glaring objective inaccuracies such as the "promulgated" constitution which was without question reached through mutual consent. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 16:50, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As the bible says, <i>kill your brother, friend, and neighbor</i> (Exodus Chapter 32 verse 27) or with the principle by which <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon.html" title="Solomon">Solomon</a> conquered so much land. Muslims believe that this responsibility of spreading the religion was now unto Ishmaelites, rather than Israelites. Once people, deny Messengers, there is no otherway to deal with them unless they are killed. Examples from <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> are numerous, like Nation of <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a>, Nation of <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lot.html" title="Lot">Lot</a> and finally Jewish miseries after denial of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. The most official document for Muslims is Quran itself, which says, <i>recall that Abraham was put to the test by his Lord, through certain commands, and he fulfilled them. (God) said, "I am appointing you a leader for the people." He said, "and also my descendants?" He said, "my covenant does not include the transgressors"</i> (2:124), <i>you shall strive for the cause of GOD as you should strive for His cause. He has chosen you and has placed no hardship on you in practicing your religion - the religion of your father Abraham</i> (22:78), <i>We thus made you an impartial community, that you may serve as witnesses among the people, and the messenger serves as a witness among you</i> (2:143), and numerous others. When people challenge the Messenger (by not obeying) and hence challenge the authority of God, they are punished by a natural disaster or by the followers of the Messenger. But the general principle in Islam still follows, as written in Quran, <i>... that whoever took a life, unless it be for murder or for spreading disorder on earth, it would be as if he killed all mankind; and whoever saved a life, it would be as if he saved all mankind</i> (5:32) and <i>And he who kills a believer intentionally, his reward is Hell; he shall remain therein forever...</i> (4:93). The punishment for taking an innocent life is eternal hell, this can be read at numerous places in Quran. So the killing of Jews and others was a special case and is no more applicable. A very good article to understand this point of view is <a href="http://www.renaissance.com.pk/mar_d2y2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.renaissance.com.pk/mar_d2y2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.renaissance.com.pk/mar_d2y2.html</a> and <a href="http://www.renaissance.com.pk/mapred97.html" class="external free" title="http://www.renaissance.com.pk/mapred97.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.renaissance.com.pk/mapred97.html</a> . Here I would suggest again, what Muslims believe, may not be fact to others, but should be present on the page as their opinion. A novice reader has the right to know the story from both sides.

<dd>Hogwash. I make no such general claim, but the cited source -- which is published by an organization that calls itself "Jewish," no matter how much others' use of the term to describe the book disgusts you -- is clearly biased against the early Muslims if it indeed supports any of the 14+ problematic claims I identified above. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 10:10, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Take this example: "Muhammad felt himself strong enough to finally move against the Jews of Medina." That is opposed to the statement about the escallating conflict after the stripped Muslim woman in the murdered Jewish jewler's store. If there were any actual historical documentation for how Muhammad "felt," then that would be what the source said, and it would read somthing like, "Muhammad's friend Joe wrote that Muhammad felt strong enough to finally move against the Jews;" and not the naked ascribed emotion which appeared in the version you've been reverting to. The story about the stripped woman, on the other hand, appears in several academic sources. Even if a Muslim historian wrote peer-reviewed articles claiming that Muhammad "felt" one way or another instead of stating the historical facts from which he drew such a conclusion, it would be inferrior to the stripped woman story. History just doesn't work that way -- saying someone "felt" some way without saying why is not historical scholarship, it is biased conjecture. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 10:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would agree with Publicaola that the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America_f3cb.html" title="Jewish Publication Society of America">Jewish Publication Society of America</a> is not exactly the best publisher... not because it's Jewish but because they don't have any claim to publishing Academic sources about Islam. It isn't a scholarly press, it is a press created to preserve Jewish heritage in the "New World". That's not to say that they can't publish something worthwhile... but their process doesn't mandate that the book is a credible sources as say a peer reviewed journal should. Kazi Publications is not a credible press for representing Judaism without some outside verification of the work (not that it is necessarily sound for representing Islam in an academic manner, either). That isn't to say the source shouldn't be used... but, this does go beyond the author's ethnicity and to the quality standards of the press. The question is... is it a reprint edition of something previously published by a scholarly press? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 10:42, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have always believed that every man's work is challengeable, because he is a human. So what makes authors of some sources unchallengeable.

<dd>Well, no one certainly has a claim to "truth"; that's the basis of Wikipedia.

<p>I have <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-06-19_Banu_Nadir_ffe3.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-06-19 Banu Nadir">requested mediation</a> for this disputed article and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qaynuqa_294f.html" title="Banu Qaynuqa">Banu Qaynuqa</a>. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 16:03, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since the section these came from is getting way too long, and because it might help with mediation, I am listing these points as questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro:
<ul>
<li><s>Should the intro say Muhammad expelled Banu Nadir "Shortly" after his arrival when in fact it took three years?</s> -- this was resolved.</li>
<li>(A - ExLibrisCupertino's (ELC) points numbered 4, 7, 8 below) Should the intro suggest that the eviction was unilateral, without mentioning the war with the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qaynuqa_294f.html" title="Banu Qaynuqa">Banu Qaynuqa</a>?</li>
<li>(B - ELC points 11 and 12) Should the intro suggest that slaughter was unilateral, without mentioning the Jews' assistance to the attacking Meccans?</li>
<li>(C - <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) Should the intro refer to "widow of the tribe's slain treasurer" -- without a source or being a summary of anything in the following article -- as opposed to "captured Jewish woman"?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Background:
<ul>
<li>(D - <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) Should the article refer to the beliefs of "academic historians" without any source for the claim contradicting the previous sourced statement?</li>
<li>(E - needs source) Should that contradiction of the previous sourced statement include a {{citation needed}} tag?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arrival of Muhammad:
<ul>
<li>(F - ELC points 2 and 3) Should the article claim that the Constitution was "promulgated," implying by definition that it was imposed without consent?</li>
<li>(G - ELC points 4 and 5) Should the article state that the Jews' "status was conditional upon their not 'acting wrongfully', a qualification which provided Muhammad with a <i>convenient pretext</i> for nullifying his obligations toward Jews at a later time." (emphasis added)?
<ul>
<li>(H - ELC point 4) Should the article omit the basis for the 'acting wrongfully' claim made by the Muslims, i.e., provocation by the Banu Nadir's chief in the form of heroic songs about the agreed-upon mutual enemy Meccans and erotic poetry about Muslim women?</li>
<li>(I - ELC points 4 and 5) Should the article state anything about what was or was not a "convenient pretext" -- which amounts to subjective conjecture, both unsupported and unencyclopedic?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(J - ELC point 3) Should the article mention the equal rights provided by the constitution before it fell apart?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expulsion of the Banu Qaynuqa from Medina:
<ul>
<li>(K - ELC points 4 and 5) Should the article state the subjective and unknowable mental state claim that "Muhammad felt himself strong enough to finally move against the Jews of Medina," while ignoring the well-documented source of the conflict from Islamic scholars, that the issues started with a fight over a naked woman?</li>
<li>(L - ELC points 6 and 7) Are the sources of that story, about escalation from the stripped Muslim woman in the jewish jewler's shop, reliable secondary sources in accordance with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>?</li>
<li>(M - ELC point 7) Should the subjective mental state claim that "The Banu Nadir ... failed to grasp Muhammad's intentions at that time" be included in the article?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf:
<ul>
<li>(N - ELC point 8) Should the statements supported by Islamic academic scholars representing the Islamic viewpoint of the legality of the killing be included?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expulsion of the Banu Nadir from Medina:
<ul>
<li>(O - already addressed for intro) Should the phrase "Shortly after" to refer to three years be corrected as it was in the intro?</li>
<li><i>there are several other problems with the text of this section, which I will complete once mediation is underway.</i> <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 22:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Are you saying that calling someone "Jewish" is a smear? How about referring to a source as "Muslim" or "Islamic" as I have done just as much? Is that a smear? Of course not. However, in the interest of successful mediation I will refer henceforth to "Muslim" and "non-Muslim" as that seems to be the only way to make you happy. The questions are legitimate, and I don't think there's any mystery why everyone else is avoiding them. There is no evidence that Stillman actually supports the several biased descriptions of unknowable mindset of the historical actors. Furthermore, as has been pointed out above, his publisher, the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America_f3cb.html" title="Jewish Publication Society of America">Jewish Publication Society of America</a> makes no claim to be a scholarly press, describing itself as "created to preserve Jewish heritage in the New World" -- which clearly indicates a pro-Jewish (or, excuse me, non-Muslim) bias.</dd>
<dd>You have utterly failed to impeach the Islamic sources I have presented, but you continue accusing me of racism, based only on my use of the word "Jewish" as an adjective. Calling Stillman a "Jewish source" is not a racial smear in any way, shape, or form. <b>I would like to remind you to please refrain from making personal attacks.</b> <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 23:23, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geo asked me for review. Frankly, I don't know what else to do other than to repeat myself ...by answering repeated attempts to detract Stillman as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> because of his Jewishness and those of his publisher. This merits no answer. As for the "Islamic sources" whose "impeachment failed", I say again that none of the websites cited (hizb-ut-tahrir.org, witness-pioneer.org, bismikaallahuma.org) qualify as secondary sources, much less are they fit to counter scholarly works. And again, I state that the detraction of Stillman for being inherently biased due to his forefathers doesn't warrant reaction, much less countering by "Muslim" sources, whose only merit is their religious affiliation. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 19:29, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>Concerning the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Medina_75b9.html" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a>, the word "promulgation" does appear, but there is no indication that the Jews did not agree to it as the mutual-defense pact was beneficial to them, and "The document confirmed the Jews as members of the Medinese community with certain rights and responsibilities." (p. 11)
<dl>
<dd>[relates to questions (F) and (J)]</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The description of what would happen if the Jews acted "wrongfully" under the agreement is, "The vagueness of this qualification was to provide Muhammad with a legal avenue for changing [the Jews] status at a later date," saying nothing about intent or what anyone thought or felt. (p. 11)
<dl>

</dl>
</li>
<li>The description of Muhammad's motivation after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Badr_04cf.html" title="Battle of Badr">Battle of Badr</a> is "[Muhammad] now had the power and the prestige to begin moving against his enemies in Medina," again saying nothing about what he "felt," and the enemies in question were "pagan poets" who had "written satirical verses about him." (p. 13)
<dl>
<dd>[relates to questions (G), (I) and (K)]</dd>

</li>
<li>Stillman makes no mention of all of what started the conflict between the Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa, and nothing he writes about it is inconsistent with the story presented by the Muslim sources. (p. 11-21)

<li>"No historian has failed to notice the fact that the other two Jewish tribes did not come to the aid of their brethren. Clearly, the Jews did not grasp the nature of the conflict.

<dl>
<dd>[relates to questions (A), (L), and (M)]</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"[Kab b. al-Asraf] had written verses satirizing Islam and insulting Muslim womanhood. Retaliation for such a slight was perfectly consistent with the heroic norms of Arab society in that period." (p. 13)

<li>There is no mention that the Jews "feared for their life" after al-Asraf's killing.
<dl>
<dd>[<b>Not Applicable</b> -- that claim is sourced to p. 127 of Stillman's translation of Ibn Hisham]</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Stillman <i>does</i> say that Muhammad attacked the Nadir because "he needed a victory to regain his lost prestige," citing Ibn Hisham, <i>Sira</i>, vol. 1, p. 559, Eng trans., p. 263. (p. 13-14)

<p>In light of this new information, I would like to retract what I have said about Non-Muslim sources in general and Stillman in particular (reminding everyone that I made it repeatedly clear that I was only complaining about Stillman <i>if his work actually supported the statements attributed to him.</i>) Since it now seems very clear that Stillman's book does not support any but a few of the potential bias problems which I identified, I would like to re-direct my criticism to whoever introduced the identified and confirmed bias in this article in Stillman's name.

Clearly, <i>the Jews did not grasp the nature of the conflict.</i> It probably seemed to them to be a tribal of political affair of the traditional Arabian kind with which they were familiar....

He makes the same point on page 9, see quote above. Pecher <sup><a href="../../../p/e/c/User_talk%7EPecher_4b24.html" title="User talk:Pecher">Talk</a></sup> 08:29, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only quote from page 9 I can find here or on either of the articles is the one about seventy-five conversions upon arrival, and nothing about motivations. Do you have a copy of Stillman's book handy? (By the way, were those conversion Jews, Arabs, or both?) Which quote are you talking about?</dd>
<dd>How do you know that Stillman means Muhammad's <i>intentions</i> when he talks about the nature of the conflict? How do you know that he doesn't mean that, before the Constitution, "it was clear to all that eventually the Jews would have to go," but the two sides <i>did</i> reach an agreement, signing a mutual defense pact that gave them both the right to practice their different religions, which was stable for years. And, after a war which arose from escalating retalliations, how do you know that the remaining Jewish tribes were complacent because they failed to grasp the <i>intentions</i> when the problem was that the Nadir's leader was writing all sorts of offensive poetry? Can't we just as reasonably say that Muhammad failed to grasp the <i>intentions</i> of the Nadir Chief in wrecking the constitutional stability with erotic poetry about Muslim women and tributary odes to Muhammad's slain Meccan enemies? Unless there is extant historical documentation, we have no way to know what the mental states of these actors were. The words "failed to grasp" appear in Stillman's page 13, and your statements citing his page 13. The difference is that the remainder of Stillman's predicate encompasses <b>the mental state of all the actors in the conflict</b> by refering to its very general "nature," while the remainder of your predicate refers to <b>the mental state of just one actor, Muhammad.</b> That is a stark difference, and it casts Muhammed in a bad light while ignoring the source-supported problems with the naked woman in the jewelry shop, so it is biased, and it needs to be fixed in the article. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 09:43, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm at a loss to which piece of original research and flawed logic I should respond first; let's deal with them in the order of appearance. Yes, it was clear from the start that the Jews would have to go, and Stillman praises the Constitution of Medina as an evidence of Muhammad's political skills, a great piece of claire-obsucre, which gave Muhammad pretexts to nullify his obligations under it whenever he saw fit. This is why the pact was stable for some time until Muhammad found it expedient to violate it, finding a suitable pretext, of course. Thus, this was not war arising from escalating retaliations — I have no idea where you got this nonsense from &amp;mdash but an attack by Muhammad launched at a suitable moment. The problem was not Nadir's leader and his poetry; if it had been so, things would have stopped after his assasination. Muhammad didn't fail to grasp anyone's intentions; Ka'b wrote peotry against Muhammad, who killed Ka'b for that, so where's a failure to grasp something? This is part of the job of historians to seek causes and consequences and make inferences from the documents. It is silly to try to infer that Jews failed to grasp their own mental state: the events described did not occur in a funny house. Finally, when you want to make a point, keep it succinct; I have better uses of time than responding to page-long filibusters.

<li><i>it was clear from the start that the Jews would have to go</i> - stillman allegedly says that it was clear to <u>all</u>, not just clear to muhammad and his followers. this can be interpreted in a number of ways and perhaps a sign of the incompatibility between the two groups. it cannot be used as evidence to speculate on muhammad's intentions.</li>
<li><i>which gave Muhammad pretexts to nullify his obligations under it whenever he saw fit</i> ­- this is different to stillman's statement that a certain clause would be cited by muhammad later on in opposition to the jews- he does not state whether it was always muhammad's intention (to at some point cite this) or his genuine reaction to latter events. you are inferring that it was always his intention to cite this clause to nullify the pact, when convenient, which is not found in the text of stillman unless you can unequivocally display otherwise. much of what you are saying above is <i>your</i> interpretation of events. the least that can be said is that the statement attributed to stillman on this talk page is far more objective than what has been attributed to him in the article.</li>
<li><i>this was not war arising from escalating retaliations</i> ­- i have already stated above what many of the historians (and indeed the great authorities on seerah) cite with relation to banu qaynuqa and the specific incident. you are again employing <i>your own interpretation of events</i> in contradiction to established authorities (re: convenient pretext. intentions etc.), and seemingly not in conformity with what stillman has opined.</li>
<li>stillman claims that banu nadir <i>did not grasp the nature of the conflict</i> - there is no speculation on muhammad's intention, which is alluded to time and again in the article <u>so that there is no doubt with the reader as to what exactly this "intention" is</u>. however, such an intention has not been alluded to by stillman himself and again this statement of stillman is far more objective than what has been attributed to him in the article</li>
<li><i>This is part of the job of historians to seek causes and consequences and make inferences from the documents.</i> - i am sure that you will therefore have no disagreement with accepting the the suitability of the relevant evidences cited by historians as i have detailed above in my proposal(s), to which you dismissed as ex-post facto justifications, according to certain academic sources which you have not yet named nor cited (please do so). <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 12:54, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Regarding this <i>ad nauseam</i> repeition of the Jewish goldsmith/Muslim woman episode, see Stillman and the article on the Banu Qaynuqa in the Encyclopaedia of Islam. Academic historians do not accept this and other similar episodes as valid justifications for the attack on the Banu Qaynuqa, period. Regarding other points, I've already responded to them, and I have no intention to repeat my arguments any further. In the title of the section people have proposed an exposition of a gross misrepresentation of Stillman; what we have instead is sophistical hairsplitting, and even this hairsplitting is entirely without merit.

<dd>what i feel you are omitting is the fact that stillman and encyclopaedia of islam are not the final authority on the matter. i have already cited ibn hisham and others who make mention of the goldsmith episode, and you know well that i have already stated that such episodes should be mentioned <i>but not in direct justification</i> of the attack, <u>because i have already cited the exact episode</u> used by the notable historians (re: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Banu_Nadir#Expulsion_of_Banu_Qaynuqa" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Banu_Nadir#Expulsion_of_Banu_Qaynuqa" rel="nofollow">marketplace exchange</a>-ibn hisham, waqidee and others - and your critique for that is welcome) to justify the attack on qaynuqa. the incidents opinion merits mention and even moreso as it is a widely accepted claim. to claim that "academic historians do not accept this and others like it" -which in itself is a sweeping statement- is not relevant (let alone accurate if you are speaking definitively), as the substantial positions and opinions held by the authorities on this matter should be mentioned especially as they are common- and i do not see why anyone is even contesting that. EoI stating something does not make it fact, especially when the secondary sources it refers to are in conflict with them on that.</dd>

<dd>Moving on, from (M) to (A) -- I will try to go in order from now on:
<ul>
<li>Stillman writes several passages about the war between the Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa, and the taunting poetry of the Nadir's leader, and how it led to the expulsion of the Banu Nadir.</li>
<li>Your intro text says that Muhammad evicted the Banu Nadir without explaining that there had been a war and that the Nadir's chief had been inciting the Muslims.</li>

<dd>The article is about the Banu Nadir, not the Banu Qaynuqa; the breif section about the expulsion of the latter serves only to give some historical context and to draw attention to the Nadir's failure to act. The expulsion of the Banu Nadir had nothing to do with Ka'b's poetry, not a single source that I'm aware of say that the latter caused the former.

<dd>Just checked with the book: all Stillman says is that Huyayy ibn Akhtab served as a emissary between those who besieged Medina and Banu Qurayza. So, it was User:ExLibrisCupertino who badly misrepresented Stillman. The article mentions that Huyayy with his son participated in the Battle of the Trench on the Meccan side, so no problem here with the article. This is not Huyayy ibn Akhtab's biography, and there is no need to dwell at lengths about all the details. If someone feels that adding more details with Huyayy's cooperation with Muhammad's adversaries is a damning piece of evidence that was concealed, then wrong this person is. Warfare is warfare and cooperating with the enemies of a person who expelled you from your home is in no way "damning", so there is nothing to "conceal".

It might not be "damning" but keeping it from readers makes it appear that the slaughter of the Nadir was done without provocation, which is terribly biased. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 17:31, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonsense. The article says that Huyayy ibn Akhtab joined the Meccans during the Battle of the Trench; extraneous details do not belong here.

<dd>If everybody here can agree that Bernard Lewis is an authoritative historical writer (which I think should be easily agreeable), then it follows that any mention (or implication) of the Banu Nadir being massacred must be removed (or at least disputed), because (A) it is simply not hitorical fact &amp; (B) even if there was any massacre at all, it did not involve Banu Nadir and should therefore be removed from this article.

<p>Actually that's not necessarily true. WP:RS&#160;: <i>In general, Wikipedia articles should not depend on primary sources but rather on reliable secondary sources who have made careful use of the primary-source material. Most primary-source material requires training to use correctly, especially on historical topics. Wikipedia articles may use primary sources only if they have been published by a reliable publisher e.g. trial transcripts published by a court stenographer, or historic documents that appear in edited collections.</i></p>
<p>The volumes of Hadith are published. Nothing in WP:RS characterizes the use of such primary sources as being "Original Research", so you're misinforming people with this statement. Additionally the original traditions themselves, reported by the many many sources cited in Sahih Al Bukhari would have been primary sources UNTIL they were compiled by Imam Bukhari and made into volumes.

<p>Scholars make conclusions as to policy and traditions based on the Hadith, not what the Hadith stated to have happened. For example, whether or not it's haraam to engage in a certain practice or deal with a person a certain way. Since we're not formulating policy based on the Hadith, but merely documenting events, for our purposes "Sahih al Bukhari" and "Sahih Al Muslim" are secondary sources. This is beyond the point that WP:RS does in fact allow the use of primary sources if they have been published. You still haven't addressed the issue of how quoting a primary source constitutes OR. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 21:34, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You've misrepresented my comment. I didn't say quoting is OR; quoting is alright if you're illustrating something from a secondary source. The hadith are primary sources because they are historical documents based on which historians make their conclusions. These conclusions are then published in books or articles, which are secondary sources citable on Wikipedia.

<p>Pecher, I'm somewhat confused by your intransigence with regards to edits on this article. Do you honestly believe that this article as it stands is unbiased and neutral? Or do you believe there may be some bias, but you're unwilling to change it without reference to reliable sources?</p>
<p>From a personal standpoint, speaking as a Muslim, I don't care whether source material comes from a Christian, a Hindu, a Jewish, an atheist, or a Muslim source, my only interest is in accuracy. I belive the article currently underplays the importance of the Banu Nadir's alliance with the Quraish at the Battle of the Trench as a precursor to the massacre and seems to ascribe devious motives to Muhammad (notably the "convenient pretext" line).</p>

<dd>Actually "multiple points of view" is a clever phrase which does not deviate at all from NPOV, but rather explains it. Pecher would have you believe one is not the other; that they are competing 'policies'. Nothing could be further from the truth. Voicing different viewpoints without having the article endorse a single view is the very essence of what NPOV is. From the text of WP:NPOV: "Texts that present multiple viewpoints fairly, without demanding that the reader accept any one of them, are liberating. Neutrality subverts dogmatism, and nearly everyone working on Wikipedia can agree this is a good thing." Indeed, a text that fails to represent multiple points of views, when multiple views exist, is not "N" at all. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 17:23, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Publicola wrote on their userpage: "I have drafted several versions of my "MPOV" (M=multiple) proposal for bias controversies..." It's difficult to say what these policy proposals are all about, but the point is that MPOV is not NPOV, but an alternative to it. It appears to be just another attempt to amend NPOV so as to give equal validity to science and pseudoscience; such attempts are made regularly, usually once in several weeks. This is why the "MPOV" version has blatant bias as the one above or is littered with original research (notice the multitute of claims that are wither unsourced or usourced to murky sources). In a nutshell, that's truly "mpov": all views, including original research, are presented, even if not necessarily fairly. Add here some poor writing (the words "Jews" and "Muslims" are usually spelt from the lowercase letter in freshly added passages) and you get what we have now.

<dd>Tony, yes: you protected the wrong version indeed. Arguably, WP should be grateful for the proposition of new policies, like MPOV<sup>™&#160;Publicola</sup>, and it is laudable that the present version isn't "<i>pushing a Jewish POV</i>", as Publicola claims to happen, when academics of Jewish descend are referred to for want of better contemporary sources. And yes, his version adds the "<i>Muslim point of view</i>" he claims to be needed wherever non-Muslim, or worse, Jewish historians speak. But let's agree that new WP policies need to be introduced by a suitable WP panel, before articles molded in that form are written by wholesale revert without consenus. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 18:56, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tony protected the right one- the version that was present was condemned by most of the users here and reflected a POV-driven version full of Pecher's now-famous misrepresentation of sources. If Publicola sees a difference between having multiple point of views and a neutral one, he's mistaken. WP:NPOV makes it quite clear that in order to be neutral, different perspectives need to be reflected. The article isn't so much dominated by a "Jewish POV" as it is by a right wing neoconservative-inspired pro-zionist POV. Publicola makes some legitimate observations regarding sources, it is certainly unfair (and a violation of WP:AGF and WP:NPA) to make charges against him because of his observations. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 21:40, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Wikipedia's NPOV policy often means multiple points of view. This means providing not only the points of view of different groups today, but different groups in the past.... Adherents of a religion may object to a critical historical treatment of their own faith. They would prefer that the articles describe their faith according to their tradition and understanding, which often differs substantially from the view commonly held by critical historians. Non adherents of a religion may feel the exact opposite, and prefer that the views of critical historians be given primacy; many articles on Wikipedia currently reflect the latter point of view. <b>NPOV policy demands both points of view be presented without prejudice.</b></i> --<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Judaism_0444.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Judaism">WikiProject Judaism</a></dd>

<p>i would agree that certain statements may seem problematic unless sourced. i would appeal to the opposing party to amiably participate in mediation instead of edit wars (as also seen on <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qaynuqa_294f.html" title="Banu Qaynuqa">Banu Qaynuqa</a>) as this seems to be the only way to achieve a consensus article and consequently lay the issue down to rest. in this way we can work with eachother instead of against.</p>
<p>regarding "MPOV", then part of it is already catered for by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in that all significant views merit mention without giving undue weight as long as they qualify under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and when we state analysis that may be disputed then we say that "X says/claims/documents/opines.." instead of expressing X's words as fact. i have not yet properly studied what "MPOV" entails, but any participation in mediation would naturally not include involvement of such a policy. the article under the "mpov" dir is not being edited with MPOV policy in mind (well at least not in my case) in that wikipedians do not have to follow a non-wiki policy in order to edit, and so nothing stops editors from making edits in accordance with the existing wiki policies. furthermore, anything within the article conforming to what is perceived as "MPOV" but in contradiction with current wiki policy (although MPOV on the face of it seems to just be a re-expression of WP:NPOV in order to achieve the same goal of attaining neutrality without contravention of currently existing WP policy) would not be able to defend itself against removal, were we to engage in the mediation process. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:22, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The above quote has to be edited since it dose not describe muhamed correctly even according to his own followers:</p>
<p>Asma said: “You obey a stranger who encourages you to murder for booty. You are greedy men, is there no honor among you?”Upon hearing those lines Mohammad said, “Will no one rid me of this woman?” Umayr, a zealous muslim, decided to execute the prophet’s wishes. That very night he crept into the writer’s home while she lay sleeping surrounded by her young children. There was one at her breast. Umayr removed the suckling babe and then plunged his sword into the poet. The next morning in the mosque, Mohammad, who was aware of the assassination, said, “You have helped Allah and his apostle” . Umayr said, “She had five sons, should I feel guilty?” “No, “ the prophet answered, “killing her was as meaningless as two goats butting heads.”</p>
<p>Ishaq 676</p>
<p>The prophet gave orders concerning Kinanah to Zubayr, saying torture him until you root out and extract what he has. So Zubayr kindled a fireon Kinanah’s chest, twirling it with his firestick until Kinahah was near death. Then the messenger gave him to Maslamah, who beheaded him.</p>

<dd>why not? it's a usable resource. or have you forgotten the previous discussions we've had which establish its usability? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 05:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a work of history, and it's not the work of a historian. It's a glorification of Muhammad by a product of a university which appears to be a glorified seminary. Ibn Hashim is not used as a primary source because it is the consensus of modern historians that Ibn Hashim's work contains fabrications and post-facto rationalizations. Considering that he is the primary source for the constitution, we should well consider the voices of the historians who write that the date and development of the constitution are not known, and are probably different from Ibn Hashim's account. It is for these reasons that I'm changing the tag. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 21:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
