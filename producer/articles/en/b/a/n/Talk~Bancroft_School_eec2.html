<p>Just another not-notable school. Seriously, it's not funny any more. No one cares about anyone else's school. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague Rant</a> 04:32, Nov 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seriously, it <i>is</i> funny. Don't lose your perspective on this. The biggest problem with the schools business is that people are getting intense about it. <i>It doesn't matter that much.</i> Everybody, just keep calling 'em as you see 'em, list them in VfD if you think they should be deleted, put in your votes in VfD, give short reasons, try gently to influence others. But don't anybody kid yourselves. A thousand stubs about non-notable schools <i>simply doesn't matter much</i> one way or the other. a) Deleting them all is not going to alienate valuable contributors. b) Deleting them is not a heroic act that is preventing a breach in a dyke that is holding back the North Sea. c) Including them is not going to induce rich alumni to donate to Wikimedia. d) Including them is not going to lower peoples' opinion of Wikipedia enough to matter. Almost nobody reads these articles. They just don't matter much. The only people who care about them are the people who contribute them and the people who argue about them in VfD. If you're spending too much time in VfD dealing with schools, go off and do something else. All be the same in a hundred years.

<li>This is one of the more prestigious preps, so the topic is possible, but the article is not. I'm not sure that merely being prestigious is enough, either. That it has high academic standing is excellent as a <i>selling point,</i> but not actually notable by itself. Therefore, even though it would be possible to write an <i>interesting</i> article about the school, it is not probably possible to make the school stand out from other exclusive prep schools, and we don't need to be Peterson's Guide, so delete. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 05:04, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

This really is a rather famous school, and I'd expect that there could be a good article on it. Given, however, that it's just a stub, we might as well merge it into Worcester, let it incubate; it can always spin out as an article in its own right later. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:29, Nov 6, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I don't see the harm. Most people won't even look at school pages, and it's not as if space is an issue. I do see two benefits: (1) as a high school page grows, presumably notable alumni will be listed, which will lead to more information in the articles about those people, or new articles. (I'm the primary contributor to the <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amherst_College_b06a.html" title="Amherst College">Amherst College</a> page, and red links do occasionally inspire to me to write a stub where I have enough information.) (2) as current students (and, to a lesser extent, alumni) of a school discover "their" page on Wikipedia, they will grasp in a way that they probably now don't, that we're looking for contributions from them. So, they add something to the page about their high school; then maybe they add something useful to a page about something else. -<a href="../../../r/j/y/User%7ERjyanco_ecd0.html" title="User:Rjyanco">Rjyanco</a> 19:32, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, to my way of thinking that's an argument for a redirect, not for a keep. If people are interested in Bancroft School and it redirects to <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester%2C_Massachusetts_6e3a.html" title="Worcester, Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a>, they'll find it and if they want to add information they can add it there. The school description can be broken out into a separate article <i>when it merits one.</i> One of my <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_BEEFSTEW_8c5d.html" title="User:Dpbsmith/BEEFSTEW">User:Dpbsmith/BEEFSTEW</a> criteria is "I) Would an alumnus of the school, reading the article, be pleased at how knowledgeable the article was?" I do not think for a minute that alums are going to get a warm fuzzy from reading "The Bancroft School of Worcester, Massachusetts, founded in 1901 is a K through 12 private school. It is located on Shore Drive, across the road from Indian Lake." It doesn't get that BEEFSTEW point. In fact I give it 0 points out of 10.

<ul>
<li>I don't disagree that the quality of the article was low. But it wasn't given any chance: half an hour after the article was posted, there was a VfD. If any alumnus comes by the page and <i>doesn't</i> feel warm and fuzzy, aren't the odds that they'll try to do something about it, particularly if a rival school has a better page? (See <a href="http://www.ephblog.com/archives/000822.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ephblog.com/archives/000822.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.) If it sat for a month in that state, maybe a VfD would be called for; but this VfD has nothing to about article quality (should <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre_College_c619.html" title="Centre College">Centre College</a> get a VfD?) and everything to do with what should or should not be in Wikipedia. And I don't necessarily think that prep schools <i>shouldn't</i> be. -<a href="../../../r/j/y/User%7ERjyanco_ecd0.html" title="User:Rjyanco">Rjyanco</a> 01:12, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
