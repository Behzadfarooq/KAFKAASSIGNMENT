<h2><span class="mw-headline">Prakash's Suggestions to improve the current Bangalore site</span></h2>
<p>Hi! I have the following suggestions. Please take them as constructive criticism from someone who loves Bangalore.</p>
<p>I have compared the current Bangalore site to the Wikipedia site about <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> so that we can take the better points from the latter and incorporate it into our cities site.</p>
<p>a) The formatting of the Bangalore page is terrible. Everything is lumped together and is incoherent. We need to re-aarange the contentso that it falls into proper place. If you see the London site, you will notice that after every 4 - 5 lines the para ends and a new one begins. In our case it is just the opposite.</p>
<p>b) I tried to rearrange the content recently. I did not delete anything but tried to add headlines. Some zealous administrator reversed what I had done and told me that the format that I had used went against Wikipedia's policy. This is why I am comparing the Bangalore layout to that of London. I ask everyone.............let's have an open mind so that we get a great format in for our great city.</p>
<p>c) There is a lot that is missing. For example, I was astounded to find that <a href="../../../d/a/l/Daly_Memorial_Hall_3fd7.html" title="Daly Memorial Hall">Daly Memorial Hall</a> was not featured at all! It is a landmark building with a great history. Luckily I had taken a recent pic which had come out well, and a bit of research led to the creation of the page. Can we create a list of landmark buildings and incorporate them into the site?</p>
<p>d) I would like to devote some time every day to the upgrading of this site. Maybe we can start with a list of things that need to be added. My forte is phtographs and I shall be happy to contribute whatever imagery is needed.</p>
<p>My email ID is prksh1@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from like minded people and set about rearranging the website.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Prakash</p>
<dl>
<dd>The formatting is per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Indian_cities_3cb2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Indian cities">Wikipedia:WikiProject Indian cities</a> and the guidelines linked to from <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a>, which the London article doesn't follow. And Bangalore is a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured article</a>, while the London article is not even close. Also, much of the discussion happens on the talk page. But of course, feel free to add/edit in areas, you feel this article is missing. --<small><a href="../../../p/a/m/User%7EPamri_2da3.html" title="User:Pamri">Pamri</a> • <a href="../../../p/a/m/User_talk%7EPamri_1a9f.html" title="User talk:Pamri">Talk</a></small> 00:10, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestions to improve Bangalore Web site</span></h2>
<p>1.Helps to move Tourism in and around Bangalore to a more prominant location then at the very bottom. 2.Picture says a thousand words.</p>
<pre>
 a)Lets get a ISCKON temple photo in. The current one is also
   good (colorfull) but lacks the impact.
 b) In the "Karnataka" page, I have given relevant details and organised Kannada Empires. 
    we can do with One picture from each empire. Ie; Pattadakal for Badami chalukya, 
    Ellora from Rashtrakuta etc. a photo of Keladi Nayaka
    and Rani Chennamma should not be hard to find.(links help but people dont always have time for it)

</pre>
<p>3.Every place of tourist interest in and arounf Bangalore should have a photo attached to it. I saw some great pictures on this web site <a href="http://www.virtualbangalore.com/Tou/InBlr.php#" class="external free" title="http://www.virtualbangalore.com/Tou/InBlr.php#" rel="nofollow">http://www.virtualbangalore.com/Tou/InBlr.php#</a>. Not sure if we can use them.</p>
<p>4.Need to find out what percentage of Bangaloreans can speak Kannada. I know for sure that a large population of Immigrants from South India can speak Kannada while very few Locals can speak the languages brought in by Immigrants fluently(telugu/Tamil). We need to establish that though Bangalore is a very cosmopolitian city, Kannada is the most dominant language in usage there.</p>
<p>5. Lets move away from Pot holes/policemen and so on. This problem exists in every city in India not just in Bengaluru. People take pleasure is trashing Bangalore because majority of them there are not "Ethnic Kannadigas".</p>
<p>6. Can someone find out the exact kannada speaking population worldwide instead of quoting a 1998 number and put it into the WIKI page for "Kannada". 7. I created a page for "Karnataka Literature" and have worked hard to put together names, works of famous Kannada/Sanskrit scholars from 4th century AD. Feel free to add to this. 8. The WIKI page "travel guide to Bangalore" looks like a big dump site. We need to organise this page. we need to seperate out temples, hotels, pubs etc. They should be seperate pages.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Places of interest near Bangalore</span></h2>
<p>It is shamefull to see such little put up on the Bangalore web page. There is no shortage of beautiful places to visit around Bangalore. Instead of "trashing" Bangalore and showing mud puddles, autorikshaws and pot bellied policemen, please take time to put some nice photographs and add to the section I have created. Look at the web pages for Hyderabad and Chennai. None of their residents talk of the filth in Hyderabad or the open drainages in Chennai. I am not suggesting that the local problems in Banglaore should go unresolved, but all I am saying is that we need to learn to market ourselves better and solve internal problems internally.</p>

<dd>I agree with the points put forth by Sundar. In addition, there are some minor nitpicks:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>As far as possible, avoid using <i>See also</i> inside sections. Use either the main article/the see also template.</li>
<li>The <i>Main article/See articles</i> should point to articles, which are directly related to Bangalore. For instance, under Media,the main article points to "Mass media in India", which is misleading.</li>
<li>The 2nd para in the lead could be arranged chronologically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this is done, you have my vote as well. --<small><a href="../../../p/a/m/User%7EPamri_2da3.html" title="User:Pamri">Pamri</a> • <a href="../../../p/a/m/User_talk%7EPamri_1a9f.html" title="User talk:Pamri">Talk</a></small> 08:24, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Sundar, Pamri, thanks for your edits. Now that you mention those points, they seem rather glaringly obvious and I'm not sure how I missed them while I was reading over them myself! Thanks! I will incorporate the remainder of Sundar's, Pamri's and Nichalp's recommendations and pushing it forward to FAC. Thanks! <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 14:58, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I want to know the source of the $59.1 billion GDP figure for Bangalore. Is it PPP-based or nominal GDP? The figure seems too high to be true. India's nominal GDP is $735.6 billion (CIA figures) and it seems impossible that Bangalore's GDP is 59.1 billion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This statistic is from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics from the Govt. of Karnataka. I have used this as a reference document for some of the other facts stated in the article but I should probably directly reference that quote...one more item to my to-do list today. I am sure that is a purchasing power parity (PPP) based value and not nominal GDP. I will reference that in my edits. India's GDP PPP is over US$ 3 trillion, so US$ 59.1 billion appears plausible. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 15:35, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
