<p>Bangaru Tirumala was a member of the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madurai_Nayaks_d898.html" title="Madurai Nayaks">Madurai Royal</a> family and one of the Governor/Commander of the Madurai Country in charge of Madurai and Tirunelveli regions. He was supposed to belong to another royal line of Kumara Muttu Nayak, the younger brother of <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirumalai_Nayak_c681.html" title="Thirumalai Nayak">Thirumalai Nayak</a>.</p>

<p>When Vijaya Ranga Chokkanatha Nayak died in 1731 without an heir, one of his queens Meenakshi adopted Bangaru Thirumala’s son Vijayakumara then a young boy as an heir for the Madurai Throne and became Queen Regent for the adopted prince. During this time <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiruchirapalli.html" title="Tiruchirapalli">Tiruchirapalli</a> Fort was the headquarters of Madurai Kingdom, while Madurai was bifurcated into a Province, still retaining the vast Fort.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangaru_Thirumalai_Nayak_e6f3.html" title="Edit section: Queen Meenakshi">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Queen Meenakshi</span></h3>
<p>When Queen Meenakshi took over the administration, the Kingdom was in deep trouble ,with enemy troops of Delhi Sultans, Mysore armies and Maratha armies attempting to seize the throne. Also pilferage of enemy spies and widespread anarchy prevailed in the kingdom. The palace administrators were rampant on treason and corruption. The queen attempting to bring order, sacked many troublesome officials and commanders, and replaced them with better ones. She was also assisted by her brother Venkata Perumal Nayak and things looked better for a period.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangaru_Thirumalai_Nayak_e6f3.html" title="Edit section: Madurai throne claimants">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Madurai throne claimants</span></h2>
<p>Hardly a year or two passed when Bangaru Tirumala, feeling he to be a better bet to the throne instigated an insurrection against the queen. He was also joined by Queen Meenakshi’s recently ousted <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister.html" title="Minister">Minister</a> “Dalavay Venkatachari”.Their first attempt at ousting the queen by attacking the Tiruchirapalli fort ended in a failure.</p>
<p>Bangaru Tirumala operated from Madurai Fort while the Queen held court from the Tiruchirapalli Fort Palace. During this period the Madurai Kingdom was a feudatory of the Delhi Sultanate whose representative of the south was the <a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawab_of_Carnatic_9fc7.html" title="Nawab of Carnatic">Nawab of Carnatic</a>.The <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizam_of_Hyderabad_24f8.html" title="Nizam of Hyderabad">Nizam of Hyderabad</a> held an intermediate authority.</p>
<p>Bangaru Tirumala approached Safdar Ali Khan, son of the <a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawab_of_the_Carnatic_c805.html" title="Nawab of the Carnatic">Carnatic Nawab</a>, with an offer of three million rupees to oust the queen in favour of him. The latter after accepting the offer, settled the dispute in Bangaru Tirumala’s favour by declaring him as the King. Safdar Ali Khan then left to Arcot without attacking Meenakshi’s fort in Tiruchirapalli and left the matters to his kin and advisor Chanda Sahib to enforce the new events. The wily queen, not paying any attempt at the suspicious settlement, responded by offering Chanda Sahib a crore of rupees (ten million) and to declare her duly entitled to the throne. Startled at the de-tour of affairs Bangaru Tirumala left to Madurai, to rule over that province and <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tirunelveli.html" title="Tirunelveli">Tirunelveli</a>, without wishing any harm to Chanda Sahib.</p>

<p>Bangaru Tirumala‘s withdrawal was only temporary as he collected a good number of discontent army and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygars.html" title="Polygars">Polygars</a> again launched offensive attacks on the Tiruchirapalli Fort. Several battles and attacks continued on either sides, with Bangaru Tirumala finally seizing the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dindigul_Fort_6f71.html" title="Dindigul Fort">Dindigul Fort</a>,a key fort and territory in between the Madurai and Tiruchirapalli. Two years passed (1736), when Chanda Sahib returned to Trichrapalli, combining with Meenakshi, attacked Bangaru Tirumala, who was still ruling the southern provinces of Madurai.In a battle at Ammayanayakkanur near <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dindigul.html" title="Dindigul">Dindigul</a>, Bangaru Thirumala’s army largely strengthened by some Polygars fought a well contested battle against the Queen and Chanda Sahib combine of over 80,000 solders, but was finally defeated, taking refuge in <a href="../../../s/i/v/Sivaganga.html" title="Sivaganga">Sivaganga</a> palace.</p>
<p><br />
Chanda Sahib, after the victory over Bangaru Tirumala, proclaimed himself ruler of Meenakshi’s kingdom, after locking the queen up in her palace, later driving her to consume poison, thus putting an end to over 200 years of Nayaks rule in Madurai.</p>

<p>Bangaru Tirumala still undaunted joined with the Tanjore Marathas to oust Chanda Sahib. Tanjore Kingdom were recently (1740) attacked and subjugated by Chanda Sahib, compelling them to cede <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaikal.html" title="Karaikal">Karaikal</a> to the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a>, who were Chanda Sahib’s new alley. Also Chanda Sahib was left on his own by his Uncle Carnatic Nawab, but still suspicious over the formers ambitions.</p>
<p>Bangaru Tirumala and the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanjore_Nayaks_5024.html" title="Tanjore Nayaks">Tanjore King</a> joined together and called in assistance of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathas.html" title="Marathas">Marathas</a> of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satara.html" title="Satara">Satara</a> in <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>. These people having their own grievances against the Carnatic Nawabs (with whom Chanda Sahib was still identified) marched down with a vast army in the south in 1741, first defeating and killing the Nawab of Arcot in the Battle, later after a three months siege at Trichinopoly fort, took Chanda Sahib as a captive, killing both Chanda Sahib’s brothers. (Finally in1751, Chanda Sahib was captured after a series of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnatic_Wars_6342.html" title="Carnatic Wars">Carnatic Wars</a> and beheaded by a <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanjore.html" title="Tanjore">Tanjore</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">general</a> Mankoji)</p>

<p>The Marathas disregarding the claims of Bangaru Tirumala appointed a Maratha Morari Rao of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Gooty.html" title="Gooty">Gooty</a> (in 1741), as their governor of the conquered kingdom. In 1744, the Nizam of Hyderabad sent an army to re-establish his weakened authority in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnatic.html" title="Carnatic">Carnatic</a> making Morari Rao flee from Madurai. The Nizam appointed Anwar ud din as Nawab of Arcot, and ordered Vangaru Tirumala to be appointed to the Throne of Madurai.The rulers of Ramnad, Sivaganga, Tanjore were also keen on appointing Bangaru Tirumala on the throne thereby to retain a Hindu Kingdom. Thus for a brief period Bangaru Thirumala seemed to take the crown as a de-jure ruler, while the administrative control was carried out by the Muslim army. Bangaru was also repeatedly warned of attempts by Anwar -ud-din and his aides on plans to usurp the Throne. But very little is know afterwards as some sources point out that he was poisoned by Anwar -ud-din.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../n/a/y/Nayaks_of_Kandy_df82.html" title="Nayaks of Kandy">Nayaks of Kandy</a> One section of Bangaru Thirumala’s family established themselves as rulers of Kandy; also the last dynasties to rule Sri Lanka.The are often mentioned as <a href="../../../n/a/y/Nayakkar.html" title="Nayakkar">Nayakkar</a> Dynasty or Madurai Rulers or Nayaks of Kandy.</p>
<p>The Kandy Mahanuwara kingdoms always had brides from the Nayak rulers of Madurai and Tanjore. When the King of Kandy Vira Parakrama Narendra Singha (1707-1739) whose queen was from Madurai Nayak family died in 1739,they crowned the Queens brother from Madurai Nayak family as the next king of Kandy according to their Marumakkathayam law.</p>
<p>The new king (from Madurai), assuming throne as Vijaya Raja Singha, again married a queen Upendramma from Bangaru Thirumala’s family. Later the next two kings in line to the throne would be the queens’ two brothers (both from Madurai) and the last king who ruled from Kandy Sri Vikrama Raja Singha (1798-1815 AD), would be queen Upendramma’s nephew.</p>

<p>In 1820’s, one of a descendant of Bangaru was reported to be in Madurai seeking pecuniary assistance from Government. Also it is reported, every year they conducted a ceremony of reciting poems of their royal forebears of their valour and deeds on the first day of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_calendar.html" title="Tamil calendar">Tamil</a> month of Chittirai.</p>
