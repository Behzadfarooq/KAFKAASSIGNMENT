<p>The attempts of the early <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Church_4da6.html" title="Christian Church">Christian Church</a> at forming some sort of library of holy writing can be found as early as the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_century.html" title="2nd century">2nd century</a> with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcion_of_Sinope_2900.html" title="Marcion of Sinope">Marcion of Sinope</a> (in present day <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>). A wealthy merchant, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcion.html" title="Marcion">Marcion</a> (who latter was known for being the initiator of the Marcionite Heresy) was a Christian. Influenced by <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dualism.html" title="Dualism">dualism</a>, he imagined that the loving <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> talked about was vastly different from the vindictive God of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> scripture. He strongly advocated a Christian canon that excluded all Jewish writings. As such, of the four <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">gospels</a>, he felt that only the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> should be included as the other three made references to Jewish texts. Other early church leaders opposed him and some even called him the Son of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>. Nevertheless, his idea of specific books to be compiled into official church scripture was a beginning point for compiling a holy library (or bible) of Christian writings.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/5/0/150.html" title="150">150</a> A.D., there were hundreds of texts in existence, some of which were in contradiction with each other. By the <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_Century_e5e9.html" title="4th Century">4th Century</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_I_%28emperor%29_5860.html" title="Constantine I (emperor)">Constantine I</a>, in an attempt to re-establish one empire with a unifying religion to back it up, felt that there should be a consensus as to what books should be the basis for this religion. At the time, there were two opposing camps of Christian thought, both centered in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arius.html" title="Arius">Arius</a> felt that Jesus was a supreme human, but no God. Opposing him was <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athanasius.html" title="Athanasius">Athanasius</a>, who felt that Jesus was both man and God. In <a href="../../../3/2/5/325.html" title="325">325</a>, Constantine I convened the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Council_of_Nicaea_a44c.html" title="First Council of Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a> and decreed that only one <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creed.html" title="Creed">creed</a> should emerge from the council. Once settled, the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a> banned Arias and his fellow <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arians.html" title="Arians">Arians</a> as <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heretics.html" title="Heretics">heretics</a> and the need for a common scripture became more pronounced.</p>
<p>Bishop <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius.html" title="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, a scholar of early Christian writings found at <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesarea.html" title="Caesarea">Caesarea</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and attendee of the First Council of Nicaea, published a comprehensive history of the Christian Church. In this history, he also critiqued many books and writings circulating in the Christian communities at the time in an attempt to form some sort common library. The books he reviewed were broken down into three categories: a) accepted (the four gospels, the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Acts_3533.html" title="Book of Acts">Book of Acts</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_epistles.html" title="Pauline epistles">Pauline epistles</a>), b) highly likely (<a href="../../../f/i/r/First_John_0f4d.html" title="First John">First John</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Peter_a093.html" title="First Peter">First Peter</a>), and c) questionable (<a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_John_be8b.html" title="Second John">Second John</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_John_2113.html" title="Third John">Third John</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Peter_7edb.html" title="Second Peter">Second Peter</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_James_7f18.html" title="Gospel of James">Gospel of James</a>, <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_of_Jude_1ffb.html" title="Epistle of Jude">Epistle of Jude</a>, the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Revelations_885a.html" title="Book of Revelations">Book of Revelations</a>, and others) He was all too aware of other church leaders views concerning Revelations with its imagery of war being at variance with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>’s message of love and peace. He finally came down to 18 books that he believed should become official Christian scripture.</p>
<p>6 years after Nicaea (<a href="../../../3/3/1/331.html" title="331">331</a>), Constantine commissioned Eusebius to create an official Christian Bible. 50 copies were made at state expense to be put in churches Constantine had planned to build throughout his capital at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. Eusebius included all 18 books he had referred to in his earlier work. As opposed to Marcion, he felt that the Jewish writings should also be included and lumped them together into the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>. Unfortunately, none of those 50 copies are in existence today. The closest we have are two <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_century.html" title="4th century">4th century</a> codices: <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Vaticanus_f31d.html" title="Codex Vaticanus">Codex Vaticanus</a> (found in the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican.html" title="Vatican">Vatican</a> Library) and <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Sinaiticus_96ac.html" title="Codex Sinaiticus">Codex Sinaiticus</a> (taken from <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Catherine_7e48.html" title="St. Catherine">St. Catherine</a>’s Monastery at Sinai and placed in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>). Both codices differ from what is on Eusebius’s list (ie. Sinaiticus has included the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shepherd_of_Hermas_b23c.html" title="The Shepherd of Hermas">The Shepherd of Hermas</a> and the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_of_Barnabas_35d5.html" title="Epistle of Barnabas">Epistle of Barnabas</a>).</p>
<p>40 years later, a final list of 27 <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> books was <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonized.html" title="Canonized">canonized</a> by the Christian Church. This official list excluded many popular books either because they were written too late or they weren’t felt to have been <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox.html" title="Orthodox">orthodox</a>. The following are some of them.</p>
<p><a name="The_Book_of_Adam_and_Eve" id="The_Book_of_Adam_and_Eve"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Banned_from_the_Bible_ddae.html" title="Edit section: The Book of Adam and Eve">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Adam_and_Eve_f164.html" title="Book of Adam and Eve">Book of Adam and Eve</a></span></h2>
<p>This book is a background story of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> 3 (<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a>). It was left out because it duplicated Genesis and was written at a much later time (<a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_century.html" title="3rd century">3rd</a> or 4th century). In this book, Satan is an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel.html" title="Angel">angel</a> in human form that accompanies the serpent when tempting Eve. Not only that, but Eve is tempted twice in this book. The first is the familiar one found in Genesis. The other takes place much later after the banishment from Eden when Adam feels that the two must do <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penance.html" title="Penance">penance</a> for their <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a> by standing in separate rivers (<a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> for Adam, <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigris.html" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> for Eve) for 40 days. After 18 days, Satan approaches Eve in the deceptive form of a divine angel, tells her she is forgiven, and successfully tempts her for a second time to disobey a command by leaving the river.</p>
<p>The book also alleges that God made all his angels bow down to his greatest creation, Adam. Satan refused to bow to someone who is inferior to him and made later. He rebelled and built an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">altar</a> in <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a> higher than God's. Enraged, God had him banished to <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>.</p>
<p>That last story is also in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>’s holy book, the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a>. In that book, Adam was made of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a> and some mysterious beings called <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genie.html" title="Genie">Jinn</a> were made from smokeless fire. As above, all the angels were ordered by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">God</a> to bow down before Adam, His greatest creation. All the angels obeyed, and all the Jinns except Satan obeyed. Jinns or genies are supposed to have <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_will.html" title="Free will">free will</a> and so they can disobey God.</p>

<p>In Genesis, there’s a question about Adam and Eve having three sons and no daughters. How did humanity flourish under such circumstances? It is also written that after <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain.html" title="Cain">Cain</a> is ostracized, he leaves with a pregnant wife. Where did she come from? The Book of Jubilees (or Little Genesis), which was written <i>c.</i> <a href="../../../1/5/0/150_BC_e995.html" title="150 BC">150 BC</a>, tries to explain. In this book, Adam and Eve have 9 sons and daughters. <a href="../../../a/w/a/Awan.html" title="Awan">Awan</a>, their third child, ends up being Cain’s wife. But this creates a new problem, <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>. Because of that, it’s felt that the Book of Jubilees was probably omitted from official western Christian scripture. But, this particular book was found among the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> and it is also official canon in the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Church_79e2.html" title="Ethiopian Orthodox Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Church</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/n/Banned_from_the_Bible_ddae.html" title="Edit section: Book of Enoch (00:33)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Enoch_2b5d.html" title="Book of Enoch">Book of Enoch</a> (00:33)</span></h2>
<p>This book fleshes out the story of <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoch%2C_ancestor_of_Noah_a434.html" title="Enoch, ancestor of Noah">Enoch, ancestor of Noah</a>, a man who walked with God that gets only one sentence in the Bible (Genesis 5:22). It also elaborates on Genesis 6:2-7 and <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuteronomy.html" title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> 2:20-21 the story of 200 angels mating with the “Daughters of the Earth” to create giants in the land. According to this book, not only did these angels <a href="../../../l/u/s/Lust.html" title="Lust">lust</a> after earthly women, they also taught mankind certain dark arts including that of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_making.html" title="Weapon making">weapon making</a>. Ultimately, the head angel <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azazel.html" title="Azazel">Azazel</a> (or Azael) and all his followers are bound in Hell for their misdeeds.</p>
<p>Azazel approaches Enoch in a <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream.html" title="Dream">dream</a> and pleads that he intercede for him and his followers with God for <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clemency.html" title="Clemency">clemency</a>. While in Heaven, Enoch is given a grand tour by the angel <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uriel.html" title="Uriel">Uriel</a> and is given extensive knowledge about the positions of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star.html" title="Star">stars</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet.html" title="Planet">planets</a> in the sky--<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>.</p>
<p>This book was somewhat similar to Revelation, but was considered too severe and strange to be included in the Bible. However, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bruce_f292.html" title="James Bruce">James Bruce</a> discovered it in the late <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> at <a href="../../../a/x/u/Axum.html" title="Axum">Axum, Ethiopia</a> to be amongst Ethiopian Orthodox Christian scripture. The hypothesis is that this book made its way there with the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_Sheba_2ba8.html" title="Queen of Sheba">Queen of Sheba</a> as the book contains a story about her visit with <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon.html" title="Solomon">Solomon</a> and the fact that she bore one of his children, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menelek.html" title="Menelek">Menelek</a> I the first Ethiopian king. When Christians arrived in the 4th century, they stumbled across the book and immediately blended it in with their official holy scriptures. Like Jubilees, this book was also found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>

<p>Thomas, which deals extensively with Jesus’ youth, was written too late to be considered as official scripture. The earliest copy was written in the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a>, but one clue suggests that it was in circulation in 150 A.D. as a church leader made comments about its stories being spurious.</p>
<p>One of the stories in this book tells of Jesus making some clay <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird.html" title="Bird">birds</a> and then bringing them to life on the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a>. The book also shows that Jesus had a malevolent side. In one story, he pushed a playmate off a roof then brought him back to life; in another, he blinded one of his father <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Joseph_8013.html" title="Saint Joseph">Joseph</a>’s customers for being critical of his work.</p>
<p>As the story progresses, Jesus slowly evolves from a five year old “divine <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brat.html" title="Brat">brat</a>” who used his wisdom to put down people to a more loving 8-year-old who used his powers to help others. In another story, he helped his father Joseph out after he had cut some wood to the wrong length by miraculously lengthening a number of boards to the correct dimension.</p>
<p>The book, of which some sections have similar stories to those into the Quran, points out that though Jesus may have been a brat in his youth, he overcame his problems and went on to become a person of greatness.</p>

The book begins with Mary’s parents, Joachin and Anna.

This <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaculate_conception.html" title="Immaculate conception">immaculate conception</a> is a proof that Mary herself was born without the stain of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_sin.html" title="Original sin">original sin</a> (sans sex).</p>
<p>By the 4th century, the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> insisted that Mary was a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin.html" title="Virgin">virgin</a> her entire life, yet Mark 6:3 mentions four additional sons and a number of daughters. James solves this <a href="../../../r/i/d/Riddle.html" title="Riddle">riddle</a> by saying those children were Joseph’s from a previous <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a>.</p>
<p>The stories in this book were well known to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> Christians and are similar to those in the Quran where the 19th Chapter is another accounting of the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annunciation.html" title="Annunciation">Annunciation</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Birth_e8f9.html" title="Virgin Birth">Virgin Birth</a>.</p>
<p>James wasn’t included in the Bible due to the fact that it probably should have been at the beginning of the New Testament to fit in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronology.html" title="Chronology">chronologically</a>. The early church fathers felt that doing so would detract too much from the main character Jesus.</p>

<p>One of the texts found at Nag Hammadi, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Magdalene_8dd9.html" title="Mary Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> is portrayed as a full <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">apostle</a> in this book where she is given special teachings from Jesus. Some of those teachings, such as “Where the mind is, there is the treasure” (Mary 10:14-16) and “He does not see through the soul nor through the spirit, but the mind which is between the two” (Mary 10: 20-22), were purely Gnostic in nature. As such, it found little favor among the orthodox church fathers. Furthermore, the concept of Mary being so close to Jesus raises the possibility of an independent female voice within the church that was <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anathema.html" title="Anathema">anathema</a> to the 4th century church leaders.</p>
<p>While comprising his list of acceptable scripture for the forthcoming Bible, Bishop <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athanasius.html" title="Athanasius">Athanasius</a> also comprised a list of texts that were to be excluded and the Gospel of Mary was one of them. Upon receiving such news, Gnostic <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monk</a> decided it best to bury this and other books at Nag Hammadi.</p>

<p>Believed to have been written in the 3rd or 4th century due to the testimonies of the early church fathers, this is a story of Jesus’s trial, execution and brief descent into Hell. Hell in this book is a place where everyone is destined to go and Jesus ventures there to free many of the early church <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyrs</a>.</p>
<p>Many scholars, as well as early church leaders<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html#Examples" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words"><i><span style="white-space: nowrap;">attribution needed</span></i></a>]</sup>, feel it’s a forgery to gain converts by impressing upon an individual the Savior’s power over Satan. Others see it as a redundant compilation of all other stories previously written. Finally, many of the early church fathers deemed its description of the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underworld.html" title="Underworld">underworld</a> as too speculative because they viewed Hell as a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_mind.html" title="State of mind">state of mind</a> and not a physical place.</p>
<p>Although banned, it is noteworthy that it was a very popular book that was in circulation as recently as the <a href="../../../1/5/0/1500s.html" title="1500s">1500s</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> and other early <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> leaders forbade their followers to read it.</p>
<p>The first half of the book is purported to be an eyewitness account of Jesus' trial and execution and is the only source which mentions that Jesus saw his mother while proceeding to his <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifixion.html" title="Crucifixion">crucifixion</a>.

<p>A contender with the Revelation of John, this work fell out of favor with the early leaders as they doubted its authorship and the fact that Revelation was better written.</p>
<p>During the time of the Christian persecutions, many <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalyptic_literature.html" title="Apocalyptic literature">apocalyptic literature</a> was in circulation to console the faithful that the evil empire (<a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Rome</a>) was going to have justice served on it.</p>
<p>This book gives a gruesome detailed account of what Hell is like. It also suggests a way out of Hell for <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evildoer.html" title="Evildoer">evildoers</a>. If a consensus of heavenly angels decide to beseech the Lord to forgive their sins, they can escape. Church leaders were opposed to such a concept because that would mean that anyone can sin all they wanted because ultimately all will be saved.</p>
