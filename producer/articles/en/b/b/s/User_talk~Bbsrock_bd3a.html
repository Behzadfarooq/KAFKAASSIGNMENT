<p>I'm afraid that I overrode your edit in an edit conflict -- but when I checked, I found that you'd only added a comma in the middle of a date. There isn't any point doing that, as the Wikipedia date engine shows the date with or without a comma depending on the User's preferences; I never see a comma, because in England we don't use one, but U.S. users always see commas (if they have their preferences set properly). --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhronima_8cbf.html" title="User:Phronima">Phronima</a> 21:49, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Bbsrock. I noticed your edit on <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Chafee_e0c8.html" title="Lincoln Chafee">Lincoln Chafee</a> and just wanted to let you know that there's no need to rearrange dates in that way, even if it's an American subject. As long as the dates are wikilinked, they'll automatically be arranged according to the user's preferences. Hope this helps! —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 23:29, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm new here, and I'm still learning. Most of my contributions to Wikipedia thus far have been birth &amp; death dates. I'm unsure of the correct dash to use to separate the two. I read somewhere in the editing instructions to use the em dash not the en dash. I noticed on your Page you seem to prefer the en dash. Which is correct? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_David_03f9.html" title="User:Michael David">Michael David</a> 15:33, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed you changed my "(born Coretta Scott; {dates}."

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 6% for major edits and 0% for minor edits. (Based on the last 150 major and 150 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>.

<p>Hi there. On your user page you contrast and compare these two lines:</p>
<pre>
([[October 23]], [[1923]] - [[December 1]], [[2005]])
([[October 23]], [[1923]] – [[December 1]], [[2005]])
</pre>
<p>But they look identical to me. The upper one is supposedly one you hate and the lower one is the one you favor. Please clue me in on the difference. I noticed your (minor) edit of <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Payne_8bac.html" title="Kevin Payne">Kevin Payne</a> which according to page history entailed exchanging the hyphen/dash separating the birth/death dates; could not see the difference in my browser, and followed you to your user page. Is this something that renders differently for you, and not for me? Oh, and could you please use edit summaries? -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareklug_38c6.html" title="User:Mareklug">Mareklug</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareklug_3424.html" title="User talk:Mareklug"><sup><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></sup></a> 05:06, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey mate, we're trying to write an article there and not build a gallery :-) The thing is, the pictures were laid out in a neat order - John then Paul then George then Ringo, which you've upset rather :-) Do you think you could choose the one or two <i>best</i> pictures from your batch, and move them after the JPG &amp; R individual pictures, and remove the rest? The pictures you remove can maybe go onto the talk page so other people can see what spare photos we have available. I appreciate you're adding some colour, but the pictures of the 4 guys in order is really too great a concept to meddle with don't you think? :) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 00:12, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can you please tell me exactly why you prefer that ugly George Harrison image over the better one? Perhaps the better one is copyrighted (like is said in the image itself), but it is fair use and it is low-resolution for non-profit purposes. There are tons of copyrighted fair-use images on Wikipedia, just like the George Harrison image I propose that we use.</p>
<p>Not meaning to be rude, but if my proposed image is still just not acceptable, any chance we could dig up some better image of George Harrison, that we can actually use? --<a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeierstra%C3%9F_099f.html" title="User:Weierstraß">Weierstraß</a> (<a href="../../../w/e/i/User_talk%7EWeierstra%C3%9F_f12f.html" title="User talk:Weierstraß">talk</a>) 20:36, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Tucker.JPG</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.
