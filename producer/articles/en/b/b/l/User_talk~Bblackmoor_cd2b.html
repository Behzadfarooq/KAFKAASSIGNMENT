<p>Sorry, I ought to have thought about Googling the above phrase; it just seemed too long to exist anywhere else (I thought that you may have written it yourself; I assumed that you're a Classics scholar or something). Thanks for it - it is now my screensaver.</p>
<p>As for your "The Problem with Wikipedia" essay; though I've not been here for very long, I'd probably have to agree with a lot of what you said. However, despite Wikipedia's (and, with which I am more involved, Wiktionary's) numerous failings, it's still, overall - dare I utter the cliché - a force for good. It's a real shame that your experiences have embittered you so. I hope that you soon find something else worthwhile to which you can devote yourself. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorem%C3%ADtzwr_4beb.html" title="User:Doremítzwr">Doremítzwr</a> 19:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, you’re an internet gaming and Star Wars fan I see. What other articles do you tweak from time to time? Oh well, though you may not edit things in any great quantity, at least what you do is of high quality.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>By the way, though I agree 100% that html smart quotes are horrible to read in the source code and thus ought not be used, it’s probably best that you don’t go removing them from the talk page of their chief proponent. Replacing them with unicode ones may have been tolerated, but changing them to " &amp; ' is asking for trouble. It’s Wiketiquette that one does not change other users’ comments. I only make this comment in an attempt to prevent unnecessary and unproductive conflict. If you prefer, it’s OK with me if you edit what I write on your talk page in order to remove smart quotes. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorem%C3%ADtzwr_4beb.html" title="User:Doremítzwr">Doremítzwr</a> 20:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And while I do recognize and respect the spirit of its current state, I agree with what a lot of the posters on that talk page say that it belongs on a fan site, not an encyclopedia.

<p>Well, there are three ways to do it; one is to click on your contributions and spend the rest of your life going "1, 2, 3, 4, ... oh wait, I lost count better start over..." Don't laugh; when I first saw people referring to their edit counts that's what I thought they were doing.</p>
<p>The faster and easier way is to use one of the tools. Interiot's tool is the one most used in <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">requests for adminship</a>. <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=Bblackmoor&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=Bblackmoor&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> That link will give you your edit count, complete with nice little charts that compare how many edits you make in various months. At the top of the screen is a link that says, "Go Back" which you can click and enter in someone else's user name to see that person's edit count. It even works for the non-english Wikipedias. Sometimes it's kind of slow; and sometimes it breaks. There's another, less detailed one that's used when Interiot's is broken, but I don't know how to find it.</p>
<p>The third way; which I have done on occasion when I want to know just how accurate Interiot's tool is, is to copy your contribution list into Excel or some other spreadsheet. The number of rows is the number of edits; and you can then sort them however you want.</p>

<p>For the record, the link to my blog is available at <a href="http://web.mac.com/flightline" class="external text" title="http://web.mac.com/flightline" rel="nofollow">this site</a> in case you're interested. You'll notice there's not a single vent about this on there. I hope you can understand my viewpoint on this case as well as Supreme Cmdrs, which you've mentioned you empathize with. I don't have any "axe to grind" on this article, if I did I'd have actually edited it (full disclosure: I made 1, maybe 2 reversions to the article, that's it). I came to this article as a mediator and when that failed, due to the edit warring and verbal sparring between Supreme Cmdr and Bill Huffman mainly, I filed the ArbCom case. If you'll go back, you'll notice that it was actually not my first choice to do to, and I only filed it at the repeated request of other editors as I felt there was no choice, and the issue would not have been properly resolved any other way. I apologize, by the way, for my "barb" comment, this case is stressing me out more than it should, and I've just lost a close member of my family and am on my way to the funeral while this is going on. I just want you to understand my reasoning for the case: My substantive issue with this case is 1) to get ArbCom to rule on the inclusibility of disputed links 2) to take action against the personal attacks and incivility on both sides 3) to enforce a cessation of the edit warring that is disrupting the page. The problem is, Supreme Cmdr does not have a full grasp of policy regarding things like NPOV, weasel words, and as mentioned before libel. A case in point is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Combat_f04c.html" title="Universal Combat">Universal Combat</a> article. His changing of "criticizing" to "noted" is a POV push, in an otherwise rather neutral article, and his claiming that it's a "weazel words" is incivil and inaccurate. He appears to be so strongly set in his beliefs that he will not allow any other opinion than his own to prevail, and he has mentioned this multiple times on the talk page (see ArbCom Evidence page WP:OWN related comments). I VERY strongly oppose behavior like that on wikipedia under all circumstances. THAT is my issue with this case, not the substantive content of the article, which I could care less about, other than the slightly interesting precedent of the inclusibility of UseNET articles by the article subject. I just want to make sure we're both clear on all this. I appreciate your input in the case, and invite further comment about it on my talk page if you'd like.<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 18:35, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"My substantive issue with this case is 1) to get ArbCom to rule on the inclusibility of disputed links 2) to take action against the personal attacks and incivility on both sides 3) to enforce a cessation of the edit warring that is disrupting the page."</i> I think these are laudable goals. For what it's worth, I am defending Supreme Cmdr (where such defense seems warranted) because it seems to me that almost no one else is. Supreme Cmdr is by no means blameless, and I know that, and I hope my comments have made that clear, but I do not think that justifies what I perceive to be a lynch mob mentality. As it happens, my grandfather, who was my second-closest relative after my mother, died on Sunday. I am not one for expressing sentiment to people (or about people) whom I do not know, but you do have my sympathy. -- <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBblackmoor_49d5.html" title="User:Bblackmoor">BBlackmoor</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></sup> • 2007-01-12 19:05Z (copied from <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a>'s talk page)</dd>

<p><br />
I understand your comments and support of him, and I agree with you that a lynch mob is never a good thing....but in a case where there is clear cut violation of policy and clear cut contempt for the goals of the project by Supreme Cmdr, I don't view it as a lynch mob, I view it as several users correctly seeing his misbehavior and calling him out on it. Maybe it's semantics, but in my mind a lynch mob implies a lack of fairness, and Supreme Cmdr has been given every chance to have a fair say, as it were. The fact that ArbCom has unanimously approved the finding of fact that he engaged in personal attacks, and that he is a SPA that has been disruptive to the article, I believe tends to support my view. The fact that there was first a mediation, I believe an RFC as well, and finally an Arbcom request, and then hearing, as well as 3 seperate AN/I discussions, and several 3RR violation discussions, not to mention his talk page and the article talk page, shows there has been more than enough fairness and leeway given to Supreme Cmdr. 40 million elvis fans may be wrong, but when a vast majority of editors call him out on his public misbehavior, is it a "lynch mob" to assume that maybe they're correct? <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 18:55, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not saying that she does not deserve censure. I think she probably does. But I do not like to see anyone railroaded, and it seems to me that on at least one occasion, Supreme Cmdr has been treated unfairly by admins in a distinctly railroad-like manner, which has only exacerbated the problem.

<p>Recently, you <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Derek_Smart_Evidence_efd6.html#No_evidence_that_Supreme_Cmdr_has_made_legal_threats" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Derek Smart/Evidence">posted</a> a statement that people have made accusations that "Supreme Cmdr has made threats (or legal threats) against other editors or against Wikipedia itself", but there's no evidence that he's done so. While I agree with you on the lack of a pure legal threat (the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Derek_Smart_Workshop_0087.html#Making_threats_of_lawsuits" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Derek Smart/Workshop">ones</a> that other editors point to come very close and are unacceptable behavior, but don't cross the line as an <i>actual</i> legal threat), there is plenty of evidence that SC has made general threats. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Supreme_Cmdr&amp;diff=68810886&amp;oldid=68510008" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Supreme_Cmdr&amp;diff=68810886&amp;oldid=68510008" rel="nofollow">this statement</a> from a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Supreme_Cmdr_8838.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Supreme Cmdr">RfC</a> filed against SC back in August indicates that he is going on a personal vendetta to bring down an admin. I should also point out that the admin's statement beforehand was not aggressive at all. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardinal2_08a6.html" title="User:Cardinal2">Cardinal2</a> 03:01, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not a threat. He appears to think an admin used their power inappropriately or incompetently, or perhaps both, and he expressed an intention to work toward having that power removed. It could have been phrased less argumentatively (imagine my surprise), but it's not a threat. -- <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBblackmoor_49d5.html" title="User:Bblackmoor">BBlackmoor</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></sup> • 2007-01-13 04:17Z (copied from <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardinal2_08a6.html" title="User:Cardinal2">Cardinal2</a>'s Talk page.</dd>

<p>I'll explain my stance when it comes to IMDb just to be clear. I think that there are pros and cons when it comes to IMDb's approach regarding upcoming films. The site seems to feel the need to mark film titles with a release year where a simple <a href="../../../t/b/a/TBA_a03c.html" title="TBA">TBA</a> would suffice. I point to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/" class="external text" title="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/" rel="nofollow">Thor</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0915750/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0915750/" rel="nofollow">The Shadow</a> as examples. In addition, as far as I'm aware, IMDb is similar to Wikipedia in the sense that "anyone" can edit it. Registered users can submit information, but I think that at IMDb, there are gatekeepers that allow the information to be posted. I've seen an Aunt May/Carnage listing for <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a></i> as well as <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Norton_5abe.html" title="Ed Norton">Ed Norton</a> listed as "John Bauer" for 24's Season 5 in an upcoming episode. However, I think IMDb is more authentic when it comes to crew information, as that doesn't seem to be as falsified by fanboyism as cast information is. I'm generally accepting of crew information during filming and beyond, but I tend to take cast information up to a film's release with a grain of salt. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 18:39, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
