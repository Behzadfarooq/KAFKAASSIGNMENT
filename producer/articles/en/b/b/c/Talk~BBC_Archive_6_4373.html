<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hutton et al.</span></h2>
<p>Under the political independance section there is no mention of the David Kelly affairand the subsequent Hutton report.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poor Criticism Section</span></h2>
<p>Whilst it is hard to write a criticism section in a NPOV encyclopedia, the current one seems a little odd. The Israel-Palestinian conflict coverage receives criticism from both sides, yet the link given as a reference is purely from the Israel side. The sentence about the USA criticisms is meaningless without references and seems rather defensive (what is the difference between journalism and criticism?). The Leftist claims again need a reference (their was a article by a ex-BBC correspondant recently that would do, can't remember who though). At the moment this reads like a rather anti-BBC section. -- <a href="../../../w/o/m/User%7EWombat_9fb1.html" title="User:Wombat">Wombat</a> 06:17, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have just had a go at writing a new criticism section. I noticed your comment here after I saved the change. -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robert Byrne</a></p>
<p>A paragraph has been added to the criticism section which is more or less identical to the one Wombat complained about above and which I removed. I think the paragraph is unnecessary a and could be removed completely. Perhaps a comment could be added to the Weekly Standard link that its accusations of impartiality largely stem from an impression of "leftist" bias? But links to anti-BBC blogs and pro-Israeli websites don't seem appropriate for an NPOV encyclopedia. At least with The Weekly Standard and The Guardian the reader knows how to judge the views expressed. -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 14:33, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm still not happy with the "Criticism" section (even though I am almost completely responsible for the current version...).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The section seems out-of-place occupying an entire main section. Criticisms of the BBC as an overall organisation are not of equal importance to the structure of the corporation or the services provided, the two other main sections; the criticism section mostly addresses BBC News; nor does the section even cover the topic of criticisms comprehensively, e.g. the new paragraph under "Funding" outlines some licence fee controversy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another problem with this article at the moment is that it is possibly a bit too long. (Wikipedia gives a "31kb is a bit big" error when you hit edit.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My proposal is: move a shorter version of the current main section to a new "Criticisms" subsection under the "Corporation" section; move the paragraph on the licence fee to this section (this is, after all, a corporation-wide issue); move the more specific criticisms of news coverage to the BBC News article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 01:41, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, after nearly a month of intense debate (not!) on this matter, I have implemented something similar to what I described above. Instead of making a new Criticism section under the Corporation heading, I have moved material from the old Criticism section to relevant places. Specifically the Commerical/Political Independence section, and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a> article. Feel free, by the way, to add links to some positive reviews of BBC News to the section I've created in the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a> article.</p>
<p>As for Criticism sections, on reflection I think they are silly. I agree that Wikipedia should be balanced and NPOV, but balancing elements should be integrated with their counterpoints as closely as possible, not separated in debate format. Also, having a Criticism section here implied that the BBC/BBC News has been significantly discredited, which is emphatically not the case. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 20:54, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Three things - 1. I have never heard of the 'Buggers Broadcasting Communism' epithet, but there is the regularly used 'Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation. 2. Rob Byrne above states that it is "emphatically not the case" that BBC News has been significantly discredited, whereas this itself is not true. BBC News is regularly criticised and it is wrong that there is no criticism section. 3. No discussion of the iniquitous 'License Fee'? - a despicable regressive tax if ever there was one.88.105.116.228 09:32, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The current Criticism section seems to contradict itself: it says that "The BBC's news coverage has been accused of systematic anti-Israel bias" and then that "The commission's report suggested that the BBC's news reporting was not sufficiently covering the suffering of Palestinian civilians, and was too focussed on the Israeli perspective of events."!</p>
<p>Also the sources for the first comment link to an extremely suspicious looking website - honestreporting.co.uk - which looks to be far from it!</p>
<p>I think this whole section should be removed as it adds no benefit to the article and I suspect much of what is written in it may have been by people with vested interests. Gizmoleeds 18:02, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">World Service radio only free press?</span></h2>
<p>"in some areas the BBC World Service radio is the only available free press." Which areas, precisely? I understand it's a very important source, but where is there that you could pick up the BBC on shortwave but not, for instance, Deutsche Welle? <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 16:45, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It should be modified slightly. The writer was most likley talking about places such as North Korea, Cuba, Zimbabwe and Iraq before the war where listeners could receive BBC World Service broadcasts, but as you say they most likley could pick up other broadcasts. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithgreer_e923.html" title="User:Keithgreer">keithgreer</a> 18:02, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The pro-Israeli website honestreporting.com</span></h2>
<p>There are often claims, particularly on the internet, that the BBC is biased in its coverage of the Israeli-Palistinian conflict. The criticisms come from supporters of both sides, as can be seen, for example, here: <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=BBC" class="external free" title="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=BBC" rel="nofollow">http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=BBC</a> .</p>
<p>Many people may turn to the "Criticisms" section of the Wikipedia article on the BBC to find out if there is any substance to some of the claims, many of which can be quite extreme.</p>
<p>So I think it is a pity that when I removed a link to the pro-Israeli (and, as always in these cases, ironically, almost tragically biased) website honestreporting.com, it was put straight back in, along with a bizarre note that it is "not POV". (Don't readers of the Wikipedia assume that anyway?)</p>
<p>I invite any rational Wikipedia editors with an interest in the Wikipedia article on the BBC to look at honestreporting.com to see whether they think it is worthy to be referenced in a serious encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I think it isn't. By way of supporting my argument, here is a link to a Guardian investigation of honestreporting.com from early 2001 -- <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4140042,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4140042,00.html" rel="nofollow">Media manipulators</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 21:41, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you are completely wrong. There are over a hundred people who are actively involved in the writing and development of this article.</dd>

<dd>Also, criticism of the BBC is most welcome in the article - but like all Wikipedia articles, that criticism must be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">fair and balanced</a>. We will all expunge, ASAP, any criticism of the BBC that is unfair, groundless, represents a point of view or isn't backed up with <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citations</a>. This applies to all Wikipedia articles - otherwise this wouldn't be an encyclopedia, it would be a giant slagging-off ground.

<dd>i would like rob byrne to confirm this - not one of the 'over 100 people' etc. In addition, why, if criticism is allowed, is the 'Biased BBC' blog link always expunged?

<p>Forgive me, but I am clearly not as perspicacious as you, since I cannot work out where or how I have been rude to you. Methinks you must be a very sensitive chap. And still no confirmation as to the provenance of Mr Byrne (or indeed yourself) regarding relations with or of the BBC, although your tone and language suggest a strong affiliation with the corporation. I now suspect you of writing for Ariel!!!! As for being blocked for editing rights, my dear chap, it is not beyond the ken of even the least able web user to visit / log on under a variety of ISPs or mirrors if necessary.

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivil</a> wording was "<i>your drivel</i>", which is hardly has a place in serious debate. You are, of course, completely entitled to change ISPs or "use mirrors" in order to be incivil to your fellow Wikipedia editors. But the fact that you would <i>have to</i> go to all that trouble is, in part, be one of the reasons we use blocks. Although one would question just how obsessive and lonely someone who goes to all that trouble would be; fortunately I remain unoffended and you remain unblocked, so the question doesn't arise. ➨ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">❝</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">R</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_Esperanza_f04c.html" title="User:Redvers/Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">DVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">❞</a> 18:37, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'All that trouble' - It's no trouble at all. My mention of changing ISPs etc. was in relation to editing rights - not to do with being 'uncivil' towards editors. This is a <i>non sequitur</i>. Please concentrate. 'Obsessive'? Just how often do <u>you</u> check this page? Use of the word 'Drivel' is uncivil? You poor sensitive chap. You keep banging on about being unoffended yet you find the word 'drivel' uncivil? Make your mind up! 'Serious debate?' - the Biased BBC site (the link to which I note is regularly expunged) is as serious a website as any. Why the censorship? I asked a simple question and have still not got a reply - so the suspicion remains. 88.105.116.143 23:03, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have noticed in recent years that praise for the BBC programming is confined to the arts/tv sections, while Murdoch-a-like criticism appears in the main body of the paper (ie. The Times), often in Editorials. I think Murdoch's influence is a valid point; he's not going to let a paper that he owns support a rival operation, and the same goes for the owners of most of the other British newspapers, most of whom are rivals. It would not be unfair to call him rabidly anti-BBC. Fionnuala</dd>

<dd>I think that's a bit simplistic. News International/Sky may be quite happy with the status quo. The alternative to licence-funding for the BBC would probably be a model involving subscription and advertising, which would produce a rival to Sky. In fact the majority of mass-circulation newspapers in Britain seem content with the present system. Nowhere do I see any serious coverage of the arguments against the BBC, nor of the growing dissatifaction with the ever-increasing licence fee (now, apparently, officially classified as a tax). The licence fee offends against the Human Rights Act and is enforced by an unpleasant set of bullies called TV Licensing. BTW the "Jonathan Miller" in question is not the polymathic, <i>Beyond-the-Fringe</i> broadcaster and director of theatre and opera, but a journo who used to have a column in the <i>Sunday Times</i>. Now he <i>is</i> <a href="http://www.tvlicensing.biz/" class="external text" title="http://www.tvlicensing.biz/" rel="nofollow">"rabidly anti-BBC"</a>; he also appears to have been dropped! -- <a href="../../../p/u/f/User%7EPuffball_8465.html" title="User:Puffball">Puffball</a> 16:05, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Lots of repeated facts (or, in some cases, "facts" - there's a bit of "some people say that.." POV stuff), unnecessarily long lists of factoids (do we really need to list all of the Governors in the headline article?), and generally just beginning to suffer from wikirot - death by a thousand minor edits. The References section mostly relates to the historical bits which are now in their own article. In short, time for a spring-clean.

<p>Having just had a little look at the article with a view to commenting here, I am not sure that the list of people currently in the BBC is very useful or important in this article (others may well disagree with this). The links in the See Also section seem a little odd, e.g. why is BBC Birmingham and BBC Asian Network there? I also think the section on unencrypted satellite doesn't sit very well with the rest of the article, and overall does not seem as important as it appears in the article.

<p>"I am not sure that ... is very useful or important". Since when is Wikipedia about these attributes? Each participant in the 1900 summer Olympics has his/her own entire page (see Lecomte: we only know that his surname appeared in a list as coming 8th in something; no forename, no dates, no nothing else. It was a men's event, so he's probably male). At some time somebody may want to look up someone in the BBC; here is the information. That's legitimate encyclpaedia fodder.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Not public broadcasting system</span></h2>
<p>I've been trying to make a point which is important for non-UK readers. This is probably better done by others who know the BBC better, if they agree.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article is likely to have two main types of reader:</p>
<p>1. Brits who want to know who the current Chief Assistant to the Assistant Chief is, or when the changeover from 405 lines was.</p>
<p>2. People from other countries who want to know what the BBC _is_. As far as I know, it's a unique entity due to its history as a monopoly and to the very good people who ran it, so it needs explaining. In most countries Public Service Broadcasting means, I believe, a worthy, underfunded, system which transmits stuff not many people want to watch, and is likely to buy most of it in rather than make it.</p>
<p>So maybe contributors would like to bear this in mind. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Hurry up, by the time the entry is finished the BBC will probably be something quite different, unfortunately.</p>

<dd>history as a monopoly? Excepting radio, it hasn't been a monopoly on TV since 1955. And its TV only started in earnest in 1946, so it never had much history as a monopoly on TV.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">World Service German section</span></h2>
<p>I just finished a brief tidy up of the radio section and this section strikes me as somewhat out of place:</p>
<p>The German Service, created in 1938 and discontinued in 1999, played an important part in the propaganda war against Nazi Germany. The authoritative source on the BBC's German Service is Carl Brinitzer's book "Hier spricht London". Brinitzer, a German lawyer from Hamburg living in exile in London, was a founding member. Another famous member of staff was Egon Jameson (Egon Jacobsson), a former <a href="../../../u/l/l/Ullstein-Verlag_1656.html" title="Ullstein-Verlag">Ullstein</a> journalist from <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>.</p>
<p>Though somewhat interesting, I'm not sure that it's sufficiently relevant to BBC Radio as a whole. I have also never heard of "Egon Jameson", and a quick search on Google reveals little that would suggest he is a particularly noteworthy character.

<dd>I'm guessing that's a reference to over 160 distinct news programmes, on the various television and radio channels and on bbc.co.uk. (The latter isn't a "channel", of course, but does have a lot of original content.) So in any given hour, "the BBC" as a whole is producing 160 hours' worth of news programming. I guess.</dd>

So unless they all broadcast the news 24 hours a day, and some manage 2 hours of news every hour, it still doesn't add up. bbc.co.uk is hard to add into the mix since what constitutes an hour online?

<dd>To be honest does Nick Robinson being a former young Tory add anything to the article? Is it any different to when the Tories kicked up a stink about Andrew Marr who came from the Independent?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Statistical Nonsense</span></h2>
<p>I have reverted the addition about doing statistical searches to find BBC bias.</p>
<p>1. It did not contain any source, let alone a credible and exhaustive study.</p>
<p>2. The examples cited were arbitary and selective nonsense. Although it is true there is one result for "far left" as opposed to about 30 for "far right". There are also 27 results for "fascist" against 837 for communist.</p>

<li>It's my image, but as it's on Commons, Wikipedia doesn't bring author information through with it. You can click the link in the box that reads "This image is from Wikimedia Commons.

<p>I read this sentence: "Television broadcasting was suspended from September 1, 1939 to June 7, 1946 during the Second World War." Maybe this doesn't belong in this article but does anyone know how did the british people lived this important period of war without the BBC? was there another company making broadcasting to the people during the WII in britain? thank you. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinakomel_a9a7.html" title="User:Minakomel">Minako-Chan*</a> 05:11, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Television broadcasting was suspended. Radio wasn't. Radio was the predominant mode of broadcasting at that time, with only a handful of television sets in use, so the average person probably didn't even notice the suspension of television. The BBC's radio services kept going. --<a href="../../../m/p/k/User%7EMpk_a450.html" title="User:Mpk">Mike</a> 08:04, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Television didn't disappear from most people’s lives in Britain as it wasn't in their lives to begin with. You have to understand TV was very much in it's infancy it had only been broadcasting a few years at the time and there was only one channel being broadcast to approximately 25% of the nation. However only ~23,000 homes actually had a TV set. The general opinion before the war was that it was just a gimmick and would never become a popular medium as apposed to radio or cinema. Such was the lack of importance of television, to the nation, it could easily be switched off. Added to that it was also considered a dangerous distraction; the government assumed people may be watching it when they should really be in their air raid shelters. The British government actually had another use for the transmitters anyway; although they never had to carry out the threat, they were modified to be able to jam German military communications if an invasion occurred.</dd>
<dd>To that end it's probably true to say no one actually really worried about the absence of television (as they probably would be today) as there were much more important things to worry about.</dd>

<dd>May be the indenting's getting a little out of hand, but I was trying to expand on your comment on the transmitters being used to jam German comms in the event of invasion, rather than ask a new question.

<p>It seems to me that the pile o'logos in the History section is unnecessarily obtrusive and takes up a lot of space in an already fairly dense article like this. The history of the BBC's typography and graphic identity could probably make an article by itself which this could be moved to, but it just seems... unnecessary to have it in such a prominent position -- especially as the changes in logo are more subtle refinements than revolutionary. Who would sulk if I removed it? --<a href="../../../m/p/k/User%7EMpk_a450.html" title="User:Mpk">Mike</a> 23:26, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really like the new infobox, but was wondering if it wouldn't be better to follow the format of other broadcasters (for example <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> or <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>. The only parts I was left puzzling about is availability (is it worth adding nearby countries that can receive BBC transmissions?), the owner section and the slogan section (is there an advertising slogan that would be more apporpriate to use?). <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi">Daduzi</a> 09:24, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're right, it should be in keeping with other broadcasters, however I think some of the details need to be ammended such as it being publically owned (which it isn't) it in fact has no ownership as it's run under a Royal Charter. It also needs to include information that it doesn't just broadcast Television and Radio but also Online and Interactive data services. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteb16_cdfa.html" title="User:Peteb16">PeteB16</a> 12:18, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As far as the ownership goes, I'll fully admit I was at a loss as to exactly how to phrase it, so a more accurate formation would be welcome. As regards the online broadcast, with the other networks only television and radio are listed as network types while online services are listed under "available", so it's probably best to stick to that pattern, even given the BBC's unique online presence. This all reminds me that I scandalously neglected to include the World Service in the available section, I'll add it now. <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi">Daduzi</a> 13:00, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You could use "This is what we do" as the advertising slogan, rather than the motto which isn't generally used for promotion. For availability what about something like "<i>Internationally available via <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">Television</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">Radio</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>, and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publishing.html" title="Publishing">Print</a></i>" (Ceefax and BBCi could be considered as part of its TV output)? <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithgreer_e923.html" title="User:Keithgreer">the<strong>Keith</strong></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Northern_Ireland2.svg_1ced.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c2/Flag_of_Northern_Ireland2.svg/30px-Flag_of_Northern_Ireland2.svg.png" alt="" width="30" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Northern_Ireland2.svg_1ced.html" /></a> 14:32, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the feedback. The slogan has been changed. I've also taken on your suggestion for the availability field since it seems more in line with the other broadcast networks using the infobox (I based mine off of CNN, but it seems cable networks have a different format), though I still think it's useful to differentiate the national from the international due to the different channels and content. I'm going to leave print out, though, since that gets away from the broadcasting side and is really a strictly BBC Worldwide deal. I've also decided to leave out the "owner" section entirely since I've managed to establish who doesn't own the BBC and that appears to have cover pretty much everyone; as far as I can tell nobody owns the BBC. If anyone can correct me feel free because I'm somewhat baffled at the moment. <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi">Daduzi</a> 17:36, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If nobody has any objections I'll go ahead and put the new infobox in after 24 hours. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi">Daduzi</a> 10:17, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 'Slogan' is not an official BBC-wide promotion or value, the 'Motto' is. MOre information on the BBC 'About the BBC' webpages. 'This is what we do' is just one particular strand of branding promotion. <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.185.240.121.html" title="User:132.185.240.121">132.185.240.121</a> 16:06, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the motto has ever been used as a slogan? &#160;<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithgreer_e923.html" title="User:Keithgreer"><span style="background-color:#6699FF"><font color="#FFFFFF">&#160;the<b>Keith</b>&#160;</font></span></a><a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithgreer_6e9e.html" title="User talk:Keithgreer"><span style="background-color:green"><font color="#FFFFFF">&#160;<i><small>Talk to me</small></i>&#160;</font></span></a><span style="background-color:#6699FF">&#160;</span> 17:20, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I added a "motto" field to the template, how does it look now? --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 23:16, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Much better thanks! Seems a bit obvious now doesn't it? So much so I thought there may have been an incompatibility issue with the Infobox template. Glad it worked, thanks. ~~ <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteb16_cdfa.html" title="User:Peteb16">Peteb16</a> 23:33, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
