<dd>I agree with you. I originally created this page and by removing the critical stuff from the main BBC page to keep it as streamlined as possible, since there are specific articles about specific BBC topics. The section that this text was cut and pasted to was about the Secret Society series of which both the television and radio programs were a part. This text is not directly related to those programs.</dd>
<dd>I did quite a bit of checking to make sure that the facts I was posting were documented facts and before this text goes in it needs more than a "as memory serves me" type of reference. What was the date of this program? Who was named? What were they accused of and what was the final result? Finally, cite some source other than fuzzy memory. Here is the text in question which deserves its own sub-heading if true:</dd>

<dd>I beg to disagree. I've been a BBC fan (if you may call it that) for several years now, and almost <i>never</i> have I seen it being biased towards the Israeli position; quite the contrary in fact. Several media watchdogs (including <a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.honestreporting.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.honestreporting.com/</a>) have even criticized the BBC for its clear pro-Arab stance on issues concerning, say, Israel and Palestine. When it comes to Israel, the BBC just can't be trusted—not at all. To them, Israel is almost always the wrong one and almost never the Palestinians.</dd>

<dd>If you believe that the tag SHOULD be placed on this article - then please explain WHY you believe that it should be on the ENTIRE article. The reason why this article was created was to clean up the main BBC article which is now an overview of the BBC. There are articles on just about every aspect of the BBC linking back to the main overview page. The entire idea behind this page is show where CONTROVERSY exists with regards to the BBC. Controversy can mean anything at all - it is not in and of itself POV, because with controversy it can report both sides of a dispute while the dispute itself may be controversial. The only prerequisite in Wikipedia terms is that the dispute is not original to Wikipedia but reported elsewhere so that its source of origination can be documented on Wikipedia. I will add a version of this text as a lead-in explanation to the article. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 17:56, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>Others however, perceive the BBC to be biased towards the official UK position, especially during the invasion of Iraq. Several statistics have shown the BBC to be the most likely of British media to accept the official UK statements as facts, while devoting the least time to anti-war opinions, and virtually ignoring Iraqi civilian casualties caused by the invasion. In addition, it is often accused of being pro-Israel in its coverage and ignoring the suffering of the Palestinians. A recent survey by the BBC itself revealed extreme ignorance among its watchers of the history of the conflict, with some believing the Palestinians to be occupying Israeli lands, or even that the Palestinians are refugees from Afghanistan!</p>

<dd>Hi there. Apologies if I get the formatting wrong for this edit;</dd>
</dl>
<p>but I think I can provide a source for the claim that the BBC was the most pro-war of surveyed broadcasters: it was the "Cardiff study": Cardiff University's School of Journalism's research looking at television news channels. I can't find the report online. I can find a Guardian report of it: <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,7521,991149,00.html" class="external text" title="http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,7521,991149,00.html" rel="nofollow">Guardian report of 2003-07-04</a> I keep meaning to dig this report out or buy a copy, because it gets referred to a lot. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">telsa</a> 19:40 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just because it uses non-standard names does not indicate any bias, and 'the gulf' is just a shortened version of the Persian Gulf. About 'Farsi', it may be a mistake on their part.

<p>When an Iranian reporter or weblogger (like Hussein Derakhshan) uses Persian Gulf or Persian in his\her articles, the editor (of BBC or any western media) replaces The Gulf and Farsi instead of them, when we call them on the phone, they only say "excuse me,Good-bye beeeeep" last year National Geography named "Arabian Gulf" our Persian Gulf and then Iranians around the world sent them 5000 of emails to correct their mistake, after it Arabs misused Iran's Nuclear crisis and wanted US state dep. to warn media to use the gulf instead Persian Gulf and uses Farsi instead of Persian, and BBC Have your say, always publishs religious Iranians' comment, when reformist univ. students write comments about reform and anything like that BBC ignores their comments. and about Khouzestan where only nearby 2 millions of 6 millon of its people are from Arab descents, BBC always uses Arabic-speaking province and for its cities Arabic-speaking city ... in fact britis are very angry about Mossadeq who made oil indus. national. and and and ... my text is true. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasanjan_39d5.html" title="User:Sasanjan">Sasanjan</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasanjan_335b.html" title="User talk:Sasanjan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasanjan_8907.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasanjan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>First of all, please sign your posts. Four tildes do it ( ~~~~ ). Now, about the Arabian/Persian Gulf? You have got to understand that most people don't care which they use, as long at it describes the place. Saying Arabian gulf is technically incorrect, but it accurately refers the the gulf. And understand that the BBC can't post anything too controversial, or Iran will be on their backs. I don't know about Khouzestan, so I can't comment on that. But even if your text is true, which is controversial at best, you can NOT post it under the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No original research</a> clause of Wikipedia rules.

<p>IMHO this article should be kept as a reference of *real* controversies that the BBC has been involved in such as the Hutton Affair, sackings of DGs, etc. It shouldn't start degenerating (again) into a list of random isloted reports that some people have adopted as hobby-horses as examples of bias on a particular subject.</p>
<p>IMHO if such opinions of BBC News belong anywhere they belong in the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html#Opinions_of_BBC_News" title="BBC News">BBC_News#Opinions_of_BBC_News</a> section. However, I feel that this already covers quite adquately the fact that some people accused the BBC of being anti-war, while some (at the same time) accuse it of being pro-war. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 00:55, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The BBCs reporting of the Iraq war was controversial. There were mass protests against the BBC. Also the deleted section gives the article balance. I had not seen any removed part.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The report I linked to was not some "random isloted reports that some people have adopted as hobby-horses" It was an objective academic report on media during the Iraq war. User:The Proffesor
<dl>
<dd>Still this is an <i>opinion</i> of BBC news (that you have now carbon copied to two articles) as opposed to a major controversy such as the other ones listed in the article that the BBC has been involved in. There are a number of such reports down the years that have come from numerous sources that say the BBC is biased on issue X.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While IMHO it is debateable whether it should have mention in the BBC News article, IMHO it should be removed from this article, as all things being fair all of these should be included in this article (what counts as an accurate source? should anti-Isreal reporting measured by pro-Isreali organisations also be included? against evidence that the BBC is also anti-Palestianian). At which point the article will again become a little project of personal axe grindings. IMHO there is a need to stop (and strongly police) this as it detracts from the value of the encyclopedia as a whole when every single article about the BBC contains why the BBC is biased articles.</dd>
<dd>As far as "balance" is concerned, IMHO, the article now reads that the BBC was found to be biased against and at the same time biased for the Iraq war. Which is impossible <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 21:18, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
