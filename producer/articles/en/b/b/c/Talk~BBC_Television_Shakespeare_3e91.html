	    <p>Telecast isn't a word that is a usual part of UK English. As the series was made, and first transmitted, in the UK, I've changed "telecast" to "transmitted"--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffjn_f812.html" title="User:Jeffjn">Jeffjn</a> 01:20, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Before plunging in and editing two parts of this, I'd like to question the sources of information.</p>
<p>"extremely low production values" - In terms of budget and the skills of those working on the series, the "production values" were little different to "I Claudius". The studio setting and video production methods may look dated now, but I don't agree that these were <i>extremely low</i></p>
<p><i>(rehearsal and filming typically took place in less than a week)</i>is misleading, as there was a period of at least two weeks outside rehearsal for the actors and the blocking before the production arrived in the studio, and while there was sometimes as little as 5 days allocated for the shooting, these were generally 13 hour days. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:Jeffjn (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUser%7EJeffjn_e90f.html" title="User talk:User:Jeffjn">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EJeffjn_dc30.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Jeffjn">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello, do you have a source for the information about rehearsal time? It would be great to include this, and better if we could cite a reliable source. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Singing_Badger_db89.html" title="User:The Singing Badger">The Singing Badger</a> 17:00, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well I suppose the source is myself. I was a cameraman at the BBC from 1973 to 1990. I attended the "tech runs" at the Outside Rehearsal Rooms in Acton for a number of dramas shot in the studios at Television Centre. Even the simplest Sit-Com had 3 days of rehearsals. Although I was never the Camera Supervisor on any of the BBC Television Shakespeares I'm still in contact with someone who was. I was also one of the camera operators on Loves Labours Lost and Coriolanus.</p>
<p>I've now qualified the two statements to make them less subjective and misleading.</p>
<p>Risible - does that mean that it lead to laughter at the time of the original transmission, or just in hindsight?</p>
<p>"now looks very dated" would be a far more mature comment.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for all your comments! If you see something blatantly subjective, such as the word 'risible', just <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> and remove it. Such language has no place in an encyclopedia. As for your own experiences of filming these programmes it's really helpful to have your information; obviously someone still needs to find a published source to make things look perfect, but this is very helpful regardless. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Singing_Badger_db89.html" title="User:The Singing Badger">The Singing Badger</a> 23:33, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I oppose the seletion of this article for several reasons. First, and most important, this was a notable attempt on the part of the BBC to produce, and make available to a wide audience, all of the bard's plays in the television format. No comprehensive attempt has been made since. The project was noted both in the UK and here in the US (by TV Guide along with other newspapers and magazines). Second, it brought many UK actors to the notice of US audiences. Well known actors like Anthony Quayle were complemented by names like Patrick Stewert, Michael Kitchen, Helen Mirren and Felicity Kendall who have become known today, but were (and still can be seen through the DVD's) early in their careers. Third, several actors filmographies have links to this page.</p>
<p>This page may well need work. Wikipedia has hundreds, if not thousands of pages about British television programs that also need fleshing out. But, it should be here to be fleshed out. The joys of seeing Derek Jacobi as Hamlet and Richard II, of seeing Anthony Hopkins Othello playing off of Bob Hoskin's cockney Iago, of Anthony Quayle's superb (sorry POV I know) Falstaff, of Jane Laportaire's Lady Macbeth, even the experimental castiung of John Cleese as Petruchio or Roger Daltry as the two Dromio's should not be casually tossed aside. Now I know that wikipedia is a communal project and if there is a consensus to delete this page I hope that I will at least be given a chance to print it out for my library before it goes. Thanks for your time and attention in this matter. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 04:56, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. This is the only practical way for most people to see many of the works by the most important dramatist ever to write in English. The productions are, in my admittedly limited experience, generally accurate, though imperfect; information on the productions, and their limitations, is far more important than, for instance, the many undeleted articles on movies of only transient interest.</dd>
