Although the BBC has generally sought to distance itself from controversy, it has generated controversy due to its unique position within <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> society. The following documented subjects reflect some of the controversial issues in which the BBC has become involved. The reporting of the controversy does not imply either agreement or disagreement with any aspect of the controversy itself, merely that the controversy has taken place and that it has been widely reported and previously documented.</p>

<p>One of the first controversial issues in which the BBC became involved was over the question of funding and the control of programming. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> radio broadcasting had already developed to the point that there were "listeners-in" within the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, prior to any broadcasting service being licensed by the British government (British General Post Office - GPO) within the British Isles.</p>
<p>As a result of these technical and social developments, in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> the British government (GPO) forced all of the British electrical companies and the American subsidiaries doing business in Britain, into a single cartel and monopoly which it called the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Broadcasting_Company_8855.html" title="British Broadcasting Company">British Broadcasting Company</a> Ltd. This arrangement lasted until January <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> when the present <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Broadcasting_Corporation_b1c0.html" title="British Broadcasting Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> was given its first <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Charter_7e9a.html" title="Royal Charter">Royal Charter</a> to act as a cultural and information entity controlled by the Crown.</p>

<p>From the late 1930s until the end of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/5/MI5_b0c3.html" title="MI5">MI5</a> had an officer at the BBC vetting editorial applicants.

The personnel records of anyone suspicious were stamped with a distinctively shaped green tag, or 'Christmas tree'; only a handful of BBC personnel staff knew what the 'Christmas trees' meant. <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1723776,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1723776,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Because the BBC had become both a monopoly and a non-commercial entity, it soon faced controversial competition by British subjects (citizens) who were operating leased transmitters on the continent of Europe before <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, to blast commercial radio programmes into the British Isles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Reith_339f.html" title="John Reith">John Reith</a> who had been given powers to dictate the cultural output of the BBC retaliated by leading the opposition to these commercial stations. Controversy spilled over into the press when the British government attempted to censor the printing of their programme information. The pressure was created by the success of these stations. By <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> on Sundays, it was reported that 80% of the British audience was tuning in to commercial radio, rather than the non-commercial BBC.</p>

<p>During World War II the introduction of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Armed_Forces_Radio_fcaa.html" title="American Armed Forces Radio">American Armed Forces Radio</a> programming on to the airwaves within the British Isles caused controversy by the tone and style of their broadcasts. They were very popular and continued to supply the kind of entertainment once provided by the pre-war commercial stations. The BBC was forced to absorb some of this cultural programming against the wishes of its original Director General who had left the employment of the BBC.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> BBC Radio once more began to lose its audience to commercial radio, just as it had prior to World War II. This time the cause of the competition were offshore <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate_radio.html" title="Pirate radio">pirate radio</a> stations, with some of the biggest being financed by money and style originating from <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. The British government reacted by censoring the stations by passing the <i>Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, 1967</i>, which made it illegal for British citizens to work on the pirate ships, or to advertise on them. The BBC then hired the out of work commercial staff and adopted the American <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingles.html" title="Jingles">jingles</a> for themselves.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> offshore pirate radio reappeared on a well financed offshore station only to be jammed by British government using high-powered military transmitters with the help of the BBC. The station effected a change during a General Election and the winning political party continued the jamming policy of its predecessor in power.</p>

<p>The BBC programme <i>Panorama</i> on 30 January 1984 broadcast <i>Maggie's Militant Tendency</i> which claimed that some <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> MPs had links to <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> organisations both in Britain and on the Continent.

In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> the BBC offered an out-of-court settlement, which was accepted, and the <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damages.html" title="Damages">damages</a> amounted to £1 million.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> BBC journalists went on strike to protest police raids to silence a series of BBC broadcasts. The police searched both the BBC studios in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> home of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_Campbell_%28investigative_journalist%29_29a8.html" title="Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)">Duncan Campbell</a>, an investigative journalist.</p>
<p>Controversy began when on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, Graeme McDonald as Controller of BBC-2 TV, was offered a series of documentaries by the BBC studios in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in conjunction with an offer to them by Duncan Campbell whose work had previously appeared in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Statesman_f7c0.html" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</a> magazine. The programmes were six half-hour films by Duncan Campbell (researched and presented by Campbell and produced according to BBC standards), which illuminated <i>hidden truths of major public concern</i>. The six programmes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>One: <i>The Secret Constitution</i> about a small, secret <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">Cabinet</a> committee that was in reality the Establishment that ruled the United Kingdom.</li>
<li>Two: <i>In Time of Crisis</i> about secret preparations for war that began in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> within every <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a> country. This programme revealed what Britain would do.</li>
<li>Three: <i>A Gap In Our Defences</i> about bungling defence manufacturers and incompetent military planners who have botched every new <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a> system that Britain has installed since World War II.</li>
<li>Four: <i>We're All Data Now</i> about the <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_Protection_Act_0efe.html" title="Data Protection Act">Data Protection Act</a>.</li>
<li>Five: Still in production about the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Chief_Police_Officers_a8e5.html" title="Association of Chief Police Officers">Association of Chief Police Officers</a> and how Government policy and actions are determined in the fields of law and order.</li>
<li>Six: Still in production about communications with particular reference to satellites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work began on the series. In April 1986 Alan Protheroe, acting on behalf of BBC Director General <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alasdair_Milne_acea.html" title="Alasdair Milne">Alasdair Milne</a> was asked for permission to <i><a href="../../../c/o/v/Covert_listening_device.html" title="Covert listening device">bug</a></i> a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_detective.html" title="Private detective">private detective</a> who said he could access a Criminal Records Office computer. Permission was granted and filming took place. The police were informed and the man was subsequently charged under Section 2 of the <b><a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_Secrets_Act_a58a.html" title="Official Secrets Act">Official Secrets Act</a></b>.</p>
<p>The sixth programme would have revealed details of a top secret spy satellite and Alisdair Milne had already decided to cut it from the line-up when the <i>Observer</i> newspaper broke the story on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> with the headline: "BBC GAG on £500M DEFENCE SECRET". Combined with this story was a report that the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Office_c781.html" title="Home Office">Home Office</a> intended to restrict the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_licence.html" title="Television licence">broadcast receiver licence</a> fee, the implication being that the Government had decided to censor BBC investigative journalism.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, a series of programmes on BBC Radio Four called <i>My Country Right or Wrong</i> was banned by the Government because it might have revealed sensitive secrets. The series was censored only a few hours before it was due to start because it dealt with similar issues to the television series concerning the British "secret state". However, it was eventually broadcast uncut, after the Government decided that it did not breach any laws or interfere with national security.</p>

<p>In May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the defence correspondent of the <b>BBC Radio 4</b> <a href="../../../t/o/d/Today_programme.html" title="Today programme"><i>Today</i> programme</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Andrew Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a>, quoted a government official who stated that the British Government had "<i>sexed up</i>" a dossier concerning <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a> in Iraq, against the wishes of the Intelligence services. A newspaper report claimed that <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Campbell_dc6b.html" title="Alastair Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> (the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy), was responsible.

<p>The publication in January 2004 of the <b>Hutton Report</b> into Dr Kelly's death was extremely critical of Andrew Gilligan, and of the Corporation's management processes and standards of journalism. In the aftermath, both the Chairman of the BBC <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavyn_Davies_ad9a.html" title="Gavyn Davies">Gavyn Davies</a> and the Director-General <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Dyke_5eac.html" title="Greg Dyke">Greg Dyke</a> resigned, followed by Gilligan himself. Lord Hutton was accused of failing to take account of the imperfections inherent in journalism, while giving the Government the benefit of the doubt over its own conduct. (See <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutton_Inquiry_35cc.html" title="Hutton Inquiry">Hutton Report</a> for details.)</p>

<p>A second inquiry by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Butler%2C_Baron_Butler_of_Brockwell_3e04.html" title="Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell">Lord Butler of Brockwell</a> did review the intelligence on weapons of mass destruction and the production of the dossier. Amongst other things, the <b>Butler Report</b> concluded that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>... the fact that the reference [to the 45 minute claim] in the classified assessment was repeated in the dossier later led to suspicions that it had been included because of its eye-catching character</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew Gilligan claims that the <i>Butler Report</i> vindicated his original story that the dossier had been "<i>sexed up</i>". Lord Hutton himself is said to be surprised at what he apparently views as an over-reaction to and misinterpretation of his criticisms of the BBC. (See <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butler_Report_b5cd.html" title="Butler Report">Butler Report</a> for details.)</p>
<p>In October 2004, the British government finally withdrew the "45 minutes" claim, which was central to the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutton_Inquiry_35cc.html" title="Hutton Inquiry">Hutton Inquiry</a> and their claims about the war's legitimacy. Interpretations of these two reports has been mixed by both postitive and negative comments.</p>
