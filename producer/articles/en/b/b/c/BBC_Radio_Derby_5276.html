<p>The main 104.5 FM is the primary frequency for BBC Radio Derby, and comes from a 200 ft transmitting mast on Drum Hill, four miles north of the Derby City Centre, the other side of the <a href="../../../a/3/8/A38_road.html" title="A38 road">A38</a> from <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Eaton_b534.html" title="Little Eaton">Little Eaton</a>, next to a <a href="http://www.drumhill.org.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.drumhill.org.uk" rel="nofollow">Scout camp</a>. This service used to come from the <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutton_Coldfield_television_transmitter_b623.html" title="Sutton Coldfield television transmitter">Sutton Coldfield transmitter</a>. There is a transmitter for the Bakewell and Matlock areas based at Stanton Moor on 95.3 FM, and a relay of that frequency for the Buxton area on 96 FM. BBC Radio Sheffield is also clearly heard around <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesterfield.html" title="Chesterfield">Chesterfield</a> with a dedicated relay station based in the town. Though in Derbyshire, Chesterfield and its surrounding area is officially catered for by <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_FM_6db8.html" title="Peak FM">Peak FM</a>, Hallam FM or <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Sheffield_490c.html" title="Radio Sheffield">Radio Sheffield</a>. Likewise, the north-western portion of the county taking in Glossop, Chapel, and Whaley Bridge is served by BBC Radio Manchester. In addition, all of BBC Radio Derby"s area is served via its medium wave service on 1116kHz which comes from its transmitting mast at Burnaston, just south of the city, close to the Toyota car plant. The frequency is used to relay the BBC"s Asian Network from 7pm, unless sports commentaries are being broadcast.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_FM_2ee3.html" title="RAM FM">RAM FM</a> broadcasting on 102.8 FM also comes from the Drum Hill transmitter, as well as a local relay on 101.4 FM for the East Midlands regional station, Smooth FM. Stanton Moor also transmits the BBC national radio stations on FM and <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_FM_6db8.html" title="Peak FM">Peak FM</a> on 102 FM (broadcast from Sheepbridge in Chesterfield on 107.4 FM). Buxton also has a television relay with regional programming from the North West and BBC national FM services, and <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Peak_Radio_2890.html" title="High Peak Radio">High Peak Radio</a> on 106.4 FM.</p>
<p>There is no <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_DAB_National_4a37.html" title="BBC DAB National">BBC DAB National</a> or Digital One transmitter in Derbyshire. Services over most of the area come from the nearest BBC DAB transmitters at Sutton Coldfield and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waltham_transmitting_station.html" title="Waltham transmitting station">Waltham</a>, plus Holme Moss in the north. North East Derbyshire and Chesterfield listeners can pick up local and regional DAB services from a transmitter in Sheffield (Tapton Hill). A local Derbyshire DAB license was advertised by OFCOM in January 2007, and is expected to be awarded later this year, with an "on air" date of Spring 2008. With the exception of some sports broadcasts, BBC Radio Derby"s programmes are simulcast via bbc.co.uk/derby.</p>
<p><br />
BBC Radio Derby began broadcasting officially on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_29.html" title="April 29">April 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, though it went on air two months earlier than planned to cover the bankruptcy of the local aero-engine manufacturer <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_plc_18ea.html" title="Rolls-Royce plc">Rolls-Royce</a>. The station's logo was a Rams head in the late 80"s and early 90"s (as many other organisations in Derby have).</p>
<p>Much of the output is speech based, featuring news, sport, weather, travel, interviews, and discussions, mixed in with music and competitions. The station"s primary audience is aimed at listeners aged over 45, though the sports and weekend shows attract a greater age range. After 7pm each weekday, Radio Derby's output comes mainly from Nottingham, until midnight, when it joins BBC Five Live. BBC Radio Derby broadcasts match commentaries from local soccer/football teams; especially the Rams (<a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby_County_bd71.html" title="Derby County">Derby County</a>)and Burton Albion. There is extensive coverage of Derbyshire cricket during the summer.</p>

<p>The current presenters at BBC Radio Derby are:</p>
<p><a name="Dylan_Roys" id="Dylan_Roys"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Dylan Roys">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dylan Roys</span></h3>
<p>Dylan Roys presents the 'Early' Breakfast Show and can be heard across the East Midlands. The show is broadcast from <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Lincolnshire_2413.html" title="BBC Radio Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a> and typically consists of chat and competitions. The show is broadcast from 5am until 6am on BBC Radio Derby (though it continues until 7am in Lincolnshire).</p>
<p><a name="Andy_Whittaker" id="Andy_Whittaker"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Andy Whittaker">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Andy Whittaker</span></h3>
<p>Andy Whittaker presents the station's weekday Breakfast Show - a role he has been in since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. The format of the show usually consists of the morning's news being discussed in detail; often with contributions from listeners. On Friday 9th February 2007, Andy presented his 3,000th Breakfast Show - this was held at a local <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakery.html" title="Bakery">bakery</a> where commemorative products were being produced to mark the occasion. A highlight of the show was the surprise contribution from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Thompson_1b48.html" title="Mark Thompson">Mark Thompson</a>, Director General of the BBC. The show is broadcast from 6am until 9am.</p>
<p>Andy Whittaker also presents a show on Saturday mornings; typically this will consist of several competitions - including the popular 'Find the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone_booth.html" title="Telephone booth">Phone Box</a>', where listeners must get to a public telephone box somewhere in the broadcasting area by following a series of clues. The first person to answer the telephone when its number is dialled wins a prize - provided that they have remembered the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Password.html" title="Password">password</a> given out by Whittaker earlier in the show. The show is broadcast from 9am until midday.</p>
<p><a name="Shane_O.27Connor" id="Shane_O.27Connor"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Shane O'Connor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shane O'Connor</span></h3>
<p>Shane O'Connor joined BBC Radio Derby in about <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>; having previously worked at <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_WM_38c0.html" title="BBC WM">BBC WM</a> as well as other stations in the region. At first, he was the presenter of the Friday afternoon show and Saturday Breakfast Show; however he went on to become the presenter of the weekday Mid-Morning show following John Holmes' return to <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Nottingham_3d76.html" title="BBC Radio Nottingham">BBC Radio Nottingham</a>. One of the more memorable occasions to date was when he made comments regarding <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paula_Radcliffe_7000.html" title="Paula Radcliffe">Paula Radcliffe</a>'s premature retirement from the 2004 Olympic Games. He played <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Orbison_f3fc.html" title="Roy Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s song <i>Crying</i> and dedicated it to the sportswoman. Shortly afterwards, an enraged listener called in to complain about his behaviour - only for him to start an even more fierce argument in retaliation. The event is still occasionally mentioned today - though usually now only for comedic effect. The typical format of the show usually consists of celebrity interviews, expert advice and humour, as well as Outside Broadcasts. The show is broadcast from 9am until midday.</p>
<p>The Saturday Breakfast show is still presented by Shane and consists of music, chat and off-the-wall competitions. The show is broadcast from 6am until 9am.</p>
<p><a name="Aleena_Naylor" id="Aleena_Naylor"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Aleena Naylor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aleena Naylor</span></h3>
<p>Locally-born Aleena presents the weekday Lunchtime Show on BBC Radio Derby. On Mondays, a guest <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chef.html" title="Chef">chef</a> from a local restaurant comes in and cooks his or her speciality dish. An ongoing feature of this show is 'Nosey Naylor' where Aleena goes behind-the-scenes at the area's most well-known organisations. The show is broadcast from midday until 2pm.</p>
<p>Aleena also presents 'Take Two' on Sundays - this takes a look back at some of the highlights from BBC Radio Derby's week. This show is usually pre-recorded a couple of days in advance - so any last-minute 'highlights' often get missed from the show. The show is broadcast from midday until 1pm.</p>
<p><a name="Alex_Trelinski" id="Alex_Trelinski"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Alex Trelinski">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alex Trelinski</span></h3>
<p>Alex Trelinski has been associated with BBC Radio Derby for many years - having joined in the early 1980s and later becoming the station's editor for a time. Alex took over from Paul MacKenzie in January 2006. Paul was one of the station's most popular presenters, and his departure was met with an angry reaction from large numbers of listeners with his exit dominating the letters page of the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby_Evening_Telegraph_3a0c.html" title="Derby Evening Telegraph">Derby Evening Telegraph</a> for the weeks following his departure. The reason behind his departure has never been revealed by him or the station - though many listeners believe that it was not his decision to leave. When Alex was editor, he was also responsible for the axing of <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_McCarthy_%28radio_presenter%29_9bf9.html" title="Dennis McCarthy (radio presenter)">Dennis McCarthy</a>'s show. Dennis was another very popular voice on radio at the time, and again, many listeners were upset at his departure.</p>
<p>Alex presents the station's Afternoon Show - usually comprising of guests from local organisations; as well as TV, film and book reviewers. The show is broadcast from 2pm until 5pm.</p>
<p>He can also be heard on Sunday mornings from 9am until midday. The same two competitions are used every week - 'The Mystery Singer' (where a clip of someone who isn't usually credited as being a singer is played out and listeners have to guess their identity) and 'The Tricky Trivia Trio' (where three questions are asked and the person who gets the most correct answers by the end of the competition is the winner. This competition varies in difficulty - though usually Alex chooses questions which he believes are '<a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>-proof'. In the last set of audience figures (taking in the autumn of 2006), the programme gained the highest figures on the station(according to figures from the joint BBC/Commercial Radio audience measurement system, RAJAR).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Ross Fletcher">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ross Fletcher</span></h3>
<p>Ross presents Drivetime from 5pm until 7pm - an hour looking at the day's news in detail. After 6pm, the format changes to one of a more sporting flavour - on Monday evenings, he is joined by former Derby County player <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_McMinn_eb97.html" title="Ted McMinn">Ted McMinn</a> to discuss the weekend's football action with listeners.</p>
<p>Ross also presents a show on Saturday afternoons from 2pm until 6pm - though this only takes place when the football season is not on - when it is, he can be heard providing commentary for Derby County games. On the occasions that The Rams are not playing on a Saturday, commentary on Burton Albion or local rugby union is provided instead.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Rob Underwood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rob Underwood</span></h3>
<p>Rob Underwood presents The Late Show - another show which is broadcast across the Midlands (from <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Nottingham_3d76.html" title="BBC Radio Nottingham">Nottingham</a>) - though it covers a wider area than that of Dylan Roys' show, as its relayed by three BBC local stations in the western part of the Midlands. This show is broadcast from 9pm until midnight and competitions and chat are usually the main focus. Rob presented the Early Show for a number of years.</p>
<p><a name="Satvinder_Rana" id="Satvinder_Rana"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Satvinder Rana">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Satvinder Rana</span></h3>
<p>Satvinder Rana's show, Aaj Kal, can be heard on Friday evenings from 7pm until 9pm - the content being especially geared towards Derby's Asian community.</p>
<p><a name="Andy_Potter" id="Andy_Potter"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Andy Potter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Andy Potter</span></h3>
<p>Andy Potter presents the Lunchtime Show on Saturdays from midday until 2pm. The show features a sporting theme - typically consisting of interviews with local sports personalities. A competition is also launched - currently this is the 'Colour Code competition' where several song excerpts are played and listeners must work out what colours have been mentioned. The colours can either be taken from the Artist's name; or from the song title itself.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoons, Andy presents <i>Music for Grown-ups</i>; where songs from (typically) the 1960s-1990s are played, along with personality interviews with musicians from that era. This show can be heard from 1pm until 4pm.</p>
<p>Andy can also be heard <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporter.html" title="Reporter">reporting</a> from the station's radio car during the week - and acts as a stand-in presenter for the Afternoon Show, and other programmes. He also covers local amateur theatre for the station.</p>

<p>Chris Baird (b.<a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>) was the station's second longest-serving presenter - joining in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> (Richard Sykes is first, however he is rarely heard on the station's output nowadays due to commitments with the station's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/bbc_bus/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/bbc_bus/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC Bus</a>). He presented <i>The Greatest Hits Show</i> on Sunday afternoons for sixteen years as of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> - this show concentrated on music from the past; particularly the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>; and many of the <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingles.html" title="Jingles">jingles</a> used on this show were reminiscent of the ones used on <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offshore_radio.html" title="Offshore radio">offshore radio</a> stations of this period. On Sunday 20th August 2006, Chris presented a special version of <i>The Greatest Hits Show</i> to mark forty years of him 'broadcasting in public places' as he described it.</p>
<p>During the morning of Friday, 25th August 2006, it was revealed that Chris was set to leave Radio Derby - his last <i>Greatest Hits Show</i> was broadcast the following Sunday. He is believed to have retired from broadcasting altogether, although it is unknown why this decision was made so suddenly. The format of <i>Greatest Hits</i> was continued when Andy Potter took over with his show.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Derby_5276.html" title="Edit section: Money Mountain">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Money Mountain</span></h2>
<p>Since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, BBC Radio Derby has held its annual 'Money Mountain' event. Nowadays this usually takes place on the second Sunday of October; however it was originally held over the course of the entire weekend, and was presented from a marquee in the station's car park. This idea was abandoned a few years ago and all presenting now takes place inside the station building itself.</p>
<p>The idea of the event is to support local charities with donations from listeners. The day kicks off with 'Dial a <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">Hymn</a>'; where listeners can dedicate hymns to loved ones in exchange for a donation. This is then followed at 9am by an on-air <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction.html" title="Auction">auction</a> which goes on until late in the evening. Lots typically consist of services by local companies (such as car valeting) and unique items (such as signed celebrity photographs, behind-the-scenes tours and home-made products).</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the amount of money raised over the years passed the one million pound mark. The person who pledged the bid to surpass this figure was rewarded with a cut glass trophy. The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> auction took place on October 8th. A final total of £22,200 was pledged by the end of the auction. The final lot was to spend an afternoon with BBC Radio Derby's sports team - this on its own raised over £400. Information about the auction can be read here: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2006/10/04/money_mountain_2006_latest_feature.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2006/10/04/money_mountain_2006_latest_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
