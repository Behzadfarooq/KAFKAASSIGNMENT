<p>'The new set was smaller then previous and square in design, initially using a projected image of a fictional newsroom as a background; the newsroom shown did not actually exist.' is untrue. When I did a tour of Telly Centre back in 2002 or so (I worked for the Corporation's Internet Services department in Kingswood Warren for some years; we organised a tour as we realised most of us had never been), we were told that the background image was captured by a camera mounted on a stairwell looking across the newsroom, and that one half of the screen was a mirror-image of the other on a delay. Certainly we got close to the camera's mount point during the tour. -- dickon@fluff.org</p>
<p>The part of the article you have quoted is regarding the set used between 2003 and 2006. The set you are talking about the set previous to that, used from 1999 to 2003.

<p>Have to query this... Whilst CNN claims '4000 news professionals' I find it hard to believe that they are all contributing to the CNN news product. A lot of those probably work in sales/advertising/marketing/legal, etc. The BBC has seperate depts. for this.</p>
<p>Think it needs to be made clear that whilst "BBC News" as an entity might employ 'x' number of people, the overall product is contributed to by countless other parts of the BBC, such as BBC Radio. For instance, would you include the staff of the BBC World Service in the "BBC News" staff? Technically, no, because they aren't part of BBC News, but they do contribute to news broadcasts very frequently. In terms of the number of BBC journalists that BBC News as a whole uses, I imagine it is probably more than quadruple that of CNN - think of the number of BBC radio stations (well over 50, each with dedicated journalists), BBC online, BBC regional TV in the UK, BBC TV news, BBC current affairs programmes (Panorama, etc.)</p>
<p>This perhaps should be made clear in the article.</p>

<p>I have now created two categories, one for current BBC News readers and journalists and the other for former news readers and journalists. Links to those can be found in the see also section of the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a> article. I have categorised all current and former news reader and journalist articles into their respective categories now.

<p>By whom was it announced that the Six O'Clock News and BBC News 24 were the most popular of their kinds? The assertion is made in the passive voice in the lead without attribution. Was it BBC News themselves or someone else?</p>
<p>Also, is 2005 correct for that? The article said "in the current year", which might have already dated. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 23:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed this. It does not really consitute the views of other media. It is the view of the small number of private individuals who write this blog. FWIW, IMHO you can prove anything by selecting a single blog in isolation (...and if one doesnt exist you can set one up! I could set one up to disprove the theory of gravity). In that context IMHO blogs dont really have <b>any</b> place as evidence in an encyclopedia. This one in particular is particularly bad IMHO, it is a badly organised list of rants where the writers even go as far as selecting sentences within reports in isolation from each other (never mind other reports) to try and justify their viewpoint. <a href="../../../i/d/f/User%7EIdf_72bf.html" title="User:Idf">pit-yacker</a> 00:28, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very odd that you should remove that link, considering the impact of blogs in the mainstream media nowadays. Why not provide a link to it - and let the Wikipedia readers make their own mind up?</dd>

<dd>There may be limited merit in including it as an external link. However, I definitely dont think it consitutes the opinion of another media outlet or as a source to back up statements in the main article for the reasons I stated above. You talk about "mainstream media", but how many people actually read this blog? compare that to the readership of the Daily Mail, or the Sun whose (IMHO) opinions definitely have a place in the article as that of another media outlet.<a href="../../../i/d/f/User%7EIdf_72bf.html" title="User:Idf">pit-yacker</a> 14:49, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many blogs are personal that is true but so are books that are written by one author and those are used on wikipedia. It's not the blog that should come under scrutiny but the notability of the person writing it. For the record the bias section seems very small and doesn't go into detail about its sources. There is alot of bias in both sources, the reader is left thinking that the first used for the Israel-Palestinian bit is less biased than the first. In all honesty of all the things I have watched on BBC news, how any organisation can come to the conclusion that the BBC needs be less biased toward Israel is beyond me. It shouts blatent bias.<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupposed_39d6.html" title="User:Supposed">Supposed</a> 23:50, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Are there any notable contributors to this blog? AFAICT from their profiles none of them are. Also again it comes back to my later point of how many people actually ever view this blog?</dd>
<dd>As for extending the article further, while there is some argument for putting more in. A fine line needs to be taken to avoid the article spiralling out of control where we end up on reporting on opposing sides selectively taking particular reports (or even parts of reports) and using it as evidence that the BBC is biased against their cause. As an example, the first thing any extension of the Israel-Palestine conflict should contain is a commentary pointing out that a number of Palestinian groups also claim the BBC is biased towards Isreal. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 00:16, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you have the wrong approach, the important thing is not to report on who thinks the BBC is biased but rather where the BBC have behaved in a biased fashion toward Israel or the Palestinians etc. Plenty of websites report on this, honest reporting is just the Israeli one. The evidence is there for all to see, it should come under rigourous scrutiny and be added to the wikipedia article. These are some important links from honestreporting in regards to this <a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/reports/BBC_In-depth.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/reports/BBC_In-depth.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/critiques/Dishonest_Reporting_-Award-_for_2001.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/critiques/Dishonest_Reporting_-Award-_for_2001.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/The_Dishonest_Reporter_Award_2005.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/The_Dishonest_Reporter_Award_2005.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> We should try to verify theirs and other peoples claims.

<dd>But that raises the question of who you use as your source&#160;;)? What are their motives? I'm sure if we took the approach that you propose, we could put virtually every report the BBC has ever broadcast as being biased towards one side or the other. We would have report 1 on the 6 o' clock news (25/08/06) was biased towards Israel (accoreding to muslim blog), but report 2 (25/08/06) from Lebanon was biased against it (pro-Israel blog), Report 3 (25/08/06) was too pro government, Report 4 (25/08/06) was biased towards the opposition, etc, etc etc. AFAICT this is what most of these sites do. They take single reports (or even parts of reports) out of context to prove an institutional bias that they want to see. You can only really discuss accusations of bias at a high level, not individual (or parts of) reports. Thats where the independent review discussed in the Israel-Palestine Section probably does better than any of the other sources in this section. It actually looks at all of the coverage and not just the parts that suit it. Unfortunately there are very few cases where people actually go to this level of detail, because its very time consuming work, so there is little justification of going to the effort unless you have an axe to grind, in which case, you will want to bend the results to show what you want them too.</dd>
<dd>Given the lack of detailed investigation, we can only really report what each side believes in notable conflicts at a general level. HonestReporting (incidentally not a blog) perhaps belongs in as an example of what the pro-Israeli side says. However, if we are going to put that in we need to a) Discuss HonestReportings motives. b) Put the <b>opinion of Lebanonese/Palestinian groups</b> (which this article currently doesnt.)</dd>
<dd>At that point we come back to the issue at stake of giving the opinions of the Biased BBC Blog. AFAICT this it is <b>not</b> a notable media outlet or organisation by an stretch of the term notable. So why is it warranted a discussion in a section discussing notable media outlets? If we are going to put this blog in, then surely any other blog merits inclusion as a media outlet? <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 15:18, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm glad the history section is being turned into more of...a history! I had a go before but it was reverted and when I did so again it was reverted. The History section has to be about the organisation rather than the BBC News bulletins so I'm glad it is now taking shape like that.

<p>This section is ridiculous and should be deleted. Any media organisation could be accused of bias by both sides of any dissagreement. The references and arguments presented are not encyclopedia worthy, it reads like a list of personal rants that people stopping by the article have felt like adding on the end, maybe with a link to some news story somewhere (if even that) used as supposed "proof" to back up the claim. I also fail to see how the BBC - along with all other news organisations - being expelled from countries with oppressive governments is a valid critisim of the BBC.</p>
<p>Notable events such as the Hutton report deserve a mention but having sub-sections detailing accusations of bias by both sides on pretty much every single recent political event is absurd. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderra_5cc9.html" title="User:Canderra">Canderra</a> 01:51, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The ground is largelly covered in much more neutral wording in the first section. This report is second hand copy of a story reported in the (right wing) <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a>. TBH I really didnt think you could get any more right wing than the Wail but this source makes it look like Pravda. The "anti-Christian" bias refers to hypothetical situation on a non-news satirical comedy programme (<a href="../../../r/o/o/Room_101.html" title="Room 101">Room 101</a>), at this point none of this belongs in BBC News. The "pro-gay" bias refers to the fact that Marr said that the BBC employed a large proportion of gays, not that it was delibrately pro-gay. I have read that university graduates are several times (IIRC something like 10 times) more likely to be openly gay than non-graduates, given that the BBC is likely to employ a large proportion of graduates compared to other companies this is much more likely to be the explanation for the high concentration of gays than a delibrate policy of employing them. As for saying that granting an interview to Osama Bin Laden is evidence of bias, I think this does more to discredit the authors argument than anything the BBC could ever do. As an impartial news reporter a news outlet is duty-bound to report both sides of the story, no matter how distasteful that it is to the right-wing. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 13:50, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we really must have these quotes to "prove" BBC "bias", then from a neutral point of view they really should be seen in the context that they were originally said in. Taking a single paragraph and presenting it alone outside of the context of its original article does not IMHO consitute proof, it merely constitutes a twisting of someone's words to achieve a political end (i.e. proving that the bias the author wishes to see exists). IMHO much of this selective misquoting verges on the dishonest. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 01:18, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. There is a criticism of BBC News section. However, it is so long it needs its own page. Hence why it says see <b>main article</b>.</dd>
<dd>2. See discussion on the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_BBC_83f4.html" title="Criticism of the BBC">Criticism of the BBC</a> page. The reason for this was to remove inconsistencies created by duplicating the same information. The nature of these sections is that they are very volatile (as each passer by adds their, different, opinion) , and inconsistencies and contradcitions between sections quickly appear.</dd>
<dd>3. IMHO, the page without the criticsm of the BBC section is completelty neutral it tells the facts and thats it. With that section it is heavily POV. It consists of a list of axe grindings from various "passers-by". Standard-fare seems to me to be cherry-picked quotes from heavily biased newspaper leaders, partial quotes taken out of context and misquotes or misrepresentations of what a BBC correspondent actually said.</dd>

<dd>You say they're axe-grinders, but why not simply call them critics? A page about BBC News without criticism is POV, because it's a heavily criticized organization. By all means expand on these points on the other page, but you can't move them off here entirely. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 12:05, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I call it "axe-grindings" because the nature of this section is that there are often contradictory comments within the same sections. Comments appear on every conceivable issue and most of these allegations are very poorly researched and come from organisations with various vested interests in proving bias on a particular subject. For example, the anti-US quote you removed was the later added full context of a partial quote that had previously been added. In its full context the quote was <b>absolutely meaningless</b> however one seemingly innocous sentence in the middle when taken out of context was used to portray the BBC as admitting it was biased against the US.</dd>
<dd>If the criticsm sections could be done sensibly I would have prefered it to be on the BBC/BBC News page. However, the problem is it isnt, as I said on the Criticsms of the BBC, page I fear that real valid criticsms are lost amongst the noise of various conspiracy theories supported by the flimsiest of evidence, cherry picked and highly biased newspaper leaders (as I said in the other article, how hard would it be to find a leader saying the opp, in which case the opinions section <b>IS</b> POV), or a single sentence in a single report, even before you consider the reporting as a whole.</dd>
<dd>The problem with the criticism section is that previously it appeared on both BBC News and BBC pages, it now appears on BBC News and Criticsm of the BBC, both pages contain much the same content, the problem is the nature of these sections is that they very quickly become inconsistent and contradictory because various "passers-by" with an axe to grind just add to or edit the one page. If Wikipedia is to be a record of fact rather than a forum listing various rants (with those that disagree with the last poster removed) it is eminently sensible there is just <b>one</b> page containing this.</dd>

<dd>I take your point about inconsistency, but even so, the BBC News page can't be devoid of criticism.

<p>All these 'points of view' are basically of opposing political spectrums who resent the BBC pointing out their short comings. The Hutton enquiry should be mentioned but other than that I think the whole section should be deleted or drastically rewritten. It is not suprising that people who work in political journalism have political opinions however unless there is evidence that these people have directly influenced coverage with their opinions I dont see what relevance it has. This section is entirely founded on some very shakey references such as a KGB defector, a journalist for a pro-israeli newspaper, a journalist for the Times and someone who works for CNN. Thats hardly reliable so it should be deleted or moved to be with the rest of the rubbish on the criticism page. Spacemurkin82 00:29, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
