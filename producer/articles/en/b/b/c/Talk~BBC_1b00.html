<p>BBC was very popular in India till recently when cable T.V. revolution snatched a major chunk of audience and BBc too was reluctant to play an agressive role here.Mark Tully (BBC correspondent for India)is a household name here.However BBc gave up the territory after allegation of propagandism .It was charged with creating false news in indian context.The News story of Kashmir was concocted with many false video clippings which were actually footage of azarbaizan and Afghanistan,for which they apologised too.However people still refer to BBC in india for international news items.<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">Holywarrior</a> 15:28, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that there are quite a few people on this discussion page who seem somewhat "unclear" as to the direction of the BBC's suppossed bias. The bias does not in most cases come from both sides: it is almost exclusively pro-Palestine, anti-Israel.</p>

<p>The BBC lets itself down badly, broadcasting more from Israelis - and choosing much more skilled presenters from the Israeli side. Many/most? Palestinian spokesmen sound as if they were dragged in off the street to speak to the microphone. There are fluent English-speakers capable of speaking from a Palestinian point of view, they're rarely called (and as best I can tell, face more aggressive questioning than do Israeli spokesmen). The BBC also concentrates much more on cases where Israelis are killed than on cases where Palestinians are killed. The concealing of the Balen report is a mystery ..... but there's been a report published on this subject, and they're aware of this imbalance. And they're well aware of failing to cover some of the wider issues, such as the ethnic cleansing going on (which they never describe in those words!). <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">PalestineRemembered</a> 23:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Following comments reveieved <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Automated_e97b.html#BBC" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Automated">here</a> I've made a number of changes to the article, mostly minor. The major changes are the placing of a number of {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags which, though unsightly, should help us to get the references sorted out. I'll try and do as many references as I can myself, though the help of those who originally made the comments would be greatly appreciated. The other major changes are removal of the conditions for license fees in the introduction (as it made for a very difficult to follow sentence and wasn't really necessary information for an introductory sentence) and the deletion of the introductory paragraph to the services section which was mostly just repetition of information listed elsewhere. What wasn't redundant was moved to a miscellaneous sub-section, which now looks a little light and could do with some additions (I'm sure there must be other eclectic services the BBC provides). As things stand I'm also leaning towards removing the unions section, given that union coverage and membership is seldom mentioned in similar articles, though if I'm missing something let me know. It'd also be a great help if others could have a look at the comments listed above and set about correcting anything they can. Oh, and finally, would anyone object to me changing the current inline links to footnotes? --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 05:52, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, IMHO the same is true for all of the "Critism of the BBC" article, which IMHO should be deleted. The article is untidy, repeats the same themes over and over (i.e. Side A says the BBC is biased towards side B; Side B says that the BBC is biased towards side A.), and generally just seems to be a place for ill conceived beeb bashing based on one news report or comment from particular groups with their own agenda. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">User:Pit-yacker</a> 00:33, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it really depends on the context. When describing an academic theory (or the academic who came up with it), for example, it would seem remiss not to include criticism of the theory (along with any relevant rejoinders from supporters of the theory). There doesn't have to be a separate section, of course, but it's generally easier to follow if it's done that way. When describing entities, like the BBC, it's more difficult to justify, however. I think a good rule of thumb is to leave criticism for concepts and have controversy for things and people. So we could have a criticism section under BBC news coverage or the license fee, but it doesn't really make sense to have a criticism section for the BBC as a whole. Generally people aren't criticising the BBC, they're criticising aspects of the BBC. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 06:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that there is a fairly substantial body of criticism of the BBC, largely accusations of political or cultural bias. It's not unreasonable to note, in an appropriate article if not in the main article, the main points critics make. Clearly a number of these points are not NPOV, but reporting that such criticisms exist _is_ NPOV. For comparison, an article on Hitler may state that he was anti-semitic: he had a POV that was clearly not neutral, but reporting that he and other people held such views is entirely NPOV. Wikipedia must be NPOV, but reporting others' POVs is quite consistent with this. A reasonable approach is surely to note in the main article that people have criticised the BBC, and give them a link to the relevant article, should they wish to click it. ( I don't feel that it's enough to include the link in the "BBC-related articles" list, because (1) as I noted above, a more-than-sporadic corpus of such criticisms exists, and (2) we don't do this in other articles where the subject has been criticised, and should be consistent. ) <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A few paragraphs going over the license fee issue, perceived biases (but please god don't let it turn into another Isreal/Palestine nightmare, there's much more to the BBC's new reporting than just Israel), criticisms of content (here we could incorporate some of the new addition, albeit properly sourced, as well as older controversies (going back to Monty Python and perhaps further) and other various criticisms of BBC programming) and possibly criticisms of the organisation and beaurocracy of the Beeb (off the top of my head <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Birt_d728.html" title="John Birt">John Birt</a> drew a lot of flack for his managerial style). The whole <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kelly_57b7.html" title="David Kelly">David Kelly</a> fiasco should probably also be included somewhere. All criticisms should be carefully sourced, of course, and directly attributed to individuals or groups as far as possible so as to <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">avoid weasel words</a>, but there'll probably be enough articles in the major UK press to cover it. The recent Royal Charter review would also be a valuable resource, since a large number of outside parties gave testimony which is recorded on government websites.</dd>
<dd>I'd be happy to do a lot of the legwork, but would really appreciate assistance in deciding on what to include and digging up sources.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 03:04, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>IMHO:
<ul>
<li>The licence fee issue really belongs on the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_licence.html" title="Television licence">television licence</a> page (i.e the main one) most of the criticisms of the licence fee are applicable to all countries that have a licence fee. Both the main one and the UK TV Licence article are very weak on dicussing the pros and cons of the licence fee and the alternatives. I may get around to that, as i have been doing quite a bit on the rest of the page.</li>
<li>I think that some of the issues raised in the current section might be better discussed in articles about the thing they are criticisied. E.g. Jermey Vine Show. Although even then I think it is necessary to avoid articles turning into a one sided Points of View post bag. e.g. Although there were several tens of thousands of complaints about Jerry Springer the Opera, these over-whelmingly came from a well organised campaign that made the complaints before they even saw the show. On the other side, IIRC, there was a good number that were pleased that the BBC had dared to show something so controversial.</li>

<dd>pit-yacker, regarding your comments above I can't say I disagree with any of them, with the slight caveat that certain high profile controversial shows may warrant a brief mention (though this could come under the "content the BBC should or shouldn't be producing" clause). I think, then, we've got a good framework to operate under: criticism of the organisation and management structure (bureaucracy, money wasting), criticism of attitude and role (expansionism, some license fee criticisms (as they relate to the BBC's market position) would also be relevant here) and criticsm of content (what should or shouldn't be produced and how well the BBC lives up to its ideals). For the first part, ex-employees and industry media would be the best sources, for the second the charter review documentation should contain most of the criticisms of competitors and for the third I guess the mainstream press would be the best source. If you're in agreement we can go ahead and start digging. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 02:27, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is outrageous that there is no mention of criticism or allegations of bias on the main BBC page. Even if the allegations are usually about one particular outlet they still deserve a *mention*, or at the very least a *link* to any controversy. The allegations aren't just about BBC News anyway, they stretch into documentary programs like Panorama and the general multicultural tone of the whole institution. In light of the recent leak I am adding in a new section. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChild_of_Albion_a4a0.html" title="User:Child of Albion">Child of Albion</a> 22:52, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have delibrately avoided doing anything on this topic as (besides being a lot of very hard work to do it properly), is, if not done correctly, a poison challice that causes the article to spin out of control into personal axe grindings. AFAICT, the latest attempt, although much better in that it doesnt resemble the Points of View Mailbag or a pile of unsourced "some say..., others say...." suffers from many of the same issues as previous attempts. AFAICT it broadly divides into two sections.
<ul>
<li>"Accusations of Political Correctness", which debatebly should be included in criticisms on the main page. IMHO probably in the context of a wider discussion of how well the BBC serves different sections of the population. No doubt there may need to be a discussion that the BBC doesnt serve some minorities well enough ;).</li>
<li>"Criticsms of BBC News": A very one sided and (right wing) point of view commentary. All we need now is the arrival of the Palestine/Israel section (rolls-eyes). I proposed that criticsms of BBC News was kept in a strongly regulated section in BBC News for a good reason. The reason being that the back and forth "reports of bias" from either side on every conceivable issue from the colour of Tony Blair's tie to "Anti-Americanism" and back again very quickly take over the article. They make it look like that is the only criticism of the BBC is a pile of ramblings from either side of each argument both accusing the BBC of bias in the opposite direction. I still maintain that the main article should discuss issues such as how well the BBC serves the population, allegations of waste, etc. AFAICT the likes of Panorama <b>are</b> BBC News productions, so it still stands these belong in BBC News.<a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 00:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I have to disagree to both your points. The first is that just because a lot of people post unsourced "mailbag" type views in here, doesn't mean the whole section should be deleted. It is quite right for editors to remove unsourced arguments, but to ignore genuine sourced complaints from acceptable sources would amount to censorship.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, unless the sourced criticism is criticising BBC News specifically, then it should remain on the main BBC page. Most of the allegations I've read complain about what they see as a cultural, institutional bias throughout the BBC that leads to bias. In that case the criticism deserves to be in the article about the institution. Also, many people wanting to read about allegations of bias will goto the BBC article and look for a criticism or bias section - I know that's what I do when I read about most newspapers, journalists, historians, media companies etc. Finally, at current, yes, the only inclusions have been from what are generally considered right-wing sources but if people wish to include criticism from left-wing sources then they are quite welcome to, as long as it is properly cited. It would be unfair to remove sourced criticism just because one perceives it is "right wing" and there is not enough "left wing" to balance it. Besides, the right-wing/left-wing thing is not even considered to be a very good description of the political spectrum by many, so it isn't fair to use this as a concept to "balance both sides." <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChild_of_Albion_a4a0.html" title="User:Child of Albion">Child of Albion</a> 16:29, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
And the Israel/Palestine section arrives! For now (until a few days time when this all needs seriously pruning) I have put all criticisms in a "Criticisms of the BBC" section.I have also tried to reorganise it slightly, as IMHO allegations of being overly "political correct" (a much abused term IMHO) are different to allegations of bias.</p>
<p>I have also added important context about the "Room 101 meeting". I think it is important that the discussion was hypothetical and the controversial (Jewish) comedian discussed (who is most famous for a character (Ali G) that parodies asian youths who like to think they are "black gangsters") (a) included articles from his own religion (Its also telling that <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Yentob_6492.html" title="Alan Yentob">Alan Yentob</a> (Jewish), was at the meeting and agreed to articles of the Jewish religion to go in) (b) It was a jew including muslim articles - I'm guessing that the symbology of a Jewish man destroying an article that is sacred to muslims would also be high in the minds of BBC Managers, as something, with no exageration, might aggrevate the current situation in the UK and around the world. Putting everything in context, at this point, I think a bit of "licence" has been used by the author (that even the Mail didnt use - even the introduction is subtly different) when saying the BBC was more concerned about offending muslims than Christians. There is a very big difference about being "concerned about offending Muslims" than being "more concerned about offending Muslims than Christians", the former saying that the context presented lead to a situation were muslims were likely to be offended, and that muslims are more easily offended than Christians (or Jews), which AFAICT is generally the perceived wisdom. The latter, IMHO, tries to isolate the BBC as being anti-Christian, as it ignores the Jewish element of the story.<a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 10:42, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't work for the BBC, although I have some really good mates that do/have. 159 is not secret or 'hidden', it's just denied the oxygen of publicity. The information is available on Ceefax, on LEfax, on BBCi, on bbc.co.uk, in Ariel and on Gateway. But, since the information is meant for staff, there is no need to advertise it to the public. The information is rarely updated because the general threat to the BBC is low anyway (although news of fires and floods have appeared there, I think). The general threat to the BBC is low because it makes no sense for a terrorist group to silence a news provider - thus silencing an outlet for themselves. 159 stems from the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Irish_Republican_Army_d939.html" title="Real Irish Republican Army">'Real' IRA</a> attack on Television Centre - considered by many to have been completely counterproductive.

In the research period, it appears from the most commonly used data (provided by the Israeli Government and by the human rights group B'Tselem) that the death of an Israeli killed by the Palestinian side was more likely to be reported by the BBC than the death of a Palestinian killed by the Israeli side. In the relevant period, the researchers found that there were some 20/23 Israeli fatalities and 98 Palestinian fatalities. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">PalestineRemembered</a> 23:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reference given for the statement that the BBC is the "largest broadcasting corporation in the world" "with a budget of £4 billion" is from a book published in 1996.</p>

<p>If I'm reading the financial statements correctly, the 2004–2005 Financial Review referenced in the article lists the BBC's income as about £4.4 billion (US$8.6 billion) for the year ended March 2005, with an operating loss of £188 million (US$368 million). (See <a href="http://www.bbcgovernors.co.uk/annreport/report05/BBC_94-135.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bbcgovernors.co.uk/annreport/report05/BBC_94-135.pdf" rel="nofollow">BBC Financial Review</a>.)</p>

<p>The fact that the BBC cannot compete with these "mega-media co-ops" is sheer nonsense. The BBC world service, alone, has- by far- more listeners than the largest media company in America.</p>

<dd>Two key things that you've left out: we are talking about <i>TV &amp; radio broadcasting</i> here not all the kinds of media that media conglomerates operate or create (e.g. music publishing, book publishing, newspapers, cinema, outdoor advertising, advertising agencies, cable systems, video games etc etc in addition to non-media assets such as theme parks, hotels, residential housing, cruise ships (or many more in the case of GE, which is not primarily a media company). Also, "largest broadcaster" is not necessarily measured by revenue or profit - to measure influence / popularity, its better to measure by audience or audience reach; you may also want to measure broadcasting output or broadcasting staff numbers. I agree with you that the current statement in the article is questionable and likely out of date, but the sources you provide haven't disproven the statement <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:32, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried pulling broadcasting expenditure numbers (as BBC is a public service operator and also derives its revenues from what is essentially government taxation which presets the bulk of BBC income over a multi-year period (the level of which is a major political issue in the UK), revenues/profit figures aren't good comparisons) for some commercial companies as comparisons to the BBC operating budget - employee figures for commercial companies tend to be harder to find</p>

<li>RTL (Bertelsmann tv/radio; claims to be "largest broadcaster in Europe") - does not break out expenditures for broadcasting segment (2005 revenues = ~$6.7bn); about 8,970 employees<a href="http://www.investis.com/reports/btg_ar_2005_en/report.php?type=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.investis.com/reports/btg_ar_2005_en/report.php?type=0" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>

<p>These are the staffing figures we would ideally have, but the BBC is clearly in the class of Disney and Time Warner and RTL (NBC figures are too unclear) as broadcasting spender <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:14, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I find this claim that the BBC is 'largest broadcasting corporation in the world' to be a bit questionable, especially since it's very difficult, if not unfair, to compare it to comercial broadcasting organisations. Also, different broadcasting companies can be constructed in very different ways. Networks in the USA are based on local 'affiliates' that broadcast a mix of national feeds and local programming/news, but all under the main network (i.e. NBC) name. So one would also need to consider all of that additional expense and employees operating under the NBC (or other network) name to compare it to the BBC. There are &gt;200 different 'NBC' TV stations around the US almost all of which will feature locally produced programs (at the very least morning, noon, evening and night local news broadcasts). Many of those local affiliates are owned by third parties, but NBC Universal also owns a portfolio of about ~25 such stations. Also, don't forget about subsidiary operations too since the same 'company' that owns NBC also owns Universal Studios and all the film/broadcast productions that go with it. The BBC is fantastic, but I don't know that one could realistically proove this statement (nor does it really matter anyway?) --<a href="../../../n/h/a/User%7ENhartman_5820.html" title="User:Nhartman">Nhartman</a> 09:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If we took it by audiences, and include radio, which is after all part of broadcasting, the BBC would come out biggest - for example, BBC World Service alone claims 163 million regular listeners, far in advance of even the largest US networks.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The other groups mentioned like CBS, Disney, etc, all make most of their money from movies and other enterprises and Bertlesman the European conglomerate is primarily a publishing empire. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 11:23, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Andrew Marr quote about BBC bias comes from an article in the Daily Mail about an alleged "impartiality summit" at the corporation which no one but the Mail seems to believe actually took place. Until someone can find another source backing this up I think we should leave it out. <a href="../../../m/f/l/User%7EMFlet1_ae75.html" title="User:MFlet1">MFlet1</a> 23:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Originally there was a reference to the Mail article (a slighlty more reliable source, but not much). At some stage this appears to have been replaced with an even more right-wing site. Unfortunately, for the BBC the story has spread like Chinese Whispers and the story being reported in the right-wing/Christian fundamentalist press now bares no resemblence to even the story reported by the Mail. The key point as I have pointed out in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECriticism_of_the_BBC_c1f0.html" title="Talk:Criticism of the BBC">Talk:Criticism of the BBC</a>, is taking a closer look at what Marr says, I'm guessing a lot of people missed the real meaning because it was placed in the context of the rest of the article. He says the BBC is a <b>socially</b> liberal organisation (meaning that its employee base is very diverse and it doesnt have a problem with employees who are gay, single mums, foreigners, etc.) being socially liberal is completely different to being politically <b>l</b>iberal or <b>L</b>iberal. It is also entirely different to the BBC projecting such a bias over the air-ways. IMHO the passage about Marr shouldnt be included because the truth is it essentially meaningless in the correct context. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 00:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, although having said that I was wrong to suggest that the impartiality summit was fictional. It did take place, but the way it was reported on the LifeSite website and the inclusion of ludicrous statements such as "BBC executives admitted the corporation is dominated by homosexuals" made it sound as if the whole thing was either the product of a Daily Mail reporter's diseased mind or something that Chris Morris had made up. <a href="../../../m/f/l/User%7EMFlet1_ae75.html" title="User:MFlet1">MFlet1</a> 17:02, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In writing a Wikipedia article about the BBC, it is easy to find ample material for an article on criticism but it is harder to find 'referenceable' positive aspects to illustrate its immense cultural significance. The BBC television and radio are a fundamental part of the fabric of the nation and the cause of much that is good in British society.(We can imagine what British broadcasting would be like without it by watching Sky One.) I hope someone can find some acceptable material to include in the section on cultural signifance. As it is, this section is awful. <a href="../../../j/m/c/User%7EJmcc150_196b.html" title="User:Jmcc150">JMcC</a> 18:41, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The section says three things: the BBC has changed to include more regional and fewer plummy accents (irrelevant), two sentences about cultural impact and then goes on to say that other counties get to see our news. In other words only two sentences describe the immense effect that the BBC has had and continues to have. For example comparison with the BBC used to keep ITV up to the mark. Without the BBC we would have missed not only <i>I Claudius</i> but also <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. Now think about Attenborough, Radio 4, Newsnight, Python, Dennis Potter, <i>Horizon</i> (before it lost its way), <i>Timewatch</i>..... Just count the BBC's entries in <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_Greatest_British_Television_Programmes_9f67.html" title="100 Greatest British Television Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a>. <a href="../../../j/m/c/User%7EJmcc150_196b.html" title="User:Jmcc150">JMcC</a> 08:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The accent thing is not irrelevant. Regional accents used to be considered almost taboo by some people, the BBC's use of more down-to-earth accents and reporters from the regions on the national network has helped to make them more acceptable - and understandable. As for the other things you mention, if you're upset about them being missing then be bold and add them in. It's not like I wrote this section as if it was going to be complete right from the start, this is a wiki after all and nobody's stopping you from improving the section. --<a href="../../../e/a/m/User%7EEamonnca1_2808.html" title="User:Eamonnca1">Eamonnca1</a> 18:32, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
