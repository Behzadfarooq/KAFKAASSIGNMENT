<p>There is a new presentation scheme.</p>
<p>Is this actually relevant at all?</p>
<p>I'm not sure why there needs to be a section on this countdown thing at the top of the hour - as far as I know, it is not some sort of widely-known aspect of the channel or really has any relevance to the content of it whatsoever. Seems really quite a bizarre addition to the article actually. Surely it would be worthwhile getting rid of this and actually putting in something about the sort of programming, that the channel carries rather than what is looks like?</p>
<p>The article on Sky News concentrates on presenters, programming, news coverage, history, etc. not the sort of graphics that the channel uses on-screen. Wikipedia isn't a design school!</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree, though it may seem more in context if more information was added around it, ie if there were more detailed info on presenters, history, programming etc, then having such in-depth detail on the presentation would seem reasonable. There is some merit in mentioning the presentation, however, since the BBC news music is widely recognised and there has also been criticism of the on-screen "clutter" and the rather tasteless aspect of the spinning ribbon headline, as seen on <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grumpy_Old_Men_5116.html" title="Grumpy Old Men">Grumpy Old Men</a>. --<a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoAround_c28d.html" title="User:GoAround">GoAround</a> 07:08, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've shifted the presentation section down below the sections on news programming and presenters. I'll see if I can trim it down slightly. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 20:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have used June 05 stats rather than the more up to date July 05 stats as in July they were more than double the normal amount (1.1% rather than 0.5%), a statistical blip I suspect is due to the 7th July bombings and the 21st July attempted bombings rather than any overall permanent increase in viewership. <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble">MrWeeble</a> 13:02, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but there are a number of issues that keep this article from being a Good Article. Some things to address, as per <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">WP:WIAGA</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>1(c)- <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> guidelines: First, unless the words are proper nouns, only the first word of a heading should be capitalized. Second, there are <i>tons</i> of grammar and punctuation problems in the article. Random examples from throughout the article:
<ul>
<li>"Nicholas Owen, of ITN's ITV Lunchtime News has signed..." (from "News Presenters") is missing a comma.</li>
<li>"It is the only domestic BBC channel transmitted by the BBC itself, all others are handled..." (from the lead) has a comma instead of a semicolon.</li>
<li>"...for the first time in two years moved ahead..." (from the lead) also needs a comma.</li>
<li>"Formerly the channel had been controlled by an editor - Mark Popescu - similar to the main BBC One news bulletins but further changes were made including the replacement of single editors for the One O'Clock and Six O'Clock News with a single daytime editor." (from "Background") is a run-on sentence missing at least two commas.</li>
<li>"Since the October 1999 relaunch an important element..." (from "Countdown"), again, needs a comma.</li>
<li>"To direct a viewers attention to breaking news, a new breaking news sting was introduced which showed a globe briefly appear on screen." (from "Breaking News") is a run-on and is missing an apostrophe in "viewers".</li>
<li>"Then controller of BBC television news, Tim Orchard stated that the message with the new style was simple: "...you still have the TV news programmes from the BBC that you know and trust at set times of the day but it is happening all the time on this channel." (from "General") needs a hyphen after "then", needs a comma after "Orchard", and has an unsourced statement... which leads me to:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2- verifiability: Aside from a series of screencaps, every reference comes from the BBC itself. For a GA or FA, this is absolutely unthinkable. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable sources</a> that comment on the network must be found and cited. In addition, many important statements- including, but not limited to, the first sentence of "Background", all of "General" (I'm amazed that an uncited statement such as "a car crash in a shower" can even exist in an article), and the two sentences in the "Awards" section- are completely unsourced.</li>
<li>6- images: Every picture in the article is fair use; seven fair use photos and zero free use photos just doesn't sit well with me. This criterion is not as important as those mentioned above, but this issue should still be dealt with if possible.</li>

<dd>Could I just say that if we're looking for images the public associate with BBC News 24 then fair use images are likely the best we can get, especially with copywritten idents and logos. <a href="../../../r/h/b/User%7ERHB_fa8a.html" title="User:RHB">RHB</a> 21:38, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree, which is why I noted that it's not necessary to change anything so as to meet this criterion. However, I think the article would be a bit better if there <i>were</i> one or two free use images in the place of fair use ones (though I don't have a ton of ideas about what a free use image could be). I'm sorry if my rationale made it seem as if this was a big problem, because it's not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:21, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No problem, thanks for your help. I had a look on Flickr and was wondering if images from there would be any good. Most are photos of television sets which aren't much good, but there was one of News 24 available on a 3G mobile phone and another of it available on certain bus services. I'm not sure what copyright status these would have though. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 20:43, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is BBC News 24 available outside the UK, even in Ireland or nearby areas in northwestern continental Europe?</p>
<p>On another aspect, is their first studio (from 1997-1998) currently occupied by BBC World? Looking closely at it, it somehow resembles the present World studio.</p>

<dl>
<dd>News 24 is available in Northern Ireland as this is part of the UK but not the Republic of Ireland. Coverage is meant to be limited to the UK only but I believe it is possible to pick up the signal elsewhere via satellite in a similar way to viewers receiving BBC World in the UK. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 15:45, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, yes, the current studio that BBC World occupies is where News 24 first started in. BBC World had been based nearby but in a much smaller space. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 19:43, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I asked the first question because I was able to see BBC1 and 2 outside the UK and I know that those 2 channels are available in Ireland. So what makes BBC1 and 2 available in areas nearby the UK but not News 24? And is News 24 currently in the same newsroom as BBC World (but different part of it) or in a different floor/room in Television Centre? --58.69.63.199 03:39, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not going to officialy review this for GA, but the number and purpose of the images worries me. I feel that Image:BBC News 24 Tonight.png, for instance, is superfluous. I don't know anything or understand the tone or content of the show as a result of this logo. I feel that it's simply there to make a block of text look prettier.</p>
<p>I've gone through most of the images and added fair use ratioanles (one of the reasons why <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a> failed today). I have also expanded the source on most, but not all. The source of the <i>file</i> might be some website, and it is certainly courteous to acknowledge their work capturing the image, but... they are not the final, true source... which is the BBC. Image description pages should describe what the image is, who the copyright holder is, and have detailed FURs.</p>
<p>I'd really like to see The Lambert Report addressed more fully with regard to News 24. Perhaps creating a stub article? I appreciate that there is an external link, but, in terms of Wikipedia, I don't know what it is, why it was set up, who Lambert is...</p>
<p>The section on the 'countdown' sequence is good, since it has become a notable element of the station. Perhaps this could be develop to address its cultural impact, such as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bailey_b846.html" title="Bill Bailey">Bill Bailey</a>'s routine. I'm sure there's even a dance mix somewhere! I wonder if an audio sample would be useful, perhaps of the last 10 seconds...?</p>
<p>Finally, I'd much prefer the cite templates to be utilised.</p>
<p>Good work so far. Before submitting articles to GA or FA, I'd really suggest that you use the <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">peer review</a> process. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 11:40, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point about the images. I had added them to illustrate the sections they related to; footage of the countdown for the countdown section, etc. I had also recently started going through the images I have uploaded and giving proper fair use rationales by developing what I had already entered. Once more work has been done, it would indeed be best to submit the article for a peer review. Also I would like to quickly thank everyone else who has helped to get this article to the good state it is now. It is much better than a year ago.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 22:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've reviewed the article and IMO it certainly suitable for GA and as such I've passed it. You might want to consider improving small things like the uncited portion in Background where the News International claim about critiscism is made as they lack citations but overall I think it meets the criteria.<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHairRef_3d4b.html" title="User:BigHairRef">BigHairRef</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHairRef_5c72.html" title="User talk:BigHairRef">Talk</a> 19:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Under News programming it says Other programming produced solely by News 24 includes the Five O'Clock News with Huw Edwards (with Film24 at 17:45 Fridays), News 24 Tonight (the hour from 19:00), Sportsday (at 18:30), and World Business Report.</p>
<p>Isn't World Business Report made by the BBC World team and broadcast on News 24 overnight.My main reason for thinking WBR is a BBC World program shown on N24 is up to recently you could see the outline of the BBC World DOG Tower appearing behind the N24 clock tower, where as in the news bulletins Simulcasts you never saw the world tower appearing behind the N24 tower. I'm lead to believe it went the other way around. E-flah 12:43, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not vandalising any links. I removed the mention of the other channels because BBC News 24 and BBC World share resources and act effectively as one channel overnight (in the UK). While the entire BBC family of domestic channels could be included, for these two channels it does not count.
