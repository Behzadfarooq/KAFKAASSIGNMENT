<p>I personally find it highly amusing that they bothered to resume the Mickey Mouse cartoon of 1939 when they resumed transmission in 1946 as few would even remember what had last been shown when they went off air seven years previous! "Only in the UK..."</p>

<dd>It wasn't so much for the benefit of the viewers - it was really symbolic, showing that this was still the same BBC Television Service, picking up and continuing as before. There was some debate internally about the move, particularly as it was felt that the particular cartoon was more dated than others (it apparently spoofed some movie stars who had since fallen out of popular view), but it was felt important, for the morale as much as anything else, to provide a stubborn sense of continuity to what had gone before. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 21:31, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

At 10 a.m. instructions came to close down the service by noon. The planned schedule was for an outside broadcast from the Radiolympia exhibition (which itself was closed down early at 12.30 p.m.) between 11 a.m. and noon, which overran until 12.05, then they showed the unscheduled <i>Mickey's Gala Premiere</i> until 12.13, then they did "sound and vision test signals" followed by announcements by Fay Cavendish; the station didn't close down until 12.35 (details from "PasB" (Programmes as Broadcast) for 1.9.39). On the restart in 1946, the Mickey Mouse cartoon wasn't shown until about 20 minutes after transmissions restarted. The myth of the abrupt shutdown and restarting in the same place appears to originate in a 1981 tv documentary which has been picked up and repeated in several other documentaries since. - <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 15:47, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've taken it out, as per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. The closure during a cartoon is supported by such an overwhelming number of reliable sources (including a BBC One documentary only a few weeks ago) that its falsity is irrelevant. It is not Wikipedia's place to adjudicate between conflicting claims and so even though the story is known to be untrue, it can only come down to the word of one reliable source against the words of numerous other reliable sources. We therefore have three choices: (1) amend the policy on Verifiability, (2) mention the story about the service being cut during a cartoon as the mainstream view, and then add the true story as an alternative theory, or (3) cut out the offending material altogether. For the time being, I have done the latter. --80.0.119.25 15:05, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasn't actually voting on "<a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_ONE_1e05.html" title="BBC ONE">BBC ONE</a>", though it's true I do think this all-capitalised style is a bit of an affectation. It's just a style thing the BBC have currently got, and I have no doubt that sometime within the next 10 years they'll rebrand their channels again to a more sensible BBC One or BBC 1. To my mind the numeric form of channel name seems more natural, but that's probably because I can remember when they first started having two channels, and they've used a digit for all except the last few years!&#160;:) I think if we were having a vote on channel names I'd settle for <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One</a> or <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_1_cdb2.html" title="BBC 1">BBC 1</a>, but ONE makes no sense as it doesn't represent an acronym.

<p>Use of capitalisation is in many cases an important feature in defining corporate or name identity. For example, there is no such organisation as the True Catholic Church but there is an entity called the true Catholic Church, its lower cap t indicating an important factual analysis of itself, that it believes it is the true Catholic Church, not a separate catholic church with the word true being given equality in its title. BBC ONE, not BBC one or BBC One is the name of the station formerly BBC1. Writing BBC One is as wrong as writing United states of america or Coca cola. Its name is unambiguously BBC ONE and nothing else. If you are using the formal name of an organisation, you should use its capitalisation. In Ireland, for Nato (which is generally written as such in Europe) is the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. NATO is a different national organisation associated with tenants. Proportional Representation is a formal voting system, proportional representation is a broad collection of electoral systems who share principles of proportionality. SimilarlyNatWest is universally recognised as what used to be called the National Westminister Bank, Natwest is unrecognisable to most. Organisations use capitalisation to create a brand identity behind a word. If wikipedia is referring to that brand, it should recognise that fact, and not treat a brand identity which carries with it a recognition factor as merely a word. If Colgate calls itself that, we shoudn't decide that we for our own reasons want to call it cOLGATE. If Britain's main TV station calls itself, BBC ONE that is what we should call it, just as we should write about the true Catholic Church in articles, etc. Encyclopædias are based on reality, not fictionalising brand names to push an agenda. The suggestion that use of capitals is just a presentation choice is patiently absurd. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 20:51, 15 Oct 2003 (UTC) <i>(Written originally on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions</a> - moved here by Angela.)</i></p>

<dd>I have to disagree. Many organizations like to write themselves in all capitals. This is not usually followed by others if it's not an acronym.

<dd>The BBC's own documentation frequently writes "BBC One" (the Annual Report does so consistently); its Teletext services write "BBC1". No-one is disputing what the channel <b>calls</b> itself (it would be wrong, for instance, to call it "BBC Channel One") -- only whether we need slavishly to follow every typographical change to its on-screen logo.

<b>There is a difference between text in a logo and body text.</b></p>
<p>There is very often a difference between how an entity's name is written in a logo and how it appears in body text. There are many examples of this. Amnesty International is written as such, although its logo is in lowercase (except, oddly, in Germany, where poor understanding of capitalization presumably led to the official term being "amnesty international"!), and in recent years many high-tech companies have used unusual capitalization in their logos; for example the defunct software company Asera had a logo that read "AserA". Many, many company logos are written in uppercase, but you drive a Toyota, not a TOYOTA, drink Pepsi, not PEPSI, and watch a Sony television, not a SONY. Likewise, stylish logos are sometimes in lowercase, but you still have a Vodafone or Orange mobile phone, not vodafone or orange. And although its logo is written as "ebaY" the online aution house is written "eBay" in text.</p>
<p>BBC One appears as BBC ONE in its logo and usually in headings on BBC websites, where emphasis is required (this appears to be the BBC's house style), but otherwise in body text it is written "BBC One" — which is how it should be written here.</p>
<p>The following official link should clear things up: It contains the logo, headers including the term written in capitals, and body text written as "BBC One": [<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/channels/bbc_one.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/channels/bbc_one.shtml" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>]</p>

<p>I have removed the claim, in the first sentence of the article, that BBC One is the oldest television station in the world. Even if we go back to 1929 when BBC transmitted broadcasts originating from Baird Television, several television stations were already on the air in the United States. The earliest of those began regular broadcasts in May 1928, and continues on the air today as <a href="../../../w/r/g/WRGB_4e7a.html" title="WRGB">WRGB</a>. See the table <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldest_television_station.html" title="Oldest television station">Oldest television station</a>. While it is true that WRGB's predecessor W2XB was off the air for a few years in the 1930s, during the transition from mechanical broadcasting to electronic broadcasting, keep in mind that BBC One was also off the air between September 1935 and August 1936 (during that same mechnical/electronic transition period), and from September 1939 to June 1946 during the war. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 19:21, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now the main page says it started as the first high-def service in 1936. That can't be right! I assume the meaning is that the TV station was the first regular TV station to go HD (I don't know if that's true, but it's at least plausible), and that it started -- as a Non-HD service -- in 1936. But that's definitely not what it says. Someone who didn't know better could easily be misled. --70.187.171.21 05:23, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Upon re-reading the article, it becomes clear that I misunderstand the use of high-definition used in the intro to this article and on the main page. The high-definition article does in fact have a section that points out this different usage of "high-definition" I still think the claim, while apparently technically true, is misleading because it is likely to be misunderstood to mean that in 1936 BBC One launched a digital HDTV broadcast. No, I don't have a good solution at the moment. --70.187.171.21 05:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Early television systems were divided into "low definition" (30 to 120 lines), "medium definition" (120 to 240 lines), and "high definition" (240 lines and above). These categories were articulated in the mid-1930s during the BBC's planning for an all-electronic television service. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 05:44, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The BBC's own phrasing is deliberate when it comes to the first issue: <i>"The world's first regularly scheduled high-definition television service"'</i> <a href="http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/geohistory/first.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/geohistory/first.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://www.ambisonic.net/articles.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ambisonic.net/articles.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://www.earlytelevision.org/pendleton_paper.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.earlytelevision.org/pendleton_paper.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://www.tvwiki.tv/wiki/Television" class="external text" title="http://www.tvwiki.tv/wiki/Television" rel="nofollow">and this source not suitable for Wikipedia</a>. There were earlier services - some via the BBC's own facilities - but only the service 70 years ago this month was both high-definition (240 lines or greater) and regularly-scheduled (ie not test transmissions). Other services were irregular (ie testing) or were lower definition.</p>
<p>What has happened since then is that the term "high definition" has been applied to the competing 1000+ line standards developed since the 1980s. Back in 1936, "high definition" was applied to the services in 240line (the Baird film-intermediate mechanical system) and 405line (the EMI electronic system that was standard in the UK from 1936-39 (interrupted by war) and 1946-1964 (when the 20 year replacement by 625line period began)). Services from Paris - at 441lines - and elsewhere at lines comfortably under 500 - didn't start until after the BBC Television Service had been running for quite some time.</p>
<p>Younger people tend to think of the 1000+ services as being "high definition" because that is the marketing term currently being used for super-high definition. In the article <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting_in_East_Germany_7de6.html" title="Broadcasting in East Germany">Broadcasting in East Germany</a> and related articles, editors chose the term "standard definition" to remove this confusion. This dumbed-down, but understandably so, term is probably what would work here, even though it foresakes historical accuracy. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:34, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BBC One (and Two) have been aviliable in cable systems in Holland for decades. This is because the Television Without Frontiers Directive allows cables systems to repeat terrestrially receivable signals (as the BBC terrestrial channels are from Hoek) as long as no charge is made for them. This is the reason most Dutch people speak English very very well, and also why, unlike a lot of Europe, they use British English words (lift rather then elevator etc).

<dd>There is no problem with using the smaller black version for the article. The BBC's guidelines are based on the logo in any form - colour or size. The policy of Wikipedia is that the logo is only used where it is actually a part of the article and cannot be used anywhere else such as on a userpage, portal, template or category. The black version of the new BBC One logo is fine for use within the article and the BBC would have no problems with it providing it is not used for commercial gain or anything else that would be detrimental to the standing of the BBC or the channel, which of course it would not. The black version is also much better as it is clearer, takes up less space and also looks better within the article infobox. I will now upload it again. Before uploading the grey version again, please either contact me or discuss it here. Hope that makes sense anyway. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 22:38, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You have not provided a reference to back up your POV, and I have. The logo is the same size as all the others. You must NOT edit a corporate logo as it breaks the rules.

<dd>While we need to be careful how we use the logos of organisations and television channels, the guidelines you are referring to above on how not to use the logo are in fact referring to the BBC logo rather than that of BBC One. If you would like to contact the BBC and ask whether using a black version of the BBC One logo is acceptable then we can truly sort out which image is best. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 16:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for providing me with the links on guidelines. However, according to the BBC Media Bank registration page <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/mediabank/ap.cgi?action=ap_download&amp;ap_id=308" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/mediabank/ap.cgi?action=ap_download&amp;ap_id=308" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, content is only made available to registered users who will make use of them on a UK based site. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Wikipedia which bases its servers in the USA. Therefore as far as I can tell, we are unable to use the version of the image from the Media Bank here. I'd welcome you to correct me if I'm wrong. A simple email to the BBC or the Media Bank itself would solve the confusion once and for all otherwise if you'd like to do that perhaps? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 16:25, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
