<p>Significant events should be included in the narative history format that already exists (and has IMO been butchered somewhat by the timeline format). I find a narritive more ecyclopaedic than just a list of dates and events. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a></p>
<p>Playing devil's advocate: what's the difference between a timeline and a narrative that just presents a timeline in prose? I agree the timeline dominates right now, but then again there's a lot of history to include! One advantage of a timeline over a narrative format for a historical section is that it better fits the "factoid" nature of the subject (and the tendency for people to add snippets of information without seeing the bigger picture of the article). Where a narrative is useful is in presenting context, answering the "why" and "how" rather than the "what" and "when". What prompted me to beef up the timeline was the observation that it included a bullet about a particular programme's relaunch (Breakfast), but didn't mention, for example, the launch of BBC2, or colour, or stereo, etc - all much more important historically. What to do? Well, moving the timeline to a separate article would help distinguish between what/when and why/how, but I suspect people will still add what/when paragraphs to the original article when Important Things Happen (like Hutton). <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvaragado_c759.html" title="User:Avaragado">Avaragado</a> 14:37, Apr 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Would it be better if the timeline was moved to a "Timeline of BBC history" article, and a smaller list of significant events created in this article? -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarknew_cf59.html" title="User:Marknew">Marknew</a> 16:48, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It wouldn't <i>necessarily</i> be better; we might end up with needless duplication, or events put in the "wrong" article.

<p>I definitely think we should make a separate Timeline page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BBC Regions List</span></h2>
<p>The edit at 20:51, 19 Jul 2004 (by IP 62.64.209.39) re-organised the list of BBC regions so that the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland regions were once again inserted into the same regions list as BBC South West, BBC East and BBC London, reverting a change that I had made on 8th July.</p>
<p>The edit comment posted by the contributor gave the following reason: "restore order of UK regions (they're just meant to go north to south) and are <b>based around news, not anything else</b>" (emphasis added by me). However, it is not the case that the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland "regions" are "based around news, not anything else", but effectively run their own BBC One and (to a lesser extent) BBC Two services; for example, there are often major schedule variations between BBC One Scotland and the main feed of BBC One.</p>
<p>I believe that it is unfair to place these major production centres in the same league as the smaller English regions, who (for 95% of the time) only organise broadcast scheduled news bulletins and current affairs programming at a set time every day. This was the reason why I made the edit at 12:57, 8 Jul 2004, which highlighted that "Scot, Wales, NI are more significant than the English regions (in schedule control, programming etc.)", believing that the changes that I made more ably reflected this situation. For this reason, I have once again separated the regions of "BBC England" (so to speak) and the "regions" of BBC Scotland, BBC Wales and BBC Northern Ireland. If anyone feels that my argument is flawed and wishes to change it back again, could they please, if possible, post their argument for doing so here first. Thank you. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarknew_cf59.html" title="User:Marknew">Marknew</a> 19:37, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are considered "nations" rather than "regions" by the BBC. So you are quite right not to list them as regions. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonalaw_f5db.html" title="User:Bonalaw">Bonalaw</a> 17:37, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Respect for BBC</span></h2>
<p>The sentence about BBC: "It is frequently heralded as the most widely respected broadcaster in the world." is an opinion not shared by millions and millions of people in the Muslim and Communist worlds. I as an Iranian for instance know that Iranians (70 million people) see BBC's role as very destructive especially in orchestrating the Islamic Revolution of 1978 in Iran. You can find very few people in the whole of the East who trust the news coming from the BBC. So I suggest either omit that sentence or add to it: 'Many other people do not share this opinion'. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMani1_e14b.html" title="User:Mani1">Mani1</a> 16:15, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No it is not.</dd>

<ul>
<li>If I said <i>"The BBBC is really great"</i> - That is an opinion.</li>
<li>If I said <i>"the BBC <b>is</b> the most respected broadcaster in the world"</i> - that is suggesting that it came top in some survey or something and we would have to back it up by giving the statistics.</li>
<li>but by saying <i>"It is frequently heralded as the most widely respected broadcaster in the world."</i> - we are merely reporting the fact the the organization is frequently described as the most respected broadcaster in the world - and that is a fact.</li>

<dd>While I agree, I think it would be a good idea to add something to balance it. Otherwise, maybe we should use the results of a survey about how respected the BBC is instead.</dd>

<li>While I have no problem with BBC, seems POV to me, and if nothing else, non-falsifiable. Remove it, or at the least, tell us which leading community figures and institutions respect BBC as opposed to other networks. Also, what about the BBC do they respect? The organization? The broadcast signal? The on-air talent? The editing? The reporting? The camera work? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeakerK44_ba05.html" title="User:BeakerK44">BeakerK44</a> 16:58, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
