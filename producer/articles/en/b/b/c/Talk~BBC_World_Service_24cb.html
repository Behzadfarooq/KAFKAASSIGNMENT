<p>There's a lot of information about receiving BBCWS in the transmission section. The second paragraph has gotten messy (partly my fault). Perhaps it should be cut down to a simple paragraph about receiving via shortwave. The north america/satellite radio/NPR/domestic material could be moved to a new paragraph. Should the cessation of NA shortwave be moved to history? <a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtatum_db56.html" title="User:Jtatum">Jtatum</a> 21:52, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was stuff in both the History and Transmission sections about interval signals, and it has grown quite a bit lately, so I've moved it into a new section of its own.

<p>Removed "first television service by the World Service" as the BBC had run a television channel as part of the overall World Service in the early 1990s. The service later became BBC World.

<p>I've removed the claim: It became known as the "World Service" in 1988.</p>
<p>I have in front of me the 1986 edition of the World Radio TV Handbook which lists frequencies for the BBC World Service. I'll grant that the book also has a separate section of 'european services' and it's not entirely clear what theis refers to. But nonetheless it's clear that this source that the name BBC World Service was in use prior to 1988 for at least some services. (And my recollection is that was the generally accepted name for the service when I first started listening to it around that time). <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoybadami_2c79.html" title="User:Roybadami">Roy Badami</a> 23:26, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>At one time all the BBC's overseas services were known collectively as the "External Services". The term "World Service" referred specifically to the English language service. This changed, and the term External Services was replaced by World Service. I don't know if this change occurred in 1988, but it sounds about right. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarumphy_0f61.html" title="User:Harumphy">Harumphy</a> 09:04, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>-- The BBC World Service states: "The External Services were renamed BBC World Service in 1988" (from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/faq/news/story/2005/08/050810_wsstart.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/faq/news/story/2005/08/050810_wsstart.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/faq/news/story/2005/08/050810_wsstart.shtml</a>) Just thought I'd mention it.

<dd>It really depends on where you are in the world and which language service you listen too, I think some services broadcast in "foreign" most of the time (Hindi, Arabic etc.). - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithgreer_e923.html" title="User:Keithgreer">The<strong>Keith</strong></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Northern_Ireland2.svg_1ced.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c2/Flag_of_Northern_Ireland2.svg/30px-Flag_of_Northern_Ireland2.svg.png" alt="" width="30" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Northern_Ireland2.svg_1ced.html" /></a> 13:14, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That may be so, but I was thinking about total output by the service - so if they broadcast say 12 hours of unique Mandarin programming a day everywhere in the world (covering theoretical transmitters in the PRC, Taiwan and Singapore), the appropriate figure would be "12 hours". The deeper question I was trying to ask I guess was "how many full-time equivelent channels does it produce?" <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatturn_857b.html" title="User:Matturn">matturn</a> 06:47, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>There are a number of examples in the BBC World Service Broadcasts illustrating its remit of following British policy and world view. Currently the BBC World service gives widespread coverage to the those who oppose Iran’s nuclear program, some say this coverage presents a critical slant and not a netural point of view. Under International law, Iran is entitled to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes and is entitled to have its own facilities to do so. At present Iran is exercising a legitimate right by creating facilities for Uranium enrichment. However when the BBC World Service reports on on the issue, this fact is almost never mentioned. This in in contrast to Indian, Chinese, Russian and Arab broadcasters. Others critical of the BBC say that the organisation never mentions the Israeli nuclear weapons program when discussing nuclear proliferation in the context of Iran. However this fact is always mentioned by other news media like Beijing News, Shin Wa, Arab News, The Hindu India.</i></dd>

<p>I've taken it out again. I checked out Newswatch India (which acts as a directory of articles published elsewhere, so in itself does not say anything), but could not find anything making this claim. Perhaps I missed it, but accusations of media bias are in a sensitive area and need proper citations. The editoralising about Iran is neither here or there for this article. The second paragraph is really interesting, but again needs citiations and 'some' and 'others' defining. I am afraid that without this it just comes over as POV bluster. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 20:45, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, If you took the trouble to read my comment, the problem is the lack of citations. If I got the web site wrong (and again read the comment: the site looked good, but the material did not seem to be there), then put a proper link in. Same with the other stuff: what are your sources? You seem very keen on this, so what is the problem with including them?

<dd>There are a number of examples in the BBC World Service Broadcasts illustrating its remit of following British policy and world view. The widely respected third world Indian Newswatch media monitoring services, reporting on the BBC coverage said, that their research shows that the BBC World service gives widespread coverage to the those who oppose Iran’s nuclear program. Newswatch and others independent media monitoring services also say this coverage presents a critical slant, and not a netural point of view. The Iranian point of view, according to critics, is not mentioned.</dd>

<dd>With increased competition from television (stations like Al Jazeera and Al Arabya) and an increasing number of radio news broadcasters offering information from different points of view, the BBC has lost listeners in some areas. In the Middle East some criticise the BBC as being too close to British Policy. Others disagree, however, saying it is much fairer than its competitors. In India the BBC is regarded by some as less credible than local broadcasters but still has large audiences, particularly across the north of the country.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<ul>
<li>"The BBC plans to scrap its hugely popular Polish service in order to enhance funding to its Middle Eastern service."</li>
<li>"This was in contrast to the BBC’s domestic service broadcasts to British viewers, which were critical of the British invasion of Iraq."</li>
<li>"There are a number of examples in the BBC World Service Broadcasts illustrating its remit of following British policy and world view" (what remit? That's not what I understood by the stated "mission")</li>

<dd>Hi, there was a reference to the first fact (though its several services, mostly in Eastern Europe, not just Polish), but it keeps getting lost because the Anon IP editor trying to put in POV stuff keep just pasting in old versions of the page. The second fact is contentious: the British government have said the BBC coverage is anti-invasion, but they would, wouldn't they. I agree with you on the third point. I've reverted back to a version that does not contain your NPOV section. I think the points in it would be relevant, but only if they are verifiable. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 15:10, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During the US siege of the Iraqi town of Falluja in April, the international media including the BBC World Service was telling the world the wrong story.</p>
<p>American occupation forces said they had entered the town to flush out a small number of "Saddam loyalists" and "terrorists" after four US security contractors were killed and mutilated.</p>
<p>But Rahul Mahajan, an anti-war activist who was one of the few independent reporters inside the battered city, rejected the official version of events which the world's media was reporting as fact.</p>
<p>The truth is rather different, he said. The Falluja resistance was not a small group of isolated "extremists" repudiated by the majority of the town's population. Rather, Falluja had been in revolt against occupation since last year when US troops opened fire on a group of 100 to 200 peaceful protesters, killing 15.</p>
<p>Like other independent journalists and media professionals, Mahajan says many of the big western broadcasters and newspapers including the BBC World Service are failing to tell the world what is really happening in Iraq.</p>
<p>Major media players, such as CNN and the BBC, rely too heavily on official occupation authority sources at the expense of Iraqi opinion.</p>
<p>So much so that the line between objective journalism and partiality is often blurred.</p>
<p>The BBC Correspondonts in fear for their lives never leave the Green Zone and rely hevily on Press Briefing by the US Occupation forces both to protect them and to feed them the news.</p>

<p>You are not here to defend the BBC. This is not a Political forum, If you are a varnish man for the BBC then wikipedia is not the place for you- The BBC is a fully funded organization of the British Government - Ministers have justified funding for the BBC because it projects the British point of view and British Foreign policy. Do you think the British government funds the BBC for Charitable reasons? If you think so you must be daft. The article is factual – If you have any disagreements be more specific, so that we may understand your logic of using the revert button to destroy a good article.</p>

Hi have changed this to:</p>
<p>"Following the British Governments aim at promoting its point of view to the Iranian people and as a prelude to a possible war with this country, British Government is funding a new Farsi service. This move is significant as the British Government has been demanding that the BBC cut its other transmissions in Eastern europe in order to save money. The BBC World Service is to launch a television news and information service in the Farsi (Persian) language for Iran, The service will complement the BBC's existing Persian radio and online services for Iran. The service is expected to launch early in 2008 and will be based in London.

<p>My comments above under the heading "As a BBC World Service Listener in Africa my Comments" were deleted. I have been a contributor of wikipedia for many years THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN A POSTING ON THE DISCUSSION PAGE DELETED.</p>
<p>Lets have no more of this childish hysteria from those who wish to protect the BBC and cannot tolerate anything critical of this organisation.</p>
<p>The article needss to stand as there is a popular myth that the BBC is neutal the evidence and historical record says otherwise</p>
<p>my edits of the page are fully sourced, cited and verified.</p>

We've been getting the same uncited edits from 81.170. and 81.1. IP addresses wiping out existing content for a few months now. I assume there's a better solution, especially since the policy says semi-protection shouldn't be used "[a]s a response to regular content disputes, since it may restrict some editors and not others".
