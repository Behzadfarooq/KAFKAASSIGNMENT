<p>I forgot about adding an infobox. Sorry if you feel your time was wasted! This is a good example of why improvements to an article should be made piecemeal and <i>in situ</i>, and not worked on separately in user pages.

<p>Hi, I noticed that you diambig'd "Gothic". But you got the wrong link. The "Gothic" mentioned in that article does not mean "blackletter". <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_gothic_typeface.html" title="Japanese gothic typeface">Japanese gothic typeface</a> might be the closest correct disambiguated link for the correct sense; unfortunately no one seems to be convinced that "Japanese gothic typeface" should be renamed to drop the "Japanese" connotation.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 03:46, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, this is very sad, because it illustrates that knowledge can get lost. With Wikipedia's sometimes bizzare policies, things can only get worse. What happens is:
<ul>
<li>The word "Gothic" is an early term for "sans serif" because the "type colour" (usually called font weight nowadays) is similar to Blackletters which are also called "Gothic"</li>
<li>The Far East borrowed the name "Gothic" for sans serif</li>
<li>Gradually, the term "Gothic" got fallen into disuse in the West (probably because it is ambiguous, <i>not</i> because it is "incorrect")</li>
<li>However, in the Far East (especially Japan) the name is still being used</li>
<li>As a result, lots of people in the west does not know that they invented the name "Gothic" themselves, thinking that the term originated in Japan (they first encounter the term "gothic" when they see Japanese font names on their computer…)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The fact is, "gothic" meaning "sans serif" had <i>never</i> been a Japanese thing. I just cited a Chinese book on the talk page of Japanese gothic typeface, and if I try very hard I should be able to prove once and for all that "Gothic" is a Western term. But unfortunately all the new books are useless and old books are hard to find.</dd>
<dd>Even currently practising typographers sometimes have incorrect information (by which I actually had to prove to some typographer working on an article that "gothic" was invented in the West, not in Japan), probably because the term had fallen into disuse for too long, people forgot what their old books say. And the software companies have too much power nowadays.</dd>
<dd>This is, IMHO, a sad state of affairs. The name "Gothic" is not "wrong" per say; it has fallen into disuse, but you can't say it's wrong when you still have fonts with the word "Gothic" which are just sans serif.</dd>
<dd>As I say, don't believe everything you read on Wikipedia. Maybe I'm too pessimistic, but I can't imagine how I can be optimistic if I can't even get such small things corrected.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 05:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not try to disambiguate links to "Xyz (disambiguation)" type redirects to disambuguation pages. They are there for a reason, that is to prevent false disambiguation.

<p><a href="../../../n/i/s/Nish.html" title="Nish">Nish</a> was originally a redirect to <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nis.html" title="Nis">Nis</a> (later <a href="../../../n/i/%C5%A1/Ni%C5%A1.html" title="Niš">Niš</a>) that was hijacked by a comedian for a personal article, and then deleted as an advertisement/vanity page; I've re-created it as a redirect to Niš.</p>
<p>Horon...man, what a mess. Anyway: Everything now in the Horon section of the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hora.html" title="Hora">Hora</a> article was also in the deleted Horon article, so it was probably copied over, as you suspected.</p>
<p>And it looks like it's still a copyright problem; the paragraph beginning "Authentic Pontic dance is characterized by small, quick, precise steps..." was on <a href="http://www.minoans.com/Pontos+Dances.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.minoans.com/Pontos+Dances.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> as far back as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991009223908/http://www.minoans.com/Pontos+Dances.htm" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/19991009223908/http://www.minoans.com/Pontos+Dances.htm" rel="nofollow">1999</a>, according to the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>Looking at formatting of the older versions, the "Types of horon" list was obviously cut and pasted from the chart at <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/folk/pontian.net/dance/dance.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.angelfire.com/folk/pontian.net/dance/dance.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (weird tabs and spacing, etc.), so that should probably be removed too.</p>

<p>Hi Bbik&#160;! Too may infoboxes and very little text firstly is a bad idea. Usually infoboxes bring along predefined space/location parameters and the text around them has to adjust itself. So here I would advise to expand the article and the infoboxes would behave the way you want.

<p>Here is the title and first paragraph from the polih web-page:</p>
<p>A Karaim legend About a red and white rose or about a bad thorn bush</p>
<p>Many, many years ago, in Crimea, in the capital of the Chans, lived famous young Babakaj. However fame, beauty and youth were not the treasure of Babakaj. His treasure was Bijana of marvelous beauty, and the knight Babakaj was the treasure of Bijana.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to me that this has any relationship to the Babakaj stone at Golubac castle, neither does the other quoted page.</p>

<dd>Well, I'm not quite sure what to make of the second link. For Golubac, some of the information agrees with what I've already found, and some doesn't at all. The age is older than anything I've seen, and I'm not sure where Byzantine and Bulgaria came from, though I <i>suppose</i> it's possible during some of the unknown dates... I'm a bit curious what the palace it mentions is, too, especially in the lower section. For Smederevo, is there both a manor and a palace in the small town, or does "manor" mean the entire area, and the palace is within it? Also, any idea if "biforium" (Something about Gothic windows, I think the dividing part when it's a double window.) is a word in English? It seems to be in German and Polish, but even <a href="http://m-w.com/" class="external text" title="http://m-w.com/" rel="nofollow">Merriam Webster</a> doesn't seem to know what it is in English. -<a href="../../../b/b/i/User%7EBbik_691a.html" title="User:Bbik">Bbik</a> 09:26, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's something fishy here: we have an article <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triforium.html" title="Triforium">Triforium</a>, describing a related but by no means same stuff as the window. However, <a href="../../../../pl/t/r/i/Triforium.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Triforium">pl:Triforium</a> talks about three-arched windows? Is perhaps "biforium" a back-formation from "triforium" under a mistaken (?) assumption that "tri" comes from Latin "three"?<br />
In any case, I'd go with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Double-arched%C2%A0window" class="extiw" title="google:Double-arched&#160;window">google:Double-arched&#160;window</a>, which seems to be the common English expression.

<dd>For that matter, what does that first link you found say? Between what I've already found (Yay language barrier-crossing numbers!) and the (very few) words I'm starting to recognize, it looks like there's actually some decent information there. Perhaps even something about these windows the other link mentions, since there's a picture? Is there any rhyme or reason for the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/willy_nilly" class="extiw" title="wikt:willy_nilly">willy-nilly</a> numbering on the map? It would be so much easier to follow if it just went in a circle, rather than all the back and forth... And where's the sacral complex? Is that in the small town, or is that the thing on the bottom right of the big town (It's labelled "Turkish [something]" though, isn't it? Judging by the baths bit, anyhow.), or somewhere else entirely? (Do you have time for translating stuff, or should I see if I can recruit xompanthy again?

<p>(Undent) Well, the page does have the "English" link at the top right, which leads you to... We have a saying "Speak Serbian so that whole world can understand you", which clearly demonstrates our cosmopolitanism <code>$-)</code>.</p>
<p>Well, I don't <i>quite</i> have time for translation, but I'll try the text on the right side, which contains more relevant informations. The one on the left is from <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksandar_Deroko_fe0f.html" title="Aleksandar Deroko">Aleksandar Deroko</a>'s "Srednjevekovni gradovi na Dunavu" (Medieval Cities on Danube).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Basic data</b><br />
The area of the small and the big town, according to 1975 measurements, is 11.3272 ha. The fortress is squeezed between Danube's right bank and the mouth of Jezava, in an irregular triangular shape. Since it had a water trench around the big town, the Fort belonged to the so-called water fortress type, although it wasn't built so that it foundations lie in the water.<br />
The Danube side is 550m long, the one along Jezava 400, and the third, turned towards the city, 502 m. Actually, it is a reduced image of Constantinople Fortress. So is artistically and intellectually shaped a military fortress with a smaller and a bigger triangles, two canals, Roman and Serbian built-in monuments.<br />
This monumental colossus of Serbian military architecture, surrounded by water from all three sides, seemed impregnable. And yet, world events, strong Turkish breakthrough, and (<i>proverbial, may I add</i>) Serbian discord speeded up the fall of Smederevo, the witness of Serbian creative force. However, hard imposed taxes and long-standing exhausting work on its building have left the traces in popular memory and associated the malediction with the name of the Despot's wife Jerina (<i>commonly known as "Prokleta" (damned), op.ed.</i>)<br />
From once small suburb, which was placed on the Danube bank away from the fortress wall (because in front of them a clear field space "kalemejdan"), during the centuries, and especially after 1867, todays big town of Smederevo developed.<br />
Along with the tower with cross and inscription, the small town also has two another building elements.<br />
<b>Windows towards the Danube</b><br />
The throne hall, leaning on the north wall towards the Danube, belongs to the most representative buildings of our medieval architecture. It contains biforas -- four big two-part windows overseeing the Danube, carved in the stone with gothic and romanic arches. Those were the Despot's residing premises and the reception hall. In this hall, the famous merchant contract between Venice and the Despotate was signed.<br />
<b>Donžon kula</b> (<a href="../../../k/e/e/Keep.html" title="Keep">keep</a>) was the last resort and defense. Into this hall, with walls over 4m thick, the eminent persons withdrew during the Turkish attacks.<br /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On one of the towers of the small town is a brick-built large inscription which testifies the year of the fortress's building. This tower, for the cross immured above the inscription, is known as "krstata kula" or "krstača" in the people.<br />
The inscriptions like this are generally rare, and can be found only on the Byzantine territory, and this one is the sole example in Yugoslavia.<br />
The text in original reads:<br />
„V Hrista Boga blagoverni despot Gurg, gospodin Srblju i Pomorju zetskomu; zapovešću njegovom sazida se ovaj grad v leto 6938 (1430)“<br />

<li>Yes, outside the walls; the central place (with the Church of Saint Lucas) of the modern city is some ~500m away from the fortress; I'm not sure if it can be seen on that photo. It probably developed much time later. I omitted a part of the sentence: "a clear field space" ... <i>had to be maintained</i>.</li>
<li>Yes, the throne hall is #17. I can only guess that the "fortified manor" refers to the entire small city. The small city is small indeed, I guess some 30-40 m wide.</li>

<p>The draft was made by model of Constatinople Fortress, which was also in triangular shapes. The works were managed by older brother of despotesse Jerina, George (Đorđe) Kantakuzin. Among the bricklayers, apart from Greeks, were also <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragusa.html" title="Ragusa">Ragusans</a>. The extreme effort that the people had to endure was further exaggerated in the popular tradition. The tax in money and other duties were given. Both old and young had to work, as well as women. According to the poem "Starina Novak and count Bogosav", there were people who fled into the woods as <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajduk.html" title="Hajduk">hajduks</a>.</p>

Kad me pitaš pravo da ti kažem:  Since you asked, I'll tell you truthfully
jest mi bilo za nevolju ljutu;   It was trully a harsh misfortune 
Ako moreš znati i pamtiti        If you're able, remember and know
Kad Jerina Smederevo gradi,      When Jerina built the Smederevo
Pa, naredi mene u argatluk.      She ordered me into day labor
Argatovah tri godine dana,       I had worked but three full years
I ja vukoh drvlje i kamenje,     And I pulled sticks and stones
Sve uz moja kola i volove;       All with my own wagons and oxen
I za pune do tri godinice,       And for all of those three years
Ja ne stekoh pare ni dinara,     I had not acquired but a dime
Nit' zaslužih na noge opanke!    Nor even <a href="../../../o/p/a/Opanak.html" title="Opanak">opanaks</a> to my legs
I to bih joj, brate, oprostio.   Even that I would forgive her, brother.
Kad sagradi smedereva grada,     But when she built Smederevo city
Onda stade pa i kule zida,       There she went on building the towers
Pozlaćuje vrata i pendžere,      Gilding doors and even the windows
Pa nametnu namet na vilajet,     And imposed golden tax on people
Sve na kuću po tri litre zlata,  Every house three liters of gold
To je, brate, po trista dukata!  That is, brother, three hundreds of ducats!
Ko imade i predade blago;        Who had had it, gave her the treasure
Ko predade onaj i ostade.        Who delivered, that one remained
Ja sam bio čovek siromašan,      I was a man simple and indigent
Ne imadoh da predadem blago,     I had no gold and money to deliver
Uzeh budak, s čim sam argatovo', Took the pickax that I used to work with
Pa s budakom odoh u hajduke,     With the pickax I went into hajduks
Pa se niđe zadržat ne mogoh      So I couldn't stay anywhere
U državi Jerine proklete.        In the state of Jerina damned

<li>So, at the risk of sounding really stupid... Where, exactly, is the fortress in the picture? (I assume you mean the very top one, right?) Is the fuzzy top half supposed to be it, or the whole thing, or something else entirely?</li>
<li>Is it only on Stormfront because it's a copyvio? That seems to be the common reason with situations like that. I'm guessing Ragusans is referring to the bunch of people from Dubrovnik that some link or other mentioned? Or is it the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ragusa_4b76.html" title="Republic of Ragusa">Republic of Ragusa</a>?</li>

<p>Youch, 10km? That is huge. For clarification, is "town" (blasting through the entire <i>town</i>. . .and most of the buildings in the <i>town</i> were turned into debris) referring to the larger suburb within the walls (Did it still exist then? If it did, this certainly explains why that area's empty now.), or modern Smederevo as a whole, or? And... How did <i>any</i> of the fortress survive, if it damaged buildings <i>that</i> far away? How did the bath and church survive, either, since they're actually within the fortress? Or does the sporadic "remains" label actually mean they're two big piles of rubble, rather than still standing but damaged?<br />
Any idea which tower is the "corner-stone tower"? Number 7 on your map, maybe? Which one is "tower number 10"? Any chance they're the same tower? Are the two trenches big enough for boats/ships, as "canal" (from one of the sources) implies, or are they actually moats, or not really even that, as your "trench" implies? There are a few questions (some bolded, some hidden) in the text itself, too, if you have any insight into them. -<a href="../../../b/b/i/User%7EBbik_691a.html" title="User:Bbik">Bbik</a> 01:02, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The town" refers to the entire modern Smederevo. I can't really tell why the damage to the fortress walls was relatively low: for the start, they're helluva thick (2-3 m). But then, if they resisted, they would supposedly direct the shockwave a bit up and at least partially protect the vicinity (from the direct shockwave path if not from the falling debris)? Or not? I'm not exactly an expert on physics of explosions. No, the "remains" of the bath and church are merely the basements; you can see a bunch of trees the air photo on the supposed location of the bath, and I guess it's similar for the church. But I'll check out for the weekend myself.</dd>
<dd>Cross-checking with the <a href="http://www.smederevo.co.yu/grad/istorija/tvrdjava.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.smederevo.co.yu/grad/istorija/tvrdjava.htm" rel="nofollow">original map</a>, it seems likely that "tower number 10" equals "cornerstone tower" and equals "Turkish inscription tower" #7 on my map. It's not clear, however, whether there are two towers at that corner or only one (and what the circles on the outer triangle tip really indicate); again, I'll check for the weekend.</dd>
<dd>The outer trench does not exist anymore at all. The inner trench is actually a moat; it still exists and I don't know how wide it is. My memory says somewhere around 5m, but I'll check.

<dd>The red links should so not be a big deal. Just remove them, you can drop them in your user space, for self reference and then add them to the article as they are created, as it is, with a lot of red links, it is massively distracting to the reader. Links should enhance the experience not hinder it. Just my POV. Also, I haven't had a chance to look at the article yet. Or really respond to much. : ) <a href="../../../i/v/o/User%7EIvoShandor_4733.html" title="User:IvoShandor">IvoShandor</a> 12:43, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>Thank you for helping with <a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_Chalet_dcf6.html" title="Our Chalet">Our Chalet</a>. If you'd like, you're welcome to join the Scouting Project at WP:ScOUT and it's GG/GS task force. As for your change to See also, I changed it back as Gilwell is the premier boy scout international center, like Our Chalet. The other WAGGGS cetners are already in the lead and linked there and when articles are linked in the body, it is wiki policy not to re list them in See also. If you could find a nice free photo of the main building, that'd be awesome. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 11:19, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I've made a round through your questions and comments. Feel free to copyedit, etc. There are two basic problems with info for this article:</dd>
<dd>the book WAGGGS sent me for it ends in 1999 and much of it is various people's recollections, vice background info, so it doesn't lend itself to encyclopedia info, such as it says "the first Quo Vadis..." but doesn't tell you what it is. In summer 2006 I got a similar book from Gilwell Park and it was much better for this purpose as it told you the history and background of everything, so we got that article to FA in only about 6 weeks (starting as a stub).</dd>
<dd>There is far more info avail on Gilwell than Our Chalet, do google searches and you'll see what I mean.</dd>
<dd>I truly appreciate all your help. I'd like to get this to at least GA.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 13:04, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Possible red link elimination is a good thing. I'll give it a quick copyedit when I'm a bit less out of it. Does this mean you're actually taking that break now, though, so questions that come up likely won't get answered for a while?

<dd>Heh, I had noticed that. Wasn't quite sure if that meant you were ignoring the break or what, though -- I'd been thinking "break" meant not editting at all, rather than just not much.
