	    <p>article currently states "With CO2 cartridges, pressure drops as gas is expelled with each shot, thus CO2 cartridges need to be changed often as pressure available drops too low" that can't be right can it? isn't compressed CO2 stored as a liquid and thus pressure is strictly a function of tempreture as long as some liquid remains? the passage could be suggesting that because of the liquid co2 boiling off and cooling the cartridge pressure drops but then it would be suggesing that people replace cartridges because there cold and thats just silly.</p>
<p><br />
Why does pressure drop when using 12-gram CO2 cartridges?</p>
<p>Has this person ever shot a CO2 airgun? Most "silly" CO2 cartridge users complain about losing pressure before the advertised number of shots. Then they go to change cartridges and nearly get a moist finger frozen to the cylinder!</p>
<p>A "12-grammer" or "cart" has very little liquid in it at room temperature and 900-1000 psi, as can be shown from an estimate of its volume and a solid-liquid-gas phase diagram of CO2. Or just hold a 12-grammer up to your ear and tap it with a metal object while tilting it back and forth, and hear the absence of a sloshing liquid ringing.</p>
<p>A 12-grammer can provide most airguns up to 60 or more satisfactory shots for ***slow-fire*** target practice. The article more likely refers to the drastic pressure drop experienced by users of CO2's typically semiautomatic airguns, who simply fire them too rapidly. The phenomenon is all too familiar to rapid-fire action shooters like myself, who must frequently resort to changing out frosted cartridges after only a few dozen shots--even despite the custom battery-powered resistive heaters I've built into the grips of my pistols.</p>
<p>During rapid-fire, pressure drops quickly because the cart gets chilled, often to the point of frostbite. I can think of several reasons for this, the first being the immediate boil-off of the cart's initial liquid CO2 load. As evidence I have observed the bottom half-inch of a cartridge completely ice over with a first dozen panic-round shots. Obviously the most effective location for heat input is near the cart's bottom.</p>
<p>The second point of heat loss involves the method of "cracking" the cart into the gun's valve system. The user screws or levers the cart's hermetically-sealed bottleneck face against a pin with a tiny hole in it. This small orifice acts as a Venturi nozzle after each shot: As gas flows through it to replenish the valve, the nozzle is chilled as the gas expands. The system was not designed to be a carburetor; pretty soon the nozzle temperature drops so low as to adversely affect the outgoing gas pressure. As evidence, when "uncracking" a frosted, partially used cart, the pin-sized hole in the neck seal can spit CO2 "mist" for some time afterward.</p>
<p>A third point is simple thermodynamics, taking the gun-cart system to be a single-stroke heat engine from the start of the cart until it's expended. In this case it doesn't matter what your working fluid is. Let it expand too fast, and you trash the efficiency of the engine, or in other words, you tried to draw too much work out of it in too little time. Not enough horsepower, see? Not even enough for my 20 watts' worth of resistors to let me pop off 20-30 rounds a minute.67.163.0.9 10:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)semiautopellet</p>

Why do they call it "BB"? -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 23:44, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are at least two different possible origins for the name BB. One was that early guns shot a single shotgun pellet that was between the B and BBB size. Another is that the early BBs were nothing more than small ball bearings, hence BB. --<a href="../../../j/k/o/User%7EJkonrath_759d.html" title="User:Jkonrath">Jkonrath</a> 30 June 2005 18:55 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BB is a shot size between BBB and B shot. If you check out ammunition for shot sizes, you can find this information. I'm going to remove the disputed tag. <a href="http://www.westernsportshop.com/hunt_wfowl_loads.html" class="external text" title="http://www.westernsportshop.com/hunt_wfowl_loads.html" rel="nofollow">Shotgun Shot at a random seller therof</a> 68.34.41.250 22:32, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I'm still dubious, though. Basically, I've always thought BB meant ball bearing, so I'd like to see some citation not just that they spheres are size "BB", but that it really is a coincidence that they happen to be essentially a ball bearing. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a> 00:58, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I added a reference to the ball bearing connection. I also had been under the impression that it stood for this, and I think it's important that people who think they're looking for a "ball bearing gun" know that they have in fact found it. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 18:05, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/b/_/Talk%7EBB_gun_7368.html" title="Edit section: The relationship between the airsoft, air gun and BB gun articles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The relationship between the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a> articles</span></h2>
<p>I think there is too much overlap between these three articles. When one looks for information on a particular aspect of this topic, one sometimes finds it scattered across all three.</p>
<p>Please consider the following propositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. <i>Air guns</i> are currently covered by three articles: <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a>.</li>
<li>2. Additionally, the same "<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a>" article covers the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a> or <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game.html" title="Game">game</a> known as "<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a>".</li>
<li>3. A <a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a> is a species of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a>, just like a sporting <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_pistol.html" title="Air pistol">air pistol</a> or an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html#Airsoft_guns" title="Airsoft">airsoft pistol</a>.</li>
<li>4. There is an international sporting activity known as <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">Airsoft</a>. It employs <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html#Airsoft_guns" title="Airsoft">airsoft pistols</a> (and occasionally rifles) (apparently along similar lines to <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practical_shooting.html" title="Practical shooting">I.P.S.C.</a>).</li>
<li>5. In at least some parts of the world an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html#Airsoft_guns" title="Airsoft">airsoft pistol</a> is commonly called a "<a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a>".</li>
</ul>
<p>I propose: 1. That the <a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a> article be merged with the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a> article. 2. That the portions of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> article relating to the mechanics and operation of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html#Airsoft_guns" title="Airsoft">airsoft guns</a> be moved to the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a>. 3. That the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> article restrict itself to the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a> of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> (including required equipment not thoroughly canvassed in other Wikipedia articles</p>
<p>So, in essence I propose that we have one article for the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a>/<a href="../../../g/a/m/Game.html" title="Game">game</a> of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> and one for <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air guns</a> (whether designed for the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a> of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> or not.</p>
<p>I'm posting this on the talk pages of all three articles. Please give us your thoughts. If there's no great opposition to this I'll go ahead and make the edits, but I thought it was only fair to raise the matter with contributors first. <a href="../../../w/u/l/User%7EWulfilia_3479.html" title="User:Wulfilia">Wulfilia</a> 19:39, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Oppose</b> It's similar, yes, but a different thing. While they have been used to shoot at other people recreationally, they certainly weren't manufactured for that purpose.

<dd><b>Oppose</b> I agree again. BB guns shoot a steel or lead ball and not a plastic one. They are also used similar to a pellet gun not an airsoft gun.

<p>The article currently states: "A BB gun is a pneumatic gun usually powered by compressed gas, electric revolution, or a spring." First off, if the BB is fired by electric revolution or a spring, it's not pneumatic, is it? Secondly, I could use a little clarification on "electric revolution". Does that mean the BB is spun around inside a disk-shaped cylinder and fired via centrifugal force? I think those two points could be improved in the article. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 15:47, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article previously contained way to much information, much of it completely irrelevant or downright wrong. I replaced this with historical information from the Daisy Museum website, plus personal experience with Daisy and Crosman BB guns. For the purpose of the article, I have restricted "BB gun" to mean an airgun with a BB sized bore, i.e. .175-180 inches, and intended to or capable of firing spherical steel shot. This implies a smoothbore barrel, or an oversized rifled barrel with a mechanism for retaining the steel BBs. The PCP big bore airguns from Korea don't fit the definition, nor does the Lewis and Clark gun. Those are air rifles, not BB guns.</p>
<p>Operating mechanisms are covered in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a>, which is a superset of BB guns, so I think details can be left for that article; I breifly mention the types of actions used on common airguns on the market now. The "spring rod" type of action described is just crap--the only way direct action works is when the projectile is MUCH heavier than the connector, such as with bows. Any direct action BB projector is a toy, not a BB gun. Legal issues are the same; BB guns are a subset of air guns, the only reasons BB guns would be more or less legal is due to power and operating mechanism issues.</p>
<p>If anyone feels I have removed too much, feel free to grab the data from the previous edit and add it back into the article, along with a justification, please. I'm going to think about ways to source some of my generalizations about BB guns, such as dual-use pneumatics, CO<sub>2</sub> pistols, and spring piston guns. Probably the best way to back that up would be to provide examples of commonly available BB guns in each category, maybe in a chart. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 18:49, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
