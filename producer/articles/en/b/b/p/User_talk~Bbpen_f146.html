<p>I saw your action on <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Praying_Mantis_1d6c.html" title="Operation Praying Mantis">Operation Praying Mantis</a>. If you run into this problem again (a misspelled page), don't just cut-and-paste the copy into a newly created page, because that loses all the history and talk of the previous page. Right now, for example, on your new page there's no way to tell when/by who it was first written. Further, somebody coming to the misspelled page doesn't know it's misspelled because there's no direction to your page.</p>
<p>Better is to Move the page - a wikipedia action that sysops can perform (maybe everybody can do it now; I'm not sure). I'm going to do it now. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 20:52, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>Although the insect is a <b>Preying</b> mantis, the operation entered history as <b>Praying</b> mantis apparently due to a misspelling. (In much the same way as Operation Satellite morphed into Starlight. There is no doubt the original documents spelled it the right way, but other cite it in either way. Sorry to have taken so long to reply to your last. I have been on the WikiSourse.

<p>Actually, the insect <i>is</i> a <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praying_mantis.html" title="Praying mantis">praying mantis</a>, named for the way it folds its forelegs as if in devotion (cf. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=praying%20mantis" class="external free" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=praying%20mantis" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=praying%20mantis</a> ). The fact that it also preys has no doubt caused the confusion. <a href="../../../b/b/p/User%7EBbpen_80d7.html" title="User:Bbpen">Bbpen</a> 13:44, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bbpen, About your recent edit to <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_turbine.html" title="Gas turbine">Gas turbine</a>. You changed all the 'micro turbine' references to 'microturbine'. I had been using the former because 'microturbine' is a trademarked name.</p>
<p>However, 'microturbine' has a lot more google hits. I would still prefer 'micro turbine', especially for the section heading. Do you have your heart set on 'microturbine'?</p>
<p>Otherwise, welcome to Wikipedia and keep up the good work.</p>

<p>You seem to have a preference for the latter. Well, that's OK, but changing every instance of the former to the latter in the entire Wikipedia is really not kosher. There are a lot of more important things that need doing here, no? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:49, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why do you believe it's not kosher? I believe that "utilized" is jargon, not clear speech; that it is used to lend a false sense of authority; and that "used" is almost always preferable. As for "more important things," one of Wikipedia's strengths is that each user contributes as he or she sees a need. <a href="../../../b/b/p/User%7EBbpen_80d7.html" title="User:Bbpen">Bbpen</a> 19:17, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And suppose someone else thinks that "used" sounds slangy, and goes around changing all instances of "used" to "utilized"? The two of you could spend your lifetime reverting each other. Not too useful, eh? That's why it's not kosher to simply blanket change instances of one word to another(any more than going around changing British spelling to American, or vice versa, is).</dd>
<dd>How can "utilize" be "jargon" when <a href="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=utilize" class="external text" title="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=utilize" rel="nofollow">it's in</a> the <i>Webster's 1913 Edition</i>? "Utilize", with its root in "utility", has a slightly different flavour than "use", and sometimes (as on the Egyptian chronology page) it is appropriate. If you see <i>some</i> cases where you think "use" is a better word, fine, but don't just do a blanket replace. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 05:40, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alas, a word's <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=realign&amp;r=67" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=realign&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">existence in the dictionary</a> hardly prevents people from using it incorrectly, inappropriately, or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak#Examples_of_doublespeak_in_current_usage" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak#Examples_of_doublespeak_in_current_usage" rel="nofollow">deceptively</a>. Certainly, no one's seeking to perpetrate linguistic fraud here; they're simply using a complicated (and usually somewhat pretentious) word where a simple one would suffice -- clear grounds for judicious editing. There <i>are</i> specific, and rare, times when "utilize" (whose flavor is more "to put to good use" than simply "to use") improves on "use"; the Egyptian chronology page may be one. But you've jumped to a conclusion about blanket replacement. The dozen or so places I've changed "utilized" in the Wikipedia leave hundreds of instances untouched. If I were really set on blind extermination, I'd simply fire up the old UtilizedBot. <a href="../../../b/b/p/User%7EBbpen_80d7.html" title="User:Bbpen">Bbpen</a> 16:06, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If all you were doing was occasionally switching to a more euphonious word, that would be OK with me, but you seem to be on a hunt for "utilize", and in looking at some of your recent edits, although some were good, e.g. <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongols.html" title="Mongols">Mongols</a>, I really don't agree with some of them, e.g. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Anderida.html" title="Anderida">Anderida</a>, where the usage is <i>exactly</i> the "put to good use" you mentioned above (although I still prefer the Webster's edition). And that doesn't count the Egyptian one I already fixed. And I don't have time to review all your edits to check them, but so far your batting average (not sure which side of the Big Pond you are on) is not good. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 22:17, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course I'm on a hunt for "utilize." I find it, review the context in which it's used, and change it when "used" would be better. (It's a fancy that will pass, I assure you.) As for reviewing my edits, there are a lot of more important things that need doing here, no? <a href="../../../b/b/p/User%7EBbpen_80d7.html" title="User:Bbpen">Bbpen</a> 22:42, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh. I see you have somehow found the time to review and revert most of my edits. Well, I can't deny I've learned a certain lesson from this little episode.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/b/p/User%7EBbpen_80d7.html" title="User:Bbpen">Bbpen</a> 05:02, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, being a Wiki cuts both ways, right? You have your opinion, and I have mine. And I did first try asking for you to back off. Anyway, I hope I get credit for i) not simply blanket reverting the lot, but picking with some discretion the individual cases where I felt the original was better (and actually, I changed less than half of the ones you replaced before I first mentioned it to you) and ii) fixing a bunch of other mistakes at the same time (and even added a "used" at one point, that should please you&#160;:-). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 11:57, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm new to Wikipedia, and I like the idea of being able to correct spelling, grammatical, punctuation, and factual errors. What I need to keep my hands tied behind my back regarding are certain word preferences. These include (my preference comes first):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. use vs. utilize</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. difference vs. differential, in a non-technical sense. For example, what I would want to change is "The wage differential between men and women is..." to "The wage difference between men and women is..." (but not "The wage gap between men and women is..." because that sounds too informal).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans.html" title="Humans">humans</a>/<a href="../../../p/e/o/People.html" title="People">people</a> vs. <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man.html" title="Man">man</a> - To describe the species, not a specific male member of the species.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. he/she (him/her) (his/hers) vs. male pronouns only - I would probably try to recast such sentences, as in "The reader should note as he studies this..." to "Readers should note as they study this..." (or if it won't make an intended formal item too informal, "You should note as you study this...").</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> vs. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jersey.html" title="Jersey">Jersey</a> - In reference to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._6e1d.html" title="U.S.">U.S.</a> state, not the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Island_7c5c.html" title="Channel Island">Channel Island</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

However, I find the plural form, "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Carolinas_2599.html" title="The Carolinas">The Carolinas</a>", acceptable. (And did you notice, I put the comma outside the quotes? That's a self-developed preference of mine, putting a comma or other punctuation outside a title that's enclosed in parentheses, although this does not pertain to quoted speech or writing. I wouldn't dare go through Wikipedia and change the placement of punctuation within quotes, except to change back an original entry of my own with the punctuation outside of the quotes that someone had changed to contain the punctuation within the quotes.) Since the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina.html" title="Carolina">Carolina</a> name is institutionalized in the name of two professional sports teams, the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina_Panthers_5726.html" title="Carolina Panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina_Hurricanes_b4d8.html" title="Carolina Hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a> of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a>, the use of this name in referencing to them is unavoidable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>7. <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> vs. <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stones.html" title="Stones">Stones</a> - In reference to the rock group.

<p>Your edits, unfortunately, all didn't seem helpful to me. They including adding what I perceived as POV (putting in "Firefox boosters," implying that Firefox hasn't really been targeted to gain a 10% share by unbiased news sources like CNET), incorrectly capitalizing a word after a dash ("Detractors," which didn't begin a new sentence), changing the pronoun "it" to the IE abbreviation for no reason, changing the % symbol to the word "percent" for no reason, and changing "for its part, has responded that" to the less specific and less eloquent "says." Also, you changed "by 2005" to "in 2005," thus changing the meaning - it's really neither, it's "by the end of 2005" - I changed it since to reflect that. Sorry if I offended you by my revert or didn't explain myself properly. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 00:20, Dec 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, fair enough. Here's why I changed what I changed, last to first: "by 2005" can mean "by the end of 2005," but it can also mean "by the beginning of 2005"; "in 2005," on the other hand, unambiguously means "within 2005." (Changing it to say "by the end of 2005" is more precise than my formulation or your reversion; good job.) "Microsoft says," coming directly after an accusation, is easily read as "Microsoft, for its part, has responded that" -- and does so more swiftly. Similarly, "by far" is equivalent to and cleaner than "by a large margin," as both are used here. The % sign rarely occurs in formal prose, and while Wikipedia is far from following AP style, the mathematical symbol leaps out from an otherwise conventionally punctuated block of text. "It" was grammatically ambiguous as used in the sentence; "IE" cleared that up. As for the capital D in "detractors," I meant to change the preceding em-dash to a period to break up an unwieldy sentence -- and forgot; my bad. These are all modest improvements on serviceable prose. But there is real fogginess in the "targeted to" sentence. The verb causes the problem -- passive voice, a verbed noun, and a transitive verbed noun to boot; it is not precise enough to communicate the thought. Who, for example, is doing the targeting? I understood the makers of Firefox to have set that goal; you say it was disinterested observers. That's something that ought to be cleared up. Moreover, the verb should be changed. These observers aren't "targeting" Firefox to do anything (they're unbiased!) but rather are predicting (or expecting, or some such). And while we're working on that sentence: exactly what market share are we talking about here? The predictions are that 10 percent of browser users will use Firefox by end 2005, right? Not merely -- as the sentence now says -- that 10 percent of IE users will switch to Firefox? If I've got that correct, may I suggest: "By the end of 2005, observers believe, about 10 percent of browser users will use Firefox, taking a bite from the dominant market share of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Explorer_6bc1.html" title="Internet Explorer">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> and potentially reigniting the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browser_wars.html" title="Browser wars">browser wars</a>." <a href="../../../b/b/p/User%7EBbpen_80d7.html" title="User:Bbpen">Bbpen</a> 05:02, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Bbphen. I was wondering if you saw the question I left you on the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Talk%7EYale_University_cd66.html" title="Talk:Yale University">Talk:Yale University</a> page. It's not a huge deal, but I was hoping you could clear up my question, which I'm repeating here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not going to delete the sentence, but I do have concerns about the "undergraduate endowment" business. What does it mean? Yale has many, many funds within the endowment, but only one endowment, which is for the entire university. (This is in contrast to Harvard's "every pot in its own bottom" system, in which each school has a distinct endowment, although I believe at Harvard the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is technically part of the College when it comes to money.) When you say that Yale has the largest undergrad endowment, do you mean that the funds within the endowment that are earmarked for the College are greater than at any school? Because I've never seen numbers that break it down like that. Or do you just mean that because in theory all of the endowment can serve the College (since it's not divided), it's larger than Harvard College's endowment. If it's the latter, I think it's misleading</dd>

<p>Hi, Bbpen. I thought I left a note on the talk page, but apparently I didn't. Sorry. Anyway, I reverted because you removed information and didn't say why, and smoothed the sentence structure to a point where it didn't read as well. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) 21:49, Dec 29, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right about the insecurity thing, but the way to solve that is not to remove the term insecurity entirely. It's a salient aspect of Firefox's popularity, and should be mentioned. I added in "poor program design" to cover the web standards. As for Microsoft's actions, they are extremely central to Firefox's history and status, and the responses from Microsoft were exactly that - responses, in regard to Firefox. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) 01:12, Dec 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Poor program design" is redundant; all of IE's flaws noted here are poor program design. Similarly, "insecurity" is covered for the purposes of the intro by citing the ActiveX and malware examples. The topic is delved into in much more detail below -- as is the Microsoft history. Moreover, the sentence "Microsoft, for its part, has said that..." does not makes your point, which (I gather) is that MS' lackluster response to consumer demand opened a crucial opportunity for Firefox. If you want to say that, go ahead; it sounds like a valuable addition. But the text doesn't say that now -- and it says what it does say more clunkily than necessary.

<p>Be carefull when you edit compound sentence, otherwise you will create sentence fragrments. I spotted two on the USS Missouri page just now.</p>

<p>The other fragment was corrected, but this one still remains: <i>The United States intervened in the name of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>.</i> There is no explanation as to why the united states interviened, or what they intervined in. 216.63.175.29</p>

<p>Maybe its not a sentence fragment, but it does disrupt from the overall flow of the article. Some of the information edited out of the <i>Missouri</i> article was need for leading up to other parts.

<p>It is true than an encyclopedia is not a history book; however encyclopedias do contain more information on given topics than you would otherwise find in history books. Furthermore, the demands made of Turkery and Greece would be lost in an article on the Cold War, and it seems aproprite to mention what exactly the USSR was asking for. As for the "overwhelming" welcome, I (unfortunatly) wasn't their, so I have to take the words of others who were thier at face value. Everything I have read suggests that the welcome was at the vary least appreciated.

Just wondering, that's all. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedernst_2c24.html" title="User:Tedernst">Tedernst</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedernst_685a.html" title="User talk:Tedernst">talk</a> 16:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The DAB reviews the U.S. military's major weapons program and writes reports to advise the defense undersecretary for acquisition. <a href="http://akss.dau.mil/dag/Guidebook/IG_c10.2.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://akss.dau.mil/dag/Guidebook/IG_c10.2.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../b/b/p/User%7EBbpen_80d7.html" title="User:Bbpen">Bbpen</a> 18:40, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds like it needs an article!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedernst_2c24.html" title="User:Tedernst">Tedernst</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedernst_685a.html" title="User talk:Tedernst">talk</a> 18:59, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks! I was not the original creator, but I was doing newpage patrol when I stumbled across the beginnings of the article a couple of nights ago. I dropped what I was doing and spent the next hour Googling the news up ... I felt we had a responsibility to put as good an article in front of the public as possible.</p>
<p>We need some standing policy on naming current-events articles to avoid all this. I have never seen a current-events article get moved so much. This was not fair to readers. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 17:15, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Uh, I didn't put it under 2005, Freak of Nurture did. I'd tell you to leave the message on his page, but I think he's already caught enough grief for it. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 19:52, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yah, I knew it was his mistake, not yours; just wanted to put the comment in the relevant discussion. <a href="../../../b/b/p/User%7EBbpen_80d7.html" title="User:Bbpen">Bbpen</a> 19:56, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good Hello. I was just doing a little wikilinking here and there and stumbled across <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Prime_Chance_45b5.html" title="Operation Prime Chance">Operation Prime Chance</a>. The article mentions 2 aircraft the AH-6 and the MH-6. I'm not familiar with either of these designations and was wondering if you might be able to help me out, that I may link to them in the article. Cheers. L0b0t 19:40, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
