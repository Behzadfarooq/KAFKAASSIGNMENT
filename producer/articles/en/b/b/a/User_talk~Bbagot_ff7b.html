<p>Hi Bbagot. Each user has a User page (home page) and a User talk page which is where you leave messages. If you click on my signature it takes you to my <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA">user page</a> where you will see a tab marked <a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESOPHIA_c099.html" title="User talk:SOPHIA">"discussion"</a>. Click on that and it will take you to my talk page. This works for every user and on the articles clicking the "discussion" tab will take you to the talk page for that article where we discuss what information to include and how to place it in the article. Have fun here - but be warned - it'a addictive! Any other questions then just message me. Labs and lab X are the best! My dogs are currently staring at me meaningfully as it's walkies time. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 07:53, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have left comments on both talk pages, so hopefully we can continue discussion there. I will attempt to cover some of your concerns more generally. You asked "What information do you feel was removed unfairly?" and looking throught the page history of Matthew and Luke, the only thing that jumps out at me is deleting 2 sentences describing the Codex Bezae. On some of the other pages you have edited, you have removed important bits of information, like the two edits on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> that removed other religious POVs, etc. I clearly wouldn't say your edits are all destructive or anything close to that, but I will say a few of your edits raised some warning flags in my mind.</p>
<p>You said "I'm not a big fan of the need to label majority and minority views". Well, part of the NPOV is stating who exactly holds what POV, and how popular that POV is. That is the heart of being neutral. We don't say which POV is better, we don't paint either in a better light, but we need to make sure not to give undue weight to minor views. I think a compromise that has been creeping into these pages has been to use words like "liberal" vs. "conservative". There may be a better solution, but we need to make sure that we don't paint a minority view as holding equal weight (such as giving a million and one reasons why conservative scholars date something early, when the majority of scholars accept a later date).</p>
<p>You said "It has seemed to me that you are following me." Well you have been editing a number of pages on my watch list. I will say that your editing patterns made me curious about what other pages you edited, and I butted in on Messianic prophecies, but mostly, I guess we have similar interests in topics&#160;:)</p>
<p>So I hope that we can work things out on the talk pages. Please try to minimize article edits during a content dispute. It can be seen as edit warring. The better user is always the one who walks away from editing the article to discuss things on talk, even if that means leaving in content you'd rather edit. And I will admit, I have been a little trigger happy on the reverting, but I think I have tried to compromise and keep in a number of your contributions as well.

<dd>You said <i>It was not prudent to change the venue.</i> I am not sure what you are talking about, or what you meant by <i>there are reasons that people negotiate behind closed doors</i>. You can see that your long message to me was dated <i>01:21, 20 May 2006</i>, where my concerns on the talk pages were <i>21:12, 19 May 2006</i> and <i>20:58, 19 May 2006</i>, both hours before your message. If anything, you are the one who took a content disupte off of the article talk pages (where anyone can comment, and where a community consensus can occur) onto the user talk pages, that basically involved two people. I am wary of this conflict involving just myself and you as it is, and would rather involve a number of other editors. I hope you understand. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 12:26, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi - re your mail etc. You have 4R in 24h and 7 mins - this is enough to trigger the 3RR, depending on the whim of the admin. Read <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> carefully, and adhere to the spirit of it. As to the length of your block - thats a bit arbitrary. 27 may be a bit heavy, but you'll have to ask SV about that, not me. But the advice, always, is don't get *close* to 3RR if you want to stay away from trouble <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<p>I'm sorry you feel I am trying to censor your view. I said in my report that I thought a block would probably be premature at this point, and you have shown an effort to work out some concerns on talk pages on the gospel articles. However, I think you still need to learn about edit warring. If you add something to an article and it gets reverted, it should make you think twice about adding it back without a deeper concensus. If you get reverted by multiple editors, this should throw up red flags that your additions are controversial. While <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">3RR</a> is policy, I advocate in most circumstances, <a href="../../../1/r/r/WP%7E1RR_8afd.html" title="WP:1RR">WP:1RR</a>. You aren't simply going to win by forcing your controversial edits back into the articles every time you log on. This is the heart of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit warring</a>, and counter productive to community involvement and wikipedia. Please try to reach a middle ground, or be willing to compromise or work with others or make a case for your edits or what ever it takes to avoid excessive reverting.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 13:43, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the first thing you do after you get unblocked? You make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christian_views_of_Jesus&amp;diff=54906007&amp;oldid=54790963" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christian_views_of_Jesus&amp;diff=54906007&amp;oldid=54790963" rel="nofollow">9th</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christian_views_of_Jesus&amp;diff=54931393&amp;oldid=54928155" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christian_views_of_Jesus&amp;diff=54931393&amp;oldid=54928155" rel="nofollow">10th</a> edit. Please take note of what the editors are telling you in their edit summaries, and please take concerns to talk before re-adding your disclaimer again. Also, the controversial Jewish POV paragraph is commented out (a reasonable compromise), so for the time being there is no reason to delete this information (because it doesn't show up in the article view). Like I said above, you can't force controversial edits into an article by simply reverting and reverting again. This isn't how wikipedia works, and I would hope you'd learn how to work with the community, instead of against it. Finally, keep in mind this aspect of the 3RR policy: <i>In excessive cases, people can be blocked for edit warring or disruption even if they do not revert more than three times per day.</i> --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 20:46, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, the first thing I did was eat a sandwich, then when I chose to post again it was to the Wikipedia administrators site followed by the TALK section of Christian views of Jesus, with one of those writings telling YOU I was going to try to rework some of my edits based on what YOU had pointed out to me -- AND I DID. As far as what the editors are saying, I'm the one trying to do most of the talking and explaining. In many ways I'm met with silence.</p>
<p>I'm not playing your game of painting a picture of me using hyperbole and exasperation and trying to make it reality. Can't you be pleased with the strong changes we have both made to the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke? Quit trying to make me out to be a monster and focus on the positive.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I am Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain from Bangladesh. I was and still am too poor like my country. I was desperately searching for support for my research and seeing my desperate wish some educators from the so called non-accreditated university Bircham International University became too kind to buy me books and appove me 100% fund. I had to beg to many but got only one. So I jumped on my dream topic - Philosophy of Death and Adjustment and start working on the Impact of different philosophies on different bangladeshi people. I did it because in the science of death such research was never conducted, but if I can do or at least raise some point for it, may be some richer and more qualified people will find their interest in it and may proceed. My back ground thought was that remedy to many mental health problem might come out from this new branch. But who would raise me with it? Cause I did not have money even to buy papers or my daily food, let alone doing vast correspondences or take help from any accreditated university. Though fortunately I enrolled at Harvard Medical School with full waiver, but that was too small period for me to do any good job. Finally I thought may be Elisabeth kubler-Ross herself might find interest in it and togather we will proceed. But my luck did not support me, cause I found the news of her funeral on the very day I found her organization's web site. So temporarily my research work stopped upto which Bircham International University helped me. So till now I dream of proceeding more on the research with supports of knowledge from all over the world, and I do not even have a web site to introduce my thoughts. So the only light of hope became this free encyclopedia, and for reference I only had Bircham International University web site. So I desperately tried to promote the introduction of the university in this encyclopedia so that the research reference gets its better base. I know my letter is big and annoying, but sometimes we do annoying things for something better, and please believe me I tried to promote Bircham International University or any other that you all object, just to facilitate the birth of a new branch of a science. Please help me in every way, you do not need to ask me anything for editing or changing. If you all fail to help in a rational manner, I do not mind and will take it as a fate. I will see my reply through the condition of the article "Philosophy of Death and Adjustment". I will love to see this baby of mine alive, but if dead, I will follow the branch of science that I am holding on.</p>

<p>Hello, I've seen you give input under Articles for Deletion, and you appear to be fair and knowledgeable. I was checking up an article, UltraRogue and found the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>07:56, 16 February 2007 Lectonar (Talk | contribs) deleted "UltraRogue" (A7)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yet, I am unable to find the trail of where this deletion discussion took place, nor can I find any record of this action being taken under Lectonar's history. If you could please help me to follow what occurred and point me to wherever the log is, I would appreciate it.</p>

<dd>Hi,</dd>
<dd>It seems the article was <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deleted</a> per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">criterion A7</a>: "An article about a real person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject." The action does not appear in <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">User:Lectonar</a>'s contribution history I assume because edits made to articles which are deleted are also removed from users' histories (I know this to be true for regular users and it also seems to apply to admins). If you wish the page to be restored, you may ask the deleting admin on his/her talk page. If they refuse, you may list the page for <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>.</dd>
<dd>I hope this helps. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:45, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to have you kept waiting...and be sure, every action by an <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">administrator</a> is easily reversible, so don't be to miffed about me deleting it&#160;:)).</p>
<p>Articles on wikipedia have to conform to certain standards (the ones pertaining to this article would be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">veriafiability</a>.

Please keep your edit comments civil. Also, you seem to imply that you wish for those unfamiliar with the UFC to not edit these articles. There are many editors can help improve an article, regardless of their familiarity with the UFC. For example, the removal of un-sourced comments, removal of non-neutral points of view, and removal of material given undue weight don't require knowledge of a topic. Any editor may be able to help improve an article in this manner. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESanchom_4ab1.html" title="User talk:Sanchom">talk</a>) 02:37, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your concern. I found the removal of my edit with the label in all caps of vandalism to be uncivil, especially since the information presented was factual and true. This occurred because he was unfamiliar with the subject matter. If he wishes to look for spelling or non-neutral points of view that is understandable, but the reversion he made was inappropriate. <a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbagot_183b.html" title="User:Bbagot">Bbagot</a> 06:02, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, sorry,I didn't see that you responded and I just reverted your category addition... I don't mean to start a revert war though. It's just that the procedure to deal with a contested reversion (such as VegaDark's previous removal of this category) is to take it to the article talk page. I think the main argument that you will face is that you haven't attributed this additional category to a reliable source (see <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>). (At least this is the only one that I can think of.) We should continue this discussion at the article talk page, since this will be worthwhile for the other editors to read. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESanchom_4ab1.html" title="User talk:Sanchom">talk</a>) 06:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS. I also found the removal with the all caps of vandalism to be uncivil and actually left a message for the editor that left that edit comment, since the statement was true (although un-sourced). He did admit that he was hasty in his categorization of that edit as vandalism and will be more careful in the future. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESanchom_4ab1.html" title="User talk:Sanchom">talk</a>) 06:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
