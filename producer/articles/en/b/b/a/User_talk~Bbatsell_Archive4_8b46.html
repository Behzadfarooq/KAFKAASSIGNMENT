<p>Thanks for your help so far. Any further help you could give would be appreciated.

<dd>I understand why you would want those pages to be deleted; however, in general, those notices and category help administrators who are unfamiliar with the user in question become acquainted with the user's actions on Wikipedia. Is there a specific reason that you are asking for them to be deleted in this instance? (Also, please note that <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> is not policy.)

<dd>Well, the user (Jeb Berkeley) and his alternate accounts only vandalized and made no legitimate contributions, and Jeb Berkeley himself is a sockpuppet of Jake Remington (also known as North Carolina Vandal, Fillmore, Briefs), so there is no reason to keep "sockpuppets of Jeb Berkeley" after the deletion of many "Long term abuse pages". Keeping these categories waste server resources and only encourage the vandals to create more sockpuppets, or encourages vandals to create "copycats". It's just a suggestion; i personally don't see any use for these categories that only list vandal accounts. Any vandal's user page should be deleted after a month anyway (if i recall correctly).— <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderous_2d5d.html" title="User:Canderous">Canderous</a> <a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanderous_9402.html" title="User talk:Canderous">Ordo</a> 22:39, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it's true that most vandal user pages are to be deleted after a month, but sockpuppets are treated differently because they usually involve long-term vandalism, and like I said above, administrators use this information in determining what has happened in the past and how to proceed in the future.

<p>I have but one agenda: to improve Wikipedia.

I was overruled by Mailer and I abide by his decision, it's the others that are trying to pick away at it. Excuse me if I can't resist a mild "I told you so".

<p>My apology, but for the canvassing of three oppose voters, epecially for the latter two votes, they only write a line "oppose".

<dd>It's pretty universally frowned upon. See <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECanvassing_fd3a.html" title="Wikipedia:Canvassing">Wikipedia:Canvassing</a> for some reasons why. There's no requirement that they specify the exact reasons they chimed in the way they did; remember, it's not a vote, it's a discussion to obtain consensus.

<dd>Did you ask everyone who voted support to reconsider their votes as well?&#160;:) (Falls under "campaigning".) My position is that people are free to "vote" (not a vote, but you know what I mean) how they choose and should not be asked to change their vote afterwards. At any rate, I don't mean any ill will, and I'm just one lowly editor.

<dd>Well, if you were me, I think you not want someone misunderstanding you either.

<p>You've been so helpful so far that I hate to bring this up, but there was an edit made in Dental Floos by the same ip address previously by an indefinitely blocked editor, (possibly another, more recent editor too). On one hand, the current editing appears to be going fairly well. On the other, if it is indeed the same person that's been blocked multiple times, then I'm not sure how much leniency should be allowed. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 03:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could you clarify which user you think it belongs to? I know not the history of the article, but if you're talking about SoLongBaby (which, judging by the edit summaries, you might be), he is not indefblocked, only his socks are (and even those were only blocked because he was using them to evade a block). Once his block expires (which it did long ago), he is free to edit.

<dd>Ah yes, it definitely looks like the same person. But I'm not really inclined to block at the moment; my philosophy doesn't quite fit into policy, but if they're no longer editing disruptively, then I don't see the need for a new block. Their block was 5+ months ago and last activity even before then. If they become disruptive or start spamming their site again, then give me a ring and I'll block posthaste. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 01:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I need to know why i am being threatened with a block. saying my opinion is not welcome is not reason enough. I have changed my entry to be nothing but factual and am told by you that I will be blocked for it and given a last warning. Please give me a valid reason for this and why you are making sure no one reads the factual information on the page....</p>
<p><br />
In response to your writing</p>
<ul>
<li>Please read Wikipedia's core policies (also known as the five pillars). In particular, WP:N, WP:V, WP:OR, WP:NPOV. A link to a news article discussing the activity can be found in the external links, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a newspaper. We must not include events simply because they're on blogs or newspapers today, we must determine whether the event is in fact notable and merits inclusion in an encyclopedia. The comment that you kept deleting explained exactly why the text you added is not appropriate. Your edits were reverted by 5 editors within minutes; you were addressed on your talk page and were encouraged to engage in discussion on the article's talk page. You refrained from communicating until you realized that your non-constructive actions might result in a block. What else are we supposed to do, exactly? —bbatsell ¿? 05:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)*</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the case then all articles dealing with current events must be taken off. Considering it's my opinion that microsoft hiring someone to change an article on wikipedia is relevant to the article, and it's your opinion that it's not does not give you the right to consider the information not factual for the article. This is factual information that is based on a factual event that can have major implications to the format considering millions of people view this article. It can show microsoft wanting to change information others have added by doing the same thing I am wanting to do, change the article to show what they believe to be true. If you have evidence this is not factual information then show it to me and delete what I wrote, other wise leave it there as is done in most other articles about current events.</p>
<p>Thank you for changing the article, and I will continue to do more research and word this more appropriately to be better suited for the article.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support in my recent RfA. I think valid criticisms were raised in areas that I need to work on, so I've withdrawn my name. I intend to work on addressing the concerns that were raised, and think I need to work contributing without allowing myself to become as stressed as I have been at times, which did result in some inappropriate behavior. Perhaps I may re-explore adminship at some point in the future, but it's a little early to consider that.

<dd>Hmm... well, I can't really tell how disruptive the editor is being without some diffs, but if they're using a very large IP block, then there's not all that much we can do to stop them other than to do a rangeblock (and again, not sure how disruptive, so I'm not sure how viable that is). If we were to do that, I'm sure it would be what is usually called a "softblock", where anonymous editing is disabled, but you can still log in to your account to edit. If this doesn't happen, then the {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}} template should be used to alert us. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 18:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just reverted some vandalism directed at the article on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Grand_Inquisitor_4716.html" title="The Grand Inquisitor">The Grand Inquisitor</a></i> from the address 71.103.243.211. I've checked the talk page and it seems there is a history of vandalism originating from that address. I bring this to your attention because you've already warned this user (or users) that they will be blocked if they continue such nonsense. I would like to respectfully request that you consider following through with this. --<font face="Papyrus"><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a><big>|</big><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a></font> 14:16, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
