<h2><span class="mw-headline">User interface helper under development</span></h2>
<p>I am currently developing a tool to help me with my manual edits (especially RC/New Pages patrol), i.e. I visit a page and tell it manually what to do with it. Planned features are: adding (categorised) stub tags, if this works I'll probably add VfD nomination (I think the current process is a bit tedious to do manually), of course with user-supplied reasoning texts. I would like to emphasise the fact that this tool is <b>not</b> planned to have any spidering or other autonomous/high-volume features and will <b>not</b> create any new pages (other than VfD discussions once this feature is added). It is therefore believed that the tool does not have the problems as listed under <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html#Inherent_drawbacks_of_using_bots_in_current_system" title="Wikipedia:Bots">WP:Inherent bot drawbacks</a>. This is therefore not a request for a bot flag (as I think it shouldn't have one; they're still low-volume user-initiated edits), but a general check for concern. Similarly, like <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumanbot_6055.html" title="User:Humanbot">Humanbot</a>, I doubt the desirability of a separate user account. The bot will be tested on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Sandbox</a> during development (providing manual reverts if the bot malfunctions). It is being developed using <a href="http://www.php.net/curl" class="external text" title="http://www.php.net/curl" rel="nofollow">PHP/cURL</a>.

<p>The bot fetches all Secunia pages linked to in the article, counts the critical advisory, and updates that number in the article accordingly. It also updates the footnote that specifies when the table was last updated. The secunia.com terms and conditions <a href="http://secunia.com/terms_and_conditions/" class="external autonumber" title="http://secunia.com/terms_and_conditions/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> seem to permit such usage of their site, since their information is not redistributed, only linked to.</p>

<dd>The bot only makes an edit if anything is to be changed, which will be once a day because it also updates the "this information was last updated on" line below the table. Of course it would be possible to not do that, but I think it is important to tell the reader of the table whether the data is current or not. Note that the edit is marked as minor if only the date is updated, or as a normal edit otherwise. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESperling_08fa.html" title="User:Sperling">K.

<dd>Currently it updates the number of unpatched vulnerabilities marked "less critical" and above, and also the date of the oldest of those, if any.

<p>As both a grammar-nazi and a motorcycle enthusiast, seeing "Harley Davidson" just irks the crap out of me.</p>

<p>I've been fixing such mistakes when I come upon them manually, but there are a lot (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Harley_Davidson" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Harley_Davidson" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) to do. All I want to do is make a bot which strafes the wiki entries which use the phrase "Harley Davidson" and change it to "Harley-Davidson".</p>

<p>Hi I've put together a little bot that will read all the pages linked to from the Main Page and parse them searching for bad grammar. I then take the result file and copy paste it to my user talk page. It does NOT make any changes to any pages or even have the capability to do so. I have more info at My user talk page.

An edit+rename would show up as <i>two</i> separate entries in the history, in any case. What we are seeing here is one. Indeed, I cannot think of a way to actually do what appears to have been done here â€” to rename an article <i>and</i> modify it at the same time. There's no way to do that using the normal web interface as far as I know. I suspect a server error. Perhaps some edits are not being displayed in the history. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:30, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've contacted Brion Vibber, who has done some checking. As I understand xyr explanation: The wrong version of the page was listed in the server database as the current version, causing the server to revert to that version when the article was renamed. This is a database problem and nothing to do with the 'bot. The exact same thing would have happened had anyone renamed the article manually. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:36, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm writing a bot which I plan to run as <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobo_2836.html" title="User:Cobo">User:Cobo</a> once it's finished. The basic idea is detailed on its user page. In short, it'll hunt out copyvios in new articles and change them to the <tt>{{copyvio|url=blah}}</tt> template. I might also add in the ability for it to detect and revert common types of obvious vandalism (also detailed on the user page), but this will need extensive testing on a dummy Wiki before it would ever come near here.</p>

<dd>How is that going to work? Will it google for things and look for text that is basically identical, or what? By the way, don't forget that alot of copyvio'ers use the "borrowed" material as a source, but it's not neccesarily listed properly. And, it's a good idea to put the {{nothanks}} template on their user page. Maybe make a version that notes that it was done by a bot, and give a link to your talk page, so they can ask about it. I think you could do this and do it quite well, personally. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <b>(<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">talk</a>)</b> 23:39, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Approved for running for one month testing. May apply bot flag after that. Nothing against you, Veratien, it's a great idea, but as you said, it's still experimental, and want your bot to be more solid before it applies for bot flag. I'm trying to take the stance that this page is a proposal page to run a program on the Wikipedia, and they have to have a reasonable and solid proposal for running their bot. This is only to demonstrate the proof of burden and that a user will be responsible enough to take care of their bot and not let it go run amok. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 04:28, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Cool idea, but I don't actually think this one should run with the Bot flag at all. It won't have a high edit rate, and it'll strongly benefit from having the odd user look over its shoulder.

<dd>Traditional bots do leisurely janitorial work: fixing an interwiki link or a bit of text there.

<li>I tend to think the bot should be OK in this instance as long as the set number of moves is higher than what any normal editor can reasonably be expected to make and also lower than or equal to the number of moves Willy usually makes in a minute. It may be tricky to find that balance; Curps should be careful to check and quickly unblock any legitimate user affected by it. The problem, which occurs to me, is that the bot may ironically end up blocking people who are trying to move pages back to where they should be. Is there a way to deal with this? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:10, 1 September 2005 (UTC) <small>(copied from the administrator's noticeboard to here, as it deals with proposed modifications to the 'bot before community approval. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:18:39, 2005-09-01 (UTC))</small></li>
<li>When it comes to running automated tools under the aegis of accounts that have been granted administrator privileges by the community, I'm largely in agreement with <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> (see above). All of my automated tools run under the aegis of unprivileged accounts (<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_%27bot_00ba.html" title="User:Uncle G's 'bot">User:Uncle G's 'bot</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_major_work_%27bot_fee3.html" title="User:Uncle G's major work 'bot">User:Uncle G's major work 'bot</a>) in accordance with the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_least_privilege.html" title="Principle of least privilege">principle of least privilege</a>. Exercise of administrator privileges by a tool that does not require a human to explicitly pull the trigger each time is not something that should be accepted as a matter of routine. <a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a> has already described how this 'bot has already made a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_positive.html" title="False positive">false positive</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_major_work_%27bot_fee3.html" title="User:Uncle G's major work 'bot">User:Uncle G's major work 'bot</a> does page moves, with a delay in between each operation. I have no way of knowing whether it will be hit by this 'bot. Indeed, how is <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> to know whether <a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortal_namespace_initialisation_script_4076.html" title="User:Portal namespace initialisation script">Portal namespace initialisation script</a> (<a href="../../../p/o/r/User_talk%7EPortal_namespace_initialisation_script_6d79.html" title="User talk:Portal namespace initialisation script">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Portal_namespace_initialisation_script_9be5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Portal namespace initialisation script">contribs</a>), or any other mass rename done by developers under role accounts, will be hit by <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a>' bot? Furthermore, why does the 'bot exclude administrators? It seems to operate on the premise that ordinary users are not allowed to revert vandalism. Speaking as an editor who reverted vandalism as an ordinary user here, and who still reverts vandalism (including page move vandalism) as an ordinary user elsewhere, I find that premise unacceptable. The more ordinary users who help in protecting against vandalism, the better.
<p>Certainly this 'bot should not be approved unless its operation is more thoroughly documented, and the concerns raised here addressed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:18:39, 2005-09-01 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Fvw did a very large number of moves in rapid succession and triggered the threshold; I have since set the threshold even higher. Also, he was only blocked because I inadvertently left him off the list of admins because <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_administrators_8c59.html" title="Wikipedia:List of administrators">Wikipedia:List of administrators</a> listed him as "inactive"; I have since added all "inactive" administrators to the "do not block" list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Why does the bot exclude administrators?" Because it's intended solely to stop pagemove vandals and it's assumed that by definition administrators can't be vandals (perhaps they could be, but then we'd have far more to worry about than just page moves). Of course ordinary users are "allowed" and even expected to help protect against vandalism. There's no intent to discriminate, but excluding admins is simply practical and sensible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a traditional bot; it does not edit any pages. Also, <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a> is very quiet compared to AN and AN/I and far fewer eyes see the discussions here. I posted originally to AN/I and fvw has started a discussion at AN, so it's best to consolidate the discussion there.</dd>

<dd>PS, the latest Willy vandalism does 75 pagemoves per minute. If the block bot is disabled and we end up with many hundred pages to be moved back, can we count on you to pitch in? And then do it all over again, nine times in one day? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 10:57, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, I would like to say that I have no objections to this Bot, for the most part. On the other hand, a bot is a bot is a bot. I think that every bot used on the Wikipedia should have approval for <i>continued</i> use on the Wikipedia, and it should have its own account. Also, since this Bot is running 24/7, but Curps can't be monitoring it 24/7, there should be some provision for a couple of other trusted editors to help supervise it.</p>
<p>For one example of where a change might be needed--The odds are the Willy vandal probably reads many of the discussions about him, and so he now knows that he needs to throttle down the number of page moves that he does.</p>
<p>Also, since this bot has the possibility of false positives (someone with a broadband connection and using a tabbed browser like Mozilla can do plenty of edits in a minute), there should be greater publicity--perhaps a mention in <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">Wikipedia:Signpost</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">âˆ…</font></a> 13:32, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why does the bot need to do an indefinite block? How about a block for something like half an hour, if it detects 3 pagemoves a minute? It could then put an automated notice on a page where other admins could review these blocks and see they should be upgraded to a permanent block, or unblocked as a false positive. This would immediately chill willy's actions, and a half an hour false positive isn't going to kill anyone. As admins are whitelisted, they wouldn't be caught for reverting damage. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorvy_be2a.html" title="User:Norvy">Norvy</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorvy_add3.html" title="User talk:Norvy">(talk)</a> 03:16, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is the way multiple blocks work. In recent cases, when the bot has blocked, very often another admin or two blocks a minute or two later (unfortunately, at 75 pagemoves per minute, even a minute's delay can be very expensive). However, if the bot blocks for half an hour and other admins block indefinitely, ALL blocks get removed when the half hour's up. That's the way the software works. So there's no way for the bot to block for a short time and still allow other admins to block indefinitely, unless they laboriously unblock and reblock (which is downright unwise if Willy's bot gets unblocked even momentarily). In any case, I do review any blocks the bot has made (immediately, if I'm around at the time). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:13, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, I support the running of this bot, but I recommend a trial run period of two weeks. This bot should immediately stop running if no one is taking care of it. By "taking care of it," that user must have access to the physical code of the bot, and whatever account it is run on. Just covering all the bases, Curps. As tragic as it may be, if, for whatever reason, you decide to leave the Wikipedia community, the bot unfortunately has to stop running on your own account. I'm trying to think... Curps, is there any way for you to add some kind of form system that allow you to log unblock requests? Although such a form would be subject to abuse, it's just a suggestion. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:03, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, due to the very nature of what the bot is fighting against, it needs to run at all times, 24/7. I have now added a feature to make the bot post a notice to an admin discussion page (AN/I) when it does a block. Unfortunately this failed the last time because the page move vandal moved AN/I itself and turned it into a redirect (!) (I thought such pages were protected against moves?). This should ensure that any accidental block will not last long. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:30, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way a good filter is that not to block users with "old" edits, at least I would guess most vandals register a new account and don't go on and edit (usefully) some article, then wait for weeks. Old edits can be checked by checking the oldest edits of the user. A reasonable "minimal user age" (age of oldest edit) and "minimal number of non-suspicious edits" should be guessed upon. Would minimalise blocking real editors.

<dd>The problem with this suggestion is that pagemove vandal bots are moving pages at a rate of 75-90 pages per minute. They have to be stopped immediately. In the time it takes to look up a user's edit history a lot of damage can be done (especially given Wikipedia's very uncertain response time, and the fact that it takes two page fetches to see a user's earliest contributions). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:30, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
