<p>This sounds a little open-ended to me, especially given the "for now", the "etc", and the all-embracing nature of "cleanup" (ah, the edits I've seen under such a summary...). Are there really so many of these that supervised use of AWB isn't perfectly adequate? Can you confirm this will be a) only be run on SG articles, until such time as separate approval is requested (and granted), b) will confine itself to SG-specific terminology and proper nouns, and c) will work to a pre-published list (linked to from the wikiproject, at a minimum) of s&amp;r's? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 22:55, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yep. I'm only asking for the bot for convienience's sake. There are like 500 articles related to Stargate on WP. Do me a favour though - if you're not going to grant it - which is okay of course - please delete the <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbotim_a64d.html" title="User:Albotim">User:Albotim</a> userpage and account.

<dd>How many images are we talking about here? Is it going to cause a strain on the Wikimedia servers by uploading so many images in quick sucession? Is your bot going to add a fair use rational to every-one of the images? Are the images going to be placed in their respected articles within 7 days? It seems to me, that there is a lot involved in image uploading, not just the uploading part, that would make it foolish to be done with a bot. That could be just me, but could you expand further on how many images this bot will be uploading? --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 13:57, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have about 400 distinct IC manufacturers logos(fair use), so the bot is fairly practical. No they will not be put into their respective articles in 7 days because most not even have companies articles yet, but i will I put them all on an article similar to this, User:ZyMOS-Bot/list of ic manufacturer logos. So far i have created 3 new articles for 3 companies, but I have been hesitant to continue until this is resolved. I added the <i>sleep 2s</i> between each upload to try and reduce strain. I try to upload all non-fair use pictures to wikimedia-commons because i was told to by another wiki-admin. I have a couple hundred IC package drawings that i created(GFDL) so i will upload them to wikimedia-commons, as it was suggested for me to do. And again i would make the list page first, and gradually add to each individual page. But as of now I have waited until add problems are solved. I don't plan on using the script often, i think i only used it 2-3 times on my <a href="http://en.howto.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://en.howto.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikihowto Site</a>.

<dd>I was just using that page as <i>my sandbox</i>, but if that is improper i will delete it. Maybe you can help me understand what is an acceptable way to do this. I am an electrical engineer, it is often useful to know the logo of a company to identify a chip. I assume that wikipedia would want this information that it currently does not have. I was thinking a usefully page would be to have the logos on the page labeled with their companies respective names. I found this page displaying state flags and labeled with their respective states. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_e889.html" title="Flags of the U.S. states">Flags_of_the_U.S._states</a>. I think this is the same idea, different licenses. I would hate to see this data not entered on a mater of protocol. And if it is not added in bulk, it will likely be added one by one for years, and many likely to get lost it time. I can not make individual pages for these. If i did one a day it would take about two years. I am also an archivist, and have archived 10,000+ IC data sheets for <a href="http://www.archive.org" class="external free" title="http://www.archive.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.archive.org</a>, so i hate the idea of lost information. I am trying to do the right thing. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith</a>. So please tell me how this should be done?</dd>

<dd>Also note that fair use images that are orphaned for 7 days are often deleted. They are tagged automaticly by a bot if they aren't inserted within a certain amount of time. I'm not sure if uploading 400 at once is a good idea if they are just going to be deleted a week later. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 02:05, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Add functionallity to <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefanBot_34f7.html" title="User:StefanBot">StefanBot</a></span></h2>
<p>I would like to add the permission for my current bot to add conservation status to taxoboxes. I have asked above at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html#Add_conservation_status_to_taxoboxes" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">Add_conservation_status_to_taxoboxes</a> with no reply so far. The bot is now ready for initial testing (have updated 2 articles so far with no problem). See also discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_7339.html#What_to_include_in_reference_section" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life">Tree of life</a> It is written in pyton using the pywikiframe work. It will be run when needed, first until all articles with taxoboxes are updated, then when new articles are created. It will be run by a human, not scheduled.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bot is already approved for adding fishbase and ITIS links and have been doing that for half a year of so with no complaints.</li>
<li>I am also requesting a bot flag, or permission to do more than 2 updates for minute, see previous request above<a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html#User:StefanBot_bot_flag_approval_request" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">StefanBot_bot_flag_approval_request</a> also no reply yet!</li>

<li><s><b>Oppose</b></s>, but only because i've just written a bot to do this too. Sorry I didn't see your comments on Tree of Life sooner or we could have reduced duplicated effort. My bot is similar, but adds proper references to IUCN (i'm using {{<a href="../../../i/u/c/Template%7EIUCN2006_66e3.html" title="Template:IUCN2006">IUCN2006</a>}} instead of {{<a href="../../../i/u/c/Template%7EIUCN_8d90.html" title="Template:IUCN">IUCN</a>}}. I'm also using the newer syntax for the status (e.g. Status = VU) and also a few other features. (see <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeastie_Bot_f121.html" title="User:Beastie Bot">Beastie Bot</a>).

<dd>Well I have already run my bot, very few missing conservation statuses found only about 100+, maybe you can find a few more with a smarter way of running it and I did not do sub species or varieties. Never got any response in tree of life if I should add {{<a href="../../../i/u/c/Template%7EIUCN_8d90.html" title="Template:IUCN">IUCN</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../i/u/c/Template%7EIUCN2006_66e3.html" title="Template:IUCN2006">IUCN2006</a>}} so I did not, if you are planning to do that I suggest you get consensus at tree of life, I got no response on that, but I think we should. Also I used the old conservation status syntax, just because I looked at examples not so much at the Tree of life description, so suggest that your bot should change to new. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefan_3752.html" title="User:Stefan">Stefan</a> 01:12, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">User:Bot-maru</span></h2>
<p>Bot-maru is my account for running both automatic and semi-automatic editting scripts; it's a throttled Pywikipedia setup which I update from CVS every other day or so, and when the script supports it, I use my XML dump instead of the live Wikipedia to save on bandwidth. The user page has the requisite information suggested at the top of this page, and it is also listed/registered over on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a>.</p>
<p>The automatic edits generally fall into updating links (using standardize_interwiki.py or inter-wiki.py) and updating templates (for example, recently it was converting from {{<a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStarwars-stub_49b5.html" title="Template:Starwars-stub">starwars-stub</a>}} to the more proper {{<a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStarWars-stub_8669.html" title="Template:StarWars-stub">StarWars-stub</a>}}). I hope to eventually modify the weblinkchecker.py program so that it can add <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Archive_a5d5.html" title="Internet Archive">Internet Archive</a> links to broken external links. Now, I have received a number of complaints on its talk page about making edits to fix blatant spelling corrections and disambiguation fixes to talk pages, but those were all for my semi-automated editting with pywikipedia, and not my automatic ones. Though I disagree strongly with the complainers, I am looking for a way to exclude the Talk: namespace from my replacements, so that should not be an issue. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 17:45, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b> I don't trust a bot under this name until concrete reasons can be given for ignoring multiple complaints on his talk page in regards to that and assurances including the routines used can be given for how this bot will exclude user, user talk, and archive pages. I am also opposed in general to spelling bots as they in general are a bad idea due to the fact that automated spelling has so many flaws due to differences in American English (AE) and British English (BE) as well as the other variations in english. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 17:50, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Concrete reasons? Because fixing spelling is not a bad thing.

I would support this bot however if you got rid of the spellchecker functioning and could successfully make it stay out of user, user talk, talk, and archive pages since those are my only points of contention with the bot, I definitely like what I've been seeing in terms of it's work with star wars templates and once this is all cleared up would love to see that continue. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 20:00, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'd just like to note that this is not a vote in no sense, and Pegasus's and Aponar's votes can be overruled at any time by a decision of the approval group.

<dd>Yes it isn't a vote just like RFA isn't a vote but the approvals group is to a certain extent bound by consensus of the comments posted in regards to the bot so there's no way they'd actually go against valid concerns with the bot, I also am willing to assume good faith in the fact that I'm sure that the committee will listen to any valid criticisms of the bot. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 21:22, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, the approvals group is more of an advisory body than anything else which was laid out when they were approved. They can of course approve or deny trial runs but when it comes down to the bot flag the bureaucrat doesn't listen to them, he/she listens to their opinions as part of the whole opinion of those commenting on the bot. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 21:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Finally, I'd like to hear the opinions from the experts here on whether I should publish the pywikipedia patch which enables page moves. In the wrong hand, it may lead to WoW-style problems, though I think that this is not much of an issue with the all the countermeasures which have been implemented (page move throttle and revert), and there are also many good uses of this functionality. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 14:25, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good, since there've been been no objections I have begun working on this though since I do not have the coding skills to get this done well I have had to cludge some routines together using AWB to do this and so it will probably be fairly slow going, I also won't be able to do changes as the page changes as it were. If anyone with coding skills is willing to help out coding a bot please leave a note on my talk page, I would be extremely grateful since my current setup for this is definitely less than ideal. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 01:45, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been manually fixing things like cross-namespace redirects (before they get deleted in RfD, it's best to orphan them to not create redlinks) with AWB, but I'd like a bot flag so I don't have to click things each time and to not clog up recent changes. Speed would be 6-8 a minute. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory096</a> 19:13, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True, but there are the occasional ones that have a couple thousand (I cleared out 1800 to WikiProject U.S. Cities yesterday).

<dd>You did 1,800 manual edits on your main account? Aww man&#160;:-( First thing I would recommend is to register that bot account and start using it with AWB.

<dd>You don't need a bot flag to run a secondary account for AWB. It's just a good idea, as it prevents spamming up your main account with thousands of bot-like edits. I'd like to wait a bit and see the kind of work RoryBot (the manual AWB bot) does for awhile before I can make a final decision on a bot flag. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:03, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Bolding" of featured articles that have been on the main page and connected tasks</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to use a bot to automatically indicate in the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">list of Featured articles</a> which articles have been featured on our main page. This used to be done by simply bolding the article's name; the new method uses a template and a stylesheet modification so that only interested users will see the bolding (see the source code for the page linked above for more information). The "bolding" itself is quite straightforward: at 0:00UTC, the bot would look at <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article">Wikipedia:Today's featured article</a> to know which article should be bolded, then it would (1) modify the list; (2) update the {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMainpage_date_to_come_fad5.html" title="Template:Mainpage date to come">Mainpage date to come</a>}} template on the article's talk page to {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMainpage_date_d215.html" title="Template:Mainpage date">Mainpage date</a>}}; (3) add the date to the list <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_nominated_in_2006_5a05.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles nominated in 2006">Wikipedia:Featured articles nominated in 2006</a> (or 2005, 2004, etc, depending on nomination date), thus a grand total of 3 edits per day. <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_articles_c405.html#Bot_to_automatically_.22bold.22_articles" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured articles">Wikipedia talk:Featured articles</a> has liked the idea so far.</p>
<p>My first, obvious, idea was to run this script as <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorglbot_114a.html" title="User:Zorglbot">User:Zorglbot</a>, which recently got a bot flag. However, I thought about a useful side effect if I do it under my own username: when doing edit number (2) above, I can automatically add to my watchlist the often-vandalised FA, and help keeping an eye on it. The edit summary would of course still reflect the fact than an automatic process did the job rather than a human.</p>
<p>For the practical details, the script is written in Perl and it shares a good deal of code with <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorglbot_114a.html" title="User:Zorglbot">User:Zorglbot</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tawkerbot2A (WoW gone as fast as normal vandalism)</span></h2>
<p>This is basically in response to Curps being semi away and the un-bot assisted WoW attack today. I'm pretty sure every reader here is aware of Tawkerbot2 and its vandal fighting abilities (to the point where I get complaints if the bot is offline). As such and seeing comments that WoW vandalism is up I have a new proposal for the codebase.</p>
<p>What Tawkerbot2A would do would be pretty simple.</p>
<p>If move is subject to subject + on wheels!</p>
<ul>
<li>Move back to original location overwriting if page history of the moved page is longer than page history of the deleted page</li>
<li>Delete the redirect</li>
</ul>
<p>If user triggers above action multiple times (say 3 times or more)</p>
<ul>
<li>Block user indef if username</li>
</ul>

<p>I know this one is a lot more contoversial, I'm willing to share the code on this one around a few people, so its not just myself and Joshbuddy who have code access, Pgk will also have a copy and so will Rob Church, Tim Starling, Curps, Freakofnurture, lightdarkness) etc. I'm not putting this one in a normal approvals policy (otherwise it'd be running by now&#160;:o ) mostly due to the flag it will need / the fact that it is contoversial and am putting this up for a full debate.

<dd>This seems like a great idea to me. There's basically no reason a user should be moving a page to anything with "on wheels!" for a legitimate reason.

<p>I have nothing contrary to running this bot. However, a past attempt from a user to acquire a second administrator account has shown large opposition from the community: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Genisock2_50c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Genisock2">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Genisock2</a>. Some of the objections raised there (including mine) do not apply here, but others do. It could be probably less controversial to run the bot using your regular account, just like Curps did. - Liberatore(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">T</a>) 11:02, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Go for it. That Genisock thing was another matter entirely. Tawkerbot needs a bot flag for reversing page move vandalism as well as blocking ridiculous vandals. Just this morning I woke up to an anonymous IP that had vandalized 29 times in a few minutes ... meanwhile, ctawkbot was complaining every single time but no one was awake to do anything about it. If Tawkerbot could block vandals on its own that'd be great. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 14:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there's never been a controversial WoW move.

<dd>A little actually. My concern is the abdication of human involvement in the process. Or at least, until a human has to clean up after a loose cannon bot (such as Tawkerbot2 was for a long time). There is also the scope creep: we were first told that an admin with a bot wasn't going to give the bot admin powers. But now... And now we're told it will only deal with WoW...but that obviously won't last...</dd>

<dd>Yeah, its possible to regex it so pages moved from * on wheels to * on wheels won't trigger it (why any page would be "on wheels" is beyond me, but its a possibility that will be addressed. Mostly the bot needs the sysop flag for 2 main reasons: 1) Users cannot delete, and deletion of the WoW redirects is necessary for decent operation and 2) As Cyde suggests, there are a lot of times when no admins are around monitoring the IRC feeds (ctawkbot had complained 28 times about vandalism but nobody around to hit block) - we've already had a bot that does the same thing (Curps) with minimal complaints, this is essentially a replacement -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 17:53, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

Ok, well, seeing how Curps's bot (and the lack of Curps bot was the entire reason this proposal came out, there was a need for a replacment and I was asked for one) has magically come back, the need for this bot has been become a lot less critical. Despite the fact that this really is a new bot (I just added its username somewhat similar to prevent major confusion and some vandal took Tawkerbot3 on me&#160;:( ) it does appear that people are paranoid about any concept of an automated tool having elevated access. It's pretty clear that a lot of people don't want this bot and I'm not about to break the trust the community placed in me and start sneaking stuff in. As for the scope issue, its a trust thing and if you honestly don't trust me, so be it, I don't have hurt feelings. This bot isn't the autorevert bot, its different but again, from what I've read any such admin bot will be opposed and its your choice to oppose it - I'll accept it, just don't complain about the lack of it later.</p>
<p>Yes, Tawkerbot2 was contoversial when it came out and no, it was other users who suggested it auto block (I said it was technically possible but I've always had reservations about it). Now when Tawkerbot2 goes down I get emails telling me that it's down and that they want it back. I really don't care if this bot goes operational or not, at least now I can go with a clear conscious that my solution was proposed and rejected, nobody can grumble about the lack of automated tools to help. -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 08:48, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It might not be a bad idea to have more than one bot that checks for pagemove vandalism (and blocks where necessary, maybe with notification via WP:AN/I or log page or IRC feed). Redundancy (or a fresh independent approach) wouldn't be a bad thing. Without getting into details I couldn't entirely guarantee that there wouldn't be any future bot downtime. One issue is that certain interesting but demanding real-life opportunities are pulling in a direction that will likely result in major time, mindshare and connectivity constraints, perhaps a semi-permanent semi-wikivacation. At some point meaningful participation and responsiveness and human oversight gets compromised, and so the viability becomes dicey. So maybe you should go ahead. Obviously bots are a far from ideal solution; really we need to see some significant software and even policy changes to get things on a sustainable basis, but there's no sign whatsoever of this happening, so bots are a "permanent stopgap". -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:54, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no problem with this proposal. I trust Tawker, and I trust his ability to code a bot. Provided that safeguards are put into place (Check if it was created as an "on wheels" page, etc), none of the reasons for opposition to oppose above really address the core issue, and that is: Is the bot harmless? (I believe that it is, provided that there are safeguards); Is it useful?

<li><b>Oppose</b>. A bad admin can do a LOT more damage than a normal user, so if the bot goes defunct, it might start reverting incorrectly or block innocent users. Also, suppose WoW moves <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> to Automobile on Wh33ls, using creative substitutions. Then the bot wouldn't catch that. Besides, we could simply create a new page for TB2 reports called Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism/TB2/WOW. Technically, you don't have to be an admin to revert (swap) two pages where the target page is only a redirect created by a move, logging its one single edit in its history. Suppose a WOW vandal moves <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Cheney_58d2.html" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> to Dick Cheney on Wheels.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Werdnabot protecting/editing protected User talk page archives.</span></h2>
<p>Werdnabot's been archiving user talk pages for a while now, and has occasionally had a bit of trouble appending to protected archives. Would it be possible to somehow (1) Allow Werdnabot to edit protected pages; and possibly but less likely (2) Allow archives made by Werdnabot to be optionally automatically protected.

<p>I am opposed to this. I don't think a bot should be going about protecting pages or editing protected pages.

<a name="Bot_suggestion" id="Bot_suggestion"></a>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot suggestion</span></h2>
<p>This suggestion is semi-theoretical, insofar as a) I don't know how to write or maintain a bot, and b) I haven't asked anyone else whether they'd write or maintain a bot, but since the functionality is pretty simple, I figure I may as well ask if such a bot would be approved rather than asking someone to write a possibly unlikely-to-be-approved bot.</p>
<p>According to current policy, users without a bot flag shouldn't make more than about two edits a minute. So my suggestion is to make a bot, preferably with sysop status (yes, already controversial there) that will monitor recent changes for extremely rapid editing by non-bot users. I was thinking something along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the bot detects six or more edits made by a single user over the course of one minute, it will internally add one "strike" to that user in its memory, which will expire in 24 hours.</li>
<li>Once a user accumulates three "strikes" (i.e., the user has made six or more edits over the course of a minute, occurring three times within 24 hours), the bot will leave a notice on the user's talk page pointing them to <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a> and saying they need approval and a bot flag if they want to make such quick edits. The user will acquire no more "strikes" for a period of ten minutes.</li>
<li>Once a user accumulates four "strikes" (i.e., the user has made six or more edits over the course of a minute, four times within 24 hours, including once more than ten minutes after they were told to stop), the bot will block them for one minute with a descriptive reason, and leave another notice on the user's talk page. Strike acquisition will continue immediately after the block expires.</li>
<li>Once a user accumulates five "strikes" (i.e., the user has made six or more edits over the course of a minute, five times within 24 hours, including once more than ten minutes after they were told to stop and once more after a one-minute block and a second warning), the bot will block user for one hour, whitelist him, and post on AN/I or WT:B or wherever noting the situation. Another notice is put on the user's talk page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, for a less controversial version, discard the blocking and just keep the notices. I think it would be preferable to keep the blocks, just for the purposes of damage control (assuming a large percentage of unapproved bots will either be doing something undesirable such as spellchecking, or will be buggy), but they could be dispensed with, in which case it might be better to post on AN/I or wherever somewhat more quickly. In either case, less flagrant violations of the rules (say four edits a minute) should result in posts somewhere but not blocks.</p>
<p>Of course, probably some people will think this is extreme. Personally, I would take a zero-tolerance policy to unauthorized bots. There's almost never an excuse to be making a lot of edits without a bot flag; it's indicative of a lack of community support. (There <i>are</i> exceptions, such as <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawkerbot2_313a.html" title="User:Tawkerbot2">User:Tawkerbot2</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">User:Curps</a>, who could be explicitly whitelisted.)

<dd>I have seen it. I don't think it's a useful starting point for my specific purpose. Those who frequent that page are mainly bot-makers; those who frequent this are the ones who decide whether to accept a bot.

<dd>I do stub-sorting and spellchecking (both script-assisted, but I'm the one that hits the "Save page" button) quite frequently, and notice in my contributions for today that I've hit three in less than a minute. I doubt this is exceptional, and imagine there are some users who edit similarly. Are you going to implement a whitelist or other method of telling your bot, "Hey, hold on, I'm not a bot!" for normal users? <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 18:10, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did say <i>six</i> edits in less than a minute for a reason. Six edits is way over the guideline of two a minute for non-bot users. And do recall that you get multiple warnings before any action is taken. But as for whitelisting normal users, well, no, that defeats the purpose. The idea is to stop people from running automated processes without approval, and if they're making six edits a minute, they're pretty obviously automated. Approved bots who have for some reason not been granted bot flags (such as <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawkerbot2_313a.html" title="User:Tawkerbot2">Tawkerbot2</a>) would be whitelisted, as noted. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 04:10, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could do more than 6 reverts in a minute fixing vandalism. Easy. I'll revert 12 times in a minute with assisted scripting killing off the AOLdos vandal's edits across 20 IPs. But this is in spurts, and I do mean spurts. You should rethink the time table. If a user makes 60 edits in 10 minutes (6/min over 10 minutes), that'd be a lot more reasonable. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 09:24, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This bot will use AWB and a simple script to add the {{linkless}} template to all listed orphan pages periodically. I believe this will spur the creation of links to them, distributing the work to people actually interested in the articles, and help deal with the large current backlog. I'd like to run this automatically after some trial runs for a few weeks, as this is a simple, automatic task with little chance for error. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:00, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SmackBot task approval V</span></h2>
<p>Task: To delink months of the year and days of the week in a pruned list of articles. Sample edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sha_Tin_Road&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57949126" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sha_Tin_Road&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57949126" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br />
Method: Automatically using AWB.<br />
Speed: 1-4 per minute.<br />
Number: c. 12,000 articles.<br />
Frequency: Once, possibly followed by monthly runs if needed (in which case a public whitelist will be made available).<br />
Duration: Will take from 3 days depending how many hours a day it is run.<br />
Testing: Several hundred articles have already been changed. A partial run was done earlier this year.<br />
Note: This is not touching the contentious areas of date editing.</p>

<p>This is a bot used on my wiki, that does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block vandals</li>
<li>Report blocks of pagemove vandals</li>
<li>Protect pages</li>
<li>Removes spam and adds warnings.</li>
</ul>

<p>This bot will run semi-automatic, meaning that all edits will be reviewed before editing a page.

<p><s>This is a bot created by <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">WickeThEwok</a> originally for the purpose of repairing disambiguation links for <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sasha.html" title="Sasha">Sasha</a>/<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Coe_f8ed.html" title="Alexander Coe">Alexander Coe</a>. It is manually assisted and will be run sporadically. In the future I plan to use this to assist with other such tasks, most often with respect to electronic music. It uses pywikipedia. I think this is important because there are many similar cases to this I have seen when dealing with music articles. Though if someone wants to run their bot to fix this that'd be great, too.

<li>Actually, it still seems to be editing at 3-5 per minutes, which if my arithmetic is correct is definitely not waiting "30-60 seconds between edits". Could you take care of that, please, and also (once again) clarify exactly what the scope you're asking to be considered approved? Bear in mind you can ask for further task approval later if your ambitions grow, but a clear initial statement would be good. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 05:53, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm looking for something a little more definitive than "at this point", and "look at the contribs". Bots as approved on the basis of undertaking <i>described</i> tasks: please describe the tasks you're seeking approval to perform, and confirm that you'll seek further approval for additional tasks. On editing speed: that's backwards. You run the bot at trial speed until such time as it's approved, you don't argue for a bot flag, on the basis that you're running it too fast for an unapproved bot. Please throttle appropriately from now on. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:04, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the clarification on scope; personally I'm completely happy with it running on that basis. I wasn't suggesting it wasn't approved for a trial run; I'm saying that until such time as it receives <i>final</i> aproval, i.e., receives a bot flag, it should really be running at "trail speed". (Now, if you were to ask why it takes so long to get a bot flag, I might be inclined to join you...) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 07:17, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
