<p>The result of the proposal was see below. We have a proposal to add new members of the approval group. It is understood that we have no election process. So this will be an <b>interim</b> election process. It is understood that these new approvals are needed because there are not enough active approval group members.

To simplify the procedure, I'll add his name to the group of others, just so if he is needed, he will already be voted on. Any others who care to join should just add their name to the list. The election will be closed by a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia%7EBureaucrats_5503.html" title="Wikipedia:Bureaucrats">bureaucrat</a> sometime on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, unless otherwise determined.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Since getting <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">User:BetacommandBot</a> approved I have monitored this page and have come to an understanding of what kinds of tasks bots can do easily; Subsuting and interwiki. I have also come to realize that some task should not be done by a bot; the anti-insult and the IRC #Wikipedia topic recording bot. As for why I should be part of the approval group: I am an experienced Wikipedian, bot operator (~20000 edits), and because I have been a user coming to this page for approval I have seen the problems and have also seen how this page can work and how important this is. As a concerned Wikipedian I noticed that the page needed cleaned up so I made a proposition. That is now being implemented. I have also noted that most of the approval group has been busy in other areas it does take them a while to respond to the page. I have sat back thinking <i>I understand that the users are busy but I understand this process and I can help</i> . As for my part on the approval group I will handle the simple interwiki, and subsuting bots myself, when a bot comes along that may be controversial I will still participate but will make sure that the approval group as a whole also has the same opinion. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> 04:11, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My comments are no replacement for a statement by Betacommand, but the recent reorganization of <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals</a> page was done at the suggestion of Betacommand. This to me clearly indicates a level of understanding of the process and bot policy. You can simply scroll up to see some of the discussion on that. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 18:35, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have experiance with wikicode and plywikipedia bot coding I have used some of the plywikipedia framework but for the task that i do i find that AWB works better; IE when i work on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_W_134c.html" title="WP:CFD/W">WP:CFD/W</a> some of the categories are under the User namespace i have seen that plywikipedia bots tend to parse the pages incorrectly and may make the page display incorrectly. one example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABetacommand&amp;diff=70226107&amp;oldid=70221381" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABetacommand&amp;diff=70226107&amp;oldid=70221381" rel="nofollow">Cydebot changing a category</a> on my userpage making it display improperly. I have worked with wikicode see User:Betacommand/sandbox for a barnstar that i created with wikicode. just because i dont use plywikipedia framework or other type of bot doesnt mean that i dont know how they work.

<p>I think I speak for others when I say that new members of this group should allow us to balance the approval process with more voices. Ideally, no bot would be approved with at *least* two members voiceing their opinion. Persons have different specialties and may be uniquely aware of problems with a bot request. More is better. I think it goes without saying that since there has been no established election process that the standard for removal of a member elected in this fashion should be relatively low, if need arises. If anyone elected here, including myself, violates this trust, they should be removed and discussions initiated immediately. Until we have hundreds of members, we can afford to be a bit more informal than, say, <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">RfA</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 18:45, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>General Comment</b> On the entire election procedure, I don't suppose most of the community would be able to participate in this. In order to be a member of the Approvals Group, a user needs to be trustworthy, of course, but a key aspect is having the technical skill necessary to judge the...well..technical aspects of a proposed bot. I'm able to support Voice of All because I'm fully aware of his technical knowledge, thanks to interaction and observation, over time. But as for other users, although I can judge whether or not they are trustworthy, it is difficult for me to determine if their level of knowledge would be sufficient for them to join the approvals group. It's simple, Approvals Group member = trustworthyness + technical knowledge. If I'm able to judge only half of this equation, then I can't, in full conscience, support or oppose anyone. I imagine that anyone who doesn't possess some deeper technical knowledge in the programming of bots would have difficulty judging the second half of this equation. That being the case, it would maybe be more efficient if we just had the current active members of the Approvals Group appoint a few new members, without the need for an election in which only a limited number of people can participate appropriately. That's my impression, at least. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 18:59, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a rather informal poll, and the lack of *most* of the approval group being active here is sufficient reason to "Be Bold" and add more members, at least in the interim. If approval group members want to comment here (either now or later when they return), they should clearly be given significant weight in the matter. As for who can vote? Bots affect the whole community, so the whole community should have a say in the matter. I appreciate your self restraint, but we could use all the comments we can get, so just vote with "<b>Comment</b>" or "<b>Neutral</b>" instead. It is more about building consensus than voting anyway. I'm not sure there is any rule that says you have to be a bot writer or run a bot to be a member of the approvals group either. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 19:10, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That would be fine by me too, although I'd hope that nobody would list themselves here if they don't have the requisite technical knowledge. For my part, I'll add a brief technical resume. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC) (edit conflict)
<dl>
<dd>I've changed my mind on this. Technical knowledge is important, but it is FAR more important to understand general wikipedia policy. When a bot idea is proposed, it is usually fairly trivial to know if it will cause any technical problems. Plenty of us that can determine that. However, it is far less trivial to know whether a bot task violates some written or unwritten wikipedia policy. For example, one of the current bot requests deals with placing WikiProject boilerplates on talk pages. At one point in history this was a very contentious issue. The rambot was once turned down because of trying to do that. However, consensus on that issue appears to have changed. As a result, it's important to have a wide range of skills in the approvals group so that these types of issues can be detected early, rather than later in the process. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 19:22, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think consensus has changed on that issue largely because of WP1 assessments. I've tagged over 100,000 talk pages for WPBio and other large Projects and I've only had one serious objection. That speaks volumes to me as I can remember debate over the very existence of these banners some months ago. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:26, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree with RM, the key to aproving bots is knowledge of wikipedia policies, the rules for bots is not very clear and it not followed very strictly and really is very unconsistant in many cases, and they are really as I see it a legacy that RM started when everyone was 'afraid' of bots and wanted to make it hard for him and other to run bots, now we have bots that revert vandalism, we have AWB, but still the same arcane rules for bots. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefan_3752.html" title="User:Stefan">Stefan</a> 15:33, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Election" deadline and closing</span></h2>
<p>In order for this election to run and conclude to contention, maybe it would be interesting to set a "deadline" for it, at the end of which a Bureaucrat could assess the result and "officially" add the new names to the Approvals Group page. This would make the definition more transparent and neutral, so no one has to say "ok, I'm approved, adding my own name now". As a Bureaucrat who is active in setting flags, I do volunteer to do that if wanted -- however, since I've already pledged my support to one of the candidates, I would understand if the community would prefer to have someone else do it. We could ask Taxman or Nichalp to do it. Just to be clear: this is by no measure a proposal for a new official task for Bureaucrats, just an <i>ad hoc</i> role to help this run as smoothly as possible. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 19:35, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, as a bureaucrat, feel free to close this "election" when it appears to be finished. We'd like to add the new members "as soon as possible", but allow enough time to get enough comments. Setting a date seems inflexible, and it should be pretty obvious when the votes stop trickling in. If you need an impartial third-party, feel free, but I won't complain if you do it yourself. We are all riddled with conflicts of interest here, afterall, a bot owner will always have a conflict of interest when making and applying bot policy and in bot approvals. It's to be expected. Once we have appointed interim members, we can work on forming a more official process. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 19:52, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great. Just one thing: two candidates have commented on this directly, and each has said something different, so I'd like to know if the participating community would prefer that I, Redux, recuse myself from "closing" this. I have no problem with it, since I have supported one of the candidates. I believe that I am the only Bureaucrat monitoring actively the bot-related forums (they are all on my watchlist) now that Essjay is away temporarily, but I suppose we can <s>pester</s> ask Taxman or Nichalp to do it. In RfA, participating directly in the discussions, to any extent, would mean a recusation, but since this is not exactly an established procedure for this forum, and the outcome is not likely to be contentious, I would like to get a clear position from the community on this. If my being on top of this will help, great; but if recusing myself is what would be best for all, then that's ok too.

IMHO, the same Bureaucrat would close the entire thing, determining the results for all candidates and which ones will join the Approvals Group. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 03:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then if *any* results are overly close, just ask another bureaucrat to handle closing the whole election. Whatever the choice, I probably don't care one way or another, so I'll let people who actually has a strong opinion on this discuss this one further, if desired. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 04:05, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's an easier way - recruit RM and VOA now. Seriuously, is anybody going to oppose either of them? I'm sure the approval of current members would be quite sufficient.; Leave me and the chimp up for consideration as extra or standby members. That way you get two new, capable members instantly, and they can get to work clearing the backlog. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:41, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree we don't need to make this overly complicated. I can't see if being a question of the current group recruiting since I don't see that as the correct way of approaching it. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 12:55, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RESULT: New members of Approvals Group</span></h2>
<p>As discussed above, I, Redux, acting as closing Bureaucrat <i>ad hoc</i>, have assessed the following final outcome for the candidates: (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp">Alphachimp</a>:

</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Final result</dt>
</dl>
<p>I have determined that the following users have achieved sufficient support to join the Approvals Group:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">Kingboyk</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All">Voice of All</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these users have received 100% support and are hereby "promoted" (if we can use this term). I will add their names to the Approvals Group page momentarily. Authority to approve bots (and their flagging) is effective as of this post.</p>
<p><i>Note 1:</i> Concerning my closing of this election, as discussed above, I closed it because the results for the only candidate about whom I commented were uncontroverted (100% support). The majority of the opinions given above were in the sense that I should recuse myself only if there were a controversy in need of settling at closing time. Since that wasn't the case, I've closed the election.</p>
<p><i>Note 2:</i> Regarding Alphachimp: I realize that participation in this election was particularly restricted, as well as that the two oppositions raised were weak. However, in light of the fact that all of the other candidates approved had 100% support going in, I viewed it as inconsistent to "promote" (for lack of a better term that I can think of at this time) a user with a support consensus that was well beneath that. But please remember that this is not RfA. Alphachimp, or someone on his behalf, could resubmit his name for reconsideration at any time, even immediately, if they feel that this result might not have been satisfactory -- but this means a new consideration of his name by the community, not a review of this result, which is final.</p>
<p>I hope this has been satisfactory. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 20:30, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Everything is as it should be, IMO. As for Alphachimp, I suspect that we will be forming a more official election scheme in the near future, and as such it shouldn't be hard to reevaluate membership at this point. I can't speculate on exactly how long that might take, but it could be sooner rather than later if required. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 22:36, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thank you Redux. Fellow group members, as I said before I'm a bit busy at the moment with programming and testing. I have the page on my watchlist and would like to make sure I'm fully up to speed with what happens here before diving in. So, you'll be seeing me some time fairly soon but not just yet. Cheers. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 08:19, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
