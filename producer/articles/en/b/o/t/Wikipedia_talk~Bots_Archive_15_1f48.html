<ul>
<li>Details: The misapplication of {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}}, which is supposed to be used at the top of an article, has been brought up several times. I will modify a pywikimedia tool to change {{main|}} references which are "too far" from the top to a cousin such as {{seemain|}}. "Too far" will be a small number of text lines which have no leading nonalphabetic characters, thus accepting various templates and Wiki markup as being part of the "top". The above test tends to fail by overlooking some candidates, which merely does not change the current situation. I have not here defined the template to change to due to an ongoing discussion (improperly taking place in TfD) which will end soon and may change details, but the discussion will not change the existing tangle to be cleaned up. The needed code is trivial compared to the previous activities. (<a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_ba0d.html" title="User:SEWilco">SEWilco</a> 07:44, 10 July 2005 (UTC))</li>
<li>Schedule: I request the bot flag because by the time there is a week of history its work will be done, and a history of the behavior of my other tools exists. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%26target%3DSEWilcoBot_4a1c.html" title="Special:Contributions&amp;target=SEWilcoBot">Special:Contributions&amp;target=SEWilcoBot</a> I point out that the mostly repetitious edits of <a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_Sandbox_1604.html" title="User:SEWilco/Sandbox">User:SEWilco/Sandbox</a> are examples of the testing given to tools.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to elaborate my reasoning, SEWilco's bot is described as "one-time" usage. I will approve for SEWilco to get his bot flag if he can boil down his specifics of what the bot will be used for. The reason behind this is that if the bot is going to run, it should run for something very specific and not at whim for one time tasks. This is only an insurance to as what we know SEWilco's bot is doing and whether or not the community approves it. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:40, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Based upon the descriptions of existing bots, and the variety of existing tools, I had not realized the bot flag was assigned for a specific task. It had seemed to me that the bot flag was a courtesy to reduce cluttering the changes visible to users during routine/maintenance alterations. I assumed this bot-usage community would still know what a bot is doing despite the flag (or due to it, if some people/bots have a "show only bot activity" ability). I thought these descriptions are part of that exchange, although some are rather brief. The speed privileges are minimal, and their import is actually in the rules throttling the unflagged to reduce speedy damage from the careless. (<a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_ba0d.html" title="User:SEWilco">SEWilco</a> 09:04, 19 July 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>There was a whole issue with <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">Anthony DiPierro</a> where his bot was doing something that it was not suppose to do. A complaint was made here about it. What I am finding is that less and less people are worrying about what bots are doing and more and more are paying attention to vandalism. I am not saying you are a bad user, but I don't want somewhere down the line where users complain about why this and that person is permitted to run a bot that is doing something it wasn't designed or suppose to do. I don't mean to offend you or sound very bureacratic, but I feel that very few people come to review this page. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 04:58, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shark articles unifying bot</span></h2>
<p>I request to run a bot, this is answers to the questions to be answered when requesting to run one.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bot will be manually supervised</li>
<li>The bot will run while there is suitable task for it to do, there is no fixed set of tasks and therefore no fixed time line as of now.</li>
<li>pywikipedia</li>
<li>The first purpose is to unify the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sharks.html" title="List of sharks">shark articles</a>, to put fishbase, ITIS, marinebio links using the correct templates, if this works out (I have not run any wiki bot before so not sure how complicated it is) I might want to do other work to unify the articles later, and change/add the same templates for other fish articles also. I expect to be able to find the scientific name from tax box and add fishbase template autoatically, need to think a bit more about other references.</li>
<li>There are about 30+ shark articles now, a bot would make things much faster (I expect)</li>

<dd>For countries/regions with the terms "Republic" or "Islands" in their short name, correct grammar is "Flag of the Czech Republic", not "Flag of Czech Republic". Image names are expected to follow the same naming rules as article, AFAIK, so this grammar mistake should be corrected, and it'll be much easier with a bot. Furthermore, I've managed to upload basically all the national flags in svg format, and those should replace the earlier png versions, so the bot could be put to further use... Sorry if I'm getting on your nerves, but your bot seemed to be available for tasks. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Image%7EAustria_flag_large.png_25c1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b3/Austria_flag_large.png/15px-Austria_flag_large.png" alt="" width="15" height="10" longdesc="../../../a/u/s/Image%7EAustria_flag_large.png_25c1.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion">ナイトスタリオン</a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion">✉</a> 00:04, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry for stepping in. Currently, I'm replacing calls of <a href="../../../i/f/_/Template%7EIf_c88e.html" title="Template:If">template:if</a> to the server friendlier <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a> (AzaToth is the original inventor of qif).</dd>
<dd>We are currently accused for server strain by some Wikipedians at <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> and I feel the technology behind if/qif is a bit "at stake" at the moment. There is a possibility that lot's of templates, among which are <a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWeb_reference_4011.html" title="Template:Web reference">template:web reference</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">template:book reference</a> are abolished due to pressure originating from <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>.</dd>
<dd>"What links here" of template:if brings up a list of about 20'000 articles but I estimate that about 80..90% of the listed pages in fact do not use if as we are in the consolidation process to qif. So it is quite hard to find the real uses of template:if.</dd>
<dd>I've been working together with AzaToth around if/qif and templates "web reference" and "book reference" and others. I can affirm he is a nice person and he abides be the rules of wikipedia. I have just asked User:Bluemoose for a touch run on this, but I personally would think it would be good if AzaToth would be enabled to run a bot for touching so we might be able to lighten Bluemoose a bit from such requests, although I can say he's very kind and helpful. If AzaBot would get green light, I would ask AzaToth for such touch runs. – Adrian | Talk 21:58, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does this also mean you oppose exchanging calls of <a href="../../../i/f/_/Template%7EIf_c88e.html" title="Template:If">template:if</a> with the server friendlier <a href="../../../q/i/f/Template%7EQif_07e1.html" title="Template:Qif">template:qif</a>?

The bot performed well for this task and would continue to disambiguate pages. Additionally I would like to use it to solve disambiguation and redirects on specific firearm pages. There are numerous links on each firearm page to the particular ammunition used by said firearm. One that is a particular issue is <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm.html" title="9 mm">9 mm</a>, <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Luger_571b.html" title="9 mm Luger">9 mm Luger</a> and <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Parabellum_bae0.html" title="9 mm Parabellum">9 mm Parabellum</a>, that all link through a redirect pointing to <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Luger_Parabellum_85d8.html" title="9 mm Luger Parabellum">9 mm Luger Parabellum</a>. In the first case <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm.html" title="9 mm">9 mm</a> could refer to <a href="../../../9/_/x/9_x_18_mm_PM_7177.html" title="9 x 18 mm PM">(9 x 18 mm)</a>, <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Browning_Long_86fc.html" title="9 mm Browning Long">(9 x 20 mm SR)</a>, <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Glisenti_443b.html" title="9 mm Glisenti">9 mm Glisenti</a>, <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Luger_Parabellum_85d8.html" title="9 mm Luger Parabellum">(9 x 19 mm)</a>, <a href="../../../9/_/x/9_x_21_mm_IMI_24be.html" title="9 x 21 mm IMI">(9 x 21 mm)</a>, <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Steyr_66aa.html" title="9 mm Steyr">(9 x 23 mm Steyr)</a>, or <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Largo_1775.html" title="9 mm Largo">(9 x 23 mm Largo)</a> while <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Luger_571b.html" title="9 mm Luger">9 mm Luger</a> and <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Parabellum_bae0.html" title="9 mm Parabellum">9 mm Parabellum</a> are both 9X19.

<p>Hmm. Can we tag these with a category? I go through runs asking people to delete images, and I generally start with Orphaned images advertising to prospective deleters that the probability of someone complaining about the deletion is fairly low... But that is only true for naturally orphaned images. Also be aware that if you do this to fair use images it is going to cause them, ultimately, to become targets under the fair use CSD. (course, they are already CSD so...). --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 03:44, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What sort of categorization are you thinking of? The bot already puts a list of what pages the image was removed from on the image description page, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Barenl_onstage.jpg&amp;diff=30973449&amp;oldid=30285003" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Barenl_onstage.jpg&amp;diff=30973449&amp;oldid=30285003" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> for an example.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any fair-use image that this bot removes is <i>already</i> a CSD, because it was unsourced. Making it an orphaned fair-use image won't change things one bit. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 06:54, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Hi, I'm doing some research to try to help people find pages to edit -- in particular, stubs that they might be willing to contribute to. We're doing some information retrieval stuff on a dump of the database to come up with algorithms for predicting edits based on other edits, and eventually we'd like to see if we can help real humans find articles they'd like to work on.</p>
<p>I am considering writing <a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESuggestBot_0d37.html" title="User:SuggestBot">SuggestBot</a>, a bot that selects a set of users, looks at their contribution history, picks a set (10-100, not sure yet) of stub pages they might be willing to edit, and posts that set of pages to the user's talk page. All processing except posting would happen on our lab's servers, using dumps of the Wikipedia database.<br /></p>
<p>1. Whether the bot is manually assisted (run by a human) or automatically scheduled to run<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>This bot would be manually assisted<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>2. The period, if any, we should expect it to run<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometime in January for a few weeks, more if it produces favorable results.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>3. What language or program it is running<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Not yet developed, but likely a standard framework for editing Wikipedia pages.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>4. The purpose of your bot<br /></p>
<p>a. Why do you need it?<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>To test our algorithms for recommending work to do in Wikipedia with real people, to help reduce the number of stubs in Wikipedia, and to help increase the amount of content and the value of Wikipedia.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>b. Is it important enough for the Wikipedia to allow your bot?<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I think so. A recent paper we did showed that 4 times as many people were willing to contribute to a movie database if we picked movies they had seen compared to other plausible strategies like picking recommended movies, random movies, or movies that appeared to be missing information. Showing these techniques work on Wikipedia could lay the foundation for increasing contributions to Wikipedia (and other online communities where people build community resources) and help to reduce the number of stub articles in Wikipedia.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>The slightly scary part to us is that we modify user talk pages. I'm not sure how people will react, and I'm looking for community guidance. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotificationBot_ebcc.html" title="User:NotificationBot">NotificationBot</a> alters talk pages, but at a user's request. I wonder whether/how much this would be perceived as spam.</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForteTuba_d7fd.html" title="User:ForteTuba">ForteTuba</a> 23:35, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting. I have some questions&#160;:
<ul>
<li>How does it work? Does it looks at the totality of what one user has edited, and the totality of what other users have edited, and then identify similar people (giving extra weighting to those who are extremely similar, and less to those who are semi-similar), and come to some list of recommendations based on what the people most like you have edited, but you have not? If so, I have wondered (purely conceptually) about doing the same thing for music. Basically we each like to think we unique - but we're not, and often specific people (who have never met, and who live in completely different locations) will have very similar tastes. For example, I have a good friend who lives in Sydney and who has musical tastes totally unlikely anyone else I know, who one day, purely-by-chance, found someone in the US, who had published their extensive list of music they owned on the Internet, and it was almost a verbatim match for his music collection. At first it kind of freaked my friend out, but then he promptly went out and bought those items this other person had and had liked, and he <i>really</i> enjoyed that new music. It saved him hours of research, of trial-and-error purchases - basically he could just go straight to the good stuff. He still checks back on the other guy's music collection, and will buy anything this other guy likes, because he knows that the chances he'll like it too are extremely high, because the totality of their musical tastes are extremely similar. Now, normally it's hard to do this for music because we just don't have the data (e.g. How do I know what music you've tried? How do you know what music I have tried? How do I know what you liked? How do you know what I liked?). However, with the Wikipedia, we <b>do</b> have some hard data, based on past edits. So, my question is: Is this how your approach will work (look at the totality of what I've edited, the totality of what you have edited, and if we're a very good match, then recommend to you some of the articles I have edited and that you have not yet edited?). Or is something else?</li>
<li>Spamming: Some users probably will see this as spamming. Better maybe to allow people to request this (at least at first), and give them some pages where they can provide feedback, both good and bad (e.g. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_Link_Suggester_Positive_Feedback_9591.html" title="User:Nickj/Link Suggester/Positive Feedback">positive feedback</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_Link_Suggester_Negative_Feedback_f216.html" title="User:Nickj/Link Suggester/Negative Feedback">negative feedback</a>). You'll know after you've got 50 or 60 bits of feedback whether you're onto a winner or not. I'd certainly be willing to consider taking part in an early stage trial. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:56, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We're testing a bunch of algorithms and variations against edit histories in the dump. Some are collaborative filtering style, like what you describe above (there are music recommenders, like <a href="http://www.last.fm" class="external text" title="http://www.last.fm" rel="nofollow">AudioScrobbler/last.fm</a> that are said to use CF. Amazon does this for many/all of its things, and <a href="http://movielens.umn.edu/" class="external text" title="http://movielens.umn.edu/" rel="nofollow">MovieLens</a> is our CF research site). There are a bunch of CF-based algorithms and we're going to try a number of them. We're also doing some search engine-style matching, using your edit history as a query against the wikipedia database. We won't necessarily use all edits, we're trying to figure out whether we can tell you're particularly interested in a topic by looking at characteristics of edits (length change, is it a reversion, marked minor, etc.) and maybe only use some of your edits to build the query/your profile. We'll actually deploy the algorithms that seem to do best in our offline tests.
<dl>
<dd>Very good! I like that edits marked as minor (or where the amount of changed text is quite small) will be excluded. For example, as part of the <a href="../../../w/s/_/WP%7EWS_f722.html" title="WP:WS">Wiki Syntax Project</a>, I frequently make small edits to topics that I personally don't care about, solely to clean up their wiki syntax. Also, I'm checking out <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last.fm.html" title="Last.fm">Last.fm</a> now - I had never heard of it before, so thank you for that! I'll also read over the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaborative_filtering.html" title="Collaborative filtering">collaborative filtering</a> page (up until now I had only thought about the idea in a "wouldn't this idea be cool?" kind of way, and never knew before what the correct term was). One thing that may help you is if you can get users to show you their watchlists (if something is on my watchlist, chances are pretty good that I care about it), but since I don't think you can access this, it might be best to start off just using a user's edit history.
<dl>
<dd>I was excited about watchlists until I posted on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a> asking people to mail them to me and someone said "you know, I put a lot of pages I hope get deleted on my watchlist". So, edit history it will be. We might come up with an interface that allows people to type in some arbitrary text as well, not sure yet.
<dl>
<dd>On second thoughts, I agree with not using watchlists. I've reviewed the things on my watchlist, and I'm not so sure that they are representative of my interests (at least some things are listed because they were things I thought that should be deleted, some I thought should be merged, and some were things that I can no longer recall why they were originally watched, etc). Significant edits are probably the best indicator, as you say. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 01:26, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When you say request, how do you mean? Would the bot just put a link that says "hey, we can find you more things we think you'll edit, click here" on user talk pages so it's not as intrusive as just dropping a bunch of links on someone's page? Or are you talking about trying to put a link in a public place? Someone suggested changing a welcome template up above... wasn't sure other Wikipedians would go for that. Thanks for the thoughts. -- <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForteTuba_d7fd.html" title="User:ForteTuba">ForteTuba</a> 12:37, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I think you've got two issues. The first is, does it work and do people like it? For this, to start with, you might want to put up a notice at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Wikipedia%7EAnnouncements_a4ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Announcements">Wikipedia:Announcements</a> page saying "we're running a trial and would like some participants" to get some people to test it and see what they think. This would be an opt-in type of thing (e.g. get people to add their names to a User:SuggestBot/sign me up for the trial page), so none of the participants will complain about spamming, and you're bound to learn something from the feedback that people give (both what they like about it, and what they don't like about it, and you should fine-tune it based on that feedback), and once you've done a trial with public feedback then people will be far more receptive on the second issue. The second issue is once you've got a working system, how do you tell people about articles they might like, without it being considered spamming? The danger for you is that if even a handful of people consider it to be spamming and complain, then your bot is likely to get blocked (just telling you the way it is - basically the onus is on you to structure it so that people will not get annoyed by this). For telling users about articles they maybe interested in, I think you have three categories of users:
<dl>
<dd>Posting asking for watchlists on the pump didn't work very well, I've gotten 5 in two-ish weeks, but I agree, getting people to opt in would be nice. Maybe the bot could create subpages of user pages (or of user talk pages) that contain suggestions and then put a polite little note on the talk page. Not quite as intrusive as an in-your-face list of suggestions. Opting in via community pages mostly only works for experienced users... which dovetails nicely with your next.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Existing established users (these you should probably require to opt-in, and should not add to their talk pages unless they opt, as they are the most likely to complain loudly and extensively, and are the most likely to have already found the topics they are the most interested in).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Heh, I agree about both points.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Anonymous/not logged in users who use an IP address (you should probably not do anything with them, as they may be existing established users who have not logged in, or they may be a user who makes only one edit and is never seen again).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also agreed.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>New users who have a named account that's quite new and who have only a few edits (and for these users you could consider adding something to their talk page). For example: "Hello, I am the <a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESuggestBot_0d37.html" title="User:SuggestBot">SuggestBot</a>, and I notify new users about articles that they may be interested in, based on the edits that they make. I have included a list of the top 10 articles that you have not edited yet, and which people who edited the articles you have edited also liked. My suggestions are: (insert ranked bullet list of top 10 suggestions). I hope that you like these suggestions, but if you don't then please don't be alarmed because I will not leave you any more messages (unless you explicitly ask me to at my opt-in page). If you have any comments on this list, both good and bad, we would love to hear them at (insert link to positive feedback page and negative feedback page)."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Hope the above helps. Personally I think the approach outlined above will probably work, but others may have different opinions. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 02:20, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is close to what we were looking at. Opt-in for experienced via community portal and a polite page creation bot that samples infrequent/new editors might be a winner.

<dd>All sounds good, but just a quick thought: if you're going to create talk subpages, you might want to not put them under the user's talk page, but rather under the SuggestBot's talk page (e.g. User:SuggestBot/suggestions/Nickj), and then put a quick note on the user's talk page linking to that. From a technical perspective, it makes almost no difference whether it's stored under the user's page or SuggestBot's; but from a human psychology perspective, they're very different things: one is a bot walking into "my" space and messing with it, whereas the other is the bot making a list in its space and then inviting me into that space to review the list. It's quite possible to get annoyed by the former, whereas it is much harder to get annoyed by the latter. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 01:26, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think this is a great idea, but I wanted to note that merely looking at who has edited an article, and perhaps the number of edits they made, isn't terribly indicative. What <i>really</i> indicates interest is substantial edits, where they have contributed significant new content or offered up a detailed explanation in the edit history or talk page. For example, many users performing disambiguation will edit hundreds or even thousands of pages they really don't give a damn about.</dd>
<dd>Also, keep in mind that unlike Amazon, our articles are strongly interlinked (some say you can't find two articles more than 6 links apart if you tried). These links, along with properties such as belonging to the same category/list, could be a valuable way of finding related articles once you've established the sort of article a person likes.</dd>
<dd>One last comment: don't recommend articles people already know about if you can. This would be really annoying.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 06:16, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Definitely agree suggesting things that the user has already edited in any way, shape or form is bad. Categories could be useful; Also articles that link to an article that the person has edited, but which are not backlinked, could be good (e.g. you've extensively edited A, and B links to A, but A does not link to B, and you have not edited B in any way; In this situation, you may like B, but not know about it). Could be more a "future directions" thing though. P.s. Off-topic: For a proof-by-existence of two articles being more than 6 degrees apart, see <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/sixdeg/index.jsp?from=Gameboy&amp;to=maine+coon" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/sixdeg/index.jsp?from=Gameboy&amp;to=maine+coon" rel="nofollow">Gameboy to Maine Coon</a>, which are at least 10 steps apart (but in one direction only). -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 07:02, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We were thinking of using local link structure to edited articles as a reasonable baseline recommender. We've thought about building one that uses categories to help cluster edits and make sense of interests; that is probably a Next Step compared to fielding a few plausible and easy-to-construct ones and seeing how people react first.</dd>
<dd>As for the substantive edits, we're trying both using all edits and trying to filter out non-substantive ones. A naive, ad-hoc approach to filtering non-substantive did pretty poorly compared to using all edits on the offline data, but it's hard to say how people would react without trying it both ways. (And, there are other strategies for filtering edits that we haven't tried yet.) It's a good suggestion. -- <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForteTuba_d7fd.html" title="User:ForteTuba">ForteTuba</a> 03:45, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I sincerely recommend that this be <b>not</b> a bot, and rather be a tool like Kate's contribution tool. We should have the ability to just simply load, based on a user's name, what pages we should attempt next. This provides it to anyone who wants to use it. You can even sign up for a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Toolserver" class="extiw" title="m:Toolserver">m:Toolserver</a> account to place your new script tool there, since the Toolserver has access to database dumps anyway. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:27, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting idea, why do you recommend so? My initial reaction: I don't know enough about the toolserver to know if this is a plus or minus at this stage. Long run it's probably a win, but currently some algorithms are slow and would be hoggy and not suitable for interactive use (think many-word queries against the searchindex). Also, we would probably be happier in our research hearts in the short term to control who gets recommendations when, for the purpose of getting more generally useful and more likely valid results. I definitely think in the long run it would be nice for people to be able to get results interactively and of their own volition. FWIW, the bot wouldn't be running continously: we'd probably pick a set of users, run the algos offline for them, and put up the suggestions as a batch, then get a dump a week or two later to see what happened. -- <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForteTuba_d7fd.html" title="User:ForteTuba">ForteTuba</a> 03:45, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is one problem that I have not yet worked out of the NotificationBot, that is how to deal with user talk pages that have been redirected cross project (i.e. a person may have a meta redirect) - the closest answer I have so far is to allow the site to do the work for you, but that would involve a lot of correction and assumptions in the pywikipedia code.
<dl>
<dd>Huh... yeah, that could be annoying. Is it painful to chase the redirects yourself?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That aside, it's my feeling that you could easily create some kind of tree of articles for each article on the Wikipedia. So if we have an article on A, it follows that if B relates to A, then it should be in the set S<sub>1</sub>. (Then we continue to build different sets of S for each article in the Wikipedia. I suppose somewhat on the idea of Nick's Link suggestion bot...) I figure that you could basically create a network for what relates to what article using trees and such. Then when a user queries against his own name, you could then pull up a list of articles he or she has edited, pull up the trees, and generate a list based on tree relationships. Does that make any sense to you? --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 10:34, 10 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it makes sense. There are a lot of ways to define "relates": text similarity, pairs of pages that are edited by the same person, link structure, categories, and more I'm sure. For now we're going after the first three:
<ul>
<li>text similarity because it's so obvious to try (and is okay in our offline experiments, though slow)</li>
<li>co-editing because collaborative filtering is effective in lots of domains (and appears to do fairly well here in limited dump-based experiments, and is fairly fast)</li>
<li>a simple link-based relatedness algorithm because it's both reasonable and something that you could imagine people doing manually (still to be built)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As for building a relationship structure (trees are one way to do it), the relationships get represented differently for each. In the text similarity case, we use mysql's built-in text indexing because it's dead simple. For co-editing, we use revision history info from a full dump, lightly processed and text removed, to establish relationships between editors (and then to articles). Eventually I want to implement it using the revision table directly. For link-based relatedness I'm looking to use the pagelinks table. I'm hoping that with just a little optimization the last two will be quick enough to run online so we won't have to build the whole relateness model: time-consuming and space-expensive. -- <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForteTuba_d7fd.html" title="User:ForteTuba">ForteTuba</a> 16:04, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mathbot is pasting messages in user's talk pages asking them to do more edit summaries. I find this very obnoxious. Wikipedia is supposed to improve by cooperation and peer review in the act of editing itself. The kind of eye-in-the-sky monitoring of this bot-function is IMHO quite contrary to that spirit.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AutoWikiBrowser -&gt; flag needed?</span></h2>
<p>I was fixing up some categories after a CFD when I found AutoWikiBrowser. I used it to quickly fix all the links to the categories. I found myself making ~8 edits per minute. Is that too many for a non-bot account to be making? The "Bots running without a flag" says I should be under 30-60 seconds per edit (granted it's not really a bot, but the effect is similar). Should I be using a separate account (eg. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenBot_a1a4.html" title="User:BrokenBot">User:BrokenBot</a>) with a flag to do such cleanups? <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 03:50, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, as I mentioned above before to Martin (Bluemoose), that his tool at that speed would in effect qualify as a bot for anyone who uses it. Users who wish to use his tool beyond the recommended limit must apply for a separate account, and run any high speed edits under a bot flagged account. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 12:32, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This bot is used to start stub articles with coordinate + location + external google maps links, it was running succesfully howeever the bot account is suspended infinetely by a bureucrat. I suppose that this action is illegal, and I want my right to use bot, editing only 1 article per minute. I accept my fault that was running an unapproved bot with 5 articles per minute speed, however an infinite suspension is a heavy punishment, because the bot was creating useful articles, not garbage. I request my bot to be activated to create articles again I promise not to use it too fast.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandal Count Bot</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to run <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVandalCountBot_8584.html" title="User:VandalCountBot">VandalCountBot</a> as an automated bot that would run once an hour. I have already created an IRC script that logs the amount of vandalism in #wikipedia-en-vandalism, and the purpose of VandalCountBot would be to grab the vandal count information from my server (based on the hour) and place it in a table, as it can be seen here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lightdarkness/Vandalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lightdarkness/Vandalism" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] (NOTE: The information in that table was manually entered.)</p>
<p>The bot wouldn't put any stress on the wikipedia server, as it would only be sending one POST request to the server every hour. The purpose of the bot would be to show trends of vandalism based on time of the day, day of the week, and even month of the year. I believe it will be a beneficial tool to the CVU to be aware of when the high vandalism times are. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness">Lightdarkness</a> 02:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is based on the potential vandalism from the IRC channel? Would it also be possible to list the Recent Changes for the past hour, and count how many have some form of "rvv/Reverted edits by/revert vandalism" in their edit summary? This could be another useful curve. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-20 03:50</small>
<ul>
<li>My script already does what you've described at the IRC level. It looks for the text used by scripts such as Godmode-lite and Popups, and disregards if their edit summaries match. If I'm not understanding what you're suggesting/commenting on, please let me know :-) --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness">Lightdarkness</a> 03:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I understand what your current bot does. But the IRC vandalism bot gets false positives. It would be nice to have another curve to look at and compare to, specifically to get all the occurrences of "rvv/Reverted edits by/revert vandalism" in edit summaries in the last hour, or something like that. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-20 04:39</small>
<ul>
<li>I see what you're saying :-) I'll start logging the RC changes per hour, then I'll write something to sort through them tomorrow, and we'll see how they match up. EDIT: After looking through just a few minutes of the RC feed, it'd be very hard for me to sort out all the non vandalism. The IRC CVU channel does a good job with extensive blacklists, whitelists, and numerous rules to see what is vandalism and what is not. Sure some things might be mixed, but if I were to analyze the raw RC feed, my vandal count would be much much higher, that it wouldn't even be accurate. Maybe down the road when I can write all the rules the CVU bots have, but as the beginning stages of VandalCountBot, I'd just stick with the CVU IRC feed. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness">Lightdarkness</a> 04:52, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am requesting the bot flag for tsca.bot on the English Wikipedia. The bot has been active on several projects since 2004 (at this point it has the flag on pl.wiki, csb.wiki, pl.wikt, pl.books, en.books, commons, nl.wikt, da.wiki, sv.wiki, cs.wiki, pl.source, it.wikt, de.wiki). My intention now is to add interwiki links to Polish articles to en: (I can read the languages the bot adds interwiki to). Any other activity will be undertaken only after a proper discussion and making sure the community is interested. <a href="../../../t/s/c/User%7ETsca_13ad.html" title="User:Tsca">tsca</a> <a href="../../../t/s/c/User_talk%7ETsca_97a8.html" title="User talk:Tsca">✉</a> 12:45, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bot and its owner are doing an extremely good job at Polish Wikipedia. The bot is also the Polish Wikipedia users with the biggest numer of edits :). <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAusir_735a.html" title="User:Ausir">Ausir</a> 12:47, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which framework does it use? pywikipedia? That information would be helpful on the bot's userpage.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 13:10, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the interwiki links the bot obviously uses interwiki.py. For any other work it uses my own software (written in perl + sh). <a href="../../../t/s/c/User%7ETsca_13ad.html" title="User:Tsca">tsca</a> <a href="../../../t/s/c/User_talk%7ETsca_97a8.html" title="User talk:Tsca">✉</a> 13:21, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Just a question</span></h2>
<p>I'm confused about the different sections on this, especially <a href="../../../b/_/_/WP%7EB_5622.html#Bots_running_without_a_flag" title="WP:B">WP:B#Bots running without a flag</a>. I just want to do a one shot replace.py of a certian category that isn't that big, but has too many to be done manually. So do I need to request permission here for something that simple? I can do--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 07:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC) even like 5 minute throttle and at whatever off-peak time! It seems like this bot flag thing is for permanent bots. I just want to run this replace.py one time and probably never use it again. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngleman_4889.html" title="User:Engleman">Chris</a> 06:57, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You probably don't want to bother with a flag if you are only going to be making a few changes but you still have to request permission here. This is because no matter how straightforward you think a change is, since a bot does a lot of work it's a good idea for others (ie at this page) to look over the idea and see if it is ok (take a look above <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html#Bot_permission_please.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">here</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html#William_Allen_Simpson_running_occasionally_as_Botryoidal" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">here</a>, both are cases where a bot operator thought they were doing something simple and yet infact bot permission was refused). So, what is the category change and where is the consensus for it? Also, you may want to consider using category.py if it's a simple category name change. If it's just a one off thing then you could consider a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBot_requests_273d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bot requests">Bot request</a> instead (and someone else will do it for you).--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 07:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No it's not a category change. I'm introducing a new parameter into a template, but all of the articles that use it (which are all in this one category) will break if I just change it, so I want to fill all of the articles with a default value for the parameter. Eventually, many of them will probably manually bjavascript:insertTags('--<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngleman_4889.html" title="User:Engleman">Chris</a> 21:24, 22 January 2006 (UTC)',<i>,</i>);e changed to something else, but I don't want them all breaking beforehand. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngleman_4889.html" title="User:Engleman">Chris</a> 07:32, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Give the parameter a default value like this: <tt>{{{param|default}}}</tt>, then go assign a value to the parameter at each article afterward and you won't be throwing ugly curly braces into articles for even a few minutes. Note that the default can be whitespace/blank like this <tt>{{{param|}}}</tt>. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> <small>07:44, Jan. 21, 2006</small>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Syrcatbot request</span></h2>
<p>As an admin who has started doing a lot of category moves / etc at CFD, I'm thinking of making a separate account for the recat edits. As a first step, I've created <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrcatbot_7a13.html" title="User:Syrcatbot">User:Syrcatbot</a>. I guess my first question is: is this a reasonable idea, or does nobody care that I will have a ton of recategorizations for <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">User:Syrthiss</a>?</p>
<p>Syrcatbot will still be me sitting there with AutoWikiBrowser, and will obviously not be tagged as Admin.</p>
<p>I'm still getting the hang of tagging cat moves for the other bots, but if that is what I should do for all my cat moves then I'm willing to stop doing recats by hand and leave it to the bots.</p>
<p>Thanks! --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 15:18, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason why you'd apply for a bot account is to make faster high speed edits that seemed unhumanly possible. Also, this helps you being blocked accidently by Curp's autoblocker. So it is a good idea to make a new bot account, and apply for a bot flag after. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 03:25, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am doing a school assignment where I need to configure Heritrix web crawler to retrive pages from Wikipedia.

I am confused whether I need to get approval for the web crawler engine.</p>
<p>This is the information of the Bot:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bot is automatic. I configured the URL to point to a page in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>It should run from Jan 25 - Mar 31 2005.</li>
<li>Heritrix from Internet Archive's <a href="http://crawler.archive.org/index.html" class="external text" title="http://crawler.archive.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">Heritrix homepage</a>. It is a Java program.</li>
<li>Purpose:
<ul>
<li>I need to crawl a topic to retrive the pages. The purpose is to preserve the topic for future use.</li>
<li>I notice that for every page there is a history that shows the history page. But, the purpose that I am doing this is for web archiving purpose. This is to archiving one topic and show a prototype of how this can be done. Wikipedia must allow me to crawl because I need this to accomplish my assignment. Please.</li>
