<dd>This would be trivial for a bot to do, and take very little time. I had a look at the page, and could see two lists: A-K and L-Z, correct?

<dd>Jayden: if you do write this bot, make sure to use the HTML class=new to see which links are redlinks; don't load each article to check. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 19:03, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, something occurred to me. Sometimes people make notes next to the links like "prodded for notability" or strike out the entry instead of removing it, and thus you'll probably want to remove the entire line. It also appears that someone has been adding a wikilinked date to some entries, which might be a nuisance to work around. I can mention to the dead-end maintainers not to do this, if it's too inelegant to code around. Also, I've restored an old dead-end pages dump at <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_Sandbox_4_099a.html" title="User:Salad Days/Sandbox 4">User:Salad Days/Sandbox 4</a> so you can test your bot out, if you like. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 19:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just did a bot run on your sandbox page, and on the two list pages, and it seems to work fine (18 links were removed in total from the real lists, and around 900 or so from the sandbox). It's no problem if articles are crossed out or if notes are attached, because the bot removes the complete line. Have a look at the diffs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Dead-end_pages/A-K&amp;diff=104118250&amp;oldid=104086736" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Dead-end_pages/A-K&amp;diff=104118250&amp;oldid=104086736" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Dead-end_pages/L-Z&amp;diff=104118788&amp;oldid=104112368" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Dead-end_pages/L-Z&amp;diff=104118788&amp;oldid=104112368" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) and let me know if the changes are okay. Also, how often should I run the bot? Once a day? Once a week? I don't think we need to go through the bot approval's process since the edit rate is completely negligible (only two edits are necessary) and the read rate is very low as well (I'm doing exactly the thing that Mets501 said, which requires only two reads in total for each list).

<dd>Once a day would be preferable; there's currently a lack of momentum on the page to remove fixed bluelink articles and instead piddle around with the red ones. Your description sounds like it wouldn't impact your CPU cycles too much, but the decision is ultimately yours. As an extremely minor request, perhaps the edit summary could display how many lines were removed? On second thought, the bot's edits won't show up on my watchlist so it's sort of a moot point anyways. Thanks again for your excellent work! <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 22:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The bot is very light-weight and only takes me about 1-2 minutes to run, so it's no problem to do it once a day. I'm doing it manually at the moment, so I might forget to do it sometimes, but it'll be more or less once a day. Hopefully I'll have it fully automated soon. I've also included the number of lines removed in the edit summary, which was an easy change since I was already keeping track of how many lines are removed. If the format of the list significantly changes let me know because it might mean I will have to slightly adjust the bot.

<dd>Actually, I belive it might be possible to do this, using a standardised template the merely states that that IP is used by an educational facility, without actually naming what the educational facility is. This would be possible because of the fact that the range of IPs assigned to eg ".sch.uk" or ".edu" domains should be publicly available. It would be possible for a bot to generate a list of IPs from these known ranges, and run through each one, appending a standard "shared IP of an educational facility" template to the IPs user/talkpage. This would be a one-time-only run, but might have to make tens of thousands of edits to mark up all the pages. I think this is a good idea and merits further investigation. - <span style="color:#ccf;background:#ccf;border-style: single"><a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPocklingtonDan_89be.html" title="User:PocklingtonDan">PocklingtonDan</a></span> 08:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I already run <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AutoWikiBrowser</a> and have been doing category renaming and deletion work recently. Maybe an automatic bot that did this would be a good start?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disambiguation bot</span></h2>
<p>Hows this: a bot which, if you save a link to a disambiguation page, asks you to adjust the link to make it a bit more specific.</p>
<p>What would be ubercool is if the bot would <i>list</i> the links provided by the disambiguation page, and just allow you to click to select which one you meant.</p>

<dd>I think this is a great idea. However, it could not notify the person real-time, it would have to watch the recent changes list and then add a note to the article's talk page suggesting the disambig link that needs changing. based on past experience, people would NOT want the message written to their own user talk page (people are paranoid about spam). If I'm editing a long stretch of an article I often type wikilinks without checking if they exist first - if they show up as blue, i assume they are good. This would help stop that. - <span style="color:#ccf;background:#ccf;border-style: single"><a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPocklingtonDan_89be.html" title="User:PocklingtonDan">PocklingtonDan</a></span> 11:08, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> helper bot</span></h2>
<p>A bot that does the trivial aspects of closing an AFD. A real person would close the AFD by placing a tag for the bot (perhaps {{close|keep}}), the bot would be watching the afd pages and see the tag being added. In the case of keep it would close the voting page, remove the afd template from the article and add the {{<a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdfull_87e8.html" title="Template:Oldafdfull">oldafdfull</a>}} tag with all the appropriate information to the talk page. The tag itself would probably just have some trivial message because it would only be on the page for a few seconds, something like, "A bot will come take care of this soon". The bot would be worthwhile if it only handled variations of keep (including "no consensus", "speedy keep" and "nomination withdrawn"), but could also be made to do deletes as well. For either just the delete or any use it could use a whitelist of users allowed to do the action, I'm not sure what the current policy is on who can close. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 05:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that would be a good idea, in principle. Removing the AfD tag and adding the talk page notice could be fully automated, and if they were it would free up admins to close more AfDs, which would be good since AfD is always backlogged. But the bot wouldn't be able to delete pages, people hate admin bots, plus when you delete a page you need to look at it and usually remove most incoming links... a bot would not do a good job of that. A better use of programmer time might be improved AfD closing scripts... one that lets the admin fully automate the process of removing the AfD tag and adding talk page notices, auto-loads the "delete" page and "what links here", that kind of stuff could save valuable time for admins who close a lot of AfDs. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:24, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think people hate admin bots because they don't want a bot making important decisions, this bot wouldn't decide anything, it would basically be another tool in the admin's toolbox. It doesn't matter though, I'd be happy if at least the keeps were automated. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 05:42, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Laughing at BC's comment. I was just thinking of ideas for bots which can be useful for Wikipedia. Something else came to my mind as well. What happens if a vandal uses a bot to vandalize Wikipedia? (i.e. on April Fool's Day). How can we as a community undo these errors if the bot vandalizes at a certain rate per minute?

<dd>Have the bot blocked as quickly as possible, and then revert all the vandal edits. Might be worth reverting all the edits with a bot or AWB (if that's possible with AWB). I doubt a vandal bot would be able to do much damage if it gets noticed by the RC patrollers. If it does manage to stay under the radar then it might have a bit more impact, but then it can't be very obvious vandalism (since that's almost always caught by RC patrol). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 20:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>vandal/spam bots are a (simi)common event we have developed tools to counter them. Any Admin that has access to Vandal Proof can murder a vandalbot very fast (IE less than five minutes) admin users of VP have a nice added function of rolling back every on top edit a user has. There are also bots such as AVB, the TB's and of course VOAbot II along with the RC patrolers and admin with JS tools and admin rollback thus vandals tend to die a fast death. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 04:47, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ST47, it looks like this process could take up to 24 hours (or more), if the Afghanistan experience (below) is any measure. Three quick questions:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>What happens to newly-created articles which are added to these categories, say a week or a month from now? Will the bot automatically add the tag, or will this process need to be re-run periodically?</li>
<li>Same question regarding newly-created categories, or existing categories which are newly linked as sub-categories to existing Spain-related categories - again, will the bot automatically catch these and add the tag, or will this process need to be re-run?</li>
<li>I keep finding Spain-related categories which were not properly linked in, and so didn't make it onto the list that the bot is working on. I've started a sub-page where other people can add these as well. Should we just come back to you in a week/month as these additional orphan categories are discovered for the bot to chew on?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, I warned you I was full of curiosity! <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspanaViva_0cb0.html" title="User:EspanaViva"><font color="red"><i>Espana</i></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/User_talk%7EEspanaViva_b2e1.html" title="User talk:EspanaViva"><font color="#F88017"><b>Viva</b></font></a> 14:09, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You will need to have them re-added, the bot only does a once-through for #1 and #2. Regarding #3, I was asked to shut down the bot for over-zealous categorization, why don't you make a list of those categories and just comment here again once you're ready? (Note - I have started it, bot didn't get too far. The bot runs in a way that if you give me a category that has already been done on the next list, it will simply skip those articles.) <a href="../../../s/t/4/User%7EST47_d0a2.html" title="User:ST47">ST47</a><small><a href="../../../s/t/4/User_talk%7EST47_ecf4.html" title="User talk:ST47">Talk</a></small> 15:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ST47 - well, I'm puzzled why <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Triple_Alliance_b571.html" title="Aztec Triple Alliance">Aztec Triple Alliance</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florentine_Codex_0749.html" title="Florentine Codex">Florentine Codex</a> wound up on the list to be tagged, since I went through their categories and parent categories, and they don't seem to have an obvious tie to any of the categories we listed. Let's give this some thought so as how to avoid problems the next time! Perhaps run it so that articles in sub-categories are not automatically tagged? Also, may run it in batches of smaller groups so that issues can be managed as they arise on a smaller scale? <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspanaViva_0cb0.html" title="User:EspanaViva"><font color="red"><i>Espana</i></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/User_talk%7EEspanaViva_b2e1.html" title="User talk:EspanaViva"><font color="#F88017"><b>Viva</b></font></a> 16:32, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Referencing Bot</span></h2>
<p>After my previous <b>AIV Warning Bot</b> went nowhere, I got an idea while reading an article, then I found out it was a previous request that was not <i>kept alive</i>. I was thinking how convenient it would be for a bot to turn all the large amounts of web citations on Wikipedia articles into the more formal reference tags such as {{cite web}}. As <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">User:John_Broughton</a> stated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests/Archive_10#ref_bot" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests/Archive_10#ref_bot" rel="nofollow">previous request</a>, it would go to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Special%7ELinksearch_3efd.html" title="Special:Linksearch">Special:Linksearch</a> and get a list of all external links for a specific domain (e.g. www.msn.com). It should understand that when a URL appears twice in a page, there should not be two identical footnotes. So, the first reference/footnote gets a name="X" argument. It probably should avoid pages that have both a "<i>Notes</i>" and a "<i>References</i>" section. It probably shouldn't footnote a URL if the URL is in the "<i>External links</i>" section. And, obviously, it should put as much information as possible into the "<i>cite</i>" ({{cite web}}) template. If you are willing to create a excellent and much needed bot that I would be glad to run and operate, it would be much appreciated. Thank you. --<b><a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtranet_f624.html" title="User:Extranet">Extranet</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtranet_006f.html" title="User talk:Extranet">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extranet_2b61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extranet">Contribs</a>)</sup> 07:08, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is an excelent idea and if someone can propose a method for implementing it I would strongly lobby for its approval. Unfortunately, I think such an algorithm (converting a poorly formated citation -- possibly just a URL -- to a properly formated one) would be at least one, most likely several, Ph.D. dissertations in computer science. I don't think AI is to the point yet of being able to read a link, and get figure out the author's name, publication date, etc. from the text of the referenced article. I hate being so pessimistic, and I think it is a great idea, I just can't see how to write the program. I hope someone can prove me wrong, but I'm not holding my breath. --<a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a> 07:32, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's possible that there are some more standard (meta) fields than these (I didn't look through the entire source), or that one would have to write a bit of code for each major news source (PubMed is already standardized, and a converter already exists), but even if this bot only covered (say) the top 25 news sources, it could still make a major difference, if only to move editors from seeing articles with only embedded links to seeing what good footnotes look like. -- <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;"><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></font> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">(☎☎)</a> 07:56, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Giving this some more thought, I think that in addition to formatting the citations, it is also necessary to check the articles to make sure they actually support the cited statment. I think this is a very important job for the good of the Wiki, and it almost certainly requires human input.

I would love to start such a thing if others are interested. --<a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a> 20:47, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sure there must be a bot that could do this already but I'm not sure which one. I'd like a bot to run through the sub-categories at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProposed_deletion_dc1f.html" title="Category:Proposed deletion">Category:Proposed deletion</a>. It would look for articles that had been prodded, had the tag removed and then replaced. If it finds any they could be dumped into a file for a human to go through. I realise that the bot could remove the tag and notify the editor that had replced it by mistake, but I don't think that would be a good idea. First of all to have the bot re-remove the tag would give the apperance of the bot edit warring. Second, I've noticed that editors get upset when the prod tag is removed a second time especially when it is for an article that has been justifiably prodded. I went through on of the sub-categories and removed 6 prod tags that had been restored improperly so I do see the need for it. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 12:30, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My understanding is that if a prod is removed, it should not be placed back. Isn't prod for uncontested deletions? I think a bot removes prods that have been re-added is a good idea, however, it must make sure that a different user removed it thant he one who added it, it must ignore re-addings that happened after enough time(say 2 weeks), and it should not remove the same prod once. Of course I am sure if I think about it more I will realize more problems, but such a bot could function. I would be a little more complex than the average bot I think. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 16:38, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No I don't want the bot to remove the prod or notify the person that re-added it. Just to dump a list someplace that a human could look at and decide if the re-adding was a good/bad thing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot to warn authors during Speedy Delete</span></h2>
<p>At present, when an article comes up for AfD, the <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54Bot_5a58.html" title="User:Jayden54Bot">Jayden54Bot</a> inserts a warning into the users' talk page. Excellent idea!</p>
<p>Last week I had the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lasagna_cell.html" title="Lasagna cell">Lasagna cell</a> article vanish without warning. I was stunned, since there was no Talkpage discussion. Also there were no watchlist notifications. It disappeared from "my contributions," and all my old watchlist entries vanished too. I know that it hadn't been AfD'd. Most frightening: if I hadn't been recently using its talkpage, I might never have noticed its disappearance. Lacking experience with this, and lacking evidence, I had no idea what to do next. (Unfortunately I didn't notice the deletion resources link on the error page.) I ended up yelling to admin for help. It turned out that the article had been Speedy Deleted by an admin under incorrect SD criteria, without tagging, and who also hadn't seen the talk page.</p>
<p>I found the whole experience very unsettling. It was like seeing "Extraordinary Rendition" in action! (grin.) I had no clue that SD existed, or how to find what had happened. And... if I found it confusing, I assume that lots of others must have the same plight. I seem to have guessed right. Someone attempted an ineffective cure in the form of a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletion_patrol_280d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletion patrol">SD Patrol</a> started in late 2005, even with comment about others' saving good articles from accidental deletion. (Scary: if some have been saved, how many have been lost?!!)</p>
<p>Here's a much better fix: just make the original author responsible for saving the SD'd article. Use a bot similar to <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54Bot_5a58.html" title="User:Jayden54Bot">Jayden54Bot</a> to announce on the original authors' talkpage the speedy-deletion event, as well as providing some resources for that author. This way legit articles won't just vanish silently with nobody noticing. Sample:</p>

<dd>I'm already aware of one possible counterargument: the bot would do something very new: it would be giving clear warning to all the vandals/spammers. But if it's a choice between silence and secrecy to fight abuse, versus transparency and honest communication to avoid "biting" people (and to cancel out human error)... I'd side with transparency. It seems very non-WP if we perform silent deletions 'intentionally'. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 07:41, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I really don't think that is a reason not to have a bot for this task, if a vandal gets warned he wont be able to do anything but remove the template. In that case he would be warned/blocked. <a href="../../../b/j/w/User%7EBjweeks_5dc7.html" title="User:Bjweeks">BJ</a><small><sup><a href="../../../b/j/w/User_talk%7EBjweeks_e86e.html" title="User talk:Bjweeks">Talk</a></sup></small> 07:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Has my support, SD needs to be made more friendly in some cases. One difficulty I see is that the bot would have to scan directly through the deletion log, since unlike with AfD (worst case, no tags used) there'll be no other record. At that time, the page history has already vanished, so the bot would need to have sysop status in order to find the original author. From the log it also isn't easy (for a bot) to detect <i>why</i> a deletion was done, so the message would have to restrict itself to a generally-worded "<i>your page was deleted for some reason, here's how to find out why</i>". Won't reduce its usefulness.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No problem with vandals, I don't think this will give them any new ideas, not more than would giving them a warning - which they should get anyway. The task is ideally suited for a bot; it's a tedious job, so it's often skipped for the obvious junk. The result is that there are many accounts with no apparent contributions because all their nonsense pages were deleted. It's a useful piece of information to keep, even if <i>they</i> won't care about previous deletion warnings. Another admin deleting their next page a few days later <i>will</i> care. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 14:44, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is a great idea (and had already considered it myself) but it's a bit trickier than what my bot currently does. AfD warnings are relatively easy since the bot only has to parse today's AfD log page once or twice a day and check each AfD. Articles nominated for Speedy Deletion can be gone within minutes so there's not really a list that can be checked once or twice a day.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see two solutions to this problem. Option one is to do what Femto says, and parse the deletion log, but there's one big problem with this: the bot would need to have sysop status. Judging by previous response to bots have sysop status I don't see that happening anytime soon, so I think we can forget that option.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The second option is to have the bot check <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_4c9c.html" title="Category:Candidates for speedy deletion">Category:Candidates for speedy deletion</a> every 5 minutes, and save a list of each article that has been nominated. This would be the best option and doesn't require the bot to have sysop status. The only "problem" is that the bot would have to run every 5 minutes (and possible even more often, say once every minute), and thus needs to run on a dedicated server. I'm running my bot on my own computer, and I haven't got a dedicated server (yet) so I can't run this bot, although maybe it could run on the Wikipedia toolserver?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The bot could be really light-weight, and only save a list of all the articles nominated, and then once or twice a day it will actually warn all the users. This won't help with preventing deletion, but will let the user know what happened to their article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 15:42, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, no, the main intention is that the bot should (also) be able to catch deletions of pages that were "<a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedied on sight</a>" on the discretion of an administrator — without prior nominations, no speedy tags, no categories to check. The only tangible information that is left behind in these cases is the deletion log, which is hard to find for new users. Especially under these circumstances an automated message is needed most. I think a toolserver process is the way to go, early notifications could also avoid many clueless repostings.</dd>

<dd>The concern about sysopped bots is that they may accidentally perform unwanted (and hard to fix) adminstrative actions. Shouldn't be too difficult getting consensus for this one, the sysop status would be used strictly on a read-only basis. To make sure, two separate accounts can be used. One process running on a sysop account exclusively for reading the logs, piping its data to another process that makes the actual edits from a common bot account. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 12:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do like this idea, but I still have my concerns about a bot getting sysop status since there has been so much backlash previous times. ProtectionBot, which was a great idea to protect the main page, had a very difficult time getting through RfA, and that was a pretty solid idea. Also, for this bot someone else would have to take the lead, definitely not me. Someone who is already trusted by the community and an administrator, e.g. <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna_2947.html" title="User:Werdna">Werdna</a>.

<dd>I'm flattered by your confidence in me, but I think I couldn't even get a bot going whose only purpose would be to crash itself :) Well, the difference is that this account wouldn't make any changes (as soon as there's a single edit it should be nuked), unlike a 'real' sysop bot whose purpose is to make actual admin edits. This might even work with a blocked account, depending on how the software handles blocked admins (whether read-only sysop pageviews already fall under the block — I've no intention trying to find this out). <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 15:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did think of a work-around that doesn't require sysop status. The bot would have to closely monitor the New Articles feed, and immediately find the original author of each new article. Then some time later (24hrs) it would check each article and see if it has been deleted, and if it has, warn the author. That would probably work, although there are a few things to look out for (e.g. too many requests, missing any new articles, too late to get the author, etc). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 11:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>New pages log, hadn't thought of that. The bot would need to be near-realtime though, deleted pages disappear from the New pages log as well. One could also correlate it with the deletion log and so avoid any lag after deletion. But, some pages start off as dormant, semi-respectable stubs, and only get deleted after later edits make it apparent that they're nonnotable bios or copyvios. The bot would need to keep new pages in its memory at least for as long as a few weeks if not months this way. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 15:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>However, usually the original creator of an article is not present. How about also notifying everyone who's made 4 edits or more, or if it's speedied on sight, how about 3? It should also check whether a user has made an edit within the last 2 weeks also. <a href="../../../-/s/l/User%7E-Slash-_14f9.html" title="User:-Slash-">{<span style="color:green">Slash</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Slash-_adb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Slash-">-|-</a><a href="../../../-/s/l/User_talk%7E-Slash-_9e42.html" title="User talk:-Slash-"><span style="color:red">Talk</span>}</a> 06:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How do you know? Even if many messages might get never read, some will, and these are the whole point of the exercise. Even so, it will keep a history of earlier deleted pages, and admins won't have to bother checking that there was/will be proper notification.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More sophisticated behavior can be added later, as needed. For now it should suffice getting a simple prototype up and running that 1. watches the deletion log for deleted articles, 2. finds their creator from the Special:Undelete page history, and 3. posts a short message.

<p>Well, just thought of something, though . . . each category is going to have multiple articles in it. So, if your limit is 50-100 <i>edits</i> you're going to have to do just a handful of <i>categories</i>. Take a look at the number articles in the first few categories (starting with #1), and then select just that number of categories that will give you the number of edits you are aiming for. (This sounds like quite a bit of work, but I doing this in the interest of science!) <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspanaViva_0cb0.html" title="User:EspanaViva"><font color="red"><i>Espana</i></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/User_talk%7EEspanaViva_b2e1.html" title="User talk:EspanaViva"><font color="#F88017"><b>Viva</b></font></a> 21:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot idea for blocked users to appeal themselves</span></h2>
<p>What do you think of the idea of a bot for users who are blocked, especially those who <i>completely</i> blocked (i.e. from editing the talk page), are not unblocked and given the chance to insert an appeal/edit <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> or <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, and (for whatever reason) don't have e-mail with which to e-mail a request to a higher authority? Specification idea: This bot would use a CGI form page for blocked users to fill out with their username and information such as a reason for requesting the appeal. The bot would require that this is coming from the same IP address the user last used, by comparing the HTTP client's originating IP with the last-known IP with which the user was logged on at Wikipedia and making sure that IP address itself (and possibly its talk page) is/are blocked from editing. If this test passes, the bot would use a designated username to edit either some page such as <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, or some designated subpage specifically for entries by the bot (to "sandbox" it just in case of abuse of the feature, but the page would have to be watched like the other logistical pages). --<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlooper_Glooper_0baf.html" title="User:Blooper Glooper">Blooper Glooper</a> 01:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was thinking a new page patrol bot that would use Bayesian filtering and learn from other newpage patrollers (such as me) the general content of vandalism/attack/advert/joke pages.</p>
<p>It would go to new pages, check the length, check it for words like "gay" and "sucks", and if it raised a sufficent number of red flags, it would tag it with something like {{Botspeedy}}.</p>
<p>And as an added bonus, it could also add tags like {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../u/n/c/Template%7EUncategorized_8ec2.html" title="Template:Uncategorized">uncategorized</a>}} (which are simple business really).</p>
<p>Now we can't get too headstrong and assume that a bot will be right 100% of the time when tagging pages for deletion. So we would have to make a separate "bot flagged" template like {{tl|Botspeedy}. It would say something like</p>
<pre>

<dd>Also, it's not just enough to tag an article for speedy delete because it "looks" spammy. A human being should do a cursory glance, if there is even a small chance of notability, at least do a quick google search. And if the page does deserve a tag, there is still the matter of notifying the page creator (as someone else has said, if you don't tell an editor you're deleting his/her article, then the probability increases significantly that he/she will just create it again). Plus if it looks like a conflict of interest, a note about <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> is appropriate.

<dd>Well I guess that you could say that they are all in the aircraft category. There is also the specified form sort of like intro boxes.

<p>Hi, i'm trying to standardize all filmographies etc to the guidelines laid down by <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28lists_of_works%29_56de.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lists of works)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lists of works)</a>, specifically that items in filmographies, discographies etc should be listed in chronological order, earliest first. At the moment i am manually searching for articles that have their filmographies listed upside-down (reverse-chronological) and manually tagging them with the {{<a href="../../../m/o/s/Template%7EMOSLOW_df6a.html" title="Template:MOSLOW">MOSLOW</a>}} tag.</p>
<p>Obviously there will be thousands, including many i would never find manually. I wonder if there would be some way of recognizing an "upside-down filmography" automatically (e.g. by finding a section called "Filmography" then looking at two consecutive lines - if they have differing years, the second being lower than the first, then we can assume its an upside-down filmography). In that case the page just needs to be tagged with {{<a href="../../../m/o/s/Template%7EMOSLOW_df6a.html" title="Template:MOSLOW">MOSLOW</a>}}. The next stage, of actully fixing it, is not needed just yet (although <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhilding87_b841.html" title="User:Whilding87">User:Whilding87</a> has a nice script on his user page for that).</p>
<p>The bot doesnt have to recognize *every single* upside-down filmography (because there are many different formats), but if it can capture a sizeable number of articles with upside-down filmographies, it will be worth it. 82.9.25.163 18:15, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's funny, I had the same idea yesterday. Finding upside down lists and tables requires a regular expression and a loop, nothing too fancy. I am contemplating writing this bot. Because it would be my first one, I think it's best if it would be user-assisted. I'd have it list all pages it finds (in categories with actors, writers, directors etc) that it thinks need a {{moslow}} on a special userpage, for human review. After reviewing and editing out the false positives manually, the bot can apply the templates on the remaining linked pages. Good thing is I can program. Bad thing is i've never used python or pyWikipediaBot before. From <a href="../../../c/r/e/Wikipedia%7ECreating_a_bot_7f22.html" title="Wikipedia:Creating a bot">Wikipedia:Creating a bot</a> I gather that pyWikipediaBot is the easiest way to start.

<dd>Thanks for the offer to send the functioning module. I know as much perl as I know python, none. But I'm sure I can pick it up quite fast and ask people for help if I need any. Most of the bots I see on the RFA page are written in python, so currently I'm still more inclined to use that. But I'm not deciding which framework I am going to use just yet, first I'm going to document some bot requirements, then I'm going to decide on a framework.. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheroachman_a473.html" title="User:Theroachman">theroachman</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheroachman_c720.html" title="User talk:Theroachman"><sup><small>T</small></sup></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Theroachman_af3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Theroachman"><sup><small>C</small></sup></a> 21:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh excellent remark, thank you for that. I have checked out all those discussions and gave my two cents in the RfC. The fact that there is no consensus for filmographies makes it even more likely that a bot is needed in the future, when a consensus is reached. The bot should be programmed to find filmographies that are not following that consensus and mark them with {{moslow}}. Thanks again for the heads up.

<dd>Don't get discouraged; all input is appreciated. One of the pillars of Wikipdedia is "be bold" and yet there are hundreds of pages of text worth of policies, etc. It can be frustrating trying to join a new process, when you are encouraged to "jump in" but then feel like people are jumping on you when you suggest something that violates policy or has already been done, which you didn't know. So, don't give up, read as much as you can, share any new ideas you have, and don't get upset if someone else doesn't like them. I know I've had lots of ideas that no one else liked. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 07:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a simple, but very great bot idea and I would really like this bot to be made for me since I don't have enough programming language knowledge to make my own.</p>
<p>Anyway, over the month I have noticed numerous article with the word, "although", commonly misspelled as "althought". A bot that would change all the mispelled "although"s, would be useful on Wikipedia and it would save time and effort rather than doing this process manually.</p>
<p>If someone is willing to make this bot, hand the "code" over to me and teach me how to operate/set the bot up, etc. Please contact me on my talk page.

<dd>But you don't account for the possibility that the word "althought" will ever be added to the English language, or that the made-up word "althought" will somehow become significant, such as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_noun.html" title="Proper noun">proper noun</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Need a bot to change links</span></h2>
<p>I've just created the article <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_heresy.html" title="Christian heresy">Christian heresy</a> with text extracted from <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">Heresy</a>. There are lots of articles that link to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">Heresy</a>. Most of them need to link to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_heresy.html" title="Christian heresy">Christian heresy</a>. What I need is a bot that will go through a set of links and either automatically or interactively change links to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">Heresy</a> into links to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_heresy.html" title="Christian heresy">Christian heresy</a>. Where can I post such a request so that a kindly bot writer will see it and maybe help me with this? Or... is there a bot in existence that will do what I want done? --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 07:13, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bot would have to know which article to link to.

<dd>I'm sorry. I probably didn't make my request clear. The bot would look at the "What links here" for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">Heresy</a> and then go through each article and replace the link to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">Heresy</a> with a link to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_heresy.html" title="Christian heresy">Christian heresy</a>. In the worst case, a completely automated bot would make some articles link to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_heresy.html" title="Christian heresy">Christian heresy</a> that should have linked to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">Heresy</a>. These errors would have to be fixed manually.</dd>

It's just \[\[(h|H)eresy\]\]→[[Christian heresy|$1eresy]] on the first line and \[\[heresy(\|.+)\]\]→[[Christian heresy$1]] on the second line for links that are already piped. AWB requires that you check each edit anyway so that's not a concern. In fact I just tried it and it works fine. If I had time I'd do it myself, but I'm going to go to bed soon and tomorrow's booked. I'll do some tonight anyway.

Ideally I'd get links to oldids at various stages such as quarterly and the same data on the article at each of those points. Could certainly be run on an offline database copy.

<dd>I'd like to have a go, though I've never made a bot before. I know VB, but I've no idea how to make it interface with WP, so any help would be appreciated. I envisage it working as follows: look at a database dump, looking at articles' Special:Whatlinkshere. If all entries have User:, Wikipedia:, etc. prefaced to them, then retrieve the live article from WP. Check the whatlinkshere to make sure it still is empty of articles. Check the contents of the article to make sure it doesn't already have an orphan tag.

One that could actually check "what links here" would be great. If anyone wants to write something like this with pyWiki or whatever, and show me how to use it, I will take care of running it if it works relatively automatically. Note: It would need to be able to ignore certain types of pages, like dab pages. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 19:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was recently nominating an article for deletion when I realized how tedious it is, plus this is something that everyone (not just admins) can do anyway. Here's how it works, a user places a tag on the articles page that looks something like {{subst:afd | cat=Category | text=Reason the page should be deleted}}, the bot is monitoring recent changes, creates the Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PageName with the preloaded debate, and adds the page to that days listings. Additionally an intelligent bot could easily tell if there had been a previous listing and handle the page naming accordingly. Also, because this process involves creating a new page the bot would simply remove the tag and take no action if an anonymous IP added it. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 08:49, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree, wikis should have the smallest learning curve possible, including the least amount of setup to be able to use them. You don't even have to create an account to edit a page, but to propose for deletion easily you have to setup a JS tool? Especially because the average user will propose very few articles for deletion, we should make the first time easy, not the subsequent times. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 09:27, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you're just doing it once, you don't have to set up the tool. You can just follow the easy three step process outlined on the page. It's not prohibitively difficult, and if as you say the average user will propose very few articles for deletion the amount of time it takes is negligible in the long run. It takes longer to read the deletion policy than it does to learn how to nominate an article for AFD, so if someone is too lazy to learn how to do it properly they probably shouldn't be nominating anything for deletion anyway because they probably haven't spent the time to make a properly thought out decision about whether or not its deletion is merited.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 10:17, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The three steps are not that easy, and unrelated to me their is a current discussion about the instructions being too complicated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_977d.html#Too_much_instruction" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion">here</a>, admittedly it's not unanimous but it still proves the point that I'm not the only one of this viewpoint. This is especially true if it's not the first nomination, which I might add the js tool you pointed out can't handle either. I'll admit this isn't the difference between 2 hours and 1 minute, but it is the difference between 5-10 minutes and 1 minute with basically no downside. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 11:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As someone who also found the process ridiculous and tedious, and who also made a bot approval request for this task, I have to say this is definitely a problem in need of a solution. My own solution of a form field was not approved since edits would have been made under the bot, not the user's account. This proposed alternative seems to bypass those objections. I am in support of it and would be willing to help out with coding if necessary. I think the suggestion that a user must install a JS tool prior to suggesting an article for deletion is crazy. Wikipedia should be as easy and intuitive to use as possible - <a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPocklingtonDan_89be.html" title="User:PocklingtonDan">PocklingtonDan</a> (<a href="../../../p/o/c/User_talk%7EPocklingtonDan_cbc6.html" title="User talk:PocklingtonDan">talk</a>) 12:43, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I never said anyone <i>must</i> do anything. Please refrain from putting words in my mouth. Vicarious called the AFD process tedious, and for experienced users the script makes it less so. In that post he never once said that his point was to make it easier or more open to newcomers, he said that in his second post. Obviously no one would expect a new user to bother with JS scripts. Regardless, I stand by my statement that it is not prohibitively difficult. Anyone with sufficient time on their hands and a modest understanding of wiki markup should have no problem with it. For that matter, how many people who don't have the knowledge necessary to do a couple of template substitutions has enough knowledge of policy to be able to justify their AfD nomination in the first place? Also, a bot would still be making the edits, only the posting of the initial template summoning the bot would be by the nominating user, and that strikes me as adding an unnecessary potential for abuse. If someone wants to write the bot I'm not going to argue with them, I simply see this as completely unnecessary. Go ahead if you want though.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 22:04, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

To my knowledge, it's not an official policy, but in some situations the argument does make sense. Say you created a list of the kings of Spain, which was basically a collection of links to articles about the kings. If all of the articles listed had references, then the need for references for the list itself could possibly be waived, although I myself would be opposed to such an exemption. Some counter this by saying that categories are more useful, but the relative merits of categories and lists are really another matter entirely. Therefore, to prevent the bot getting entangled in the whole debate, I recommend that it leave lists alone. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalanskov_2d06.html" title="User:Galanskov">Galanskov</a> 00:01, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

In Squire's book on Peru (Peru, Incidents of Travel and Exploration in the Land of the Incas, by E.

<dd>Some time ago, I wrote a script to make a list of unreferenced math articles, and while it is not impossible, it is harder than you expect because of natural language issues. The section headings that are used for references in articles are quite varied. Not all referenced articles use any sort of citation template. You should expect several percent false positives the first time you search for unreferenced articles (which I estimate at around a hundred thousand errors if you scan the entire article space and exclude redirects and disambiguation pages). <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 04:26, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. Cleanup lists aren't working all that well at the moment. This is more about giving a clear reminder to users that they have a duty to reference their articles, and getting them to do so voluntarily. I certainly don't think that most editors would do so, but a sizable minority would, particularly on anything that isn't an unwatched and unattended stub. And of course the template could go onto every new article. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Mostlyharmless</a> 02:11, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A better idea might be to after a new article is created and the vandel fighters have delt with it, a bot goes and checks for references and if it does not have references it tags the articel and informs the editor.--<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonguy_1ec0.html" title="User:Balloonguy">Balloonguy</a> 19:21, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you Balloonguy. I think one of the real problems is that newcomers aren't fully aware of how vital it is that articles be referenced, so they create unreferenced articles and by the time they fully grasp the importance of citing sources they've forgotten about their really old articles. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalanskov_2d06.html" title="User:Galanskov">Galanskov</a> 02:03, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To the best of my (limited) understanding AWB is not able to do the following in a reasonably efficient way. A manually assisted bot with a easy user interface so more than the bot creator can use it, that points links to disambig pages to the correct page. First, the bot would find links to disambig pages that are likely to be incorrect, meaning it would ignore links from other disambig pages as well as anything but the main article space. Then it would show the user the few sentences around where the link in the article on one side, and the disambig page on the other, however simply clicking the link on the disambig page completes the operation with no typing involved. Also, a well made bot could guess the correct link frequently enough for it to be worth adding a feature where the bot recommends an option to the user by highlighting it. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 07:47, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing user pages from categories</span></h2>
<p>A common mistake when linking to categories is to forgo the initial colon, i.e. write [[Category:Wkipedia]] instead of [[:Category:Wikipedia]]. A related mistake is when users copy an article over to user space and forget to &lt;nowiki&gt; or link the categories and interwiki links rather than including the page in them. A similar thing happens when developing/reworking templates. Could a bot be made to regularly (say every month) scan all wikipedia categories looking for these incidents and sorting them out? Note that extra care would have to be taken with respect to user categories and user-based templates, which obviously don't want to be touched. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Peel_9ea8.html" title="User:Mike Peel">Mike Peel</a> 23:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's what I can come up with concerning your questions:
<ol>
<li>That would depend on how many categories we have, but I don't think it would matter. That's what bots are for, if it had to run for three days to check all the categories then what would be the problem? It could be placed on a server and run continuously or it could just run in the background of the computer of one of the many people who leave their computer on all the time. It's not like bot software is typically all that system intensive.</li>
<li>How many categories that belong on user pages are not a subcategory of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_94a6.html" title="Category:Wikipedians">Category:Wikipedians</a>? If it was merely a matter of skipping those categories then it would be easy to do that.</li>
<li>I think it would be best if it just added the colon. In the instance of a post on a talk page forgetting the colon, there would be no way to know who added the category in order to post on their talk page without trolling through the page history. It should just have an edit summary stating what it's doing and why.</li>
<li>I don't know about this one. Is there any way to obtain a comprehensive list of templates that add categories to mainspace articles?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Anyway, if this could be done it has the potential to be quite useful, if this really is all that much of a problem. I might look into doing it later if I have the time; but I do think someone should do it.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 22:48, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In reply to 4: I think that you'd need to search through all of the templates looking for [[Category:]] links that aren't in &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt; statements, then manually check through it to remove the templates that don't intentionally include the articles in the categories. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Peel_9ea8.html" title="User:Mike Peel">Mike Peel</a> 23:09, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>I have no idea. Presumably not a huge length of time, though - the contents of each category (a simple text array) would need to be fetched then parsed for <i>User:</i> and <i>talk:</i> pages, which I wouldn't have thought would take too long.</li>
<li>This is an important question. The best way I can think of to deal with this would be to search for categories with user pages in them, then the bot operator would have to approve/disprove (or whitelist/blacklist) each category based on its title, description and contents. If these lists were then stored and checked against, this would only need to be done <i>en mass</i> the first time, with reduced numbers of categories appearing in the future. One issue with this would be if the categories were repurposed to do a different job; I'm not sure how this could be dealt with.</li>
<li>I was thinking: change [[Category:Wikipedia]] to [[:Category:Wikipedia]], leaving a useful edit summary that would, if possible, contain a link to a page explaining the reasons in more detail. I would argue against removing the category links (they are generally kept on the page for a reason). Commenting out with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; statements would also be a possibility, and would be preferable in cases of lots of category links (e.g. at the bottom of a template being redeveloped), but less appropriate for a single category link in the midst of a talk comment. I like the idea of leaving a message on the user's talk page, but there would be a few issues with only doing this: it assumes that the user will read the message, and take action based on that, and it also leaves the clutter in the categories until the user fixes their pages.</li>
<li>The bot could pick these instances out by identifying the page by the list of contents from the category, then searching for [[Category: statements within the text; if it didn't find any, then it could either look through the templates included, searching for the category link, or it could add the page to a list of pages which could then be checked through manually later.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Something else the bot would have to keep an eye out for: making sure that the category links aren't already in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; statements. Also, I'd recommend that the bot only makes one edit per page, removing all offending category links at once, if possible.</dd>
<dd>I know that this wouldn't be a simple bot to make, and would probably take a fair bit of manual maintaining. But I'd argue that that makes it a challenge, rather than an impossibility.

<dd>The situation where this is a bit of a problem occurs when a citation needed tag is replaced by a "reference" to another wikipedia page. The fullurl link/footnote makes the text appear to have a reference. If these could be replaced by standard wikilinks, it would be more evident what's going on.

<p>To the best of my (limited) understanding AWB is not able to do the following in a reasonably efficient way. A manually assisted bot with a easy user interface so more than the bot creator can use it, that points links to disambig pages to the correct page. First, the bot would find links to disambig pages that are likely to be incorrect, meaning it would ignore links from other disambig pages as well as anything but the main article space. Then it would show the user the few sentences around where the link in the article on one side, and the disambig page on the other, however simply clicking the link on the disambig page completes the operation with no typing involved. Also, a well made bot could guess the correct link frequently enough for it to be worth adding a feature where the bot recommends an option to the user by highlighting it. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 07:47, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing user pages from categories</span></h2>
<p>A common mistake when linking to categories is to forgo the initial colon, i.e. write [[Category:Wkipedia]] instead of [[:Category:Wikipedia]]. A related mistake is when users copy an article over to user space and forget to &lt;nowiki&gt; or link the categories and interwiki links rather than including the page in them. A similar thing happens when developing/reworking templates. Could a bot be made to regularly (say every month) scan all wikipedia categories looking for these incidents and sorting them out? Note that extra care would have to be taken with respect to user categories and user-based templates, which obviously don't want to be touched. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Peel_9ea8.html" title="User:Mike Peel">Mike Peel</a> 23:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's what I can come up with concerning your questions:
<ol>
<li>That would depend on how many categories we have, but I don't think it would matter. That's what bots are for, if it had to run for three days to check all the categories then what would be the problem? It could be placed on a server and run continuously or it could just run in the background of the computer of one of the many people who leave their computer on all the time. It's not like bot software is typically all that system intensive.</li>
<li>How many categories that belong on user pages are not a subcategory of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_94a6.html" title="Category:Wikipedians">Category:Wikipedians</a>? If it was merely a matter of skipping those categories then it would be easy to do that.</li>
<li>I think it would be best if it just added the colon. In the instance of a post on a talk page forgetting the colon, there would be no way to know who added the category in order to post on their talk page without trolling through the page history. It should just have an edit summary stating what it's doing and why.</li>
<li>I don't know about this one. Is there any way to obtain a comprehensive list of templates that add categories to mainspace articles?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Anyway, if this could be done it has the potential to be quite useful, if this really is all that much of a problem. I might look into doing it later if I have the time; but I do think someone should do it.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 22:48, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In reply to 4: I think that you'd need to search through all of the templates looking for [[Category:]] links that aren't in &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt; statements, then manually check through it to remove the templates that don't intentionally include the articles in the categories. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Peel_9ea8.html" title="User:Mike Peel">Mike Peel</a> 23:09, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have no idea. Presumably not a huge length of time, though - the contents of each category (a simple text array) would need to be fetched then parsed for <i>User:</i> and <i>talk:</i> pages, which I wouldn't have thought would take too long.</li>
<li>This is an important question. The best way I can think of to deal with this would be to search for categories with user pages in them, then the bot operator would have to approve/disprove (or whitelist/blacklist) each category based on its title, description and contents. If these lists were then stored and checked against, this would only need to be done <i>en mass</i> the first time, with reduced numbers of categories appearing in the future. One issue with this would be if the categories were repurposed to do a different job; I'm not sure how this could be dealt with.</li>
<li>I was thinking: change [[Category:Wikipedia]] to [[:Category:Wikipedia]], leaving a useful edit summary that would, if possible, contain a link to a page explaining the reasons in more detail. I would argue against removing the category links (they are generally kept on the page for a reason). Commenting out with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; statements would also be a possibility, and would be preferable in cases of lots of category links (e.g. at the bottom of a template being redeveloped), but less appropriate for a single category link in the midst of a talk comment. I like the idea of leaving a message on the user's talk page, but there would be a few issues with only doing this: it assumes that the user will read the message, and take action based on that, and it also leaves the clutter in the categories until the user fixes their pages.</li>
<li>The bot could pick these instances out by identifying the page by the list of contents from the category, then searching for [[Category: statements within the text; if it didn't find any, then it could either look through the templates included, searching for the category link, or it could add the page to a list of pages which could then be checked through manually later.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Something else the bot would have to keep an eye out for: making sure that the category links aren't already in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; statements. Also, I'd recommend that the bot only makes one edit per page, removing all offending category links at once, if possible.</dd>
<dd>I know that this wouldn't be a simple bot to make, and would probably take a fair bit of manual maintaining. But I'd argue that that makes it a challenge, rather than an impossibility.

I've been running into cases where they are used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests" rel="nofollow">inline links</a>, or to provide what appear to be "references".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 23:00, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting - checking at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Special%7ELinksearch_3efd.html" title="Special:Linksearch">Special:Linksearch</a>, it looks like the fullurl of en.wikipedia.org is used in templates like {{logo}} and {{albumcover}}. That means, I guess, that it is in most if not all image pages. So this (hypothetical) bot should only check mainspace and maybe talkspace. -- <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;"><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></font> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">(♫♫)</a> 03:25, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The situation where this is a bit of a problem occurs when a citation needed tag is replaced by a "reference" to another wikipedia page. The fullurl link/footnote makes the text appear to have a reference. If these could be replaced by standard wikilinks, it would be more evident what's going on. Just wondering if this was already a task for some bot. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 03:45, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Request for Mizabot/Metsbot/or another bot which subst tags</span></h2>
<p>First, I have a request for a new task for a bot which substitutes tags. Per the <a href="../../../a/l/b/WP%7EALBUMA_eb57.html" title="WP:ALBUMA">album assessment</a> project, we assess albums which have the {{albums}} tag. Instead, for assessing, I need to have this tag (shown below) placed on each album talk page, instead of the regular {{albums}} tag...because the regular album's tag makes the album harder to assess.</p>
<p><br />
{{Album |class= |importance= |attention= |needs-infobox= |auto= }}</p>
<p>Second, what happened to Antivandalbot? Thanks. <b><a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReal96_8494.html" title="User:Real96"><font color="#6495ED" face="georgia">Real96</font></a></b> 00:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone — don't remember who — had a brilliant suggestion on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdminship_survey_ad61.html" title="Wikipedia:Adminship survey">Wikipedia:Adminship survey</a> (I think) and it's good enough that I thought it should be brought up here: A manually assisted script to help close AfDs more quickly. I could envision it as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program prompts the closing admin to close a given AfD as keep or delete (merges and such would probably just fall under "keep") and fill in a closing rationale. The bot places the closing templates on the top and bottom of the AfD, removes the topic category, and fills in the given closing rationale.</li>
<li>Admin deletes the article if the result is delete. Perhaps if it is a keep, the bot could remove the AfD notice and place the {{<a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdfull_87e8.html" title="Template:Oldafdfull">oldafdfull</a>}} template on the talk page with the proper parameters.</li>
<li>If the result is delete, the bot would automatically remove relevant links to the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would help a lot (for me at least) in clearing the AfD backlog. Removing the category, manually closing the article and especially removing links to the page is time consuming, and could be done by a bot, I think. I'm a mac user, I don't know if I'd be able to utilize it necessarily but I'm sure other people would appreciate it too. Comments?

If you want me to have it add something else to the author's talk instead, like what you have above, please create a subpage in your userspace with it and I'll have the script use that instead. Second, the author's talk page opens in a new window, so you'll need your popup blocker to exempt Wikipedia or it'll get blocked. Third, I used something in the script that so far as I know only works with Firefox and Opera; if you use IE this won't work for you. If that's the case, make a note here and I'll alter it for you. Or you could just switch to Firefox, you'll be happier anyway.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 07:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This bot would need human input. It uses the RSS feed and the recent changes page and updates itself every 1 minute. It then highlights possible vandalism.

The bot would then act accordingly,if its vandalism revert it and add a warning to the offenders talk page : If not ignore it. It would not be active unless you go to the certian page. (That way you are not bugged every minute by a bot buzzing at you). This might need to be a monobook script to really work out properly.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NY Times links</span></h2>
<p>Standard links to New York Times articles expire after a while, and direct the user to a paid archival service. These are the links one gets from simply copying the url of an news article they are viewing. However, the Times also provides permanent anchors for blogs. To get the permanent anchor, one can use <a href="http://nytimes.blogspace.com/genlink" class="external text" title="http://nytimes.blogspace.com/genlink" rel="nofollow">this service</a>, though there may also be some simple algorithm for it. I've probably fixed dozens of such links using this method, and the NYTimes must be one of the most common citation sources. So, it seems like a good project for a bored bot to run around and change the temporary links to permanent ones. As an example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palestine_Peace_Not_Apartheid&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111738955" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palestine_Peace_Not_Apartheid&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111738955" rel="nofollow">here's one</a> I just fixed, which inspired me to make this suggestion. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 02:56, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi! Due to issues with overtagging, most of the bot operators who can assist you will not blindly add subcategories. I recommend creating a user or wikiproject subpage where you can list all of the categories that should be included, depending on how deep you want to go. Also, you can use <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a> to do this yourself if you want to! Simply create a bot account (such as User:NatterBot, or User:PlanningBot, but there are no required conventions on naming). Then you can download <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a> and request approval at <a href="../../../r/f/b/WP%7ERFBA_c91b.html" title="WP:RFBA">WP:RFBA</a>. Once approved, your bot will receive a bot flag and someone will allow you to use <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a>. If you still want someone else to do this, and would like a list of all subcategories to use as a starting point for the final list, just post here and tell me how deep to go - no edits will be made until you approve the list. <a href="../../../s/t/4/User%7EST47_d0a2.html" title="User:ST47">ST47</a><small><a href="../../../s/t/4/User_talk%7EST47_ecf4.html" title="User talk:ST47">Talk</a></small> 13:38, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why would you want to get rid of wikilinks to sections? They're quite useful for things like character pages for TV shows that have a dozen or so characters on them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Category Bot</span></h2>
<p>Hmm, well, I've been busy with random stuff lately, particularly minor edits. I've cleaned up from 1 - 1 BC (After the 19th century in its entirety) in the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Special%7ECategories_101d.html" title="Special:Categories">categories</a> at current. My proposal would be for a bot to...</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a random article space page.</li>
<li>Check that page for typoes in categories (IE: Births --&gt; births, deathse --&gt; deaths)</li>
<li>Fix said typos.</li>
<li>Save page with a minor edit and a summary of the changes (IE: CatBot: Births --&gt; births, DeAths --&gt; deaths)</li>
<li>And, if possible, if the category remains redlinked and there is only one page in the category, remove the category from the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I understand not all of this might be possible, but it's certainly labour intensive to do this by hand, especially when the same categories can simply popup again and again due to human error. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogical2u_96f0.html" title="User:Logical2u">Logical2u</a><sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Logical2u_daa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Logical2u">Review me!</a></sub> 18:22, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps a nicer way of doing this would be to look through the category listing for categories with typos, and correct the typos category by category - that way whole mis-spelt categories could be removed quickly, all at once (rather than random page by random page). <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 23:12, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That would require a list of typos. It could look through random pages, make a list of categories that don't have not been created, then it can show that list to a human. A human can match them up to the correct one, and the bot can check each mis-spellings category for other identical misspellings, and fix them all.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of going through random pages, going through a database dump would allow the finding of all categories that are used but do not exist.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">City name redirects</span></h2>
<p>Is there a way to create a bot to automatically create redirects to American city articles from names that are incorrectly punctuated or capitalized? For example, there are many many city articles for which ONLY searching for "Baltimore, MD" will get you to the right article. "baltimore MD", "Baltimore MD", "baltimore md", sometimes even "baltimore, MD" either take you to a search results page or to nothing at all. As most of these articles were created by a bot to begin with, someone suggested that a bot could create these redirects.

<dd>Try their "Coffee room" or whatever it's called.

<p>As a side note, <b>mabey</b> this bot should also put <b>{{archivebox|auto=yes}}</b> automatically in every talk page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have a strong objection to this. Not because I personally don't like the templates, but because the community has rejected that idea many times in the past. Some people think that if talkheader is on every talk page, it will just look like a disclaimer/copyright message and people will skip right over it by habit. Besides, if we wanted {{<a href="../../../t/a/l/Template%7ETalkheader_069e.html" title="Template:Talkheader">talkheader</a>}} on every talk page, there's a mediawiki feature for that, we don't need a bot for it. :-) —<span style="color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M<small>ETS</small>501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 05:38, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This bot comes out of a discussion with Ray Saintonge on wikien-l.</p>
<p>The problem: we have a zillion schoolkids vandalizing Wikipedia from shared IP addresses. We clean it up some, and then we block. This a bunch of work for us, people other than the vandals see warning messages that don't apply to them, and then a lot of innocent people suffer until we unblock.</p>
<p>The solution: School administrators put a special template on the IP talk page to show their interest in a given IP. Whenever a warning or a block happens, the administrator gets an email notice. They then take some locally appropriate action, defusing the situation before we block. Or if a block happens, then when people come to them with questions, they already know the answer.</p>
<p>I don't have time to build this in the near future, but if anybody gets interested and wants to chat about it, feel free to get in touch. Thanks, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 17:12, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been reading the thread on wikien-l, but I have one problem. Do you think that school administrators would actually place that template there?

<dd>A school admin can look at the block log and talk page.

<dd>True, but knowing is not the same as doing. Suppose their students average one warning a month. If they look daily, then that's 97% of the time that they get empty logs. Under those conditions, most people would stop checking. Given that the school techs I know are all overworked, I imagine that goes doubly so for them. Whereas if they get immediate e-mail notification, they could take immediate action if they so desired. As to spam, I could think of a few ways around that. The most obvious is to just use the Wikipedia email system.

<dd>Hi, Mets. I think some school administrators would. And when they come by unblock-en-l to get unblocked, they could be told how to reduce the chance of blocks in the future. One recent message on unblock was part of the inspiration; the administrator was clearly willing to do more to keep a block from happening again. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 22:44, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think this would work. The high schools in my district all have library accessible computers that require no login authentication. Having a log file from Wikipedia of the vandalism would not give administrators an effective means of finding the students.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, vandalizing Wikipedia is not against any school user agreements, so the actual recourse that can be done by the administrator is practically nothing.</dd>

<dd>Just to be clear, I wasn't thinking of a log file. When the IP got a warning, they'd get an email. From the one administrator I talked to personally, he said he'd go out, look at who was using the library computers, and tell the person involved to knock it off. Recently on unblock-en-l, one administrator looking to get unblocked said they'd even be having an assembly to explain the right way to deal with Wikipedia. This would be used by the people who care and ignored by the ones who don't. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:29, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it would be good if schools do chase up a little more on vandalism. Not saying they should chase up on every incident obviously no one has the time but a little chasing up along with a clear instructions by the school on what is acceptable and/or a little nudging would go a long away IMHO. I've always been of the belief that it is the responsibility of schools to some extent to help teach etiquete and decent behaviour (obviously this is predominantly the parents role but school plays a part) and this kind of thing can help IMHO. I also suspect it would in fact be against most school policies to vandalise wikipedia. Most won't have anything specific but general AUPs would probably have something that would cover it. E.g. being disruptive, obscenities (well, for a lot of vandalism), etc. Heck even general policies may apply (using school property to cause damage). In any case, most school policies only allow educational usage and I doubt anyone will be able to successfully argue that vandalising wikipedia can be resonably considered educational usage (some 'bright' sparks may try of course). Remember that it isn't a court of law we're talking about here. I don't know how things work in the US say, perhaps the nature of the ways work there mean that school policies have to be very specific or they'll get sued. But I suspect in a lot of other countries this is not the case, school policies don't really have be that specific, there is a resonable amount of leeway. Also, we're not talking about students getting suspensions here (that sort of thing probably does have to be spelt out resonably well), maybe not even punishments (although I think with many schools that wouldn't be unresonable, especially restricting computer access for a short time) just a stern word with the students and if necessary involving the parents would often probably be enough. And once a student has been warned of course, even if the policies aren't that clear in that specific area, the fact the student has been warned would mean in most schools further action would be acceptable if necessary. Universities are of course a different area although even then I would suspect it would still be against policies. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 09:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't actually know about it, but reading through <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/interwiki.py" class="extiw" title="m:interwiki.py">m:interwiki.py</a>, doesn't it determine the transitive closure set from the perspective of the operator's (single) language wikipedia (step 1 of the above) and update links only in that wikipedia? The point of the suggestion is to make the set of links the same for all wikipedias in the closure set (i.e. run in multiple language wikipedias effecitvely simultaneously). This would require having bot logins in all the wikipedias the bot is updating, but I assume this is a solvable issue. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 20:39, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandal Detection Bot</span></h2>
<p>Make a bot that can scan through the user talk pages of IP addresses and detect a specific vandalism tag which includes the date of vandalism, then have it count the number of tags within a certain time period, and if a minimum number is met, post the IP address and a link to the user page on a "block page" for administrators to look at. Store a list of all IP address vandalism and check to see if vandalism tags are removed from user talk page. To save server access time, the list of IP addresses to block can be loaded to the page every x times.</p>
<p>Outline of the process: Check user page, counting all vandalism tags dated after x date. Also, count overall number of tags. Compare count to y number of allowed tags, if greater, move ip address to list to be updated to the server. Also, check overall number of tags against last overall number of tags count. If new overall number of tags is less than old, move ip address to list to be updated to server with comment about missing tags. If not, store new count of overall tags to client side data file. After z number of ip addresses have been found to be over the limit of number of allowable tags, append list to special "block consideration" page for administrators to view, along with any comments on why they should be blocked and a link to their talk page. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamienhunter_daae.html" title="User:Damienhunter">D</a> 16:33, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. First, user talk pages can be blanked; to be complete, the bot would need to go through history pages (or diffs). Second, anonymous IP addresses vary - some are dial-up, some are dedicated (home broadband), some are from schools, some are from business; how these are handled varies. Third, the algorithm could be endlessly argued over - how serious, within what period, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most importantly, if editors who are placing the warnings know about <i>levels</i> of warnings, then they almost certainly know about <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, and can report problems (reporting is very easy). If they don't understand levels of warnings, then the bot is likely not to be useful, but the data it uses isn't useful. -- <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;"><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></font> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">(♫♫)</a> 19:17, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The talk pages are scanned for blanking. Here's the line that deals with that, found in my section "Outline of the process:" <b>If new overall number of tags is less than old, move ip address to list to be updated to server with comment about missing tags.</b> If the page is blanked, the vandalism tags won't be greater than the number of the current scan, so the user will be caught redhanded. To make that work better, I'll even check the talk pages tags behind the date of the last scan. That way it only compares the number of old tags to the number of old tags.</dd>

<dd>As for the arguments over the algorithm, I'm going to set the standard. As each editor uses their own judgment, it would not hurt to have a little uniformity. After all, that's a part of being bold. Third, the tags in question are going to be a newly designed tag. They will be specific for my bot. Meaning that instead of tagging first, second, third, last warning, there will only need to be two tags: a tag for possible negligent editing that looks like vandalism, and a tag for actual vandalism. The count will determine which level of tag the user is on. So if you get the vandalism tag 5 times in an hour, then I'm sorry, but one of those was your last chance and you are going to be added to the list. The algorithm will however skip over possible negligent vandalism tags, giving benefit of the doubt to the IP editor. --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamienhunter_daae.html" title="User:Damienhunter">D</a> 01:41, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course they have. They've also heard of static IPs. If there is consistent vandalism over a period of months to a certain type of article, it can warrant blocks for longer than would otherwise be appropriate. The only thing I can see as being appropriate for a bot like this would be to clear old warnings off of the pages for school IP addresses, as those can get pretty crowded in a relatively short period of time and old warnings are much less relevant.--<a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b><span style="color:#000000">ж</span></b></a> 22:02, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you're looking for someone to code up a bot to do the scoring, <i>good luck</i>. That's an awful lot of coding for a system that has no community input, let alone consensus. And the coding would be completely wasted if permission was not given for the bot to operate. I'd guess that approval is hardly guaranteed, since the bot (potentially) will post a rating to <i>every single article talk page in Wikipedia</i>.</dd>

<dd>Generally speaking, it's better to start with a <i>relatively simple</i> scoring system and tweak that (adding complexity where necessary), rather than start with a very complicated one and then try to figure out if (a) the results seem reasonable and (b) if they don't seem reasonable, what needs to be changed to fix that. Plus, a relatively simple system can be tested by doing some calculations manually; what you have is going nowhere if you can't interest someone in coding a bot for it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing wikiproject templates from talk pages of deleted articles</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that there's quite some deleted articles, which still have a wikiproject template on their talk page. This is particularly bad for projects like <a href="../../../v/g/_/WP%7EVG_e1f3.html" title="WP:VG">WP:VG</a>, where there's lots of articles that don't meet the policies for inclusion, and are thus deleted. This clutters up statistics (deleted articles are often poorly rated) and unnecessarily adds extra articles to 'unassessed articles' categories. This could be added to an existing bot that browses talk pages. (Maybe one of the bots that add signatures to unsigned comments?) --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrator_bbf9.html" title="User:Krator">User:Krator</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrator_7c0e.html" title="User talk:Krator">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Krator_5c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Krator">c</a>) 17:20, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Really, talk pages of deleted articles (which are inactive) should be deleted. I'm sure that there was/is a bot somewhere which nominates such pages for deletion, but it seems to be offline now. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 17:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Martin, I'm pretty sure that it is Oleg's <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathbot_604f.html" title="User:Mathbot">Mathbot</a> that used to do that, but it ended up tagging archives instead so he stopped it. <b><a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023"><font color="green">Cbrown1023</font></a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../c/b/r/User_talk%7ECbrown1023_2bb6.html" title="User talk:Cbrown1023"><font color="#002BB8">talk</font></a></b></small> 22:49, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ahh - so really, the best thing would be to ask Oleg to adjust his code to ignore talk pages with "/" in them.

<dd>I don't think inactive talk pages of deleted articles should always be deleted - disputes that existed before the article got deleted might have arise again, and lots of discussion can be avoided this way. However, the project templates should always be removed, hence this bot request. It is easier to do than deleting talk pages, because project templates shouldn't be on subpages or anywhere but article talk pages anyway. --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrator_bbf9.html" title="User:Krator">User:Krator</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrator_7c0e.html" title="User talk:Krator">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Krator_5c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Krator">c</a>) 23:52, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi! Due to issues with overtagging, most of the bot operators who can assist you will not blindly add subcategories. I recommend creating a user or wikiproject subpage where you can list all of the categories that should be included. Also, you can use <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a> to do this yourself if you want to! Simply create a bot account, download <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a> and request approval at <a href="../../../r/f/b/WP%7ERFBA_c91b.html" title="WP:RFBA">WP:RFBA</a>. Once approved, your bot will receive a bot flag and someone will allow you to use <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a>. If you still want someone else to do this, just post here with the category list. -- <span style="background-color: #EECCFF;"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>)</span></span> 14:11, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah - see, there's something of the problems. First, a bot doesn't know which sub-categories to follow and which not to. That's why I suggested coming up with a full list of categories you want run through. Second, a bot doesn't know what's a stub and what isn't. We can tell it to look for pages less than, say, 5,000 characters and mark those. But the bot would be wrong in some instances. If we don't have really clear instructions to give the bot, it would be just as likely to mess things up as it would to make things better. Since I count about 35 categories total that you'd want to go through, you might just want to enlist another WP:PACK member or two and split up the categories and do it by hand. It might *seem* like a bot could do this, but without really clear parameters, humans are better suited to the job, IMHO. -- <span style="background-color: #EECCFF;"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>)</span></span> 01:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Would it be possible for someone to run a bot through all transclusions of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_UK_station_87f3.html" title="Template:Infobox UK station">Template:Infobox UK station</a> and perform the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>exits0405 → usage0405</li>
<li>lowexits0405 → lowusage0405</li>
</ul>
<p>These two fields are identical, the intention is to move all articles over to 'usage' which is a better description of the data. This will allow the template to be simplified and so make it easier to maintain.</p>
<p>The current use of the fields is:</p>

<p>So this change would require in the region of 1749 edits (use of lowexits0405 + use of exits0405). This is of course more than going the other way but as I've said, usage better describes the field. Some of the other fields in the list can also be merged together but I'll work through these manually as they need checking.</p>
<p>If anyone is able to do this, don't hesitate to contact me if there is anything you wish to verify. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 14:36, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I can do this. Would you like the various redirects renamed at the same time? (Some pages use "UK stations", others "Infobox UK station") <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 15:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good point. Including "Infobox UK station" would certainly be preferable to going through the redirects as many do currently. This would increase the number of edits slightly but not much. This would add the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>UK stations → Infobox UK station</li>
<li>UK stations PTE → Infobox UK station</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>There aren't any others that go through redirects. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 15:27, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><b>De</b>Orphan bot</span></h2>
<p>I don't know if this has been done before, or is technically feasible, but a bot that scans Wikipedia to locate articles tagged as orphaned and introduces internal links by putting brackets in words same as the name of the article would be extremely helpful. It wouldn't introduce every link available, but it would reduce the amount of work.--<a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthologist_bfd6.html" title="User:Orthologist">Orthologist</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>That would need to be a human assisted bot because the bot cannot tell if a link is appropriate. However, assisted by a human such a bot could be very productive. <small><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC"><sup>High</sup><sub>InBC</sub></a><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 00:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Why would it need to be assisted? If it located and recognised <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Certificate_in_English_0a1f.html" title="First Certificate in English">First Certificate in English</a> as orphaned, it would scan Wikipedia to find <i>First Certificate in English</i> together and make them into internal links to that page. It wouldn't make <i>feel bad</i> into <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depression</a> (that requires consciousness), but does introducing links by putting brackets around the same exact words as the name of the article require assistance?--<a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthologist_bfd6.html" title="User:Orthologist">Orthologist</a> 22:48, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How would the bot know whether "depression" is being used to refer to something related to a human or something related to a surface? (<a href="../../../s/e/w/User%7ESEWilco_ba0d.html" title="User:SEWilco">SEWilco</a> 23:08, 11 March 2007 (UTC))

<dd>I think the best way to do this is to have a bot make suggestions to a human who can then go back and add the links a appropriate. It could also be written so that it displays the text around the proposed link and the name of the article and let's a human hit link or don't-link. If you have a few orphaned pages in mind, I can search an old database dump for articles containing their titles and provide you a list. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 20:15, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I suggest it should display the first paragraph of the proposed target too, if it's doing more than one target at a time. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonMerlin_5f2b.html" title="User:NeonMerlin"><span style="background:#000;color:red;border:#0f0 solid;border-width:1px 0">Neon</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeonMerlin_f87e.html" title="User talk:NeonMerlin"><span style="background:#0f0;color:#000;border:red solid;border-width:1px 0">Merlin</span></a> 21:02, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I said it wouldn't be perfect. It would link a word to the disambiguation page, and then editors would fix the link. But, most important, it would have introduced new links, even if those redirected to the disambiguation pages. Moreover, orphaned articles usually have unique titles, so it wouldn't be that difficult.--<a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthologist_bfd6.html" title="User:Orthologist">Orthologist</a> 17:55, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Redirect_rewriting" id="Redirect_rewriting"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redirect rewriting</span></h2>
<p>Very simple, I think (at least for people who know how to code). So simple, indeed, that I suspect it had already been suggested and eventually refused.</p>
<p>A bot that transform incoming links when they point to a redirection. Example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seven_virtues&amp;oldid=115541719" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seven_virtues&amp;oldid=115541719" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> has a link to <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Deadly_Sins_7c39.html" title="Seven Deadly Sins">Seven Deadly Sins</a> wich redirects to <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_deadly_sins.html" title="Seven deadly sins">Seven deadly sins</a>.</p>
<p>Such a “redirectbot” (proposed name) would edit the link in <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_virtues.html" title="Seven virtues">Seven virtues</a> and change it to <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_deadly_sins.html" title="Seven deadly sins">Seven deadly sins</a>. In the long run, it would save some CPU cycles and from day one, would remove a bit of the feeling of clutterness of the Encyclopedia.</p>
<p>What do you think of it? Has this already been suggested? Is there a place to browse the various proposals and why they have not been implemented?<br />
