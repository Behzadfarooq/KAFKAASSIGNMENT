<p>I am somewhat saddened to bring this report to the AN/I noticeboard, as this is an established editor whom I respect greatly as a contributor and developer, but in light of their actions, I feel I have no choice but to report it here.</p>
<p>First of all, let me establish the context for this report. In the <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam guidelines</a>, there is a section on canvassing. Asking for opinion and consensus is a natural part of the Wikipedia consensus building process, however, when canvassing occurs it dilutes a true consensus and turns the process into a simple majority. It also poisons the well - editors who would normally vote oppose may not vote because of a strong block of support votes, or vice versa. Now, to explain the specifics, <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDragons_flight_cbbc.html" title="User talk:Dragons flight">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dragons_flight_eb87.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dragons flight"><span title="Contributions: Dragons flight">contribs</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Dragons+flight" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Dragons+flight" rel="nofollow"><span title="Page moves: Dragons flight"><font color="#002BB8">page&#160;moves</font></span></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Dragons_flight_e67d.html" title="Special:Blockip/Dragons flight"><span title="Block User:Dragons flight">block&#160;user</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Blocklog: Dragons flight"><font color="#002BB8">block&#160;log</font></span></a></span>) has recently proposed a bot to perform protections on certain articles. In the process of proposing it, he canvassed quite heavily for it (in my opinion). Diffs include:</p>

<p>There's more, but those are what were readily available. To me, advertising on another BRFA is just blatant spam.

<li>I strongly endorse this instance of spamming, and you'd have to dig deep to find anyone more anti-spammer than me. This particular bot approval is needed urgently and vitally. It's been discussed extensively here and there is strong consensus that this needs done, like yesterday. Leave him be. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:08, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(double edit conflict)Well, it's not really spam when it's only on the most relevant pages. If he'd left the message to all the creators of feautred pictures, I think I'd care a lot more, but this is very focoused notification, informing of the proposal. Anyway, as you noted on the BRFA page, Peter, BRFA isn't a vote - only discussion, so these comments shouldn't matter. I <i>think</i> I went to the page based on the post on AN, and made a suggestion on the page - not a vote, a suggestion. I belive that this was probably Dragon Flight's aim when leaving the messages - to get ideas, which he has got in abundance there (and one can get ideas from oppose votes, to satisfy their reasons for opposition). <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 21:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>First of all, I don't really consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Picture_of_the_day&amp;diff=98543621&amp;oldid=98542932" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Picture_of_the_day&amp;diff=98543621&amp;oldid=98542932" rel="nofollow">this</a> canvassing, and secondly, when we say canvassing, aren't we mainly talking about spamming messages? We have here five independently-tailored messages in five separate situations where he's encouraging people to support a bot. I think it's within his rights, as the bot's creator, to offer arguments as to why it is a good idea. It doesn't really make sense to say he's not allowed to talk about it at all, or that he must give the appearance of being neutral over whether his bot is approved or not. The one qualm I have is where he says to go&#160;!vote in support and provides a link, but that is a very minor quibble at best. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 21:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've read the <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> section on canvassing and I must say I see no great issue here. One distiction made was the level of disruption made by the crossposting. This doesn't seem to like an "<i>aggressive propaganda campaign</i>" to me (unless you can provide more spamdiffs to support the claim), but rather "<i>reasonable amount of communication about issues</i>". Deliberate and single-purpose spamming is bad, while mentioning a discussion on related occasions is no worse than advertising a WikiProject in a signature. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisza13_4392.html" title="User:Misza13">Миша</a><a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMisza13_b5fd.html" title="User talk:Misza13"><span style="color:green"><b>13</b></span></a> 21:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it would be acceptable to leave a notice on the admin noticeboard, since admins have had to manually protect all these pages. The Bureaucrats' board because, after all, bot RFAs are a bit exceptional, and Bureaucrats close RfAs. The only edit slightly hard to justify (IMHO) was to Shadowbot's page, but it is a related bot... Note that one of those is not Dragons flight. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 21:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He posted about it publicly on AN and other places (since only a limited few follow the bot requests page) and in doing so asked for input from the people the bot would most help — administrators — since only administrators can take care of Main Page issues.

<p>I'd like to draw the various editors here to the existence of the aforementioned bots RfA. The page was created 3 days before conditional approval was granted. It seems, I'm not the only editor aware of it's existence, with 3&#160;!votes (as of 21:30 on 5th Jan) already having been placed before the RfA is listed on the main WP:RFA page along with the rest of the RfA nominations. The only page linking to the RfA at present being <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtectionBot_5543.html" title="User:ProtectionBot">User:ProtectionBot</a> - So, my main question, what's happening with the RfA&#160;?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/ProtectionBot" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/ProtectionBot" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/ProtectionBot</a> --<font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 21:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it's not been listed yet, so the RfA hasn't officially started, so those&#160;!votes are early. I think the RfA will only be going ahead when full approval from BRFA is granted (correct me if I'm wrong) <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 21:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It might be sensible to list the RfA now and once the result of the RfA is known, then the BRfA process can continue, it seems the BAG is getting ahead of process here and the talk of WP:IAR combined with an RfA that hasn't yet been listed leaves me a little uncertain as to whether the BAG was going to be permitted to give the bot sysop permissions in this case. --<font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 21:41, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I prepared the RFA for when/if it became appropriate. It was not posted in part because I wanted to be sure what the functionality of the bot would be, and this has been subject to revisions due to discussions at BRFA. As it had not been posted, I have removed all early posting of votes to it, as I regard that as inappropriate. Personally, I feel adminbots ought to be handled entirely through BRFA (with wide community notice; not spam) rather than having two largely overlapping discussions, but many people seem to disagree with that, so I am prepared to do an RFA if that is what is to be required. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:00, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I was the first vote. I just figured it couldn't hurt to support early. (It so happens that I also think that a RfA isn't even necessary, but if it goes live I'll support it.) <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 22:36, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To be clear, I don't think an RFA is necessary when the bot owner is already an admin. Bot owners are already responsible for everything their bots do. Giving a bot a sysop flag when the owner is already a sysop is a simple matter of deciding if the bot is a good idea — and since we all agree that this one is — it should be granted. <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> is for granting sysop access to <i>humans</i>, and if you look at all of the normal questions and procedure that go on in RFA, you'll see that they're totally unnecessary and irrelevant when dealing with a person who is already a sysop and just needs a second flagged account for bot usage. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 21:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cyde. I had assumed, per the precedent set at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/TawkerbotTorA" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/TawkerbotTorA" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/TawkerbotTorA</a> any bot with sysop functions would need to be approved through the normal RfA channel, since Tawker was already an admin at that point and he had to go through an RfA process. I realise there is a vast difference in what TawkerbotTorA and ProtectionBot do, but shouldn't the bot still have to go through an RfA process&#160;? --<font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 21:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The user conduct described does not constitute canvassing or spamming within the meaning of any relevant policy, nor does it give rise to any of the concerns that those policies are meant to address. Moreover, any reasonable steps calculated to help solve the problem of inappropriate images on the mainpage and in our daily featured content are of surpassing and immediate importance to the reputation of the project. Letting administrators and bureaucrats know of a potential bot that could contribute to addressing this issue is not only acceptable, but highly commendable. I frankly don't understand the reasons for making this report and am saddened by the existence of a dispute between two of our best Dragons. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC) Addendum: I'm by no means a bot expert, but I also agree with Cyde that a full-dress RfA should not be necessary for a situation like this. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:53, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, Peter, the text of their comments were quite clear; I'm not sure why you're assuming an enormous amount of bad faith here, but it's troubling. The coder and overseer of the bot is an administrator; thusly, he has gained the trust of the community through his own RfA. The BRFA process is designed to determine whether there is a need for the bot, whether technical issues are present with it, and whether the mechanisms are in place to prevent errors should they arise (as they nearly inevitably do in man-made code). The user in charge of the bot has been granted trust, and the consensus on the BRFA is quite clearly in favor of the bot itself. That is why the editors above who support bypassing the RfA hold that position, and they made themselves abundantly clear. For the record, I think we should go through an RfA to remove even a smidge of doubt, and I'm slightly (but not significantly) unhappy with the precedent, but I refuse to assume the bad faith you assume above.

<li>I'd like to offer an alternative interpretation, Peter. I think the push to skip the RfA process is because the user in question is already a Sysop. Dragons Flight already passed an RfA, so unless he has become less trustworthy since then, an RfA seems redundant and the need for it has not been established. As long as the sysop-bit element of the bot is clearly defined during the bot request phase (which it was), then the community has more than enough opportunity to comment, and they did. In addition to these practical considerations, I'd like to offer one final realistic one. There are folks employing criteria in RfA that would, by definition, make it absolutely impossible for a bot to pass. Not because the bot isn't the Right Thing for the project, but because the bot has not written a featured article, has not accumulated X-thousand edits, and so on. There are both practical and realistic limitations to using the RfA that has nothing to do with a "block of sysops" working in concert to somehow thwart the rest of the project, and I feel such a suggestion doesn't do the hard working folks on the project justice. If you feel there is any such cadre working against the interests of Wikipedia, then that should be resolved separately and not involve the protection-bot effort that Dragons Flight is undergoing at the moment. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 22:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Perhaps we can clarify something here that might reduce the controversy. Precisely what "sysop" functions will this bot be performing? No one wants a bot given the ability to inadvertently block users, delete articles, etc. and if someone were to propose giving a bot the ability to do these things I can see the argument for requiring a broad consensus evinced by something like RfA or an equivalent. But do I understand correctly that the only "admin only" function this bot will perform will be to protect templates? That seems to be a fairly low-risk situation and might not implicate some of the broader concerns. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:53, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A thinking point to consider. When we perform a Request for Adminiship, is the RfA for the account, or for the person behind the account? If the answer is the former, then an RfA makes sense. But if we're determining whether or not the person is suitable for adminship, then a separate RfA becomes redundant. I think precedent suggests that Wikipedia considers the person to be the more important elemtn of the equation. Dragons Flight the person has already passed the RfA, and by necessity, the robot he creates is his responsibility. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 23:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please see my question a few posts above, which may have been lost in the multiply threaded discussion. For editors, "the sysop bit" is an indivisible whole: one is either an administrator with all the buttons going with the job, or isn't. Is that true for bots? As I understand it (please confirm), this bot would only be tasks with protecting templates, couldn't it be constructed in a way that would not require access to the full "sysop bit" including the powers to block, delete, etc. that raise greater concerns? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that Robert has done absolutely nothing wrong. The community has been clamoring for such a bot, and he's stepped forward to deliver it.<br />
I also strongly believe that an RfA is both unnecessary and downright absurd. Robert already is a sysop, so the bot account won't enable him to do anything that he isn't already capable of doing (and trusted by the community to do). The bot itself has overwhelming approval, so there's nothing left to discuss (aside from technical specifics). Furthermore, "RfA" stands for "requests for <b>adminship</b>." A bot can't be an administrator, so the idea of requesting adminship for one is ludicrous. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 23:53, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All that means is that not enough admins have opted in. Nonetheless the problem should be on the decline. Agian, this is not that urgent, we will live 5 more days, so hurry up and slap the bot on RFA. I am sure that people won't treat it like a normal human, but will look over the merits of the proposal. I don't think we have to worry about checking the account's wikipedia space edits or anything. I don't know if this bot really has the majority you say it has, and we won't know until it ends up on RFA now will we? I really do want to thank all involved for all the work (programming <i>I know what this is like</i>, debating ect.)

<dd>To be fair, <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtectionBot_5543.html" title="User:ProtectionBot">User:ProtectionBot</a> would not have prevented that POTD snafu. Note the following on ProtectionBot's page: <i>"Note that if any admin changes the protection before the ProtectionBot expects it to be concluded, then ProtectionBot will assume the admin knows best and not try to make any further changes to that image/template during the course of that appearance on the main page/featured article."</i> - from what I can make out, in the latest incident, an admin came along and changed the template system being used for POTD (actually quite a good change), but forgot to protect the new templates. I suspect that the clause above in ProtectionBot's description means that vandalism will still occur when a well-meaning admin makes a change without realising the full consequences of the change being made.

<dd>No, ProtectionBot would have covered this (assumming it was seen between when it was added and when it was vandalized). The clause you refer to covers recent changes in protection level by other admins. If a template appeared on the Main Page and has never been protected, ProtectionBot assummes it ought to have been. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, OK. So ProtectionBot would have prevented that, which is good, though all this does depend on how closely vandals are watching the main page. I still think vandals will adapt to sneak into the small window of opportunity that is there for image vandalism, despite the semi-random feature. Getting back to how ProtectionBot won't overide a change made by another admin - ie. you programmed it not to wheel-war!&#160;:-) - can you think of situations where a well-meaning admin unfamiliar with the main page might unprotect a template or image <i>while it is on the main page</i>, and then forget to reprotect? If I am understanding the 'no wheel-warring' thing correctly, ProtectionBot won't prevent this kind of thing (cos it's not designed to stop humans being silly). I still think that ultimately the developers will need to come up with a system where this is all hardwired into the MediWiki system. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 02:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>David Levy, surely the community as a whole has a right to decide on whether or not it's comfortable in giving bots sysop access, be it through a standard RfA or proposing a new policy on sysop bots. If were going to IAR on this one, it sets a potentially dangerous and certainly unfair precedent where it can be done again to give any developer with admin access permission to create and run sysop bots with no input from the community beyond that which happens at BRFA. In fact, it seems IAR could also extend to giving any user sysop status if a few people decide it's necessary. There's Shadowbot2 which offers an e-mail report to admins when it finds an unprotected page. Sign up for the mailing list on that whilst this is going through the RfA process. Threatening out of process warnings (which could end up leading onto blocks, I assume&#160;?) isn't on either and I would appreciate if you would strike that comment. RfA is supposed to be an open process, one where any editor can make any comment (within reason) on the whether or not it is appropriate to give the user (through just one account) sysop access. It's totally inappropriate to mention warning a user for commenting in a certain way on any RfA. As I've said, there are further options available to admins to let them know whether or not all the templates transcluded onto the main page are protected. This bot isn't the only option and it's not as clear cut or urgent as your making out. I really have no time for any admin who threatens to censor any RfA. Blackmail was too strong a word, but there's certainly an air of intimidation for anyone daring to Oppose. --<font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 00:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's clear that this could be quite a sticky situation and something does need to be done to sort out the danger of vandalism appearing on the main page. I would suggest, in the interim however, that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtectionBot_5543.html" title="User:ProtectionBot">User:ProtectionBot</a> is give a temporary sysop flag whilst it's decided what to do next, be it an RfA or propose a new policy on granting bots sysop functionality. I don't see a great number of concerns over the bot malfunctioning and destroying Wikipedia, rather, it seems to be concern at what passing RfA means and it's effect on policy, i.e does it say</p>
<ol>
<li>The user has been trusted sufficently by the community to be granted sysop status and consiquently any and all additional accounts that sysop may wish to operate (provided they are solely for the use of the sysop) can be conferred with sysop status too</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol>
<li>The user has been trusted sufficently by the community to be granted sysop status for the one and only account presented at the RfA, and that any and all additional accounts for which the sysop requests sysop functionality need to go through the RfA process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Until some sort of consensus is decided on what exactly passing an RfA means, then there's little point in discussing policy on bots with sysop functionality, however it's a debate that probably needs to happen sooner than later, and if the former statement is the consensus of the community, some sort of policy will likely need to be drafted on if and when it is appropriate to grant bots sysop functionality and of course, whether or not the RfA process can be ignored for all developers needing sysop access in order to design bots and other applications. Quoting IAR is fine to start with but after a while, there starts becoming a need to create a rule to be followed, not ignored, which provides the same basic freedom but with the necessary limitations to protect the community. If we, as a community decide we want bots with sysop functionality, we will need to look at the testing arrangements for sysop bots, who ultimately makes the change on the account permissions and the various safety measures in place to ensue the bot doesn't, once operating with sysop functionality, start to be given additional functions by it's developer(s) or if malfunctioning, doesn't do damage that cannot easily and quickly be stopped and reverted. --<font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 01:18, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'd just like to have the proviso that should it be possible for the devs to split admin functions, it can only be used by bots and not by human editors, and only after some sort of policy is agreed upon. If split admin functions can be carried out, I don't see as great a need for putting bots through the RfA process as they are absolutely limited by the functionality granted to them and developer(s) expanding any bots functionality is less of a concern. Apart from that rather lengthy add-on, I'm happy to support either my own proposal, Brad's, or any combination of the two. --<font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 01:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This may not be not feasible. In recent testing I have seen dropped Mediawiki session cookies, which I suspect are caused by trying to use my account for normal editting while a bot run is in progress. If this interpretation is correct (and I'm not entirely sure, I'm still investigating it), then it would make it impossible for this bot to run concurrently with my normal editting behavior. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Ok as a member of <a href="../../../b/a/g/WP%7EBAG_f4b6.html" title="WP:BAG">WP:BAG</a> there are a few things that need to be cleared up. This bot is not yet approved, it is still in the trial phase. I gave Dragons Flight limited approval for testing of the bot on his account. Before approving this bot fully I see several issues that need to be handled. There has been no suggestion from the BAG to bypass RfA, In fact I support a RfA, I agree IAR cannot be applied here as giving a bot sysop privileges (via IAR) can open a can of worms that we don't want opened. As for the issue of wiki-spamming this was just spreading the word as <a href="../../../b/r/f/WP%7EBRFA_d541.html" title="WP:BRFA">WP:BRFA</a> is <i><b>NOT</b></i> a very high traffic page, all Dragons Flight was doing was letting people know that such a bot was in the process of being created. Regarding the use of shadowbot there are a lot of holes in that method of protecting the main page. But that is the best that could be done with a non admin bot. there are many images and templates that are used daily and rotate this is a lot of work for all admins involved as any active admins know we take a lot of work and one less major pain, and is a lot less stress for us and for Wikipedia. I Propose a RfA but before this bot can be posted there it will need unanimous BAG approval. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 06:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. We know that some technical concerns remain to be addressed. Much of the above discussion is based on the assumption that the bot will receive approval from the BAG (though I don't see how you can justify the need for "unanimous" support from a body with no official authority).</dd>
<dd>2. The application of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> would mean setting aside some technicalities, <i><b>not</b></i> bypassing consensus. No one is proposing that the will of the community be ignored. We're saying that the community already has spoken (and the bot should used as soon as possible).</dd>
<dd>3 If it's determined that further discussion is required, so be it. But to refer to said discussion as an "RfA" would be ridiculous. Again, <b>computer scripts can't be administrators</b>. Robert seeks a sysop bit for his bot, <i>not</i> "adminship." RfA is <i>not</i> an appropriate forum. If we must, let's take this to the village pump or even RfC. But let's do it <b>now</b>. There's no valid reason why the technical approval must come first. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you think opening an RfC or Village Pump thread now would affect the RfA (which has been written but not yet posted)? Annoyingly, it looks like there needs to be a preliminary discussion about whether long-term approval (after the 30-day trial) should be granted through RfA or a Village Pump discussion or an RfC. Incidentially David, I don't think the spread-out discussions and the small discussion at the Bot Approval Group, show community consensus. They show consensus by part of the community, but RfA regulars may feel that they were bypassed unless they are notified in some way. Notes can be dropped off at all venues, and at {{<a href="../../../c/e/n/Template%7ECent_b541.html" title="Template:Cent">cent</a>}}, but I agree that discussion should take place in one location, and that RfA might not be the best place (though the existence of the discussion should be advertised there). Can we get this wrapped up in 30 days (well, less than that now)? When does the trial end? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:47, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm suggesting an alternative to the "RfA," not a supplement. As I said, I don't oppose the solicitation of additional feedback (provided that it's done immediately). I feel, however, that RfA regulars have no special standing in this instance, given the fact that this has absolutely nothing to do with a request for adminship. Of course, <i>all</i> Wikipedians are entitled to comment, and the matter can be advertised in every major forum of even peripheral relevance (including RfA). I merely object to the idea of conducting the actual discussion <i>as</i> an RfA, as that would be entirely nonsensical. (We would basically be pretending that the bot is a person.) We can create a dedicated project page and list it in all of the aforementioned locations (thereby negating the issue of which is the correct one). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 19:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As <a href="../../../b/a/g/WP%7EBAG_f4b6.html" title="WP:BAG">WP:BAG</a> we don't want the stress/responsibility of bypassing RfA's for granting bots admin priv's (please note that I used <i>admin privileges</i> as we dont have a +sysop in metawiki all that there currently is is +admin some can call it sysop but it is not). having a small group of users (BAG and passer byers) is not a method of granting a community consensus on whether they want a bot doing certain admin actions. As Wikimedia Foundation policy currently has it there are three ways of getting adminship, having a foundation level user grant it, (WP:OFFICE), per arbcom or RfA's, as B-crats shouldn't grant adminship to users without a community consensus, this is currently done on <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> on the English Wikipedia.

<dd>Just dropping in here (I'm on a bit of a break at the moment), but if there is a strong enough community consensus to grant an admin flag to a bot, then it should be no problem to have that demonstrated at RFA. If there isn't enough consensus to cause the bot to pass an RFA, then that's a pretty clear statement that there isn't consensus to make it an admin. It should be no problem for the people who have feelings on this bot to register them at RFA and avoid having the need to cause hurt feelings on any side by going outside of our normal processes. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 05:58, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, enjoy your break. But since you stopped by ... I agree that RfA would be appropriate for a bot that were going to exercise pervasive sysop powers. But here, from what I understand, the bot (if approved) is projected to do one very narrow aspect of an administrator function–protect templates, and nothing else. To suggest that the bot requires "adminship" for that is a bit of a misnomer, and while I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world to put the bot through the RfA process, it seems to me to be more to the point to come up with a means in which concerns are alleviated by ensuring through technical means that it can't do anything other than protect templates rather than exercise the more potentially controversial adminship powers such as blocking, deleting, etc. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 06:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Except, (and this is in no way a suggestion that I think this <i>would</i> happen, but an observation on what <i>could</i> happen) it's really hard to know what features may come up after adminship is granted. As we all know, it's pretty hard to get adminship revoked, and I can say from experience, when you're running a bot, there's a lot of temptation to add new features. (I'm constantly wanting to add something new to my EssjayBots.) We've had problems in the past with admin-bots; the famous Curps-bot was by no means uncontroversial, and it has only been a few months since Marudubshinki was desysopped for repeatedly running an adminbot after being told not to do so.</dd>

<dd>We all know that most everything on Wikipedia is driven by consensus (I almost said "everything"), and adminship certainly is. The best way we have to determine consensus is through RFA, and that's what we should use (especially since the people we trust to monitor bots, the Bot Approval Group, has said above that this should go through RFA). While there is certainly excitement all around for getting going as quickly as possible, one of the important things we have to think about (and this is always implicit with bots) is what is the least disruptive way to go about this. In this case, bypassing RFA, while it might be convenient, is going to cause a lot of hurt feelings and ill-will between users, and there really is no reason to do that. If the bot is supported, it will pass RFA with no problem, and the damage done to the community by bypassing RFA isn't necessary. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 06:21, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As noted by Betacommand, the BAG doesn't wish to bypass the participation of those who frequent RfA.

<dd>As for whether this is adminship or not, the bot is getting an admin flag, it will have access to all features an admin has, the ability will be there for it to be programmed to use all of them. I see no need to argue over semantics, so we can decide not to call it "adminship" but it doesn't change the fact that it will have full amdmin powers, and if the programmer decides to use them, they will have the ability to do so. (Might not have permission, but that doesn't stop it from working if they decide to do it.) As for desysopping it, I can't do that as I'm not a steward, so I'm not comfortable assuming someone else will be willing to do so. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 08:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect Essjay, giving me access to a second account with a sysop flag provides me no greater or less technical ability than I have now. It just makes my life easier as a programmer and makes it easier for myself and others to monitor it. If I wanted to be evil, I could have done want Curps did and simply run it, but I disagree with Curps' approach and feel it ought to be segregated. I can understand that some people disagree with creating sysop bots in general, but the attitude that an admin shouldn't have easy access to a seperate admin account for developing and running otherwise approved bots is mysterious to me. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 09:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never made any of the above points. I'm quite aware that you could have chosen to run the bot without permission, though there is now precedent on what happens in those cases since Marudubshinki; I'm glad you decided to put it under a separate account. I realize the benefits provided by a separate account, and never questioned them. I don't disagree with this bot, if the community supports it, and haven't said I do, though I've opposed other adminbots in the past (both because I felt they were bad ideas, and because the community did not approve of adminbots). And finally, I don't have an attitude that an admin shouldn't have easy access to a separate admin account for an approved bot; I'd be happy to see that. What I have said is that the appropriate place for you to get that access is at RFA, and I stand beside that; with the single exception of a Foundation order to sysop someone, all accounts that are assigned an admin flag get it because of a successful request for adminship, and this case should be no different. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 10:50, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Essjay, what do you (and the other bureaucrats) think of the idea (suggested above) of <i>temporary</i> adminship for the bot to make it easier to run trials? The BAG have approved the trial.

I think a successful trial would alleviate a lot of concerns at RfA, and make the whole process go a lot more smoothly. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 07:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

"Admin" is a position within the community, <i>not</i> a user rights designation.</dd>
<dd>2. Again, Robert isn't seeking "adminship" for his bot. He's seeking the "sysop" designation, and we have no formal process through which to handle such a request. That doesn't mean that we should fall back on the closest process that we happen to have (thereby anthropomorphizing a computer script).

<dd>Indeed. Our usual process for deciding whether programs should be allowed special user rights designations is the bot approval system.

<dl>
<dd>RfA, on the other hand, is a system for determining whether human users should be granted adminship, which includes a user rights level but also indicates a social standing within the community. The process is designed to determine whether an individual is trustworthy and familiar with our policies. To apply those standards to a piece of code makes no sense at all. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 07:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>we need to make this discussion closed there will be an RfA or there will not be bot approval. as stated before we all want this concluded. As the BAG we have stated that we need community support. Unless you want to wait a month to figure out how you want this done the best way is a RfA, and a b-crat has also stated that we need a RfA. what else will it take to get this started? this will not be a case of IAR we have clearly stated our position. Essjay as b-crat and as BAG. I know some users consider BAG a <i>body with no official authority</i> yet per <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a> {which is a policy and not a guideline)</p>

<p>Prior to use, bots must be approved at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_de2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval</a>.

<p>thus this issue has been settled. If there is community support for a bot with this function it will be shown there if not the community shall have spoken in a consensus.

(From a <a href="../../../b/a/g/WP%7EBAG_f4b6.html" title="WP:BAG">bag member</a>). IMHO, We (BAG) should not be determing if sysop status should be granted to an account at this time. If the userrights system were to be updated to define certain permissions only (e.g. EditProtected, Delete) without the other permissions I may lean more towards it though, assuming the community assented that BAG should do this. It is (or should be) that noone is advocating making this script a <i>real administrator</i> (at least at this time) with authority to do things like close xfd's. That being said in order for this bot to function it will need to be added to the sysop group, and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> is the way to get that done. This request would need to only use sysop rights for approved bot actions, and that must be enforcable as much as possible. I'd suggest that the RFA would include a vow from the operator that this account would only preform certain actions (altough we've had many <i>campaing promises</i> on RFA's that didn't last) and/or vows from multiple other admins that they will continually block this account for violating the approved functions (I'd be in that camp).

A condition of this bot's acceptance is passing RFA. Full stop.

<dd>1. <b>You</b> believe that "RFA is the proper forum for consensus regarding sysop functions." I, conversely, see no evidence to support the contention that it's the proper forum in which to establish such consensus for anything other than a human. It's called "requests for adminship," and bots cannot be admins.</dd>
<dd>2. "Because we said so" is <i>not</i> a legitimate argument for why something is right. Jimbo himself doesn't apply such logic. Furthermore, your "full stop" remark was rather rude.</dd>
<dd>3. <s>I'm still waiting for you to elucidate your claim that "we dont have a +sysop in metawiki all that there currently is is +admin some can call it sysop but it is not."

<dd>The right is called sysop. A bot cannot be an administrator. It can be a sysop. RFA is where you go to get the sysop bit. A bot op that wants the sysop bit for his or her bot should petition there. Until there is a seperate venue for bots, that is the way it should and will be.

<dd>Are you certain that you read my replies? I never said that we should "allow the bot approvals group to approve the sysop flag to accounts." Over and over again, I've plainly stated that I don't object to the idea of conducting a formal discussion to determine community consensus. I object to the idea of labeling said discussion an "RfA" (because bots can't be admins). I'm merely arguing that the discussion should be called something different and held on a different page (while still prominently linked from RfA and various other forums). That's all. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 18:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I am certain, and I respect your opinion. I also agree that a bot with a sysop flag is not an "administrator" (see my statment on the RFA). I'd welcome a community discusion on changing the way that 'crats are instructed to give out sysop or other flags for technical means, but I don't think that here or RFA is the place for it.
