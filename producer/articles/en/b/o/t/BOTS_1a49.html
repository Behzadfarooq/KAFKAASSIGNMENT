<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>BOTS are virtual workers that have been called to save Cyberspace from viruses. Players can choose from three different BOT types, each with its own personality and abilities. The player is a robot, living on the physical realm in a supercomputer. Suddenly, the computer the players call home has been infested with viruses! The BOTS can be retrofitted with customizable battle armors, items, and minibots and charge at the viruses to clear them from the system for good.</p>
<p>Also players have the chance to go head to head and battle it out against other people! This is called "PVP", you can either battle in a team, or fight and "indiv battle", in which there are no teams. Fighting in a PVP battle will supply you with Bot-Stract, which is used to start the battle in Transform mode. (Note: This feature has not been implemented yet) The last option is a base battle in which there are two teams (red and blue) and they battle it out to destroy the base of their opponents! You can also use Mercenaries, or Mercs, as they are commonly called, to help you. The available Mercenaries right now are&#160;: Boza, Wazzu, Nimba, Scalper, and five Acclaim coin Mercs: Aeron, Echo-Force, OpsTeam, Shuriken and Arsenal. Many players are recorded in a hall of fame for outstanding robots.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Controls">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controls</span></h2>
<p>The controls are as follows:</p>
<p>Move- Arrows</p>
<p>Attack- V</p>
<p>Jump- C</p>
<p>Guard- X</p>
<p>Transform- Z</p>
<p>There are also advanced controls, such as using guns by pressing X + V. You can also use any skills you have by pressing X+C. You can change these controls to suit your playing preferences. For more information go to the website: <a href="http://bots.acclaim.com/guidegame/gameinstructions.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://bots.acclaim.com/guidegame/gameinstructions.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>To play a game, first you must join a room, you can do this by clicking in the room's name in the lobby. Once you go in, you will see the other BOTS that are in that room. Once everyone is ready (by pressing the button Ready!) the room master will begin the game. Players will play through the sector level the room master has chosen, once they win the game, items may drop. When it is all over, a screen will appear naming the MVP, Boss Killer Number 1, and other things, here is a more detailed explanation:</p>
<p>MVP- This is the Most Valuable player, this is the player that has done the most general damage to the monsters (not the boss)</p>
<p>Boss Killer Number 1- This is the player that did the most damage to the boss.</p>
<p>You can also see how much experience people are getting, what place you where ranked, and the total points you got (points depend on how much you helped, the person with the most points is the MVP)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Patch">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Patch</span></h3>
<p>- <b>Official BOTS website description:</b> - Possessing strong physical power, Patch was originally designed as heavy construction machinery. Later, it was remodeled as combat machinery.</p>
<p>- The best physical attack bot in the game, which is a benefit, as the primary mode of attack in BOTS is melee. Just as good as the Ram-type BOT for newer players. Its weapons consist of Fighting Knuckles, because it fights like a boxer. Patch is recommended to players who know the basics of the game.</p>
<p><a name="Surge" id="Surge"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Surge">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Surge</span></h3>
<p>- <b>Official BOTS website description:</b> - Designed only for combat purposes, Surge can smoothly move around on any kind of terrain by its antigravity cyber core. It uses powerful laser attacks to penetrate heavy metals. Best used if you want to use ranged combat rather than hand to hand.</p>
<p>- It is slightly less powerful than Patch (although with a faster attack rate), and slightly faster than Ram. Contrary to the official site's description of the Surge-type BOT's attack style, it still uses melee attacks, and cannot fire any of its "powerful laser attacks" without having a gun equipped. Surge is recommended for more experienced players since it requires more skill to use correctly, though some less experienced users are able to do well with this bot.</p>
<p><a name="Ram" id="Ram"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Ram">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ram</span></h3>
<p>- <b>Official BOTS website description:</b> - Created on the concept of an insect's adaptability. Using its unique arm, a Ram is a multi-task machine with hidden weapons and quick attacks. This BOT specializes in transformations, due to its hidden attack ability in transformation mode.</p>
<p>- This Bot is advised to be used for new players just entering the game. Also, Ram is the most popular BOT, most likely because it is the only BOT in the game which has two different arms. It specializes in transformations, and stays in transformed state longer than the other two BOT types. Also, Ram's attack speed is slightly faster. But, because Ram is very smooth to control, it is also used by experienced players.</p>

<p>In Sector mode, a group of players (max. 8) must face viruses in different levels. Each level gives different viruses and different obstacles. Each part of a level contains viruses which must be destroyed in order to advance to the next part. At the end of each level, a boss virus must be fought. When a boss is successfully destroyed an item may drop, on a % chance, which increases with more players in the group, and the level ends. Players are then rewarded exp. points (depending on their level and ranking for the battle) and Gigas (the in-game currency of BOTS) The person which has played the level the best (losing least HP, dealing the most damage etc.) will be titled the "MVP" and receive a small exp. bonus. The player dealing the most damage to the boss will be titled "Boss Killer" and will also receive a small exp. bonus.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Player vs. player">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Player vs. player</span></h3>
<p>This game can be played individually and in a team. The objective is to destroy all players, or all players from the rival team. When a player is destroyed, he/she will drop Bot-stract. (Please note: a player will not lose any Bot-stract when he/she is destroyed.) The game will end when all players or rival team players are destroyed. At the end of each game, exp. and Giga's will be given according to the ranks they receive.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Base battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Base battle</span></h3>
<p>In base battle mode, a team of players fights against a rival team. Both teams have a base, which they must protect from the rival team's attacks. Each player can equip up to two Mercenaries which they can command to attack the rival base or defend their own base. (two bozas are standard given to all new players)</p>
<p>A base is also able to attack with a long range shot and a wide angle laser attack, providing it with its own form of defense, although it is still vulnerable to being shot from a distance. While it can shoot distant targets, if a bot can get close enough, the gun will not be able to hit him. A base can also restore itself up to grey lines which are indicated on the base HP bar on the bottom of the screen. When a base loses its HP to a grey line, the players which are teamed with the base will also get lower HP when regenerated after death. (This still can be filled with a HP pack, or Silica pack) The game ends when a team destroys the base of the rival team. A gold bar will shoot out the base when it is destroyed, this goldbar could be a Goldbar, a Goldbar6, a Goldbar 10, a Goldbar 15 or a Diamond, which all have their own value in gigas for which it can be sold to the shop, since it has no other use.</p>
<p>Note: Before games can start for player Vs. player or base Vs. base, there must be an equal number of players on each team.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Shop items">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shop items</span></h3>
<p>Items can be bought in the shop for Gigas or Coins. Parts, minibots, guns, and much more are sold here, but not all of them, some items can only be obtained by boss drop. They provide standard benefits like Hitpoints, Attack and Defense. There also are parts which can only be equipped on a specific BOT. Most, if not all, parts are level determined you need a certain level to equip them. The shop also sells items which can only be bought with Acclaim coins.(see lower section) Also to try on the items click the item (not Buy or Gift!) to see what it looks like on you.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Boss drops">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Boss drops</span></h3>
<p>At the end of each level, a boss must be fought. Sometimes, a box containing an item will shoot out when the boss is destroyed.(Sector mode only) The player who takes this box first, will receive the item. this system has led to many arguments, especially when players who helped the least still took the item. The items that bosses drop will have +1, +2 or +3 after the item name. These give extra benefits like Transbot attack, Transbot defense and Critical. Also, the chance of getting a boss drop will increase when Lucky items are equipped. Red boxes contain a BOT-specific part, Brown boxes contain items like a gun, a mini-bot or a forcefield and blue boxes contain shoulderparts and shields. Please note: in lower levels, a blue box might be dropped by the boss, but when it is picked up, it will say "This item doesn't exist". This is because shoulderpads can only be equipped on level 30 or higher players and shields on level 20 or higher players only, so there are no lower level shoulders and shields.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/BOTS_1a49.html" title="Edit section: Coin items">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coin items</span></h3>
<p>Acclaim coins can be used to buy special coin items. these include heads, mini-bots, wings, guns, skill packs, mercenaries and transformation packs. These items only last a specific time, with 1 day being the shortest and 1 year being the longest, depending on which version of the item was bought. Also, these items cannot be traded in any way, but still can be gifted, which has led to many players asking other players to gift them coin items in trade for Giga's. This has caused many players being scammed, by first giving someone Giga's but not receiving any coin item and vise versa.</p>

<p>Every Friday 5 to 9 p.m. PST (7 to 1 p.m. GMT) an event is held in which players receive twice as much giga's and exp. as they would normally receive (event ended on 12/28/06). It is also sometimes held on holidays (i.e., Christmas). This event is no longer active until further notice. It has been restarted for the time being except it is now two hours on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.</p>

<p>On 12/21/2006, a patch was released which added holiday items. These were: Santa head, Rudolf mini-bot, Frosty transformation pack and Jingle bell wings. These items could only be bought with coins. Also, on 12/24 a contest started in which players had to collect three snowballs every day, one week straight. Snowballs were randomly dropped in sector and base modes. Players who would achieve this would receive one of earlier mentioned prizes in their gift tab. In sector mode, the boss at the end of each level would randomly be replaced with a snowman. This snowman boss was considered very strong, but also had a 3~4 times higher drop rate than existing boss monsters. The chances of getting a snowman boss were 15% chance of getting a snowman in a normal level and a 5% chance of getting one in elite levels.</p>
