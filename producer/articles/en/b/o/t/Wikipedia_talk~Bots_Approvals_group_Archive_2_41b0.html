<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot approvers need approving?</span></h2>
<p>Just wondering if people in the bot approvals group need get their bot approved by someone else. Sounds sensible encase of any flaws/problems are not noticed by the owner of the bot.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndypandy.UK_6e9d.html" title="User:Andypandy.UK"><font style="background:white">Andeh</font></a> 16:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This sounds reasonable, and in practice is exactly what happens. My own bot was recently approved, and while I may have archived it (it already had the bot flag), I didn't do it under my own "authority". I think this goes without saying. On the other hand, if no one was active on this page, then I wouldn't have a problem if someone approved themselves. But with new members, that seems unlikely to be a problem. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 16:32, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agree, we should never approve our own bots.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Commons delinker bot</span></h2>
<p>Commons gets a lot of images that ultimately, need deleting. Red links on wikis referencing them are ugly. There are 701 different wikis that can get images from Commons. A bot has been created and tested to perform the delinking. But consider if all 701 wikis were asked for bot approval! gaak! So concerned commons admins and 'crats are asking on Meta for an exemption to normal bot rules...

<dd>We have no process, and in my opinion we could use a few more members. I just cleared out a bunch of bots today that have been sitting around for quite some time. Still though, we don't have an established process for adding members. Xaosflux added a number of good points for discussion above that could be addressed. Perhaps if you were willing to address some of those issues and perhaps come up with a proposal for comment then we would be in a position to consider adding more members. It would surely show good faith if you did that! Still, the commenting on bots in the approval process is not isolated to members of the approval group. I looked through your edits and you have not participated. So I would suggest participating more in the approvals process and working on a voting process. If you do both, I think you should easily win approval to join the approvals group, as you are already a respected bot writer and operator. I have not checked to see how well you understand policy, but I'm assuming its there at this point. I would obviously check that if there was a vote on new members. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 02:27, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since we've added new members to BAG and changed the archival process, I took a few minutes to get some statistics on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_approved_bot_requests_9d71.html" title="Category:Wikipedia approved bot requests">Wikipedia approved bot requests</a>. I don't know how many people are aware of them, but there are now a number of categories setup to monitor the bot requests (See here: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_bot_requests_for_approval_cfeb.html" title="Category:Wikipedia bot requests for approval">Wikipedia bot requests for approval</a>). The statistics above are for an approximately 1 month period since the election. The table suggests to me that we still could use more members to spread out the work. Perhaps more bureaucrats would be helpful. Most bot flagging tends to occur within a few hours, but it would never hurt to be better. The obvious caveat with this table is that it does not show those BAG members who comment extensively but don't approve bots. It also doesn't include who approved bots for trial or how many people "voted" to approve. Naturally it also doesn't include any failed or withdrawn bot requests. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 20:11, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting table! I dont think there's a RUSH requirement to get crats to flag these bots, if they get it within a day of being notified it usually sufficient.

<dd>I wasn't trying to imply that the bureaucrats were doing a bad job or that the process was horribly deficient. I was implying that while we're doing fine now, more wouldn't be a bad thing. I think overall everything is going quite well. And I know that if someone wasn't paying attention they might assume that some people are carrying all the load, but that's obviously not true in your case: You do a lot of commenting and the work you described above. That's why I added the caveats in the first place.

<ul>
<li>Terms or Perms?
<dl>
<dd>I know that "offices" such as admin and bureaucrat are essentially permanent positions, but I don't think that it is appropriate for bot approval group members. In the case of administrators, the admin powers have not changed much since they were first instituted. Plus, the policy surrounding things like blocking and deleting is fairly well standardized and isolated to a few pages. The same cannot be said for approving bots. While bot policy itself is well-standardized, bot approvals group members have to keep track of a lot of different potentially changing policies constantly. Now of course each group member is going to be aware of different policy areas based on their skill-set, but I think that there should be some sort of term limit. My suggestion is as follows: Once elected, renewals are automatic so long as the user has non-trivially contributed to <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_de2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval">Requests for approval</a> or its subpages and talk pages sometime within some time period, say 3 months. Removals from office due to expiration will then be automatic and not require discussion. Although, I'd say add a clause that before removing the user require a post on their user page and wait 1 week before removal. I would say that once a user has been a member then it should be easier to become an active member again as opposed to someone who has never been a member. Nevertheless, it perhaps shouldn't be automatic. More on that later when discussing the voting process. For the record, I don't believe strongly in permanent or temporary limits, but I'm leaning for a automatic system of renewals with non-permanent membership. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 16:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Addition period-constant ala rfa or period based?

</li>
<li>needs requirement:how many do we need?
<dl>
<dd>This is a tricky question. "All" bot approvals group members do is close discussions by determining consensus based on knowledge of Wikipedia policy and the discussion itself. Anyone from the community can and should contribute. However, as was made clear from the recent RfA for a bot, BAG members are given considerable power and respect from the community itself: In the RfA the lack of agreement between BAG members was considered sufficient reason by some to oppose. A BAG member needs skills at determining consensus and wide knowledge of Wikipedia policies. So on one hand the job is fairly narrowly defined but on another hand the community has granted BAG members a certain amount of leverage past simple closing of discussions. It is because of this latter reason that I would not limit the number of members. If someone is qualified and willing to help out, then their opinion should be granted the extra weight that being a BAG member affords. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 16:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>candidacy requirement (e.g. admin?)
<dl>
<dd>Candidacy requirements should be fairly strict in principle, but are likely to be somewhat arbitrary. I specificially don't think a user is required to be an admin or run a bot, but either of those clearly add to the user's ability to help out in a useful way. I think the focus should be understanding of Wikipedia policy. A BAG member must have a wide understanding of Wikipedia policies so that when a bot comes along they know if the bot's task is appropriate. This can usually be seen by extensively looking into a user's contributions. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 16:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Ram-Man.27s_Election_Procedure" id="Ram-Man.27s_Election_Procedure"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ram-Man's Election Procedure</span></h2>
<p>I've stated my thoughts on the issues regarding an election. I'd like to lay out an election process based on some of those thoughts. We'll see how much sense it makes.&#160;:) I'd like to suggest that all existing members be reconfirmed though the process.</p>
<p>Before anything else, any election should be closed by a bureaucrat or an admin who is also an existing member of BAG. It should be obviously why a bureaucrat should be allowed, but maybe not the BAG admin. It seems to me that an admin already has garnered the trust of the community and with the addition of being a BAG member has the ability to determine consensus based on the requirements of the service of bot approvals, perhaps even better than an outside bureaucrat would. A closing user should not close an election when consensus is not clear and they have directly participated in the process. Some issues should be given more weight than others. For example, a user's understanding of wikipedia policies is more important than whether or not the user has run a bot. The person closing the election should consider the relative weight of such discussion. When in doubt, a BAG member should not be elected since BAG membership is not adminship.</p>
<p>The requirements for BAG membership can be broad like in the case of administrators, but should focus on the user's understanding of Wikipedia policies and workings. A BAG member must have a fairly broad understanding of policy in order to judge the appropriateness of a bot, since bots can cause considerable damage if approved incorrectly. Ideally, a new BAG member should have existing experience in commenting on previous bot requests for approvals, although this could be waived if the user's background and skill set make them qualified (as was the case in the recent election). While I don't think we need to have any edit count requirements, it should be clear that a user who has not participated in policy discussions or editing a wide range of articles will probably not have sufficient experience. Membership should have term limits as I've described above (with automatic renewals and removals). A user who has already been a BAG member but let their term expire should not require as high a standard as someone who has never been a member. Also, adminship should be a plus but not a requirement.</p>
<p>Anyone should be able to vote and voice their opinion. Vandals and sockpuppets should obviously not be allowed. The user closing the election should take into account the content of comments by supporters and opposers and weight them relative to their importance on being a BAG member.</p>
<p>The procedure for adding new members should (probably) use transcluded pages on a voting page similar to how pages are done on the requests for approvals now. Anyone can nominate at any time, but it must be accepted by the user. The format should be similar to that of RfA, although perhaps not so formal. The previous election (See the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_Archive_2_0a01.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Requests for approval/Archive 2">archive</a>) worked well. Users names were listed and people commented on them by listing whether or not they supported. I don't see the need for as formal a system as RfA unless the number of voters get really large. Reconfirmations for users who are expired (or withdrawn) without controversy should be given considerable latitude in becoming active again, but should otherwise go through the same process as new members.</p>
<p>Removals should be a separate function of the member voting page. Anyone can suggest that a BAG member is inappropriate for any reason, but must be seconded by another independent user. The member should be given the opportunity to address any charges before any removal action is taken. The member should, however, voluntarily recuse themselves from approving/denying requests until the issue is resolved. This will essentially be a probation period with no guilt implied. They can still comment on bots as any normal user can. In order to remove a user, a voting process similar to the process for adding new members must occur with the following caveats: A user cannot be removed without a plurality of other BAG members voting <b>and</b> a plurality of non-BAG members voting. In any case, consensus to remove must still be established. This prevents hijacking the process.</p>
<p>That's my first draft. Let's see what other people come up with. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 17:37, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bluemoose/Martin</span></h2>
<p>Since Bluemoose has apparently left the project, his name was placed on the inactive list. I'd propose that we accept Bluemoose's stated departure as a resignation from BAG and remove his name from the list. At the very least it will prevent imposters from using his name in bot procedure, but I can see no other reason to keep it around just for memories. We have history for that. Since discussion on this page appears almost non-existent, I'm going to go ahead and remove it and unless there is significant discussion to the contrary we can leave it at that. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 12:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that BAG members are more than capable to decide whether or not a fellow member should be removed, but if I may suggest: maybe wait a little while, to make sure that Martin's decision is indeed final and that he in fact left. I mean, recently we saw an admin declare that he was leaving the project, but then he thought it over and went back on his decision to leave, within a few days. So maybe wait and see if Martin is really gone, maybe for a month, or two or three weeks... Just a thought, but again, BAG members are certainly capable of making this decision. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 15:26, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's a well reasoned thought, but the way I see it is that there is a minor practical reason for not cluttering the list with users that have stated that they are done for good. Let's say for sake of argument that he did return. In that case, we'd treat him the same way that we'd treat an admin who's powers were voluntarily withdrawn: we'd reactivate him as a BAG member without much fuss. But if he says he's gone, I'm going to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on this one that he really meant what he said, and as such act accordingly. Also, if he ever came back under a different name, we'd have no easy way to verify that he was the same person, so we wouldn't want someone to try that tactic either. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 19:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello, folks. You might know me.

I didn't much participate in BRFAs up to date since I was treating the discussions a bit exclusive and for BAGgers only, but finally figured I might join and give some hepling hand/opinion/(dis)approval on requests every now and then, especially if pywikipedia bots become more popular.

<dd>I agree that they shouldn't. But from my observations, rarely anyone from outside the BAG comments on the approval requests. Perhaps bot proposals should be crossposted to relevant forums like the Village Pump/WikiProjects involved within the bots' scope. One more important issue is the approval of adminbots, for which BAG has currently no authority to grant <i>+sysop</i>, and for which RfA has been criticised as a solution. I believe we could approve bots by BRFA (with the admin bit given automatically if a consensus is met) if only the forum gathered enough commmunity input by, for example, advertising a discussion on <a href="../../../c/e/n/WP%7ECENT_a4cb.html" title="WP:CENT">WP:CENT</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMM_1829.html" title="WP:COMM">WP:COMM</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisza13_4392.html" title="User:Misza13">ÐœÐ¸ÑˆÐ°</a><a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMisza13_b5fd.html" title="User talk:Misza13"><span style="color:green"><b>13</b></span></a> 20:30, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Two thoughts come to mind. First of all, it would be nice if persons other than BAG members gave their input, but I think that most of the time the bots under review are uncontroversial and do not require much more than standard grunge work for approvals. Every time there is a controversial bot, there are people who just "randomly" pop up and comment, so it is clear that the requests have the attention of a number of persons who mainly just read and occasionally comment. Second of all, I personally like the system for admin flags. We approve specific requests for running bots and acquiring bot flags and the community at large approves admin flags. It's a good system that results in few admin flags, but then again, there <b>should</b> be few of those. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 13:03, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good evening (<a href="../../../g/m/t/GMT_24fe.html" title="GMT">GMT</a> time); I am requesting approval to serve for the Bot Approvals Group (on this Wikipedia.) <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">Bots</a> are an area of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> that has greatly interested me of late - I am currently developing a simple bot to assist in archiving my talk page; I am not a <a href="../../../s/y/s/WP%7ESYSOP_9bfc.html" title="WP:SYSOP">sysop</a>, and I don't plan to be for a while, despite my ongoing Administrator Coaching.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request to join bot approval group</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I am HighInBC, there is no formal process to do this yet so I am being bold. I would like to join the bot approval group. I find the subject and procedure interesting and I think I am qualified to assist in this area.</p>
<p>I am an administrator and have a firm grasp of policy, and an understanding of consensus. I have given particular attention to the <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a> policy since I have been developing bots of late. I program mainly in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl.html" title="Perl">perl</a> but can understand other languages rather easily. I operate <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBCBot_488b.html" title="User:HighInBCBot">User:HighInBCBot</a>(in progress) and <a href="../../../h/b/c/User%7EHBC_AIV_helperbot_17a6.html" title="User:HBC AIV helperbot">User:HBC AIV helperbot</a>(operating).</p>
<p>I am ready to answer any questions you may have, and I look forward to your feedback. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:13, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How much do you know about the bot approvals process? As far as trust, technical knowledge, and knowledge of bot policy goes, you're a perfect candidate, I just worry a bit about your knowledge of the procedure, what kinds of questions are asked, how trials work, etc. I'd support given that you'd start of slow until you get comfortable with the process. â€”<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 15:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First off I prefer to start slow. I will most likely start by asking questions and giving opinions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for my current knowledge, it mostly comes from reading through old bot request, approved, denied, and in progress. I found that it is important to make sure the user has explained very clearly and specifically each function the bot will serve, there should not be any vagueness here. The operator should demonstrate the needed technical knowledge, the trust of the community, and it should be confirmed that the functions of the bot are both in line with policy, and have the consensus of the community.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More practical concerns needed to be taken into account such as:
<ul>
<li>Is there a need for this bot</li>
<li>Has the operator taken the steps required in <a href="../../../c/r/e/Wikipedia%7ECreating_a_bot_7f22.html" title="Wikipedia:Creating a bot">Wikipedia:Creating_a_bot</a></li>
<li>Is this function duplicated by another bot</li>
<li>Is this the best way to accomplish this function</li>
<li>Are there any unforeseen repercussions from this function</li>
<li>Can the functionality of this bot be abused (that one is important)</li>
<li>What kind of load will this put on the servers</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see trials as a way to both explore the community reaction to the bot and vet the inevitable errors. It is a period of time where the bot should run under close supervision both from the owner and the approvals group. The bot trails should continue until the bot is running reliably for a good time since it's last bug fix.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Talk page templating for WikiProjects</span></h2>
<p>I was a bit concerned to see BotanyBot (<a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_BotanyBot_d692.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/BotanyBot">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/BotanyBot</a>) tagging articles as Stub class, without leaving behind a note that the article had been automatically assessed. The practice of automatically equating stub templates with stub class articles was controversial when it first started and threatened to derail the assessments process. That's why I created the now much-used {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStubclass_c80b.html" title="Template:Stubclass">stubclass</a>}} template. I'd ask fellow members to insist that any auto assessing of stubs use that template or an auto=yes parameter so that the automated assessment is transparent and human editors can follow behind checking and reassessing where necessary. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:54, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not enough, as the talk page is not in any "auto assessed" category.

<dd>Does it matter whether or not the specific WikiProject approves of the usage? I've been checking many of the articles that are in my watchlist that have been flagged as stubs and checking them manually, but perhaps that's not good enough. I looked at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Plants_7183.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Plants">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Plants</a> and there was no discussion about this issue, so either no one has notice (which seems unlikely) or no one cares. As a relatively new member of the Wikiproject, I have no objections, but if others complain, then perhaps we should do something. Since I don't have the discussion that you stated above, I don't know if this is sufficient behavior or not. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 01:46, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The controversy came from people who don't like the templates, not from the Wikiprojects. Iirc correctly the rationale was that if a stub is stub class, you don't need to a WikiProject tag <i>at all</i> for assessments, just use the stub tag.</dd>
<dd>Now, ok, if there've been no complaints then things may have moved on, which is cool; I personally prefer to mark these edits assessments as auto but I can't force it on others. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 00:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well if I notice any discussion on the WikiProject from members or otherwise about this issue, perhaps we'll address it at that time. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 01:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Protecting the approved page</span></h2>
<p>According to <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Approvals_group_b61c.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Approvals group">Wikipedia:Bots/Approvals group</a>, all active members are sysops. I move that <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Approved_bot_requests_de7d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Approved bot requests">Wikipedia:Bots/Approved bot requests</a> be protected as it's not for general editing; it can always be un or semi protected if we get a non-sysop member. Any objections? --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 17:41, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We've had this discussion in the past. The consensus was not to protect the page, because some of us (like myself) do edit from accounts without sysop access and there is no reason that someone else couldn't edit the page for other reasons other than to add or remove names. I would, however, not have a problem with semi-protecting the page. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 17:58, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We had the debate in the past when we had non sysop members. Why would you edit the page from a non sysop account? How are the bureacrats supposed to know if it's a genuine approval or not if you don't edit as Ram-Man?&#160;:) Not meaning to be confrontational, just don't follow the logic&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 17:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC) PS I'll semi-protect in the meantime.

<dd>The approvals page says that I edit from that account, plus it's easy enough to verify that I am who I say I am <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:RM&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:RM&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>. But that said, I could be doing something like updating the table format to be more attractive or have a better layout. Perhaps the names are not in alphabetical order. Maybe the opening paragraph needs expansion. Whatever the reason, I don't think it needs to be (fully) protected. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 18:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking through this history, I don't see any recent or ongoing vandalism or misuse. Perhaps we can wait until there is a problem before we fix it. <small><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC"><sup>High</sup><sub>InBC</sub></a><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 18:06, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the page needs protection, the current 'crats that deal with bots are pretty familiar with our group. I do urge any of us that do not alreay have it, to put it on your watchlist though. â€” <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype">xaosflux</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:42, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
