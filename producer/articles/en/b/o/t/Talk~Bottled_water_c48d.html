<p>There is a common understanding that drinking a lot of purified water can be bad for you (ostensibly because it will absorb minerals that would otherwise be consumed by your body). However, I could only find one clear article describing this and it is widely disseminated, by Zoltan P. Rona MD, MSc. Unfortunately the vast majority of the web sites that contain this article are trying to sell water purifiers or water itself and therefore are suspect sources of material. Can anyone provide information about whether drinking purified water is good or bad for you in the short or long-term and add to this article? -- <a href="../../../s/g/a/User%7ESgartner_d39b.html" title="User:Sgartner">S.

<p>I've read the article titled <a href="http://articles.guidemegreen.com/articles/29/1/There%92s-No-Such-Thing-As-%91Pure%92-Water" class="external text" title="http://articles.guidemegreen.com/articles/29/1/There%92s-No-Such-Thing-As-%91Pure%92-Water" rel="nofollow"><i>There's No Such Thing as Pure Water</i></a>, and I realize it's written by a biased ecologist working for a <a href="http://www.cleanairpurewater.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.cleanairpurewater.com/" rel="nofollow">water purification company</a>; however, he makes a very good point that there is a misconception about the word "pure" applied to water. Water is an acid and naturally bonds with other chemicals to reach a level of neutrality that is safe for consumption. The Wikipedia article makes multiple mentions of pure water with no apparent understanding that you can't just have a bottle with only H2O in it. For example, the line "Even if the water itself is pure, a plastic container may leak chemicals into the bottled water," gives the impression that such a pure water exists. Is there an expert that can clarify this in the article? <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELackthereof_028f.html" title="User:Lackthereof">Lackthereof</a> 19:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think this article conforms to a high standard, it seems very biased against bottled water. The whole tone of the article is anti-bottled water. As well as that, it needs some tidying. - Joolz</p>
<dl>
<dd>Statements such as <i>I don't think</i> and <i>it seems</i> are personal views. Unless you can be more specific and back up your feelings I suggest we drop the NPOV tag. The points made on the unhealthy aspects of bottled water and the controls of it is backed up by links and much published articles in the past (such as the uranium and benzene contaminated bottled water).
<dl>
<dd>I posted that months ago (before I learnt how to tag my name on the end&#160;;) The NPOV tag was added today, and not by me. Also, you may note that I talked about the tone of the article. You may also notice I've outlined some of the problems I've had with this article below, which have been resolved now. -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 16:11, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I second this. This article has a very strong bias against bottled water.</p>
<p>It opens with an extensive section about the negative environmental effects of bottled water. This is followed by a "Marketing" section that has nothing to do with marketing. Penn &amp; Teller's test is another of their many attempts to make the general public look stupid, and has no place in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The article mentions the potential health benefits of bottled water, but quickly clarifies that this is pseudoscience. It proceeds to mention that bottled water costs 10,000 times the price of tap water. This is a misperspective. People who buy bottled water aren't paying for the water, they're paying for the service of having it purified (in some cases) and put in a bottle.</p>
<p>The "Regulations" section is a blatant attack on the FDA's regulation of bottled water, and then mentions that, "ironically", tap water is more strictly regulated than bottled water.</p>
<p>The writers of this article are clearly people who pride themselves on drinking tap water, since about 75% of this article is anti-bottled water propaganda. This article needs a large overhaul.</p>

<dd>Why don't you create an article called Anti-Bottled-water-ism?

<p>Is there any source to the "fact" that <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evian.html" title="Evian">Evian</a> water sold in the US is actually made from US springs? How about <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perrier.html" title="Perrier">Perrier</a>? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 09:25, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the UK Evian bottles are labelled as from "Cachat Spring - S.A.E.M.E - 74500 Evian - FRANCE". It seems unlikely that they would source their supplies for the US market at a different spring for a whole range of reasons. Namely, the taste of the water simply wouldn't be the same, people would be able to tell the difference. It wouldn't seem to be in Evian's interests to use a different source for the US market. This claim seems to be completely unsubstantiated. - Joolz</p>
<p>Having done some research I can't find anything to substantiate the claim as of yet. I'm also wary of the claim that because it's a French company any product it produces, regardless of where it is produced, can be labelled as a 'product of France'. For instance, Nokia phones are often produced in Hungary, and as such are labelled 'Made in Hungary', even though it is a Finnish company. I'm not sure about the regulations in the US though. Also, the statement "a lot of the bottled water is actually very close to tap water." needs explanation. Close in what way exactly? In seems to stand to reason that there will be a number of similarities, considering the fact that they're both essentially water products. - Joolz</p>

<p>You say that Evian would not produce differently tasting water marketed for different countries.</p>
<p>You may want to note that Cadbury produces different tasting chocolate worldwide based on the taste pallete of the respective consumer country.</p>
<p><br />
From the web site www.mineralwaters.org you can choose a list of bottled water by country, where you will also find Evian mineralization table, there are two with different structures and total dissolved solids, this is a clear indication that two different springs are used in bottling Evian.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is simply not enough evidence to back up such claims, according to Evian all their water comes from France. That isn't to say that they don't have two sources very nearby, and there can be a variety of reasons why there are two different types listed on that site. The site does not explain why, and you've simply leapt to a conclusion.</dd>
<dd>I'm going to remove the claim because it is unsubstantiated, and quite possibly libelous.</dd>

<p>umm...I don't really know if you guys agree, but this doesn;t sound very neutral. From the dawn of humanity? exgeratted</p>
<p><i>for thousands of years, people have been making deliberate use of the fact that water flows downhill all by itself. [1] [2] For some hundreds of years, technology has existed to pump water under pressure on a wide scale, enabling it to be stored at altitude, and self-feed under gravity on-demand [3]. This practice has become so wide-spread in the English-speaking world, that the phrase 'on-tap' has become synonymous with'on-demand'.</i></p>
<p><i>Putting it into little containers and lugging it around is comparitively inefficient, both in terms of energy and time. This has been known since the dawn of humanity, when we drank from natural pipes and reservoirs known as rivers, lakes, and wells. It is these same natural pipes, which have supported earth's life since the very dawn of time, that are becoming poisoned and polluted by the plastics we discard, and the chemicals and residue from production and shipping of the plastic bottles which contain the bottled water which now enamours so many.</i></p>

<p>Large relevent sections have been removed by someone under the guise of "NPOV". This happens so frequently on so many wikimedia pages that I don't have the heart to restore the article.

<p>The person who performed wholesale slaughter of several sections (March 7-ish revisions), Joojabber, was me.</p>
<p>The sections in question were removed because some sections were irrelevant, but in most cases, simply not NPOV. You're free to add them back in a form that is not with bias slant, or peppered with the opinions of the editor--this is one of the powerful benefits of a user-editable encylopedia like Wikipedia. However, we as a community -- people using this resource, and people contributing to it -- should put forth our best effort to ensure that articles are of the best quality possible. This means that we have to be able to put on the NPOV hat when we're writing an article, even if it's about something we hate or loathe.</p>
<p>If that's not possible, it is for the best interests of everyone involved that anyone unable to perform NPOV edits simply step aside for someone else to do the grunt work, while mentioning that there are sections in particular that are wrong, but that you are unable to make modifications to these sections yourself for fear of conveying a biased point of view.</p>
<p>So, what I'm trying to say is, please don't use Wikipedia as a political tool. I understand that it could be considered a mouth-watering target, as it could be hours or days before someone modifies the article again (with who knows how many hits between article modifications), but such actions have the potential to devalue the great, exciting service Wikipedia offers.</p>
