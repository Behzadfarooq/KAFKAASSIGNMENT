<p>I know that <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">Anthony_DiPierro</a> was running a bot to update his own personal subpage to keep a track of the hourly discussions... but since the format on VFD has changed, he has not fixed his hourly discussions. I would like to use a bot for the purpose of updating a subpage on my user page, keeping a track of all the new discussions being added by the hour. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 04:26, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean just links to the newly created vote-pages or also links to changes in vote pages? What exactly do you hope to achieve, I think if we're going to run a bot on VfD we might as well make it one that organises VfD in such a way you don't need to run a personal bot to check for new VfDs. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 04:32, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Each hour, it would post links to any new VFD discussions, keeping 7 days of VFD on the list.

<dd>Ah, right.

<p>Well, due to the security update, I will not be able to implement this bot yet, but I would like the approval to have my bot additionally do the following tasks at <s>roughly</s> <b>exactly</b> around every 00:00 UTC:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add each VFD subpage day. Example: <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 February 5}}</b>
<dl>
<dd>Reason for this is because the VFD system has changed such that each day has a subpage for VFD based on the UTC clock. The transincludes must be included every day in order to properly present the VFD. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 17:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Edit each new subpage day to include: == MONTHNAME DATE == (Like == February 5 ==)
<dl>
<dd>Again, VFD system changed, and each day will require to display its day section, allowing a person direct access to the VFD day. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 17:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><s>Take the last recently moved subpage day (transinclude) to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Old_499a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old</a>, edit all VFD subpages to include the content from <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_top_d7d6.html" title="Template:Vfd top">Template:Vfd top</a> and <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_bottom_f7cd.html" title="Template:Vfd bottom">Template:Vfd bottom</a>. (This bot will not count any of the votes, just merely include content from the templates, making it easier on the maintainers)</s>
<dl>
<dd>Each VFD subpage includes the content from both of these templates. I believe they are not applied due to the technical limitations of the number of templates that can be used on each page. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 17:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have decided not to do this feature, until the bot really can do something useful. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 00:59, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, rethinking to add the content from <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_top_d7d6.html" title="Template:Vfd top">Template:Vfd top</a> and <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_bottom_f7cd.html" title="Template:Vfd bottom">Template:Vfd bottom</a> but as HTML comments, on all VFD subpages after moved to <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_Old_dcc1.html" title="WP:VFD/Old">WP:VFD/Old</a> -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:13, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Having a bot to update VfD would be <b>wonderful</b>. One suggestion: as step 3), have it create the subpage for <i>tomorrow</i>. There's no reason not to create it ahead of time, so it's ready when it's needed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About adding {{subst:vfd top}} and {{subst:vfd bottom}}: I don't know if this is such a good idea. When I'm scanning /Old, I ignore the sections with colored backgrounds, because they've already been closed. Adding the templates ahead of time would make it harder to see which pages have been processed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, if it's feasible, change "roughly around" to "exactly". This thing'll be run as a <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cron.html" title="Cron">cron</a> job anyway, so there's no reason not to run it at the right time. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 21:00, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're forgetting about the time it takes for it to get a Wikipedia page. That is why I say roughly. Because the load time to get the page is not always exact, the time when the bot posts something to the Wikipedia will not always fall exactly 00:00 UTC. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 00:54, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How do you think I manage to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">do it by hand</a> every day at midnight (except when I flake out)? You load the page ten minutes early, get the changes ready, then hit "save page" at the right time. Edit conflicts aren't an issue, because the page is only edited once or twice a day. Of course, doing the same thing with a bot would complicate the code slightly. It's no big deal either way. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 05:10, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The code won't be complicated any further than it already is. If the bot runs exactly 10 minutes before the UTC date rolls over to the next day, all it has to do is search for the current date, then replace <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 February 5}}</b> for <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 February 5}}\n{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/TODAY}}</b>. Or in computing terms: <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/TODAY}}</b> for <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/TODAY}}\n{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/TOMORROW}}</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:08, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, if it is running 10 minutes before the next UTC day, then yes, it would create the VFD page for tomorrow. I would actual want the bot to do that one hour before hand. just to be on the safe side. Of course, all changes presume that the Wikipedia is working, and is not down at the time of the updates. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:31, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, the additional complication would be having it wait until midnight before <i>submitting</i> the change. Also, there are actually 5 lines to edit on VfD. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=9923509&amp;oldid=9897702" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=9923509&amp;oldid=9897702" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> for a representative example. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 08:31, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said, it would only be adding, not removing the discussions. Removing the discussion would still be a human job, since the bot will not know when a discussion is closed.

<dd>I think there's a slight misconception here about how the edits to VfD work. Every day at midnight, the new day is added, and the oldest day (now 6 days old) is removed, and added to /Old. The discussions on that old day aren't <i>closed</i> yet—anyone can still vote. It's just that the day doesn't appear on the main VfD page anymore. The votes get closed one by one as someone gets around to closing and tallying them. There's no reason for the bot not to do the complete extension (all 5 lines of the diff above), and it would be tremendously helpful. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 21:17, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Another minor technicality: have it submit the changes for VfD <i>first</i>, and the change to /Old <i>second</i> (like, a couple seconds later).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Upload script request</span></h2>
<p>I'm in need of a script. I recently found a large dump of classical music, all CC-by-SA. I used wget recursively to fetch all of it (650 files; 5.29 gigs). I need to upload them now. I'd like to do it with a unix command line program. I figure the syntax should be something like:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>&gt;wikiupload Raul654bot:mypassword ./song.ogg --rate=100 --location=commons "This is a public domain song I uploaded {{PD}}"</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The 1st arguement is the username and password (necessary for uploading files)</li>
<li>The 2nd arguement is the file to upload. So in the case of uploading a large number of files, I can just use the *</li>
<li>The 3rd arguement specifices the upload rate. I believe this is necessary because bots are supposed to be able to run at low speeds initially.</li>
<li>The 4th arguement specifies where it should go: en, de, commons, wikibooks, etc.</li>
<li>The 5th arguement is the upload text - IE, the text to be put on the image page.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../../../c/u/r/CURL_a8bc.html" title="CURL">cURL</a> might already do what you're after. It's what I use for putting automated content into the Wikipedia - (I'm only adding article text, and I'm doing it using PHP's cURL library, so I don't think my code is likely to be of much use to you, otherwise I'd just give you the code). Nevertheless I think it should be able to do what you're after from the command line.</p>
<p>The following args look most applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li>--cookie (you'll need a cookie for your uploading data under your username / password)</li>
<li>--limit-rate (so as to not upload too fast)</li>
<li>--form (With various args as per the Upload forms, which will include the description, and the path to the file)</li>
<li>The destination URL (which will be different depending on where you want it to go, but will presumably be the commons most of the time).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're lucky then maybe someone has already done this using cURL on the command line, and will let us know the command they used.</p>

<p>Note that you'll probably have to call it multiple times (e.g. using "xargs"), if you want wildcard / multi-file-upload functionality.</p>

<p>I talked it over with Kate ,and here's what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>curl -F wpName=Bob -F wpPassword=asdf --cookie-jar ./mycookies "http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?Special:Userlogin&amp;action=submit" &gt; output1.html</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>curl -F wpUpload=@./Bob_test_file.txt -F wpUploadDescription=This_is_a_test -F wpUploadAffirm=1 --limit-rate 100k --cookie-jar ./mycookies "http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?Special:Upload&amp;action=submit" &gt; output2.html</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one logs in Bob (whose password is asdf) and creates a cookie jar containing the log in cookie, and the second one actually does the upload (of file Bob_test_file.txt with description This_is_a_test). I tested, and the first one works *I think* but the 2nd one does not.

<dd>You can try the pywikipediabot framework. They have a script called upload.py that you could use, if you made the script runable. Then you can create a perl script or a bash script based on upload.py to loop through the contents of the directory.

<p>Debugging - Raul, you did good, and you were 95% of the way there:</p>
<p>With the first command:</p>
<ul>
<li>I added wpLoginattempt="Log in" (which is the same as clicking the "log in" button) - (may or may not be needed, but it won't hurt).</li>
<li>Added wpRemember=1 (may or may not be needed, but it won't hurt).</li>
</ul>
<p>With the second command:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL could be wrong - I used <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload</a> instead.</li>
<li>Need the file's path in "wpUploadFile", rather than "wpUpload".</li>
<li>Add 'wpUpload="Upload file"', which is the same as clicking the button (may or may not be needed, but it won't hurt).</li>
<li>With uploading, I think you want "--cookie", rather than "--cookie-jar", since "--cookie" is read-only, whereas --cookie-jar is for storing stuff (i.e. use store to log in, then read to upload).</li>
<li>Note that you'll also want to put in a license tag in the description, otherwise the tagging folks will hunt down and nail you to a tree&#160;;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting all that together into two commands, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>First command&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<p>curl -F wpName=Nickj -F wpPassword=NotMyRealPassword -F wpLoginattempt="Log in" -F wpRemember=1 --cookie-jar ./mycookies "http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&amp;action=submit" &gt; output1.html</p>
<ul>
<li>Second command (note that I have omitted the rate limiting bit, as my installed curl is so ancient that it doesn't have that option, but you probably want to add it back):</li>
</ul>
<p>curl -F wpUpload="Upload file" -F wpUploadFile=@./Part_of_Great_Barrier_Reef_from_Helecopter.JPG -F wpUploadDescription="Photo I took in Jan 2005 over part of the Great Barrier Reef in a helicopter {{GFDL}}" -F wpUploadAffirm=1 --cookie ./mycookies "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" &gt; output2.html</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zbot</span></h2>
<p>Ok, this is my first attempt at a bot, so if I seem to be missing anything, let me know. The main reason I created this bot is that I wanted to have a bot that changes flag images. What I mean by that is replacing one flag image from here, with another, which can be either on here or at the Commons. An example would be (which will be a test run if approved), is switching from Image:Belarus flag large.png to <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Belarus.png_e4d7.html" title="Image:Flag of Belarus.png">Image:Flag of Belarus.png</a>. Not only this will free up the many images we use here at Wikipedia EN, this will also do the work that I have done by hand for months. And, if we ever go to svg conversion, this bot can be used to help in the conversion. While I am not sure how long it will take before it can be approved, but I am an idiot in dealing with programming and could use some help on trying to make the bot work. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 06:52, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Changing what is shown in the articles. If there is any images to upload, I will do it myself manually. But, as I post on User:Zbot, I crashed Python and I am an idiot when coming to programing.

<p>Also, as long as I'm here, could I trouble you to tweak Vfdbot to add a &lt;!-- Please do not add new vfds here.

I catch two or three vfds a week being added to the <i>first</i> day listed on vfd instead of the current day, and sometimes two or three a day where they're added to yesterday's page just after midnight UTC.

<p>Manually archiving DYK items to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_additions_2250.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent additions">Wikipedia:Recent additions</a> is still managable, but can anyone with more knowledge about bots tell me if it's possible to automate the archiving process (also outlining the pics correctly).</p>
<p>It should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Archive all but the latest 2 updates from the section on DYK talk to Recent additions.</li>
<li>Archive the oldest 50 items including pics to a free numbered subpage in Recent additions.</li>
<li>Warn users about their articles being featured.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd also love for template updates to be automated during weekends and holidays, when no else seems to do them, but that may not be possible because that would require the bot having admin access. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:11, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The text that needs archiving would be only a section of the page. Complete page moves wouldn't be necessary.

<hr />
<p>Update: The code is still being written, however I have a good idea what this bot does. Some definitions for the purpose of anyone who wishs to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>dyk = Did you know</li>
<li>dykline = A line of information containing the dyk info plus a possible associated picture. It is assumed that all associated pictures proceed "...that"</li>
<li>block = A blank newline in the wikicode that separates several dyklines. A block will refer to several dyklines between two blank newline or one of the key search features, such as a hidden HTML comment or section.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>On the page <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html" title="Template talk:Did you know">Template talk:Did you know</a>... <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurando-san_e26d.html" title="User:Kurando-san">User:Kurando-san</a> will move all blocks under the ===ARCHIVE USED SUGGESTIONS HERE=== section except for 3 blocks to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_additions_2250.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent additions">Wikipedia:Recent additions</a>.</li>
<li>On the page <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_additions_2250.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent additions">Wikipedia:Recent additions</a>, if the number of dyklines exceed 50, move the oldest blocks (the bottom blocks) to an archive page, like <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_additions_25_11a1.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent additions 25">Wikipedia:Recent additions 25</a> until the number of dyklines on the archive page is equal or greater than 50 dyklines. Once the number of dyklines exceed 50, create a new archive page and add to the next number in the archive. In this case, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_additions_26_ee74.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent additions 26">Wikipedia:Recent additions 26</a>.
