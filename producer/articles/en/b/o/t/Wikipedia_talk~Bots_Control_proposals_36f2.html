<h2><span class="mw-headline">Control proposals</span></h2>
<p>The following proposals are split to make it a bit easier to consider them individually. Their intent is to provide me and the other technical team members with ways to limit bots other than using the site firewall. For those unfamiliar with me, I'm the member of the technical team who does most of the watching of the database servers. The limits are because of the major load that write bots can impose on the system and are intended to provide a way for those operating the systems to limit the bots to levels which do not unduly harm the response time of other users. These are not en Wikipedia proposals. They are intended for discussion here as proposals applying to the Wikimedia servers and are here to make you aware of them and provide a way for you to discuss them and the reasons for them.</p>
<p>Please don't suggest things like adding more database servers as a way of raising the limits: that won't make disks seek any faster. Even if it did, bots are unlikely to be sufficient reason for the expenditure.</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to discuss the proposals with me in IRC - I'm not an ogre but I do have to deal with load issues and these are the tools required. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 04:51, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is an interesting addition considering all the prior discussion on the "negligible" load bots have on the servers. I have questioned the load that bots have on the servers and people have replied that developers have told them there is negligible impact. Now, we have someone who monitors the database load and now wishes to place tigher controls on bots due to resource issues which now seems to backup my earlier concerns about the impacts of bots on server load. As for the policies stated below, I think some will require changes to the core component of the pywikipediabot program. Alternatively, the server could do its own monitoring of bots (as bot accounts will be marked with the bot flag) and could conceivably give lower priority to bot requests. There are of course issues with doing that as well though. Alternatively, a system load factor could be returned on requests made by bots which could trigger the bots to increase/decrease its request rate accordingly. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWolf_0f32.html" title="User:RedWolf">RedWolf</a> 05:56, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bots already get the best practical measure of load: how long it took their last request to complete. Even 10 second reporting of load isn't good enough to keep up with real time fluctuations, so the response time you see is the best guide available. Waiting as long between requests as the last request took would be fairly good for real time load adjustment. Default might be 3-5 times that, since that's about once every ten seconds much of the time. Lower priority for bot requests is doable but would take programming which isn't likely to happen soon. Not that easy to set up a queue with PHP or a bot could be placed at the back of the queue. Would work badly anyway - bots would never get any work done with that method because there are too many humans. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 15:24, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FWIW, the comment that bot performance was "negligible" was based on a comment made a developer (<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a>) a long time ago when the rambot first ran almost two years ago. The rambot has never increased the amount of editing that it has performed. Since then, this is the first time someone has ever mentioned anything different, which is great because developers have been extremely silent on this issue. What I don't understand is how with all the new hardware and newer software the bot suddenly is slowing down Wikipedia. At the time it represented a tiny fraction of the server load, how can it suddenly be taking up so much? <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man"></a> – <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup>[[]] 15:26, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can it suddenly be taking so much is the wrong question. The right one is how close are the systems to their limits? For disks, it's easy at low load - any disk can handle a lot of load since drives doing 150-200 seeks per second are readily available. If you ask while the site is well below using that many seeks, you'll get the answer that it's not a problem. Ask now and you get a different answer because a 5+spare drive RAID5 array on a machine with a gigabyte of RAM has a limit of about 30 write queries per second (however many seeks it takes). That's Albert, the terrabyte machine which just became the main image/download server for the site. Today I get the decidedly dubious pleasure of contemplating exponential growth with doubling periods in the 8-12 week range, while the systems are today at or exceeding the capacity of a single drive to keep up. That means that I'm asking the developers to start planning now, with deadline summer to this time next year, to have support in the software for splitting a single project across a farm of database servers, similar in concept to the way Google and LiveJournal split their database into chunks. Please also review the recent medium term (one year or less threshold) capacity planning discussion at <a href="http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Wikipedia_Status" class="external text" title="http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Wikipedia_Status" rel="nofollow">OpenFacts Wikipedia Status</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 05:23, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is it possible to put the ext3 journal (or whatever filesystem you're using, if it has a journal) on a separate disk? Alternatively, maybe it's possible to put the innodb journal on a separate disk. If so, and you're not doing this already, this should increase performance many many times over, as writes to the journal are going to take very few seeks. I find it strange you'd have so many seeks anyway, as I would think the vast majority of the reads would be in the article space which easily fits in memory. I suppose compressing the article space would save even more memory, though. Splitting the database is surely going to be necessary eventually (well, I assume Wikipedia growth will outpace the declining costs of random access memory), but I would think there's some time for that, as anything important can fit in memory. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 13:59, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's possible to put journals and logs on different disks. Has to be RAID 1 so InnoDB can reconstruct without data loss if there's a failure though. We currently have 2U 6 bay boxes and I'd rather have 6 drives doing the full work load. With more bays I've certainly considered it and may well go that way. The article space doesn't fit in memory. En cur is about 2.673GB in InnoDB database form. About 4GB of 8GB total on the master is available for InnoDB caching. Slaves have 4GB but only have to cache half of the data. With indexes and other tables it would take several times the RAM to hold it all and that's not really doable in the few months ahead timeframe even in boxes with a 16GB (using 2GB modules) RAM capacity. Getting the titles split from the article text is doable and being worked on. Compressing cur text is an option - it would save perhaps 30% of the space. But at the cost of complicating quite a few other things and adding some Apache load. Probably not worth doing. Might be worth it when InnoDB supports compression within the database engine, though. MySQL Cluster is interesting because it's spread around many machines but the problem is the growth rate and it currently being too immature to trust, as well as not yet having a properly segmented data set so "cold" data can go somewhere other than RAM. We use memcached to cache rendered pages and we can eventually cache a pretty high proportion of parsed pages in that, saving significant database load. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 15:24, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Bot operators are reminded of de facto English language policy, in response to complaints about the Ram-bot created city articles, is that mass automate adding of content is prohibited. Any bot intending such action must obtain broad community consensus, involving, at a minimum, 100 votes, none of which can be made by bots. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 04:51, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Having done the rambot articles, I can't remember such a "de facto" policy ever being made. Of course such a mass automatic adding as the rambot articles has not been done since, but I was unaware of any substantial policy discussion of this. Now many of the complaints had nothing to do with the content of the messages but when there were votes on the issue (before 100 was a reasonable number) they were consistently supported. Here is my problem with this: If the content is acceptable in the small scale, it should be acceptable on the large scale. We don't require voting for the small scale content. Despite the popular view, the fact is that there is no functional difference between a bot doing the work and me doing the work. The only difference is the amount of time it takes! I can't support this proposal because it assumes that if a user performs large number of edits that the content must suddenly be given a stronger standard of review than a small number of edits. It violates the spirit of Wikipedia's openness and that anyone can edit. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man"></a> – <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup>[[]] 14:35, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The philosophy has been that if a human is willing to do the work, it's more likely to be worth having, coupled with widespread dislike for the work of the first mass bot, rambot: the US city articles. As a result of repeated complaints from many querters the "random page" feature was made non-random earlier this year. It now retries, trying to dodge any article where rambot is the last editor. That seems to have muted the complaints and it is possible that a mass-adding bot will receive wider support now. Also, there are now a sufficiently large number of other articles that relatively large data dumps won't be as high profile as the cities were, so that should help. The quantity of the content seemed to be a bigger problem than the nature of the content, because that caused it to turn up very regularly, though there has been pretty regularly expressed dislike for the small city articles as well. Speaking personally only, they didn't bother me. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 10:33, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Proposal: DBA discussion mandatory</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>No bot may operate at more than 10 requests (read and write added together) per minute without discussing the bot's operations, and getting approval from, the people who look after the Wikimedia database servers. I'm the person who does most of that.</li>
<li>This proposal is intended to make sure that the operators of potentially disruptive bots have discussed their operation with those who will see and have to deal with that disruption.

<dd>The speed of the requests should be tied directly to physical performance or other database concerns and not set at an arbitrary value.

<ul>
<li>This one isn't a limit. It's how to get the capacity limits on a bot changed. We've seen that bots generally aren't harmful to system performance at current rates. There's now a proposal to abandon those effective limits. We don't know the limiting rate. Discussion and real time monitoring will let the limiting rates be determined for each high speed bot, based on its properties (those include things like the rate at which it touches seldom-edited articles). Peak time limiting rates are likely to be quite low - the systems are sized (and money raised) based on what is needed to handle those peak rates, with some margin for growth. If a bot operator is unwilling to work with the systems people to do that, why would anyone other than the bot operator want the bot able to run at high speed?</li>
<li>If a bot is going to do high speed adding of articles, there are far better ways than using a bot. Things like bulk loads into the database (after broad community approval of such bulk loads). Discuss the task and how to get it done efficiently - something requiring talking with the people who can do such things can help with. If the broad community approves, you might find it more convenient to hand me 20,000 records in a CSV file and have me load them in half an hour one night than run a bot for weeks. It would certainly be a lot nicer for the database servers, which have optimisations for such bulk data loading.</li>
<li>Asking in bots pages on this project (or any other single project) isn't the right place to get load-related approvals. Nobody dealing with load would normally notice such discussions. System load discussions generally happen in #mediawiki, where the people who operate the systems discuss and react in real time to whatever is happening and discuss back and forth how to adjust designs and what to ask for. It's also the place where the people who understand the system load issues and the real time response of the systems are to be found. The proposed and actual purchases which result from those discussons are placed on meta. I've written most of those this year and it was me who suggested raising the last fund-raising target from $25,000 to $50,000. If you'd like to understand the systems better, please read my contributions on meta, then follow up with questions on the appropriate meta talk pages. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hardware_capacity_growth_planning" class="extiw" title="m:Hardware_capacity_growth_planning">m:Hardware capacity growth planning</a> is one to start with. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 03:38, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bots have been limited to 10 per minute by the bot policy, with crawlers subject to the robots.txt limit of one per second. Reads of normal article pages (not category pages, image description pages for much-linked images, allpages pages) are generally sufficiently inexpensive that one bot at 60 per minute probably wouldn't be so bad. Ideally it would be reading while not logged in, so the Squid cache servers can read the pages - that's the assumption behind the one per second limit in robot.txt. Hiting the database server at one page (many requests) per second would be unpleasant if done by many bots at once. As always, doing these things off peak is much preferred. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 05:23, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>My understanding is actually that crawlers have to wait one second between hits, which is actually somewhat less than 1 per second (to much less when things are slow). That's how I implement it, anyway, after every read I just sleep(1) (or sleep(5) if there was an error, but I plan to tweak that to use more of an exponential backoff based on the number of errors in a row). But my write bot (which I currently use only about once an hour) uses my crawler to do the reading (just adds the read request to the top of the crawler's queue). So I'm really not sure how I'd even implement something like 10/minute across reads and writes, without slowing the crawler way down. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 14:17, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Discussing with the DBA in advance would defeat the whole purpose of using the bot, which is to make the changes faster and with less effort. If I've gotta discuss things with a DBA before I can make the edits, I'll just use an interactive script (call it an "alternative browser", not a "bot") and run it under my own name. Can you imagine if Britannica required its writers to check with the DBA every time they want to add 50 see-alsos? Most of them would probably quit, and they're getting paid for it.

<p>I'd rather see 600/hour than 10/minute. Since a bot pretty much has to do a read before it can do a write, 10 requests/minute would be 5 edits/minute. That means if I want to add a category to 50 articles, I have to wait 10 minutes before I can check the last of the edits to make sure everything went smoothly. This is even more problematic if the limit is intended to be binding when I run the bot manually as a script (I've got a script which allows me to type on the command line to create a redirect, requiring me to wait 5 seconds between each command line argument is not reasonable, in fact, if this is required I'll just change my command line scripts to use my regular username and no one will know the difference). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 05:51, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Depends on the times. 600 in one second would always be a denial of service attack, it would be noticed and you'd be firewalled. Off peak, faster transient rates, throttled by running single-threaded and not making a request until the last one is fully complete, would probably not be unduly problematic, even though that may be faster than robots.txt permits. They key is to always delay quickly once you see responses slowing, so you adjust at the very rapid rate at which the site response time can change. Within seconds, a link from a place like Yahoo can add several hundred requests per second and make all talk of "this is a good time" obsolete. Yahoo isn't hypothetical - Yahoo Japan has done it quite a few times now - makes for an interesting, nearly instant, spike on the squid charts. Fortunately the squids do do most of the required work in that case. Stick to normal pages, wait as long between requests as your last request took and do it off peak (based on the real time Ganglia data) and you should be fine for reads. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a>

<dd>Single-threaded, waiting for a complete response, and backing off on errors are the currently available methods. Those provide some degree of automatic rate limiting and might be enough to keep the rate low enough to prevent emergency measures like firewalling. Maybe - I haven't watched a high speed editing bot in real time yet. I'd like to. In #mediawiki we also have bots posting periodic server load statements, aborted query notices and emergency denial of service load limit exceeded warnings. For myself, I also operate all the time I'm around with the "mytop" monitoring tool running on all five of the main production database servers, refreshing every 30 seconds (though I'm adjusting to 15, because that's not fast enough to reliably catch the causes of some transient events). There's no reason someone couldn't write something to help bots limit rate but it's not around yet. I asked Ask Jeeves to wait doing nothing for as long as the last operation took (we had to firewall them for a while). At the moment, wait times aren't a reliable indicator of database load because Apache web server CPU is the limit (we have 4 out of service and five ordered, and another order being thought about but not yet placed. Also the benchmarking subtantially faster code in MediaWiki 1.4, being rolled out now, countered by using more compression of old article revisions, which might help or hurt). A modified servmon/querybane reporting on a private IRC channel might be one approach. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 06:34, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly what is up to you. It determines how likely we are to decide we can accept people getting connection refused errors or other forms of site unavailable. If we can reach you <i>fast</i> we can take a few more seconds. If we aren't sure, and hundreds of queries are being killed by the load limiter every 20 seconds, we'll firewall instead. If there's ID and a request to call you in the brower ID string, and a member of the tech team is on the same continent, one might call and ask you to stop the bot instead of firwalling it. More likley after firewalling it to let you know and make it possible to more quickly end the firewalling. At the current rates, it's very unlikely that this will be necessary - it's the proposed new rates which change the picture and mean I have to talk about emergency realtime activities. I hope that no bot will be affected - but I want all high speed bot operators to know how we think and react in those situations, so nobody is surprised by what happens if rates are too high. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 06:34, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do note that I didn't ask for email address or telephone number. The harder it is to find and quickly contact the bot operator, the more likely it is that we'll have to firewall the IP address to block it. When there is crawler-type load issue, first stop is usually the database servers rising from 5-20 to hundreds of queries outstanding and then getting mass query kills by the load limiter. Except that for safety it only kills reads, while the bots would be doing writes and wouldn't be stopped. Next step after noticing that is a search of the logs to get the IP address and browser ID string. If that provides enough information to identify and contact the bot operator <i>predictably, in real time, within seconds or minutes</i>, then we may be able to risk waiting instead of firewalling the IP address to keep the site online. Email won't be used until after the fact - wiki account would be as good. IM address could be useful. To dramatically reduce your chance of being firewalled when crawling at high speed, monitor #mediawiki in real time while your bot is running, because that's where we'll be asking questions, asking others in the team to do something or telling others what we're doing. You might be fast enough at noticing to stop the firewalling by stopping the bot. <i>Fast</i> matters here: crawling and some other nasty things have taken servers from under ten to 800 or even up to 2,000 outstanding queries and denial of service mode emergency load shedding (mass cancelling of hundreds of queries, continuing until load drops) in less than 30 seconds. Such events are usually started, noticed and dealt with inside five minutes, so that's the effective upper bound on whether your contact information will do any immediate good. Just be sure to include a unique ID of some sort in the central spot - no need to include phone or IM or whatever, but if you want those used, the browser ID string is the best place for them. The logs are kept private - we aren't going to do something like post a phone number to a mailing list. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 06:34, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After reading up on this issue, I agree with this proposal in principal, assuming the robots.txt file accuratly represents current server load. In the ideal solution the bots would be able to use just enough of the remaining server load to maximize the server usage to get the maximum speed without hitting a critical slowdown. Over the last week or so I have not been running a bot, but Wikipedia's read and write response has seemed quite slow. Don't we have a bigger problem than bots if this is the case? Maybe that's a bit of a red-herring, but I wonder if there is an easy way to perform a more dynamic way for bots to check current server load and to be able to use as much of it as possible without causing problems. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man"></a> – <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup>[[]] 18:33, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're short of apaches right now, so it's slow for that reason, even thought the database servers are OK speed-wise. On saving, there's an unfortunate bit of software design which causes writes to sometimes be delayed several minutes or fail, triggered only by edits to an article not changed within the last week. Those sometimes cause a lock conflict on the recentchanges table. A quick hack to possibly deal with this is in MediaWiki 1.4, a nicer solution is on the to do list. This one is one reason why I commented about by write rates to infrequently changed articles.</dd>
<dd>Beyond site down, there's the "how slow is too slow" question. That's a tough one and people differ significantly - I tend to be more accepting of slowness than most, but it varies. Bots doing bulk updates which can be done in other ways aren't something I'd be paricularly keen on, just because it's inefficient. Those who want to rapidly do very large numbers of edits might consider working together to develop things like server-side agents with vetted code verifying job files with carefully vetted allowed transaction types. Those could do things like apply batches of 100 edits to one table at the same time, exploiting the database server optimisations for a single transaction or statement doing multiple updates, then moving on to the next table. More efficient ways of operating like that are perhaps better than running client-side bots at higher speeds. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 06:51, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They were set based on painful experience with bots crawling too fast and overloading the site and were orignally set before my time. Today, we see about one too-fast crawler every week or two. As the capability grows both the instantaneous capacity to handle things and the number of cralwers and pages to be crawled rise, so it's tough to get and stay ahead. One second is really too fast but we gamble on bots/crawlers not hitting too many costly pages at once. That generally works tolerably well. Yes, currently running bots are a factor but there are few enough bots and enough human convenience variations that per-bot limits and throttling based on response time seem likely to be reasonably sufficient for now. Figures for total load by bots v. humans aren't around. Editing is subtantially more costly than viewing but I've no really good data for you.

If I and the others dealing with load are in touch with those running high speed bots, we're better able to adjust things.

Haven't had to since they entered service, it's been full on. Given viable cross-project communications channels (and central and automatic bot settings for on/off and such) I'll do what I can to help high speed bots run quickly. But those things do need to be arranged. Frankly, as long as one human is considering each edit intreractively in real time, I doubt the technical team will notice the bot. Bulk data loads without live human interaction are more of a concern. I do expect/hope that MediaWiki 1.4 will cause many more queries to leave the master server and be made on the slaves. That will hopefully make that system far less sensitive than it is today. We're still in the process of moving from one server to master/slave write/read division and 1.4 should be a major step in that direction. Today the master sees a far higher proportion of total site reads than it should and the stress is showing. Just part of moving from three servers this time last year to 30 this year, and redesigning and reworking to handle the load. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 07:18, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

As with most of these proposals, if they are listed as guidelines, I would be fine with that. If they are listed as strict rules, I will not support them.

<dd>It would be nice if all users backed off at high load. Since bots do more work per person, as a whole, the bot operators are a group which needs to be more aware than the general community. The actual behavior of users is often to keep retrying, piling on more and more load. It's pretty routine for me to see many copies of the same slow search, for example. With load sharing, that can end up slowing down all of the database servers handling that wiki, as it's randomly sent to each of them on successive tries. So, people do need to be told to back off on error or slowness, because they don't normally do that. If you're willing, I'd be interested in a log of the errors you see with timestamps and a note of what you were doing. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 09:54, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My preferred backoff routine during normal operation is to take the response time of the last action and add double that amount to the next delay time (response time is time in addition to minimum delay). Before doing that, compare the response time to the delay time and if less then subtract 1 second and 10% of the previous delay time. If smaller than the minimum delay time, reset to minimum. This makes for a quick backoff and a slow return to faster action while only needing to remember the delay value and configured limits. When an error of any kind occurs, double the delay time. Have a maximum delay limit to avoid month-long delay times. Include a random factor to prevent synchronization problems. I've used such methods in other automation; I just started using Wiki bots and haven't implemented this algorithm yet here.

<p>One example of such an issue is the current space shortage on the primary database server, which may force us to switch to the secondary database server next weekend. While an extra 50,000 old article revisions may normally be OK, they aren't helpful when we're tring to avoid a forced move to a lower power, larger capacity, computer. This is a temporary situation: compression has left 40GB unusable due to fragmentation and new compression promises to free up a further 60-80GB and allow the existign 40GB to be made available, leaving about 100-120GB free of the 210GB capacity. But today we don't have that space available and won't until the comrpession has been fully tested and used on all wikis. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 04:51, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally I prefer reading combined bot edits - easier to check them all at once than individually and less work for the RC patrol people. However, that's personal preference. Onto the technical side. en Wikipedia old uncompressed is about 80GB. using bzip compression for individual articles takes that to 40GB (though that 40GB saved isn't yet free because of fragmentation). If the new compression which combies multiple revisions together works as well for en as it did for meta, that would fall to 15GB, of which about 25% is database overhead. About 19% of the uncompressed size. In development but not yet available is diff-based compression. ETA whenever it's done. That may be smaller but will probably be faster for the apache web servers than compression and decompression. This is for 7,673,690 old records, so each with the best compression we have available now is taking about 2k. Of that 2k, there are fields for the id (8 bytes), namespace (2 bytes), title (I forget, call it about 30 average), comment (call it about 50 average), user and text of user (about 20), two timestamps (28), minor edit flag (1), variable flags (about 4) plus some database record keeping (call it 16). Plus the article text. Eliminating all of the text, which we're planning to do by moving it to different database servers, once the programming for that has been done, and we're left with perhaps 160 bytes per revision for metadata. About 1.2GB of that when you have 7,673,690 records. And exponential growth with 8-12 week doubling time (but this may be worse). How long before that fills the 210GB on 6 of the 15,000 RPM 73GB $750 drives in the current master server? Quite a while - it's actually 28-29 doublings away. About 4 to 7 years away. Or it could be 20 if growth slows. Or longer. By which time we'll have more disk space (though it won't be plain drive arrays because in 29 doublings we'll either have stopped growing or split en across many different database servers or failed). Of course some things can't double that many times... but editing seems unlikely to stop even if the number of articles becomes stable, which is why old record growth is the one I watch most carefully. Of course, there are things to do about this and those are being investigated as well - like rewriting the code so en Wikipedia can be diced across multiple servers. Dicing en may be necessary in about 9 months because of the disk write rate, though again I've suggested things which can stretch that a bit. I've also been discussing introducing a feature to optionally automatically merge a minor edit by the same person with their previous edits, within a certain time threshold, keeping two recent changes records and only combining if the comments can be combined. This would get rid of the pretty common major edit/typo fix pattern. Now, nothing will break because of this. It'd just take more money raised to buy increasingly esoteric storage systems to keep the capacity and performance tolerable if nothing was changed. But since I have to think ahead, I'll take any edge I can get which might give more time for fund raising and coding to keep up with the growth rate. I'm contemplating suggesting $100,000 as the next quarterly fundraising target. We'll be spending the last of the $50,000 from the previous one in a few weeks, though there are some reserves available in a crunch. Please let me or any of the technical team know if you can think of better ways to do things (and if you can find the human time or money to get them done, that's even better!). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 14:37, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
