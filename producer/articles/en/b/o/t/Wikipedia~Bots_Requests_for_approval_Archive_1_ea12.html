<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tawkerbot</span></h2>
<p>Tawkerbot is a python wikipediabot from <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Using_the_python_wikipediabot" class="external free" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Using_the_python_wikipediabot" rel="nofollow">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Using_the_python_wikipediabot</a>. It will be running subst: on a list of userpages that I have created and checked that have templates without the subst tag.</p>
<p>I'm taking lists of user pages that have not used subst: on common warning templates and adding the subst in. I will be using a text file of configs.</p>
<p>= Config params given</p>
<p>As per the instructions, Tawkerbot will be run with the commands</p>
<p>python replace.py -file:articles_list.txt "{{test2}}" "{{subst:test2}}</p>
<p>with the articles_list.txt being a file created by myself and the template being the template that needs to be edited.</p>
<p>Sorry that I started running the bot, I misunderstood the bot procedures, thankfully I had 20 people on the IRC room trying to tell me I hard errored.</p>
<p>Update: Tawkerbot presently has an option for auto reverting the squidward mass vandal, I know it is a little step up from the reasons I applied for the flag however, I'm not expecting any complaints (nobody on IRC expressed any concerns besides the innocent page revert which I explained) so it is enabled in case squidward returns. Tawkerbot will only auto revert if one follows the exact conditions of the attack, it should be virtually impossible for an innocent edit to be caught by this process</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">LDBot</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../l/d/b/User%7ELDBot_2bf7.html" title="User:LDBot">LDBot</a> is a self named bot (<b>L</b>ight<b>d</b>arkness) which is to be created to do a few tasks. It is based off PHP and the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pywikipedia" class="extiw" title="m:Pywikipedia">Pywikipedia</a> framework. The purpose of the bot would be to maintain <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_non-admins_with_high_edit_counts_c29d.html" title="Wikipedia:List of non-admins with high edit counts">Wikipedia:List_of_non-admins_with_high_edit_counts</a>. The bot would check the edit counts via the toolserver of each user once a week (Spaced out in equal incriments, as to not cause stress on the server) and once every other day, update the counts at the previously mentioned page. The bot is being designed to make the stat tracking of that page automated, so it doesn't require user upkeep.</p>
<p>The Bot will not strain wikipedia servers at all. It will make no more than one request to the toolserver (or a wikimedia server) per hour, with updating to take place once every other day. If this behavior were to ever change, I would first bring it up here, or to AllyUnion to be sure that the bot is still within operating limits.</p>
<p>I've recieved the support of an active admin on that page, and another admin, which is why I've started development on this bot. Development will occur in my Usernamespace, and willnot edit the main page until the bot is approved, and testing is complete. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 03:09, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hvae you asked the people who run the tool servers if checking all edit counts once a week would stress their servers? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 09:35, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I haven't specificly asked, I just came to the conclusion that it was common sense because I know several users who check their edit count using Interiots tool several times PER hour. I'm also very certain that Interiot uses the SQL function COUNT() which reduces the amount of processing power, but I will ask Interiot and the other toolserver admins if indeed it will be no trouble. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 12:05, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A question, currently some users bold their user names, for <i>Users in bold have shown an interest in becoming admins.</i>. What do you think about this, will you add this feature.--<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 13:13, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course! Syntax for editing the users interest is as follows: "LDBot mod Lightdarkness &lt;bold&gt;" for making a user bold, if a user is not interested, you'd use the following: "LDBot mod Ugur_Basak (Not Interested) &lt;strikethrough&gt;" Where a comment is given within the parenthises, and the format type is given in &lt; &gt;. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 14:06, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This sort of thing would be much more efficient to implement on the toolserver itself (eg. a slight modification of <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/files/admin-counts/enwiki.html" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/files/admin-counts/enwiki.html" rel="nofollow">this SQL query</a>), and it would probably much less work to just pester someone who has a toolserver account than to write the code for the bot. Even better, <a href="http://www.wikisign.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.wikisign.org/" rel="nofollow">wikisign.org</a> has a database dump that's currently 10 days old, and you can run that query there. All that aside, a hit or three an hour isn't going to be noticable, but there may be better ways to do it. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 17:18, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The thing about it being on the toolserver though, is that users can't add their own comments on if they want to be an admin, no interest, links to previous nominations, ect. You do bring up a good point though, and I'll ask you about it on your talk page. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 21:36, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the thing is, the stats will be constantly updated over a period of time, I wouldn't think that one query per hour would be trouble, but I'm very open to ideas as far as what type of things toolserver access would attribute to this project. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 22:46, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would pretty much do the same thing, I'm just using my personal server to do all of the data processing, but with toolserver access I could just get the counts and update there, but I'm not sure the toolserver has access to a mysql database to <i>write</i> to (which I'm now using on mine for storage), but I'll look into it. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 03:12, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The database in the toolserver does not have write access to the Wikimedia databases, so I don't think that is possible. However, the same effect can be done by making the raw query in the toolserver (which is much less expensive than querying Kate's Tool or doing anything like that), and then have LDBot read the file and process it slightly for posting in the local Wikipedia page. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_edit_counters_Flcelloguy%27s_Tool_0e9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool">help us</a>)</sup> 05:50, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I knew that the toolserver can't write to the wikipedia database, but the way I'm storing all the edit counts is on my own database, once I query Interiots tool for them. This way, I can space them out rather than gathering all the data at runtime. Even if it were on the toolserver, being run all at once would probably take quite a bit of processing power, and I wouldn't want to disrupt the toolserver. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 05:55, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After re-reading all of the comments here, I thought I would just sum everything up. Interiot stated that 2-3 hits per hour wouldn't affect the toolserver, but suggests that there could be a better way of going about it. However, the current layout of <a href="../../../n/a/_/WP%7ENA_90a4.html" title="WP:NA">WP:NA</a> has a lot of information, regarding notes about users seeking adminship, links to previous noms, ect, that the toolserver cannot gather by doing a simple query. Which brings me to my conclusion. The concensus on the talk page of WP:NA suggests everyone is for the bot implimentation. Due to the limitations of the toolserver for this layout, I'll just be querying the toolserver once every hour for an updated editcount of the user whose editcount was updated the longest ago. Every night, my bot will grab commands from a specialized page in LDBot's usernamespace for commands to add, modify, delete users from the master list, and then LDBot will blank the page, signaling that the commands have been processed. Then, if any updates are required, LDBot will update the pages of the appropriate sections. I hope this wasn't too long, but this is the best way I can see doing it while automating the process and keeping the output the same. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 21:48, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would be simple enough to generate a report on the toolserver in a machine-readable format to provide this data; this could be kept up to date via a cron job; Interiot hinted above, I think, that he'd be willing to help with this.

<dd>Thanks Rob, I appreciate it. The bot is going to start it's trial run Friday evening. I'd also like to request one more thing from here. It's been noted that AFDBot hasn't been operational since mid-March, and AllyUnion hasn't been around to fix it. I've offered to write another feature for LDBot to update the AFD pages as appropriate. I've put a note about it on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WT%7EAFD_d7df.html" title="WT:AFD">WT:AFD</a>, and am waiting to see if there aren't any objections. If after 5 - 7 days there aren't any objections on that page, would anyone have a problem with LDBot taking over this task?

<p>Hello everybody! I would like your permission to run my little <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBot_e8e1.html" title="User:JoeBot">JoeBot</a>. It replaces common misspelled words, like 'begining' (beginning). I sort of started doing it on my own account and then realized that if I wanted to continue doing it I would need a bot account because of the sheer massive amount of these misspellings. So here I am! Wikipedia is getting so large that little mistakes fall through the cracks, and I'd like JoeBot to be able to be there to catch em'.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bobblebot</span></h2>
<p>I would like to use a bot to delink date links.</p>
<p>The task is to reduce linking of solitary months, solitary years, etc in accordance with the Manual of style. It will not delink date links used for date preference. Each edit will be checked visually.</p>
<p>For example <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Algeria_10e4.html" title="Economy of Algeria">Economy of Algeria</a> has many solitary year links, including 14 to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. The policy and popular misunderstandings are explained at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Date_formatting" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Date_formatting</a></li>

</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The short-lived ABC Cable News began in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>; unable to compete with <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>, it shut down in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. Undaunted, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> ABC launched a news channel called <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_News_Now_a8e2.html" title="ABC News Now">ABC News Now</a>.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>will become:</p>

<p>Several editors were using Martin's excellent <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_c07e.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser">AutoWikiBrowser</a> to do this task. That was a good solution that just got better and better. The shared experience of many users produced a 'whole is greater than the sum' process of logic improvements. I would be more than happy to share or give away the date delinking task to AutoWikiBrowser if it is permitted to do it.</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b>, Bobblewik has said in the past that he checks each edit yet his talk page has plenty of examples of where he has clearly not taken enough care to check that his bot script has not done something silly. I don't believe this will be any different. I am also opposed in principle to using bots to "improve" articles. Articles are organic things and rigid scripts rarely help. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 19:54, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have no problem remove 13 links to 2004 in the first example but do not agree that the links are irrelevant in the second example.

<li><b>Support/Oppose</b>. Bobblewik's edits are manually checked, therefore they are at most robot assisted. Since we are all fallible, there is no reason these edits should not show on recent changes so a <i>bot-flag</i> should not be granted. Bobblewick is restricting his changes to 2 per minute - slower than some of his critics. If giving him bot-status will allow him to continue editing, then I support his request. If on the other hand, he should be permitted to edit at two changes per minute (or a faster rate) in any case, then I would oppose the bot status, and say let him get on with the editing. If someone has a problem with any of his edits, they can discuss them or revert them individually, and follow the normal dispute resolution procedure if that doesn't work. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 21:17 <a href="../../../2/5/_/25_February_9b7d.html" title="25 February">25 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Support</b> - All Bobblewik is trying to do is conform to policy, which is a noble goal. We should be thankful we have someone who is willing to do this nitty gritty work; I certainly don't enjoy going through hundreds of pages and doing it manually. Even though he is going AWB-assisted, it is manual in the end, so kudos to him. As an answer to someone who said he shouldn't get the bot flag because these are manual: he's had people repeatedly blocking him because he's "editing too fast" for a non-bot.

<li><b>Oppose</b>, because I'm not so sure that all the changes being made are positive.

<dd>Although I support this bot, Robth's example is a good one. It might be advisable for Bobblewik to concentrate on more recent dates, post-1800 or post-1900, say. Such date links are much less likely to be useful, and earlier ones may be useful. Of course, any cut-off point is arbitrary, and may lead to strange results if applied strictly, so I would make this a recommendation rather than a condition. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephen_Turner_5111.html" title="User talk:Stephen Turner">Talk</a>) 09:15, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Support</b> - removing the "sea of blue" is certainly helpful, and, as far as I am aware, in line with the MoS and consensus more generally. Why should every year in every article be linked? It helps no one. Yes, he makes mistakes; but, in my experience, his improving edits massively outnumber any unhelpful ones.

<li><b>Strong support</b> The overlinking is pointless, and that it goes uncorrected perpetuates it, I know I started linking dates for no reason other than I saw it was being done, and assumed it was wiki policy, it was only in seeing bobble's edits that I then bothered to look at the actual MoS to see that I was wrong. Correcting the overlinking will help unclutter pages and make new users aware of what the MoS actually says regarding wikifying dates. Gheorghe Zamfir 10:50, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>.

<dd>I didn't want to get into point/counterpoint here, but I don't think it is fair to say that people's voting rationale is "invalid". Bobblewik's made this claim from the word go, yet even a cursory look at his talk page shows numerous examples of where he hasn't bothered to check his edits, leaving his mistakes in place - and this isn't just the case with his date modifications. Astonishingly he's even left mistakes in a section barely a few sentences long.

<dd>Wikipedia on the whole operates by consensus, not by voting.

<dd>A bot can't distinguish between when it should or shouldnt be linked, it needs a human to watch over it. Plus it's pretty damn easy to do with the AWB! <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 14:14, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is rarely, if ever, a valid reason to link to a year article when other date elements are not present, so removing such links (with proper edit summeries) is IMO one of the safest possible editing tasks for an automated or semi-automated process. Detecting the presence of other adjacent date elemetes (and they must be adjacent dor the link to function as a date preference mechanism, normally the only valid reason for the link) is pretty purely mechanical. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:30, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I confess myself guilty of overlinking until recently. I'd vote support provided the solitary birth and death years linked at biographical articles stay like that. I'd like to see someone change solitary year links to more contextually relevant ones (for example, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">2005 in film</a> in movie/actor articles) rather than simply removing all links; that's what the policy aims at. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li>Though I support the discussion of the issue in the Manual of Style, I'm not sure what "harm" comes from linking dates or how it "degrades" Wikipedia. Sometimes it's sort of interesting to be one click away from what else happened in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1755.html" title="1755">1755</a>, even if the relevance to the article is not immediately apparent.

<li><b>Limited Support</b> I agree, lots of date links are really of little value. But it seems to me there is a value in having the ability to see what else happened on that date (or in that year) in history. This is more interesting for the more historical (older) years than more recent ones (say pre-1950) and for events of at least some significance - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 20:28, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. This needs to be done by hand. Removing linked dates makes it difficult to organise articles per "x in music". I fail to see the long-term use for this bot.

<li>One reason (as eluded to by <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">J. D. Redding</a> above) to link to years is that is provides landmarks in a history article. For example, if you are reading History of Australia but are interested in events of the 1850s, the blue linked dates are easy to see (Note: it is not my personal belief that date linking should be used, so so get cranky at me about it).--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 01:20, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Now that I check the Manual of Style, it does not use spaces. So the criticism of making edits in accordance with the Manual of Style does not seem fair. If the Manual of Style needs changing, then we can change it easily enough. There are plenty of changes I would like in it.

<dd>I think you are reinforcing my thoughts that this is an issue for the Manual of Style. Dates in captions are not mentioned in the Manual. If you think they must be linked, then it is easy enough to add that to the Manual. As far as 'no human would delink them' is concerned, I have delinked plenty and I am a human (despite occasional accusations to the contrary). We should be debating these points of style in talk:Manual of Style, not here. I am not targetting you, but a lot of the discussion on this page has been people disagreeing with the content of the current Manual of Style. A bot proposal should be criticised on its merits, not on the basis that the Manual of Style that it follows is inadequate. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 19:26, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The links are of course useful so you can then go and find out what else happened in that year in question, in the same manner you would click on the link to the Prime Minister's article page to find out more about the Prime Minister. It is clearly better to have more links in an article than less, because it gives people ease in browsing to related articles.

<li><b>Strong oppose</b>. Style issues should be handled on a discretionary article-by-article basis, as a matter of editor judgement, rather than something cranked out by an automatic bot. More importantly, the Manual of Style is not absolute gospel, and personally I think date links are useful for cross-indexing of information by chronology. If you look at it from the perspective that date links do no harm, and clearly show some merit for finding information about dates specified in the article, I cannot see merit in a bot for the purpose. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 00:27, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. There is a contention here that date link clutter is harmful. If so, it is a very marginal harm. On the other hand they do provide an article with context, even if that is a very marginal benefit.

In the example of 14 instances of links to "2004" in a single article, delinking 13 of them with the assistance of a semiautomatic bot (requiring human intervention) seems to be a good thing. However, instead of eliminating the first occurence of the link to a year, I have often found it more useful to change the link to something more relevelant to the article such as [[2004 in music|2004]], [[2004 in sports|2004]] or [[2004 in books|2004]]. A bot could not do that (at least not without some level of AI) and I would rather leave the link for a human to fix in the future if the person manning the AutoWikiBrowser doesn't take the time to do so. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 01:07, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Removing multiple date links is a good thing, but in general I agree with the opinions expressed above that year links provide a valuable tool for investigating context in articles on historical matters. When making such edits, it is very necessary to see the layout of the article as a whole, and I suspect that a bot-assisted mechanism would not provide the detail. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">User:Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 20:41, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Can I have a bot-flag for <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmackBot_cc7a.html" title="User:SmackBot">User:SmackBot</a> to allow me to edit very quickly without cluttering "recent changes".

<dd>Well I was pluralising the "External links" header in articles with more than one external link. I have paused (or slowed to a crawl), because a user found it inconvenient when doing recent change patrol. There are currently about 7-8000 articles still to do. I would only use SmackBot account for manual edits, until further request (I.E. I am not requesting to run a bot at the moment). I would also restrict it to very simple edits, because they are the only ones that can be performed at high speed, the slightest complexity means careful checking is required, therefore recent changes is not cluttered, therefore no bot flag is needed and I would use my main account.

<p>I would like approval to run my new <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchlistBot_8f1f.html" title="User:WatchlistBot">WatchlistBot</a>. Its purpose is to create/update a project watchlist by finding all articles which include a specific template. More details, including links to the relevant pages for the Numismatics project are at the bot user page.</p>
<ul>
<li>the bot is not manually assisted (at this time -- if I expand it, it probably will be)</li>
<li>I plan to run it every few days, perhaps once a week. Definitely no more often than once a day.</li>
<li>It is written in Python, with pywikipedia</li>
<li>I have been manually updating the project watchlist for the numismatics project, and there's some copying and pasting involved. It's a bit of a pain. I'd also like to offer the bot to other projects (the idea came from WikiProject Hawaii). Although this is not a significant task, it's also relatively safe because only one page per project is edited. In the future, I'd like to expand the bot to tag the articles in a project (by traversing the directory hierarchy). This would involve editing article talk pages, but is very difficult to keep up with without a bot. <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMom2jandk_49c0.html" title="User:Mom2jandk">Ingrid</a> 00:00, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An interesting idea which I hadn't considered before. However, the Template is linked on the talk page, and the formatted list contains both the talk page and the article. I think that makes it unworkable, but in case you have another idea I didn't think of, there are other issues I've thought of. These lists can be pretty long (the numismatics project currently has about 1200 articles/categories/templates/project pages, so the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Numismatics_Articles_c2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Numismatics/Articles">list</a> has about 2400 entries), and I think there are server issues with categories since they update dynamically (although I am certainly no expert on that). Finally, the template is already on most of the pages it needs to be on, and I think there are delays with categories being added to articles through templates unless the article is edited. <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMom2jandk_49c0.html" title="User:Mom2jandk">Ingrid</a> 16:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm working on the code to tag articles (and categories). This means editing the talk page to put {{<a href="../../../n/u/m/Template%7ENumismaticnotice_d2b0.html" title="Template:Numismaticnotice">Numismaticnotice</a>}} at the top, if it's not already there.

<dd>Testing has gone well, and I'm ready to apply for a bot flag. Any objections?

<p>I've been running a manually assisted bot on the English wikipedia for the last couple of months under my normal user account. It does spelling and punctuation fixes; HTML entity conversion; URL tidying and other miscellanea (I used it to bulk convert a bunch of TinyURLs recently, for example). I manually inspect every edit before submitting it.</p>
<p>It's been brought to my attention that I should really be doing this from an account with the bot flag enabled, so I've created a new account for this purpose. The bot has been fairly heavily tested at this point (the best part of 30,000 edits) and should be fairly safe by now. I'd like to get bot-status for this account if I may.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The problem</span></h3>
<p>It is usually good to give for a vandal a warning, adding one of the standard warning templates to the talk page (vandals then frequently stop they activity without blocking). However if the vandal uses the anonymous IP, another user (not vandal) may later see that warning, being unpleasantly surprised. In Lithuanian Wikipedia there was a discussion that the person who left the warning to the anonymous user should delete it after several days, but remembering IP's and removing warnings manually takes too much time. Also, the page with 20 previous warnings and the new warning at the bottom may be less impressive to a vandal. From the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_troll_2a9e.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a troll">troll</a> concept, such page feeds the troll, as seems showing a lot of attention to vandal (multiple warnings, threats, sad words from the innocent users of that IP and so on).</p>
<p>There are talks on Wikipedia that the found vandal warning templates must be automatically substituted by they content, and there are some bots doing this. We think that there is no need to keep old warnings and old anonymous talk pages in general: the page can be just blanked instead, saving even more resources. The real discussions (not warnings) should go on the talk pages of the registered users, or on the article talk pages.</p>
<a name="The_solution" id="The_solution"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">The solution</span></h3>
<p>The proposed bot blanks the anonymous vandal IP talk pages that are older than 240 hours (since the last editing). It does not blank the normal user talk pages and also does not blank pages without the standard vandal warning templates.</p>
<p>This bot</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtains the list of IP pages where the vandal warning template is included (via "what links here"). We do not use the <i>subst:</i> in anonymous pages as they do not last longer than two days and vandal seems not deserving needed Vikipedia resources. There are anonymous IP talk pages with such unsubstituted templates in English Wikipedia also (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Vw&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Vw&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, for instance).</li>
<li>Checks the page name, it must be the anonymous user talk page (User talk:N.N.N.N).</li>
<li>If these two matches, checks the page history (visits the history page). The page must be older than 240 hours (10 days since the last editing session).</li>
<li>If all previous conditions are true, replaces the page content to empty, also explaining the action in the edit summary.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bot was tested in Lithuanian Wikipedia, first under strictly manual control and later in automated mode. It typically runs daily and just for several minutes. The program is written entirely in Java, without using any additional libraries.</p>
<p>The expected running frequency could be once a day, and (if required) it can be a limit of the deleted pages per session.</p>
<p>The bot could probably be useful for doing the same work in English Wikipedia. The bot operator is <a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudriusa_990c.html" title="User:Audriusa">Audriusa</a> 20:51, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> the possible misunderstandings can be easily explained by to anyone who accidentally gets one of these templates and indeed several templates are solely around to warn people of the possibility. There is also a great need for other users and admins to be able to see warnings left on people's pages so they can determine A) whether an {{<a href="../../../i/p/w/Template%7EIpwelcome_69f9.html" title="Template:Ipwelcome">ipwelcome</a>}} is warranted to welcome the person and/or whether the IP in question has a history of vandalism. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 19:39, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> While I accept Andriusa's good faith, my main problem with his rationale is that not all IP's are transient. Many IP's, probably most, are consistent vandals or non-vandals. For consistent vandals, warnings indicate their lack of innocence (first-time vandalism is presumed to be a test until warned) and lack of credibility on dubious edits. Conversely, for transient or shared IP's, my problem is that the bot is removing notices that IP's are AOL, for which warnings are pointless, as well as contact information about shared IP's at schools etc, sockpuppets, etc. <a href="../../../w/u/z/User%7EWuzzy_9768.html" title="User:Wuzzy">Wuzzy</a> 00:41, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. Some IPs are chronic vandals, and when I'm dealing with them it's very useful for me to be able to see that. When I'm going to an IP talk page to add a vandalism warning and I see that that IP has 20 previous warnings stretching back over six months, I handle it differently than if the IP has received one or no warnings. I'm sure that many other RC patrollers work in the same way. <a href="../../../h/b/a/User%7EHbackman_f74f.html" title="User:Hbackman">Hbackman</a> 01:03, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strongly Oppose</b> as per the above. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf-friend_659a.html" title="User:Elf-friend">Elf-friend</a> 07:09, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. Per above. Some IPs are static and therefore warnings should not be blanked. Anyway if no new warnings are added other users of that IP will not get 'new messages' so there isn't too much risk of them being coming across them. Editors can manually remove old warnings when adding new messages to an IP talk page if appropriate (what is appropriate depends a lot on the IP and therefore should be left to an editor not a bot to decide). In addition warning templates should be subst. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 09:50, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

The edits could also be reasonably spaced out in time. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 20:24, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed, as I've stated in other places on this page, even non-broken redirects should be fixed if they (while still being helpful), actually <b>exist to accommodate an incorrect usage</b>. An article writer's failure to capitalize "United States" or use the accent mark in "JonBenét Ramsey" or properly spell "Ashlee Simpson" (by mistakenly using the more common "Ashley") would fall into this category. Links to such redirects, being clear and present typos, should <b>always</b> be replaced with the correct link text, and never made into a piped link, (which, unfortunately in this case, is the default behavior for both solve_disambiguation.py and popups.js). — <small>Apr. 10, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[11:02] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt></p>

What would the bot do will be to create such "capitalization redirects" i.e. missing redirects where only capitalization changes from the real entry. (I didn't fix this particular instance so you would know what I'm talking about). -- <small>( <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini"><span style="cursor:crosshair;">drini's page</span></a> <a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini"><big><span style="cursor:crosshair;">☎</span></big></a> )</small> 17:40, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I created a user account, <a href="../../../z/s/i/User%7EZsinjBot_07a6.html" title="User:ZsinjBot">ZsinjBot</a>, that will be running solely via Martin's <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a>. The <i>only</i> thing it will do it subst out templates. The templates I currently have lined up are the vandalism warning templates (test, test1, test2, test3, and test4). I plan on starting with "test" as there are over 1500 un-subst-ed "test" templates. I have tested that it will do only this, as is evident in the short contributions I made with this account in the past few minutes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/ZsinjBot" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/ZsinjBot" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Currently, the timer is set for 30 seconds (to comply with the trial period), however due to page load times, it usually comes to about a 40 second delay. I welcome all comments and questions. I will publically announce everything the bot will do on both its user page after gaining concensus with peers to do so.</p>
<p>In the future, once all vandalism warning templates are subst-ed, I may expand to common misspellings, etc, however I have no intention of doing so at this time. --<font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../z/s/i/User%7EZsinj_4f9a.html" title="User:Zsinj">Zsinj</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../z/s/i/User_talk%7EZsinj_6340.html" title="User talk:Zsinj">Talk</a></sup></font> 01:48, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Addendum: I will only be running ZsinjBot when I have the time to commit to supervising it. If it is deemed appropriate and, most importantly, safe to do so, I would not mind running it for extended periods of time unsupervised (with a longer delay, of course).</p>
<p>2nd Addendum: Hm... I just read the three requests ahead of mine and it seems this is a very popular use for a bot. Whether or not ZsinjBot is granted a trial and/or the flag, keep in mind the uses of AWB and the fact that I would never do anything near controversial without consulting others, espically admins. --<font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../z/s/i/User%7EZsinj_4f9a.html" title="User:Zsinj">Zsinj</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../z/s/i/User_talk%7EZsinj_6340.html" title="User talk:Zsinj">Talk</a></sup></font> 01:54, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hence the reason I'm leaving it's possibilities open-ended. Disambiguation repair is a semi-automatic task that ZsinjBot can do a lot faster than I can by hand. Image tagging, such as where an image has a blank summary, is also something that can be done semi-automatically. New page patrol and stub sorting are other tasks I enjoy that ZsinjBot can assist with.

<dd>Just letting you know, I've added and tested a new functionality (which I will hold off on using until I get approval for it), whereby i give it the name of a user to approve for the .NET Bot Framework, and it parses the list of requests, removes the request, adds a note that it was approved, then moves it to the Approved page. It then adds the user to the announce-list, and leaves a message on their talk page. To see this in action, see the diffs for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Werdna648/.NET_Bot_Framework/Requests&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429761" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Werdna648/.NET_Bot_Framework/Requests&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429761" rel="nofollow">removing the request</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Werdna648/.NET_Bot_Framework/Requests/Approved&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429794" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Werdna648/.NET_Bot_Framework/Requests/Approved&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429794" rel="nofollow">listing that the request was approved, with a note that it was approved by the bot</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Werdna648/.NET_Bot_Framework/Announce-list&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429828" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Werdna648/.NET_Bot_Framework/Announce-list&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429828" rel="nofollow">adding the user to the announce-list</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Werdna648&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429852" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Werdna648&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429852" rel="nofollow">leaving a message</a>, and finally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Werdna648/Werdnabot/Log&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429911" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Werdna648/Werdnabot/Log&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47429911" rel="nofollow">logging its actions</a>.

<p>I am requesting that a bot flag be added to <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalmeBot_1500.html" title="User:DigitalmeBot">DigitalmeBot</a> so that I can use <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a>'s bot mode to assist with bypassing redirects as per <a href="../../../t/g/s/WP%7ETGS_438a.html" title="WP:TGS">WP:TGS</a>. This does not have to be permanent, as I have future bot plans for this account. I will, of course, request that the flag be removed before I write my new bot. I think that having this bot account will be beneficial to wikipedia because I will be able to help out with the very large task that <a href="../../../t/g/s/WP%7ETGS_438a.html" title="WP:TGS">WP:TGS</a> requires of bypassing the redirects.

<p>I've created <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshbot_4a6a.html" title="User:Ganeshbot">Ganeshbot</a> to create city/town articles in India based on on data provided by <a href="http://www.censusindia.net/results/admin.html" class="external text" title="http://www.censusindia.net/results/admin.html" rel="nofollow">Census India 2001</a>. I converted the data into a comma-seperated file. Bot will read the file line by line and create article stubs. Please see examples, Aadityana and <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshbot_sandbox_Testing_Aambaliyasan_0987.html" title="User:Ganeshbot/sandbox/Testing/Aambaliyasan">Aambaliyasan</a>, that I had created in the sandbox using the bot. It will be manually run by me. There are 5161 towns listed. <s>It should take a couple of hours to complete.</s> This is similar to the <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">User:Rambot</a> that created U.S city/town articles. Thanks, <font color="navy"><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshk_9519.html" title="User:Ganeshk">Ganeshk</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGaneshk_3d44.html" title="User talk:Ganeshk">talk</a>)</font> 08:33, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A few questions:
<ul>
<li>Do you have more information you can put into the articles besides the name and rough location? Part of the strength of the Rambot articles is the amount of information they contain: basic geography, a basic demographic profile, and frequently a map showing where the place is.</li>
<li>How fast is the bot editing? To keep from overloading the servers, bots shouldn't edit more than once every ten seconds. Creating 5161 articles should take at least 15 hours.</li>
</ul>

<dd>We should only be happy to have something like this, and eventually for all the countries in the world.

<p>How do you feel about exploiting <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographic_references.html" title="Geographic references">Geographic references</a> like Rambot, instead of adding the same reference to all the articles? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 21:52, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Please don't go ahead</b> Bot articles are horrible, especially the awful rambot ones about American localities. A couple of human-written sentences are always better and they will all get done in the end. I see huge long term problems with the rambot articles. They are going to get very out of date, but when new census data is ready how are they going to be updated, <i>especially</i> those where people have added proper content? Is is going to be wiped along with the old rambot bilge, or is the rambot data going to be left in place forever. Please be patient and wait for Wikipedia to be written by people not machines. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkestone_e60a.html" title="User:Hawkestone">Hawkestone</a> 23:03, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to disagree; having the stubs help greatly, I find the information generally useful, and I prefer to have machine-made articles than none at all. Many of the Rambot articles have since been improved, sometimes vastly so, by editors. Treat them as stubs. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 23:53, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The examples provided look pretty good, as for becoming out of date, this is applicable to all articles, regardless of how they were created. Creating the articles like this is good, as it provides a base for humans to build on and create much better articles, as is the case with many of the rambot articles. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 23:17, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should round to the nearest percent, rather than truncate (to avoid the gender proportions totaling to 99%). It should give the literacy rates for males and females, rather than the proportion of the literate people. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBentley_fb12.html" title="User:TimBentley">TimBentley</a> <a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETimBentley_65cf.html" title="User talk:TimBentley">(talk)</a> 19:21, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fixed the rounding issue. I rephrased the the literacy line. If you feel it still does not sound right, Could you please write the exact line how it should show using <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshbot_sandbox_Testing_Kodumudi_0ac7.html" title="User:Ganeshbot/sandbox/Testing/Kodumudi">Kodumudi</a> as an example.
