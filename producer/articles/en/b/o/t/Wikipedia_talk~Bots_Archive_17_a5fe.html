<dd>Please note that AWB works perfectly automatically, the problem is that SmackBot is doing things that should not be done automatically. The things he is doing are not built-in functions either. Also, the month de-linking business has been discussed at length already, I believe the outcome was not to de-link them, at least until there is a firmer policy. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 10:43, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>SmackBot would no longer run under "bot flag"</li>
<li>SmackBot activity (and all other use of AWB/semi-bots/bots by Rich Farmbrough) would be <b>suspended</b> until contentious issues have been cleared out.</li>

<dd>It's a nightmare having this in discussion in so many different places! This complaint has spilled into at least six pages, and while I want to deal with it properly it is being made very difficult.</dd>
<dd>William makes three complaints, two that have occurred on pages he is involved with and one he hunted down out of the logs.</dd>
<dd>He is absolutely right about the edits to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_all_two-letter_combinations.html" title="List of all two-letter combinations">List of all two-letter combinations</a> - they were wrong and should not have happened.</dd>
<dd>As he says I have ensured that they cannot happen again. Why were they allowed to happen in the first place? Because that page is pathalogical (in the mathematical sense, not the clinical), stuffed with self reference and arguably belongs on a different namespace.</dd>
<dd>The second complaint has some validity, on the other hand the utility of linking the word "may" to the month of May on List of three-letter English words is very dubious. I have changed it to link to <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="May (disambiguation)">May (disambiguation)</a>. This page is also very unusual, (not just for having survived a VfD despite a 31 to 16 vote to delete) and William spends a lot of effort reverting peoples changes to it, so perhaps that's why he's so unhappy about this particular edit.</dd>
<dd>The third problem appears to be a phantom. SmackBot changed [[constellation|constellations]] to [[constellation]]s, compare with "When forming plurals, do so thus: [[language]]s. This is clearer to read in wiki form than [[language|languages]]" from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html#Form" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Form</a>.</dd>
<dd>I am always prepared to try to improve, and welcome helpful criticism of my edits by anyone, so I hope we can resolve this quickly and move forward. However I do understand people's concern about bots in general, and to this end I have added a stop button to <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmackBot_cc7a.html" title="User:SmackBot">User:SmackBot</a> which can be used by anyone, not just admins. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 18:48 <a href="../../../2/6/_/26_March_04e7.html" title="26 March">26 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

Modbot changes this to "annual, anal" due to a faulty replacement string, which has been fixed since. I usually revert the modbot version to the one before it to offset the faulty edit. Then before I catch the mistake (when it's pointed out on my talk page), FS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emperor&amp;diff=45407445&amp;oldid=45370663" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emperor&amp;diff=45407445&amp;oldid=45370663" rel="nofollow">changes</a> it to read, "Pedro II Emperor of Brazil in <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regalia.html" title="Regalia">regalia</a> at the opening of the General Assembly." Afterwards, not looking at the edit history, I simply revert to before the modbot edit, back to "Pedro II of Brazil on an anual opening of the Congress." I apologize for the hasty revert, but the bot has done nothing but correct common misspellings. The bug in question has since been fixed, and since the week has been a trial run for the bot, I've rigorously monitored every change, but unfortunately I let this one pass by. The week period for the bot will expire on the 26th, after which I'll let it go unmonitored. <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModulatum_dd33.html" title="User:Modulatum"><font size="1" face="verdana">MOD</font></a> 23:41, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, as I said at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html#Modulatumbot" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approvals#Modulatumbot</a>, you're clueless about wikisyntax for images (ergo, the bot cannot be programmed to be less clueless about it). I never <i>changed</i> the visible image caption. Before, during and after your and my bot and manual operations the caption of the image in question continued to be read as "Pedro II Emperor of Brazil in <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regalia.html" title="Regalia">regalia</a> at the opening of the General Assembly (oil painting by Pedro Américo)." You didn't know (and still don't appear to know) that the part of the text you messed with was never visible, so the only logical thing to do with it (and that <i>would</i> have been a nice job for a bot while tedious for humans) is to remove the first string that has no function whatsoever.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New approvals procedure</span></h2>
<p>The current approvals system is ambiguous - you wait a week and if there are no complaints you proceed with a 1 week trial - but what if no one saw the request for approval? A dodgy bot would still get approval to run. A steward has also complained about the clarity of approvals (see <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_3fac.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Requests for approvals">here</a>).</p>
<p>The new system will be similar, but approval will come from a core group of experienced Wikipedians. You will submit your request as usual. After a week a member of the approvals group will allow or deny the request, looking at discussion etc.</p>
<p>Then the one week trial will occur. After the trial a member of the approvals group will allow or deny the bot (a bot flag can be applied for after this second approval).</p>
<p>A core group of experienced Wikipedians has been selected: <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Approvals_group_b61c.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Approvals group">Wikipedia:Bots/Approvals group</a>.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 02:24, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Complaints procedure</span></h2>
<p>The complaints procedure is also ambiguous. At the moment, if you have a complaint about a bot during its one week trial you mention it in the application at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals</a>, that seems fine. But what to do if you have a complaint about an established bot?</p>
<p>Minor complaints can be placed on the operators talk page. However, occasionally, a series of complaints will arise and editors become anxious and want to report it. What is the correct procedure? Options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave a brief note at <a href="../../../b/o/t/WT%7EBOTS_bb56.html" title="WT:BOTS">WT:BOTS</a> and continue discussion at the operators talk page</li>
<li>Have the entire discussion at <a href="../../../b/o/t/WT%7EBOTS_bb56.html" title="WT:BOTS">WT:BOTS</a></li>
<li>Have the entire discussion at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals</a> (not sure if that's a good idea, since it's for new requests)</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">Administrators noticeboard</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">Request for comment</a> are places where discussion can occur about a bot.</p>
<p>Personally, I think option number one is ok, and would like to introduce it to the main project page: <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOTS_070f.html" title="WP:BOTS">WP:BOTS</a>.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 17:38, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with option number one, it has sufficient visibility, and if there's a mega problem will reach the audience who can best deal with it. Should we call it something more inviting, people might not want to "complain"? <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 23:24 <a href="../../../2/7/_/27_March_06c1.html" title="27 March">27 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I'm sure people in the approvals group will be watching this page, and anyway they aren't required in dealing with problems. Various emergency shut off buttons exist. Some point to the block page, others (eg SmackBot) lead to the talk page. Some bots have the feature where a note on the talk page will stop operation. I think it is something to consider encouraging, but it is not perfect - for example with Orphanbot the talk page was abused and bot struggled to get any work done.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 20:13, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rolling several changes into one</span></h2>
<p>I have seen divided opinion on this. Some watchers feel that small edits should be avoided, because they needlessly clutter watch lists. Some editors would prefer them broken out so that they can be selectively rolled back. Personally I have no preference, but perhaps this could be a guideline [if there is strong consensus]. Or perhaps we should simply put it on WP:Bots to make operators aware of the issue, and non-operators aware that they are aware. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 18:30 <a href="../../../2/8/_/28_March_a606.html" title="28 March">28 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</p>

<p>I think de-flagging won't be neccessary, I agree to not use the bot (the account is blocked anyway) until the situation clarify. So what am I supposed to do now?

<dd>You're supposed to <i>read</i> <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html#Current_policy_on_running_bots" title="Wikipedia:Bots">wikipedia:bots#Current policy on running bots</a> and apply it (that's not something we can do in your place);</dd>
<dd>Further, if <i>reading</i> current policy, you'll see it will be necessary to first de-flag PorthosBot (and I'd advise you to request de-flagging at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_bot_status#Removal_of_bot_status" class="extiw" title="m:Requests_for_bot_status">m:Requests for bot status#Removal of bot status</a> yourself, that'll be the quickest procedure): If PorthosBot is not de-flagged, it will stay blocked; if it stays blocked, it can't test-run, which is necessary to get an approval to flag it...</dd>
<dd>So, as far as I understand, de-flagging is the first step, and you can do what is necessary for placing that request in the appropriate place. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 12:13, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't know where else to bring this up. He's running something claiming to be AWB, but it's doing rather a lot of annoying things that I've never seen AWB do before.... And he's running at a very high rate of speed.</p>
<p>He's changing ordinal numbers like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aurora&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48344649" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aurora&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48344649" rel="nofollow">"18th century" to "eighteenth century"</a>. There is no consensus to do this.</p>
<p>He's changing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lorton%2C_Nebraska&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48344473" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lorton%2C_Nebraska&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=48344473" rel="nofollow">location links</a>, in this case adding complexity by splitting the county and state (and ending the sentence with "U.S.." -- two dots -- nobody actually previewing their edits before commit would make such a mistake.) Egregiously contrary to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html#Context" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Context</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Links should use the most precise target that arises in the context, even where that is merely a simple redirect to a less specific page title. Don't use a <a href="../../../p/i/p/Wikipedia%7EPiped_link_ad60.html" title="Wikipedia:Piped link">piped link</a> to avoid otherwise legitimate redirect targets that fit well within the scope of the text. ... For example, link to "<a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome%2C_Italy_51f8.html" title="Rome, Italy">Rome, Italy</a>" rather than "[[Rome, Italy|Rome]], [[Italy]]", and "<a href="../../../v/8/_/V8_engine.html" title="V8 engine">V8 engine</a>" rather than "<a href="../../../v/8/_/V8.html" title="V8">V8</a> engine".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most mysteriously, he's changing [[square kilometer|km²]] to [[km²]]? That's particularly odd, since usually I'm complaining about AWB bypassing redirects for no reason, here he's eliminating the bypass (the article is at <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_kilometer.html" title="Square kilometer">square kilometer</a>). Why?</p>
<p>In this example, he's hit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lorton%2C_Nebraska&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lorton%2C_Nebraska&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">same article</a> with Smackbot 3 times in the past month, and some of the changes this weekend were to the same sentences as the previous hits. How does this improve the *pedia? How does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060414&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Rich_Farmbrough" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060414&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Rich_Farmbrough" rel="nofollow">hundreds (sometimes thousands) of these per day</a> all weekend long improve the *pedia?</p>

<dd>Ummm, I am the "original author", I never included any options without testing, and there were never any disasters, I do remember you making some bizarre claims though, which a number of people tried to correct you on. This is not the first time you have made allegations that are just based on fantasy.

<dd>Thanks Sean. William, there is an option in the program that I was asked to implement that removes excess date links (I didnt even make the logic behind it), users have to conciously turn this option on for it to work.

<dd>So, "bizarre", "fantasy", "slanderous" -- your retorts to documented problems. And now we learn that AWB <b>does</b> run unattended without review of edits, and obviously isn't carefully tested programming. You've been lying to me (and everybody) all along. As I suggested more than 4 months ago, AWB should be throttled back to 30 seconds per edit for every edit on a page (3 lines changed count as 3 edits), and carefully audited before ever allowed to run again!

<dd>Yes, automatic bots are allowed on wikipedia, <i>AWB can only be run on automatic mode with an account that is registered as a bot</i>, plus this feature is relatively new, and certainly was released well after the above conversation. And, once again, it has been tested well, and there have never been any serious problems. The edits you suppose are somehow breaking articles are not, you disagree with it, but that is all, and the date de-linking issue is seperate from AWB, and has now (thankfully) been mostly resolved. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 08:53, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is clearly stated on the guidelines for using AWB and for reporting people who abuse AWB that the issue is with them so if he's abusing it as you say then put a note on AN to that extent or go through the dispute resolution process if it's something you two are disputing but there's no purpose to repeatedly bringing it up here and ranting about the evils of AWB. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 07:30, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is rather disruptive, and certainly the old versions should be restored as soon as possible (I will restore them once I post this). The approvals group was set up with the consultation of many experienced users, indeed discussion occurred <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html#New_approvals_procedure" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">above</a> - where no objections (including from yourself) were raised. It helps operators and the project to know that someone has investigated a bot before it runs/is flagged. The people is the group are trusted, they understand consensus and that is how they will act. There is just as much input - everyone is free to comment on bot applications. The old system was Ally Union approving each and every bot request. He has not been around recently, so the existing system was modified. It works well, so what is the problem? --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 01:12, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, not sour grapes, though part of this is the fact that the approvals group is acting cabalistic but there's also the fact that there is absolutely no consensus for it.

<li>The group who enacted it were those who monitor the bot procedures on a regular basis</li>
<li>Sometimes things don't scale, and sometimes we need to consider common sense; a bot that's running out of control or running without our knowledge <i>could</i> cause some serious damage before it was noticed</li>
<li>There was no intention for any hint of cabalism; care to elaborate?</li>
<li>Consensus doesn't need to be large, nor does it need to have a poll or be heralded with banners and announcements. You demonstrated opposition to what was previously an unchallenged way of doing things; now we're pausing to hear you out.</li>

<dd><i>Who gave you guys authority on whether or not to make a sound judgement call about whether or not a bot is harmful?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The initial group was comprised of people who are all experienced bot operators, or who have a strong technical background. The former are expected to be able to gauge the effects of a bot running automated edits on the site (having had to do so in the past for their own bots); the latter are expected to be able to have some input and advice with respect to the site.</p>
<p>As to the who; see the point below.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...it was a consensus of 10 or less people, which doesn't count for shit around here</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That all depends on the scope. Consensus, I take to mean; "what people seem to agree upon." First of all; I don't think it would have been prudent to involve every single user, since this only affected a small group of people. Second; until now, when you announced your dissent, there <i>was</i> a consensus between the people whom the procedure affected.</p>
<p>I'd like to point out, and no doubt be bitten for doing so; that there are some things consensus shouldn't or can't determine. There are those items that affect us from above, and there are those which, through common sense, we can see need to be controlled. A bot, running out of control, or without the knowledge of someone, could cause a considerable amount of damage before it was spotted, depending upon the task and the locus of the edits.</p>
<p>I'd like to think it was obvious that a group of people exercising common sense are not deliberately harming the project, nor are they deliberately trying to be awkward or arrogant. They're simply aware of the number of hours of work that have gone into what we have in the main namespace so far, and they're trying to protect it from clueless idiots running programs, to state an extreme example. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">talk</a>) 17:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Hmmm</span></h3>
<p>WHile I agree with Pegasus that the approvals group is arbitrary, virtually self appointed, and has only lack of complaint rather than consensus, I had noticed, (at least a year, possibely longer ago) that the previous versions were also somewhat self proclaimed. And certainly the idea that anyone can black-ball a proposal is not good. I think that things have changed in the following ways since the original policies were set up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Far bigger WP</li>
<li>Far more bots, editors, vandals and reverters.</li>
<li>Far more semi-automated processes.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the potential problems posed by bots and automation have changed in priority. I see these as</p>
<ol>
<li>Runaway bot syndrome
<dl>
<dd>What everyone feared to start with. But bots are blockable, and revertable, so not a huge problem. Also contrary to expectations, one of the advantages of true bots is that they can run slowly, because they are not consuming valuable human time. Perhaps we should have a revert bot or bots standing by in case of major problems. In general I think we need to be more permissive with bots - they can take a massive editing effort away from trivial tasks. We could also perhaps try to develop some bot standards - not prescriptive one, but useful ones, like a shared format for article whitelists (i.e. those that legitimately include a solecism).</dd>

<li>Clogged Recent Changes
<dl>
<dd>To some extent dealt with by bot-flags, also by the vast increase in human editing.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Clogged watchlist

<p><a name="Flagging" id="Flagging"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Flagging</span></h2>
<p>As some of you may know, bot flagging (and deflagging) is now the responsibility of the local bureaucrats. Previously, requests for flags were made on Meta, with a link back to the relevant discussion here. Given that there is a new process in place for approving bots, I'd like to request those making the approved/denied calls (the approvals group or whomever is in charge) to place requests for flagging/deflagging on an easy to access and universally used page, to make it easy for those of us responsible for setting the flags to see what needs to be done.</p>
<p>I suggest use of something along the lines of Wikipedia:Requested bot flags, which I've drafted up for this purpose. My basic idea is, requests will continue to take place on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals</a> just as they currently do. When a request has been approved, a member of the approvals group will list it on Wikipedia:Requested bot flags under "Approved bots requiring a flag," and a bureaucrat will assign a flag. When a bot needs to be unflagged, a member of the approvals group will request deflagging in the "Bots requiring flag removal" section. This should provide minimal intrusion into the process by bureaucrats, not require too much extra effort on the part of the AG members, and will make sure that bureaucrats see the requests in a timely manner.</p>
<p>If others have better suggestions, feel free to amend or abolish as necessary. My only request (and I presume to speak for the other bureaucrats as well) is that there be a single, easy to identify place where legitimate requests to add or remove flags be placed, so we won't be put in the position of trying to locate approved requests and determine whether a bot should or should not be flagged. <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small><font color="#7B68EE">)</font> 15:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

Additionally, unless I've missed it, that log doesn't provide for us (bureaucrats) to remove entries as we perform them; I checked there and found one that was not complete, and two that were already complete. I don't have to check listusers to see if an RfA has already been closed, or if a username change has been performed; I'd like to have a convenient way of knowing what work still needs to be done. <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small><font color="#7B68EE">)</font> 16:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</font></font></dd>

Approval is needed for any bot to determine whether your bot is a resource hog or not, or whether your bot is necessary. The latter is in the event that someone feels it necessary to go around changing things like <b>color</b> to <b>colour</b> for all entries in the Wikipedia (or something similiar). A bot flag is treated as a flag of trust, much like a sysop flag. This flag is to be given to any bot that has been deemed reliably <b>safe</b> by members of the community. By safe, I mean that the user and the bot has been proven "harmless, useful, &amp; not a server hog." Any bot that is making very minor changes, like one that makes changes every so week or month or whatever, should not necessarily need a bot flag. However, the Python Wikipedia more or less requires a flag so it is better to obtain one. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:06, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</font></font></dd>
