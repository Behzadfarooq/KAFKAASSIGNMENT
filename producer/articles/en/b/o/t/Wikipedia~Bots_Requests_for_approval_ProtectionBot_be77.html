<p><b>Operator:</b> <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a></p>
<p><b>Automatic or Manually Assisted:</b> Automatic</p>
<p><b>Programming Language(s):</b> Python (partially dependant on pywikipedia, but mostly original code)</p>
<p><b>Function Summary:</b> Intended to automatically protect templates and images appearing on the main page or today's featured article, and unprotect them when they are no longer in these high profile locations. This bot will require sysop rights.</p>
<p><b>Edit period(s)</b> <i>(e.g. Continuous, daily, one time run)</i><b>:</b> Every 15 minutes</p>
<p><b>Edit rate requested:</b> N/A</p>
<p><b>Already has a bot flag</b> <i>(Y/N)</i><b>:</b> N</p>
<p><b>Function Details:</b> The bot reads <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_Page_Tomorrow_f3be.html" title="Main Page/Tomorrow">Main Page/Tomorrow</a>, identifies the current and immediate future featured articles, and then generates a list of all templates/images appearing on any of these four pages. The bot then checks each template and image to see whether it is protected (i.e. edit=sysop, move=sysop). If it is not protected, the bot will automatically protect the template/image, and add that item to an internal list. The bot will also check this internal list for items it has protected in the past but which are no longer in high profile locations and restore those items to their pre-existing state. It will not remove protection that had been added by someone else.</p>
<p>I have already written code capable of performing most (but not all) of the above functions, but I am coming here to get feedback from the community before carrying this project further. As noted above, this bot would require sysop rights in addition to ordinary bot approval. For an alternative but less extensive proposal, see: <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_Shadowbot2_6a5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Shadowbot2">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/Shadowbot2</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 11:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Addendum:</i> In order to protect images which come from Commons, I have added an ability to upload them to Wikipedia. When the local copy is no longer needed, I would have the bot tag them for speedy deletion. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 06:37, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To expand on this, I am proposing that the bot copy the image, image description, and any neccesary templates that exist on Commons but not locally. When the local copy was no longer needed, the image would be tagged for deletion. Any commons image templates would be left here since presumably they could be used for future images. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Addendum 2:</i> Per suggestion, it would also track images/templates used within <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template%7EDid_you_know_Next_update_0e08.html" title="Template:Did you know/Next update">Template:Did you know/Next update</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 10:46, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I now have an essentially fully functional code base, and have updated <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtectionBot_5543.html" title="User:ProtectionBot">User:ProtectionBot</a> to give more operational details. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 00:43, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Support</b> - <s>On AN you also mentioned protecting templates and images for the article of the day, but this is not specified above. That should be clarified.</s> (Misread section) I'm fine with the proposal so long as the article of the day page itself is not protected... the blurb about it on the main page and all templates/images displayed on it can be protected, but the article itself should be open to editing. Note that this might result in a vandal image being added to the page and then protected by this bot... but someone could then still revert to remove the image from the page itself. Also note that <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_Page_Tomorrow_f3be.html" title="Main Page/Tomorrow">Main Page/Tomorrow</a> duplicates all but four of the templates used on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> and thus it might be better to check some of those templates directly. Specifically, the other templates are the 'article of the day', 'picture of the day', and 'on this day' sections for the following day and <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template%7EDid_you_know_Next_update_0e08.html" title="Template:Did you know/Next update">Template:Did you know/Next update</a> in place of <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template%7EDid_you_know_2dd7.html" title="Template:Did you know">Template:Did you know</a>. The 'next update' page often gets updated several times per day and is currently accessible to non-admins and thus might not be appropriate to protect prior to be placed on the Main page. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - every 15 minutes is not good enough. That would give a vandal or an unauthorised (well, obviously it would be unauthorised!) vandal-bot 15 minutes to act first. Suggest changing to a lower but unspecified amount of time so that vandals are not aware of how long they have. Ideally, if possible, make it impossible to add unprotected images and templates to these sensitive areas. Can we also come up with a bot-assisted plan to deal with the template vandalism that was seen on 'today's featured article' for about a week, as that will surely return at some point unless it is dealt with now. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As described it would be looking at Main Page/Tomorrow and Tomorrow's Featured Article as well as the current ones, so predictable elements will be protected <i>before</i> they actually reach high profile status. The unpredictable elements (such as a news event causing a new image to appear on In The News) would be caught the next time the bot runs, but ideally should still be protected by the admin who added them. It has been the predictable elements that have been greatest sources of vandalism lately, and so that ought to be eliminated. I also plan to add random jitter to the bot execution times, so as to make it more difficult for anyone to race the bot. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 18:28, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, per the comment <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadowbot2_ce5b.html#Making_sure_the_admins_on_the_list_are_active_and_the_bot_is_working" title="User talk:Shadowbot2">here</a>, what are the mechanisms in place for alerting people as to whether the bot is working or not working. If the bot is approved and successful, people will gradually let the issue drift to the back of their minds and come to rely on the bot. How can we ensure that there is always someone watching the bot (more than one person and not just the person running the bot)? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:09, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Question:</b> Since the plan is for the bot to also protect images that appear on the main page, how will it deal with those from Commons? The current procedure is to upload a local copy here onto Wikipedia, tag it with {{<a href="../../../c/-/u/Template%7EC-uploaded_423e.html" title="Template:C-uploaded">C-uploaded</a>}}, and protect that. Protecting just the image description page here does not work because a vandal can simply log onto Commons using a sleeper account and save a new version of the image there. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 16:05, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><s>The code written so far would ignore images uploaded only to Commons</s>, but ultimately, the ideal behavior is probably to do what admins currently do and upload a copy locally for protection. This will take a bit of time to implement, but certainly seems doable. After it was no longer needed, I could have to bot tag the image for local deletion (I prefer doing that than having the bot actually delete the image, as an extra safeguard against rogue deletion behavior). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 18:28, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure I quite understand what you mean by "[the bot] would ignore images uploaded to Commons" - does that mean they would remain unprotected unless a (human) admin uploads and then protects the images? This would be a serious concern. <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 23:18, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I now have code prepared to automatically copy images over from Commons so that they can be protected locally. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 06:37, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for clarifying this! A few more questions/comments: would the bot be programmed to delete the image once it is off the Main Page? If there are prior revisions in the image description here (i.e. FA tagging) will the bot restore those revisions? In addition, does the bot also copy the image information (i.e. description and licensing information) from Commons? If it does, will it recognize when a template used on Commons isn't used here, leading to a red link? (In other words, Commons had a template that we didn't have; I've had to manually substitute the code on Commons, sometimes several times for templates within templates, copy the code here, and then revert myself on Commons.) Thanks! <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 03:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When the local image is no longer needed, it is programmed to add <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtectionBot_Delete_9650.html" title="User:ProtectionBot/Delete">a tag</a> that marks the image for speedy deletion and includes a reminder to the deleting admin to restore any pre-existing description page content after deleting the local copy. Given the unusual nature of this project, I felt it was prudent not to go handing direct deletion authority to a bot. <s>It does not copy the description from Commons but rather provides <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtectionBot_Uploaded_8e2a.html" title="User:ProtectionBot/Uploaded">a template</a> that points at the Commons description page, similar to {{<a href="../../../c/-/u/Template%7EC-uploaded_423e.html" title="Template:C-uploaded">c-uploaded</a>}}.</s> <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 04:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sigh. Have I complained recently about how the existence of Commons makes life here more difficult? Okay, I've modified the bot code to be able to copy over the Commons image descriptions (including duplicating any unique to Commons image tags). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Maybe leaving away all bot-features relating to images for a start? The images thing starts getting very complicated (just and idea, I'm not opposing anything).

<li><b>Comment</b> - I personally think that the templates and images on the main page need to be watched by more sets of <i>human</i> eyes. Historically, most of the disruption on the main page is caused by sysops making small changes without consensus and often introducing bad markup in the process. Every template and image on the main page should be checked by human eyes after <i>any</i> edit is made. I fear that adding a bot will reduce the amount of redundant checks on these pages and thus cause minor mistakes to stay up even longer. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 19:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to agree with the general sentiment of this comment; I'm always wary of entrusting a task to a bot without continuous human oversight. As pointed out above, there is no mechanism to ensure that admins are alerted if the bot is malfunctioning or stops working, and the results could prove disastrous. The current system works, and given the new system of checks with <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowbot2_2f8d.html" title="User:Shadowbot2">Shadowbot2</a>, I don't feel that there is an urgent need for the bot, especially with the (very real and plausible) chances of malfunction or stoppage.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If by some miracle the community emerges from its haze of ignorance and and actually permits this bot to acquire a sysop flag, then for god's sake use the precedent to get the same thing done with other bots that need it. There's a bloody <i>user javascript subpage</i> transcluded on to the Main Page because people refuse to give the FA-counting bot the necessary flag. In other words, they're happy to let it edit a template on the Main Page via some clumsy hack, but they won't sysop it so it can do so the normal way – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 20:23, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the concerns raised by people over an admin-bot were (and continue to be) valid, even though I don't necessarily agree with all of them; I also hope that following discussion here, any attempts to make the bot a sysop will go through the usual channel of <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">RfA</a>, which seems to be more appropriate (i.e. it's the place for <i>all</i> requests for admin rights, and would have a wider participation than here, on the bot request page.)

<li>No, the bot couldn't tell a vandalized image/template from a non-vandalized one... but should it need to? Think about the way it works. It would protect all 'daily' content on the main page (except 'In the news' and 'Did you know') starting at midnight the day BEFORE it went live. So maybe a vandal could sneak something in just before midnight and the first bot protection... causing the bot to then protect the vandalized material. However, that would then be visible for an entire day before it went live. There'd still be a need for 'human eyes', but we'd have a full day to catch vandalism before it was widely distributed. After midnight of the day before 'activation' the page would be 'safe' unless an admin vandalized or unprotected it... and even the latter would only last for a few minutes. The 'article of the day' would work the same way <i>except</i> that since that page itself would be unprotected someone could add a vandalized image or template to it... which the bot might then protect. However, the article would still not be protected and any other user could just revert/remove the call to the vandalized image or template. There <i>would</i> be 'vulnerabilities' if this proposal were implemented (including some I haven't mentioned to avoid educating the vandals), but they would be significantly less than those which exist now. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:44, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree. Unless the vandalism is very subtle or there are no admins looking (unlikely) then this is not really a problem. I just wanted to point out that part of the act of an admin protecting a template from vandalism (which is checking that the template is not <i>currently</i> vandalized) can't be replicated by a bot, so we still need some oversight. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 16:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though the chances of either an image or template being vandalised and then protected are slim, I've seen it happen before; vandals hit the images/templates scheduled to come up in a few days. Although rare, I've (luckily) caught this before, and although I'm also confident that (hopefully) an admin would catch this either before to or after the protection, I'm still hesitant with a bot doing this. (Note that vandals also adapt to our tactics; once they figured out what time the bot protects, they could easily do some damage if no one was watching the process.) Perhaps some checks could be implemented here, if possible?

<dl>
<dd>Unprotected templates and images are ending up on the main page because there are not enough admins to double check them everytime someone makes a change. It can happen when someone changes the image on <a href="../../../i/t/n/WP%7EITN_7166.html" title="WP:ITN">ITN</a> or <a href="../../../d/y/k/T%7EDYK_cb03.html" title="T:DYK">DYK</a> but forgets to protect it.

It can also occur when another unprotected template is placed onto one of the main page templates, such as when the unprotected <a href="../../../p/o/k/Template%7EPokenum_5cf7.html" title="Template:Pokenum">Template:Pokenum</a> was added to the <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_July_28%2C_2006_4cf5.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article/July 28, 2006">2006-07-28 TFA template</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_article/July_28%2C_2006&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66034252" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_article/July_28%2C_2006&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66034252" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 19:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To expand on what Zzyzx11 said, the biggest culprit recently appears to the be the rotating sections (e.g. <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_January_1%2C_2007_504b.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article/January 1, 2007">Wikipedia:Today's featured article/January 1, 2007</a>). These are individually dated and what appears on the main page is automatically changed when the date rolls over. The individual sections (and any images or templates they contain) are supposed to be protected before they appear on the main page and unprotected afterward, but because they change over automatically, they often get neglected. There have also been examples of unprotected images added to ITN, DYK, etc, but because these have to be added by hand, the admin who does so usually gets the protection right. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:13, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>2:As for the FA, if the challange is in having a hard time finding tempaltes that are subtranslcuded in the FA that have been vandalized, the bots programing could be used to make a talk page or subtalk page link of all transclusions and subtransclusions that could be searched by Related Changes, no? — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 18:40, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it could (though copying the edit page transclusion list to a talk subpage would accomplish the same thing), however given the low likelihood of needing to edit a template on a FA versus the high frequency with which they have been targetted, my preference would be just to the protect them all while the topic is front page featured. This would also ensure they get unprotected afterward, whereas right now templates that are protected because of an attack may remain protected for a long time unnecessarily. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:13, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe the big red block button should be adequate.

Even if removed from the FA (possibly by the vandal himself), it could be added to other (non protected) templates or pages. Yes these additions could all be reverted, but the simplest fix at the point of origin (blanking the vandal template) would not be accessible to non-admins. A little variation in the protection timing would help avoid this sort of exploit. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 17:39, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The template would only remain protected for as long as it was on the Main Page or the Featured Article page. At some point (less than half an hour I think) after it is taken off the page, ProtectionBot will unprotect the template again, and the vandal only has an unprotected template to play with, and anyone can blank it. If, as is likely, the vandal uses the template in the short interval when it is protected, an admin will be able to unprotect it and delete/fix it. I agree though that this is slightly worrying, as people will focus on the "ProtectionBot protected a vandalised template" bit, and not realise that human oversight is still very much needed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It unprotects it after two passes of finding a template it protected is no longer part of a featured article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - there is the point that we still need to <b>LOOK</b> at the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_Page_Tomorrow_f3be.html" title="Main Page/Tomorrow">Main_Page/Tomorrow</a> to pick up vandalism, in fact we need to do this more than ever before. If this works, people will get complacent and the inevitable result will be that a vandal slips something in just before protection takes place, the vandalism (possibly not very visible) remains undetected for a whole day, and then silently switches over on the main page, at which point all hell will break loose. Checking the 'tomorrow' version will also guard against various 'date template' vandalism possibilities. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:24, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've already run all the trials I feel are necessary short of full-scale deployment. You really want me to sit around generating lists to show that I know how to <a href="../../../d/f/b/User%7EDFBot_2770.html" title="User:DFBot">parse text</a>? That feels very much like a waste of time to me, and potentially hazardous as well if made public. The current and tomorrow's main page/featured article collectively contain 53 templates and 31 images. All 53 templates are already protected as are 20 of the 31 images. Of the 11 unprotected images (none on the main page currently, thankfully), 6 are local and 5 reside on commons. Parsing out the relevant bits is somewhere around step 2 in a 10 step process. You are welcome to review the code, as several other people have <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_de2f.html#ProtectionBot_Process" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval">volunteered to do</a>, but if we are going to have a trial I would ask that it be a full demonstration that it works, rather than making extra pointless work for me. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 06:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Some serious comments. I like the <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtectionBot_5543.html#Safety_value" title="User:ProtectionBot">safety valve</a> feature, but I wonder if there is a way to test that as well to make sure the "not editing for 90 minutes" thing does work? Also, is it possible to make clear to admins using the emergency shut-off button that they should follow-up and make sure that protection is dealt with by humans, rather then just walking away with a "bot's shut off now, everything should be OK now" shrug of the shoulders. That's the only thing I can think of at the moment. All looks really good! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:38, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The safety valve is controlled by MediaWiki itself through template syntax, so as long as it's tested once to make sure the math is right and it does kick in after 90 minutes, it should work the same every time. Also, blocking the bot would trigger said safety valve 90 minutes after the block; since the bot would theoretically have already handled the next day's protection, I think warning within 90 minutes should be plenty. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 17:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have begun running this on my admin account on a manual basis. In doing so I have identified several issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>A unicode handling bug in one part of the program that crashed it. This is now fixed.</li>
<li>A problem with dropped wikisession information. I suspect that this was caused by how Mediawiki handles sessions and a conflict with my trying to use my account at the same time the bot was running. If I am correct, this means that this bot <i>cannot</i> run on my account at the same time that I am using it, and consequently continuous operation absolutely requires a seperate account. I will be investigating this further.</li>
<li>A formatting issue wherein the bot converted a newline to a space. I haven't yet tracked down why this occured.
<dl>
<dd>The formatting issue should be resolved now (albeit with an ugly hack). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 04:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ol>
<p>The first two errors, being fatal, required me to do some substantial manual cleanup after the bot during this initial run. It has also suggested ways that I can improve the error handling which I intend to do now.

<dd>Thanks for the trial report. A comment: would it be possible for the bot to add the images it protects to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProtected_main_page_images_0596.html" title="Category:Protected main page images">Category:Protected main page images</a>? I'm not sure if the bot is actually copying the code from the template pages or taking the code from the source (I haven't gotten a chance to go through the code you sent me&#160;;-) ), so all I've done is place the templates themselves in the category. Or would a creation of a new category for images not on the Main Page but on the FA itself be more appropriate?

<p>(edit conflict) I have also discovered that the list of transcluded templates does not respond to action=purge and can at times be several hours out of date.

<p>I will be leaving the bot running while I go away for a bit. Since this is the first time it has been left running without myself directly in front of it, I thought I should let others know. It has been operating normally for quite a while now and I don't anticipate any problems, especially since there is little activity on the Main Page this time of day. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 07:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Today's midnight UTC changeover seems to have gone as expected. The bot failed to unprotect a couple images, but this was caused by missing log entries related to yesterday's bugs, and not any current problem in the bot. During the night it also served to protect and unprotect some changes that where made to the Did you know image. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the updates! Two minor requests: first, could you have your bot unprotect old selected anniveraries as well? The "tradition", per se, has always been to unprotect them when they are off the Main Page so that they can be updated accordingly (new events will be added, holidays that don't stay on the same day will need to be changed, etc.). I had to just manually unprotect the SA for January 6. Secondly, would you mind adding "BOT:...", like you have done with normal edits, to the protection log summary while the bot is running off of your account? This would make it a lot easier to look at the contributions, etc. Thanks a lot! <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 02:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I've noticed that some of those selected anniversaries have been protected a really long time as well. My thought on that had been that I would propose a seperate one-time run to clear all the really old protections some time after ProtectionBot was fully set up and deployed. On your second point, I can add "Bot:", but frankly it's already more than a little inconvenient as a developer/operator to have this running on my own account. I would much prefer to fully set up the seperate account as soon as possible, so that the bot's actions would be cleanly seperated from my own. See for reference <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Canvassing_for_bot_approval" title="WP:AN/I">this discussion</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Alternate_proposal" title="WP:AN/I">proposal at the end</a>.

<dd>Well, the second point isn't a large issue, now that the bot is undergoing the RfA now and would run from its own, bot-flagged, account. However, I would still prefer, if at all possible, for the bot to unprotect SAs as soon as they're off the Main Page, similar to how the bot would unprotect images/ tag images for deletion as soon as the images were off the Main Page. This would avoid having the protected SAs accumulate over time, and would also be a large convenience. Finally, it would leave the SAs open for editing, as they should be, the moment they are off the Main Page.

Cheers! —— <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101"><b>Eagle</b> 101</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">Need help?</a>)</sup> 02:16, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

As the RFA required to give this bot the sysop bit has been withdrawn by the operator, this bot can not function as designed. Due to the large size of this request, I'm closing it as a w/d. Should DF wish to due something else with this bot account, please start a new request. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
