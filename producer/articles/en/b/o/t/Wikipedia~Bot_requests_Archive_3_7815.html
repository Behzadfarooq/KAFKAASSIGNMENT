<p>Hi. I've noticed that a lot of pages are misusing HTML entities by not using the trailing semicolon. In some cases, this is accepted and rendered properly, but other cases not. This could be fixed by a pretty simple <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_expression.html" title="Regular expression">regex</a>:</p>
<pre>
s/&amp;sup2([^;]|$)/\&amp;sup2;\1/g
</pre>
<p>Example of pages where this is needed but still rendered properly: <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arches_National_Park_7fde.html" title="Arches National Park">Arches National Park</a>:</p>

119 mile&amp;sup2 or 76,519 acres (310 km&amp;sup2).

<p>This is actually very common for the older pages for Japanese towns (added by <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">User:TakuyaMurata</a>, his new additions are correct). I don't know squat about wikipedia bots, but I thought this might be a good thing to add to one of the existing bots that can do regexps. Comments? Thanks. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> 04:43, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds good to me. I have seen this myself in the past and have corrected it manually but this would be well suited for a bot. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWolf_0f32.html" title="User:RedWolf">RedWolf</a> 23:46, Aug 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinBot_f44e.html" title="User:KevinBot">KevinBot</a> can do this (when it gets done doing what it's doing now) but I would like to have a list of pages to edit (or at least be pointed to where I could get that list). KevinBot doesn't crawl (it can, but I'd rather not) but rather compiles lists of pages to check and then checks them. If you have a good idea of where to get a list of pages, let me know. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> 06:07, Aug 7, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure how to generate the list of pages. Perhaps from a download of the database and then a grep through the data or import it into MySQL and perform a query? The on-line search function doesn't help here since if one searches for "sup2" (to continue the example above), it will match every page where that entity is used, regardless of whether the trailing semicolon is there or not. Other ideas? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> 07:42, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've put up a list of pages (as of the 23rd Oct DB dump) containing the regex above at <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopbanana_Reports_This_article_contains_a_malformed_HTML_entity_b7a2.html" title="User:Topbanana/Reports/This article contains a malformed HTML entity">User:Topbanana/Reports/This article contains a malformed HTML entity</a>.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That regex would delete the character right after the entity. It needs a \1 at the end like <code>s/&amp;sup2([^;]|$)/\&amp;sup2;\1/g</code> <a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGoplat_aa2e.html" title="User:Goplat">Goplat</a> 21:01, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FWIW, I can add this to the list of automatic replacements that the rambot already does for the articles that it parses, so that will at least get over 95% of the U.S. city/county articles. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 04:22, Dec 24, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second that. In the particular case of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_asteroids_8bf3.html" title="Category:Lists of asteroids">Category:Lists of asteroids</a> pages, the bot would need to scan the table and compare the links in any given cell with those in the cell immediately above. If a link is repeated, the lower one should be de-linked. For this to work in one pass, note that the bot would need to scan the table from the bottom up. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids_%281-1000%29.html" title="List of asteroids (1-1000)">List of asteroids (1-1000)</a> for an example of the expected result. Note that some links will repeat within the page, but this seems a good compromise for user-friendliness.</dd>

<dd>I agree that this bot could be helpful. However, could it do a larger proximity check say 10 or 20 lines. Otherwise, if the link term alternated none of the links would be removed. In very long articles extra links may be justifed, say, one every screen. Also dates (both year and day) need to remain linked for the dynamic conversion user preference to operate. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 20:56, Sep 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having multiple links to the same target is often useful, but how is a bot to know that? I have no objection to human editors fixing pages where there are too many links to the same target, but I would strongly discourage the use of bots to do the same (except if the bot runs under careful human control, such that a human is making an informed decision for each link). Heuristics such as "no more than one link per n lines of displayed output on a typical screen" would help, but I can imagine valid exceptions to just about any heuristic. —<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarrett_905e.html" title="User:AlanBarrett">AlanBarrett</a> 07:54, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pngcrush bot</span></h2>
<p>I'm wondering if this could be useful...a bot that finds large .png images and runs pngcrush on them. Pngcrush is a lossless png optimizer. It would help de-bloat pages and reduce database size. <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVacuum_abf8.html" title="User:Vacuum">Vacuum</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vacuum_f424.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vacuum">c</a> 03:18, Dec 31, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea IMO. Another thing you might be able to do is try converting 24-bit RGB images that use less than 256 colors to a indexed color palette. I would suggest using -cc 3 on pngcrush, but it is not yet supported. This can reduce PNG size by large amounts (usually around 50%-60% smaller in my experience), but it is only really useful on larger images that contain lots of solid colors. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> 02:27, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>images are NOT stored in the database. and this is certainly NOT a job for a bot. (if it was to be done it should be done by the server admins locally. The real problem is that the scaling system always produces truecolor png output but that is a difficult issue to solve in the general case (rescaling ALWAYS gives a flood of extra colors and its difficult to know how many can be safely discarded). <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a></dd>

<p>The idea of this bot, although automated, it would not change any of the articles. Rather, it would simply bold out or highlight spelling errors on the discussion page (giving the complete sentence so an editor could see where the misspelling is coming from), or a temporary page with the copy of the article. A series of HTML comments could also help out the bot in checking or not checking the page, or which sections to check, and which sections to leave alone. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:01, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

Where an article already has a vertical bar in its category link then the bot should not make any edits (so <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_rail_accidents_47f8.html" title="List of British rail accidents">List of British rail accidents</a> doesn't get moved from the top of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Category%7ERail_transport_related_lists_8355.html" title="Category:Rail transport related lists">Category:Rail transport related lists</a> (its link is [[:Category:Rail transport related lists|*]])).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mediawiki: redirects to Template:</span></h2>
<p><i>Related to the previous request:</i> All redirects in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediaWiki_namespace_025b.html" title="Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace">MediaWiki namespace</a> that point to Template: should also be deleted. (The original proposal at Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion/Old#January 4 was for all Mediawiki: redirects, but this sounds a bit dangerous to me; on the other hand, I think ditching all redirects to Template: should be safe. For additional safety, one could delete only redirects where Mediawiki:{foo} points to Template:{foo}.) In the past, a number of non-<a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllmessages_6f04.html" title="Special:Allmessages">system messages</a> were placed into the MediaWiki: space. This included what have now become templates in the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_namespace_8f91.html" title="Wikipedia:Template namespace">Template namespacea</a>, as well as a number of other items. All of these non-system messages have long since been moved to the Template: space, leaving hundreds of redirects (too many to reasonably delete by hand). Unfortunately, because of this, whenever the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Template_namespace_initialisation_script_ab83.html" title="Special:Contributions/Template namespace initialisation script">User:Template namespace initialisation script</a> runs after an upgrade, it re-moves a lot of items and readjusts all the related links. Non-admins cannot fix these errors and double-redirects, because the entire MediaWiki: space is specifically protected. In order to avoid problems in the future, simplify maintenance, and make <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllpages_197b.html" title="Special:Allpages">Special:Allpages</a> more useful, we need to delete all of those redirects. Once all the Template: redirects have been done by the bot, it should be easy enough to check the remaining redirects by hand. This will ensure that no items, other than the internal system messages, will be left. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:05, 2005 Jan 4 (UTC) / <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:29, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have manually set up one image to show what it should look like.

</ul>
<p>In addition, each of those should then interwiki with the other languages.</p>
<p>To implement, start from a wikipedia, find a commons image, put in the backlinks from the commons to the wikipedia.</p>
<p>The second part is when a commons image is used on multiple projects, having run through the first lot, there should be identified and the interlanguage links put in. Licensing information could also be copied across if necessary.</p>
<p>So I guess there are two bots here really, the first one is the most important though as it shows people in the commons where tose images are being used. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 15:16, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I think a good bot idea would be a bot that made articles on and gave statistics on United States/other schools. E.G.-- Ouachita High School have the number of students, percentages of things, test scores. The bot can gain the statistics from a goood number of websites out there. If someone is willing to take the time and effort to do this I'm sure it will be appreciated. I myself have no experiance in computer science and programming.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redirect cleanup</span></h2>
<p>A lot of single redirects could be bypassed, improving navigation for readers and improving site speed slightly. Some easy cases where a bot could probably just go ahead and bypass the redirect on its own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inline links where there is display text set which is different from the link target's title. (And it's not a simple case of stripping the namespace prefix.)</li>
<li>Simple links in "See also" sections. In some cases, multiple articles in the same list have been merged. It would be good to consolidate these into a single listing with the new title. I assume you'd want to preserve whatever ordering already exists in these lists, rather than alphabetize. I would skip any sections which have more than one list, as these may require human attention to sort links properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be other cases which could be handled by bots, but there are certainly many that need fixing but require human attention. I guess the thing to do would be to start a "redirect sorting" project, similar to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_72d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting">stub sorting project</a>. Perhaps a bot could help with getting that off the ground, as well.

<p>It is a good idea to replace template redirects with their target (e.g. {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisamb_1478.html" title="Template:Disamb">disamb</a>}} with {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">disambig</a>}}) or redirects for misspellings with their correct spelling, but in general, replacing <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_with_possibilities_c528.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects with possibilities">Redirects with possibilities</a> or redirects such [[railroad]] or [[railway]] with <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport.html" title="Rail transport">Rail transport</a> or [[colour]] with [[color]] should be avoided. -- User:Docu</p>

Further, the articles would still exist, but they'd be blanked, which means neither of those problems would be solved anyway. In fact, it would only increase confusions when someone searching ended up getting a blank page. Instead, how about a bot that added a boilerplate to the temp pages, making it clear that the page is there for archival purposes, and that the content may not be complete? --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalathion_119a.html" title="User talk:Malathion"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 15:50, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IMDB bot for films?</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia is desparately in need of a self-motivated bot with a positive attitude to extract any available film-related information from IMDB, and create articles out of it. For example, the bot could pick out the director, actors, tagline, quotes, release dates, budget, etc, and rewrite this information in sentence form. There is a definite bias on Wikipedia toward newer films, and countless classics are being left red. You could start with all the <b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top" rel="nofollow">top film lists on IMDB</a></b>. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-08-27 17:27</small></p>
<ul>
<li>This could be a bit tricky because IMDB isn't a public domain source, unlike Rambot and US census data. This could violate their terms of service. A more feasible idea might be simply to add an IMDB link at the bottom of each film page or actor page that's currently missing it. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 14:25, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know it's not public domain, that's why you wouldn't include IMDB's plot, or any other text that could be considered copyrighted. Names of people, dates, and budget numbers, however, are a different matter. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-09-2 17:19</small>

<dd>I don't see why you need to delete the old images... Personally, uploading all SVGs would force everyone to that standard.

<dd>Again, I do not see how the images are redundant when there are some people who are on modems, and would very much prefer the static image rather than downloading the Adobe SVG just to view the image. Furthermore, SVG is not a standard on all browsers and computers. You have to consider that there are public terminals which are installed and locked down a certain way such that they may not have the proper software for SVG. Furthermore, people use other things than computers to read the Wikipedia, like Palm Pilots. We do not want to restrict the Wikipedia to SVG even if the images are redundant. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 20:14, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The most obvious thing this that there is no consideration of distinguishing reverts made by the administrator, reverts of an edit by an administrator, reverts of an earlier editor after the administrator's edit, and reverts to an earlier version by the administrator. And even more important, multiple reverts of the same thing. But that's only the tip of the iceberg, really.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category-refugees bot</span></h2>
<p>Not sure if this exists or is even feasible, but what I'm looking for is a way to step through the articles in a Category/"Category substring", scanning the links for wikilinks that step outside the category requirement. This would be more akin to a spider or database query, except the former is forbidden (?) and the latter seems unsuited to the task. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's say <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a> links to <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue.html" title="Rogue">rogue</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leia_Organa_8db5.html" title="Leia Organa">Leia Organa</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacen_Solo_8515.html" title="Jacen Solo">Jacen Solo</a>. We're hunting for articles that should be in "Categories:*Star Wars*", but ain't.
<ul>
<li>bot finds that <s>all</s> two of the three above links are in the specified categories.</li>
<li>However, in scanning <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacen_Solo_8515.html" title="Jacen Solo">Jacen Solo</a>, it finds a link to <a href="../../../v/o/x/Voxyn.html" title="Voxyn">voxyn</a> which has not been categorized at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Results given to user:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue.html" title="Rogue">rogue</a> links out of defined Category-space, from <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a> (false positive)</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/o/x/Voxyn.html" title="Voxyn">voxyn</a> links out of defined Category-space, from <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacen_Solo_8515.html" title="Jacen Solo">Jacen Solo</a>. Oops! User categorizes it, and now the <i>voxyn</i> article is maintained with the rest of the SW articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously it's an imperfect example, and because it takes no action, it may not really be a bot, but it could be a boon in fiction/other specialized cats that very rarely link out of their own categor(ies). <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 22:28, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see what this is intended to accomplish... especially because it sounds like you're saying <a href="../../../v/o/x/Voxyn.html" title="Voxyn">voxyn</a> should not be in a Star Wars category, when it quite obviously should (if it weren't a redirect). ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 22:36, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, obviously I didn't do a very good job of that. In my example, voxyn' (hypothetical article) *should* be in the SW categories, but isn't through user error. It's fairly difficult right now to find these without a human user checking all theoretically category-bound links on all pages in the category. Ideally this would be a list of "exit links" - links that go out from Category articles that are no longer in Category. Things like <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue.html" title="Rogue">rogue</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">sword</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_blast.html" title="Energy blast">energy blast</a> would be easily scannable as false positives, leaving only the mis/non-categorized articles to be tagged. <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 02:41, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So this would be a human-operated bot to add articles to cats? I like it. Keep in mind, though, that subcats may sometime be necessary; for instance, if we had categories "Star Wars animals" or "Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology" (which, I think, we don't), "voxyn" would go in one of those, not the root SW category. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 03:03, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

It would be interesting to expand the idea to articles which are already in categories, though it's clearly easier for uncategorized articles, and those are probably in more urgent need of attention. I'm not sure links outside of the "see also" area would be likely to be in the same category, but I haven't done any field testing of that idea.

<p>Similarly I have a list of vertex figure images for 80+ uniform polyhedra that I'd like to upload automatically, rather than by hand.</p>
<p>I wouldn't plan to overwrite any existing pages, although it might be useful to overwrite a set of images in the future, if I can get better images, or want to change resolution or whatever.</p>
<p>I imagine there's a way of using Javascript or something to manipulate webpages, filling in form data perhaps and activiting buttons.</p>
<p>Alternately there might be a URL approach in Wiki to transmit article and image information for generation without using the web page controls.</p>

<dd>You would need a bot to upload stuff to Wikipedia in batch mode.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alexa rank checker request</span></h2>
<p>I'm a little concerned about Wikipedia being used as a medium for self-promotion and advertising non-notable sites. Might it be possible/desirable to write a bot to check the Alexa rankings for all externally linked sites, and list all links to sites below a certain Alexa rank? Humans could then review that list and decide what to do with the less notable sites.</p>
<p>This is actually a request for two different functionalities: the first would be for the bot to go through every current Wikipedia article, checking external links, while the second would be for the bot to patrol Recent Changes, doing the same. The first functionality would obviously need to be done carefully, so as to not be percieved as a DoS attack on Alexa; if necessary, it could run fairly slowly, over a period of weeks or months, even. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 08:17, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I agree that wikispam is a very bad thing, a site with low Alexa rank might have information highly relevant to an article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Null edit bot?</span></h2>
<p>Can't imagine a simpler bot than this to implement, or a more harmless one to run. (He observed, leadingly...) Has anyone previously suggested a "null edit" bot, to assist in forcing renamed stub categories to pick up their "new" categories? (This doesn't happen automatically, if the category in a stub template is changed, but the transcluding article isn't.) At present, stub category renames tend to be done opportunistically when they're small, but it'd sometimes be useful to have a convenient way to do this by "brute force" on existing, large categories, when a naming convention changes, or is "clarified". Running either on a given list of articles, or a given category would be good. Proposed "null edit": add a blank line to the end of an article. Possible refinement, to stop continually growing article if for some reason it's repeatedly edited by this, and never otherwise: instead delete a blank line at end of article, if it already exists. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disambiguation pages-birth and death dates</span></h2>
<p>I work with the <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEA_d033.html" title="WP:MEA">Missing Encyclopedic Articles</a> and am constantly pruning new lists of already existing articles. One of my big pet peeves when I run into a disambig page is that there is seems that there never enough info on the disambiguation page to fully disambiguate who the person was and I have to check several articles just to be sure. According to the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html#Specific_entry_types" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">Manual of style for disambiguation pages</a>, birth and death dates are supposed to be added to help make the disambiguation easier and provide some context for who the person was. Can this process be automated by a bot checking disambig pages and looking for <a href="../../../1/9/3/Category%7E1931_births.html" title="Category:1931 births">Category:1931 births</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/Category%7E1995_deaths.html" title="Category:1995 deaths">Category:1995 deaths</a> on linked articles and adding birth and death dates where appropriate?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Archival Bot</span></h2>
<p>Certain pages, most notably the Village Pump, Reference Desk and Admin Noticeboard, have a tendency to get overly lengthy. I was wondering if it was possible to create a bot that checks once per day, and moves to an archive page each <i>section</i> that ends with a datesign of more than a week ago. Almost all sections on those pages end with the standard signature + date, and any section without recent activity would be archivable.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if people <i>like</i> this idea, but before suggesting it on those places I'd like to ask the botters if it's actually possible. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 01:06, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

The bot should be checking all of the timestamps in the section, of course, not just the lowest one.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SectionDating Bot (also related to the previous request)</span></h2>
<p>I have been supersectioning (=MONTH DAY=) <a href="../../../h/d/_/WP%7EHD_6530.html" title="WP:HD">WP:HD</a> and the four <a href="../../../r/d/_/WP%7ERD_c7a5.html" title="WP:RD">WP:RD</a> categories (/H, /S, /L and /M) for while. This sectioning by the date-of-question has been well received as it been helpful for navigation and archiving by providing chronological breaks. The bot that I'm requesting would add the supersection date header at the bottom of those five places at approximately midnight (UTC) daily. One complication in doing this manually (me) is that many questions are unsigned/undated and so into the Page History I go (which is listed by my local time) and sort out the UTC breakpoint. This complication would wouldn't be a problem for the bot as the headers would be added at midnight in UTC realtime. The relationship to the previous request is that the archiving bot could work from the date tag file.
