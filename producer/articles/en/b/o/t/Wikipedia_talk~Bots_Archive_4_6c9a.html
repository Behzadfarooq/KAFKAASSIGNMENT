<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disambiguation Bot / Rambot data</span></h2>
<p>I have written a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html" title="Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> bot that looks for very specific text in pages and then changes that text. The current plan in to disambiguate [[Hispanic]] which has over 30,000 pages linking to it (the vast majority of those are from the data put in by <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">User:Rambot</a>). I was using the solve_disambiguation.py but even that is just way too slow and tedious. So I wrote my own bot. I registered <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinBot_f44e.html" title="User:KevinBot">User:KevinBot</a> to run the bot.</p>
<p>The way the bot works is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gets the pages that link to [[Hispanic]].</li>
<li>Get's the text of each of these pages.</li>
<li>Searches through the text for "% of the population are [[Hispanic]] or [[Latino]] of any race."</li>
<li>If the text does not exist it does nothing to the page.</li>
<li>If the text does exist it changes it to "% of the population are [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]] or [[Latino]] of any race."</li>
<li>It submits the page back as a minor edit with a summary that is TBD.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the bot has more than one throttle so I can slow it down to whatever threshold is deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Note: this is a custom bot and is not related in any way to the python bots.</p>
<p>I am not yet done testing the bot, but I thought I'd throw it up here for consensus so that when I am finished testing I can get right to running it.</p>

<dd>Some time ago, we discussed changes need to the [[Asia]]n references included in most of the same articles (by Rambot). They are even more in need of fixing as they lead not just to a disambiguation page, but to the wrong article and we can't really make <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> into a disambiguation page.</dd>
<dd>I was going to try to fix them with the py-bot, but it's obviously preferable if you'd include them in a series of changes you will be doing with your bot, as the number of articles to be covered is very high.</dd>
<dd>So if there is a possibility that you include a change to [[Asia]]n in your edits, that would be great.</dd>
<dd>-- User:Docu</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can do that, but I'd need to know what to change it to. I would suppose that it should be changed to [[Asian American|Asian]]. Is that what it should point to? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> 13:01, Jul 28, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, though I can't locate the previous discussion. Personally, I'd prefer to use redirects such [[Asian (US census)|Asian] ], but [[Asian American|Asian]] is much better than the present solution. -- User:Docu</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with Docu on changing [[Asia]]n and thanks to Kevin for stepping up to fix this. I'd prefer [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]] (<i>note</i> the full stops and capitalization) over [[Asian American|Asian]] because Rambot was changing <i>all</i> the links to point to [[Race (U.S. Census)]]&lt;nowiki&gt; before he vanished without finishing. I personally think linking all of these racial labels to the same place is confusing, so the links should direct to [Asian American|Asian], [Hispanic American|Hispanic], etc., but using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]] allows us to change this linkage to [[Race (U.S. Census)]]&lt;nowiki&gt; should the consensus change. We should also link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[White (U.S. Census)|White]] and [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)]] and change "African American" to "Black and African American" (per census wording). --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 05:23, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't even know that there was a <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28U.S._Census%29_a9bd.html" title="Race (U.S. Census)">Race (U.S. Census)</a> until I read these posts. I like the idea of making all the races point to this one article which will explain what the census data means clearly and consicely for all the races. If we need to break it down any more from there, we can. [[Race (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] and [[Race (U.S. Census)|Asian]] and [[Race (U.S. Census)|White]] really works well for me. If concensus changes I easily run the bot to change it to [[Asian American|Asian]] or [Hispanic American|Hispanic]. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> 04:17, Jul 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>the problem with using [[Race (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] and [[Race (U.S. Census)|Asian]] and [[Race (U.S. Census)|White]] is that if we want it to link to the race articles instead, then we will need your bot to run the thousands of changes. It is much easier to have [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] and [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]] and [[White (U.S. Census)|White]] and have [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)]] and [[Asian (U.S. Census)]] and [[White (U.S. Census)]] all redirect to [[Race (U.S. Census)]]. This way, it reduces down to a matter of changing the redirects rather than running a bot on thousands of articles. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 06:06, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some counts: There are 32'010 links to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic.html" title="Hispanic">Hispanic</a>, 33'905 to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> and already 4869 to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28U.S._census%29_c859.html" title="Race (U.S. census)">Race (U.S. census)</a>. At the rate of 6 per minute, one can edit approx. 8640 articles per day. If recall correctly, there are at least 25'000 references that should be changed. -- User:Docu</p>
<p>That's a good point about using redirects. I like it. That's what we should do. Also, I've finished testing my bot, and it seems to be working really well. I'm going to run it on 10 articles and see how it fares. I'll post the list of articles edited on <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinBot_f44e.html" title="User:KevinBot">User:KevinBot</a>. That way we can check them to make sure there isn't anything catastrophic that needs to be repaired before we mark it as a bot and let it loose. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> 20:26, Jul 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, the bots run a bit on a limited basis to see how well it works and it's working like a charm. So whoever it is that can mark bots please mark <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinBot_f44e.html" title="User:KevinBot">User:KevinBot</a> as a bot.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot to import FCC stations</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to write a bot to import the FCC's list of US broadcast stations including FM, AM, and Television. Nothing's been written yet but I wanted to make sure this was okay to do before I bothered to do any work. If someone else wants to do it, that's great. I'm willing to do it but I don't want to duplicate effort. Not sure whether I'd start from scratch or use the python bot.</p>
<p>Posted a request on the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html#Pulling_in_FCC_list_of_radio_stations" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">pump</a> yesterday but I didn't get any replies, so I thought I'd bring it here. Following is my comment from the pump. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 15:43, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC)</p>

Each state's page is formatted differently and contains different kinds of information. There are thousands of licensed stations in the US.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One of the few things the FCC's done right is publishing downloadable data <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/fmq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/fmq.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/amq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/amq.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. You can get a list of all the stations in the US. Thoughts on importing this data into Wikipedia? There are something like 8500 FM stations listed, so I'm not sure if that list includes defunct or trivial stations. Anyway we could filter by certain criteria like wattage, I'd have to do more research to find out possible filters. I could write the bot to do this but it might take a while given my schedule. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 04:26, Jul 28, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>8500 is not a large number for the entire United States, considering that many major cities have dozens of radio stations, and not all radio stations are limited to major cities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BGoldenberg running disambiguate bot</span></h2>
<p>I would like to run the disambiguation bot from pywikipediabot. It is possible I would later run other bots, almost certainly user controlled bots. For instance I think it would be great if there was a bot that could easily be used for categorizing groups of articles, something I already do; the bot would just speed things up. (It looks like replace.py might satisfy this, but for the time being I am mainly interested in disambiguation).</p>
<p>I am a bit unfamiliar with the bot regulation system. I know for major, non-interactive bots, there is a period where it is expected to be run at a very reduced rate, but it seems that at least disambiguation bots don't receive nearly the scrutiny as others.

<dd>I would submit that solve_disambiguation.py is not really a <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_bot.html" title="Internet bot">bot</a> but rather an alternative <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_interface.html" title="User interface">user interface</a>. A bot is something that runs automatically but solve_disambiguation.py doesn't do anything automatically. So I would say go ahead and run it (that's my opinion, and I'm not an authority on the subject). However, until and unless you get <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjBot_9638.html" title="User:BenjBot">User:BenjBot</a> marked as a bot, I would just run it as <a href="../../../b/g/o/User%7EBgoldenberg_ece5.html" title="User:Bgoldenberg">User:Bgoldenberg</a> if I were you. Just an FYI, I had to go to go and find someone to mark <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinBot_f44e.html" title="User:KevinBot">User:KevinBot</a> as a bot as putting it on this page was not enough.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussion pages</span></h2>
<p>Bots must not make modification to comments signed by individuals. Even, it would be better to remove the comment entirely than to attribute text to an individual that they did not create. Other than that, changes on discussion pages can destroy discussions that are premised, for instance, on the peculiarities of linking or disambiguation pages, etc. Please make this change to the Project Page. - <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> 21:15, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree to some extent. If discussion pages have links requiring disambiguation and the proper use for the link is easily identified, I don't see a problem of a bot disambiguating the link. While technically, the user's comment has been changed as far as what's actually in the page contents, the meaning has not. However, if the link cannot be clearly disambiguated or the user's comment specifically discusses a disambiguation issue then the link in the comment should not be disambiguated by a bot or manually. I have come across several talk pages that discuss how <b>English</b> or <b>French</b> is disambiguated. In this case, I have not disambiguated the link. I don't know of any bots that automatically disambiguate links. AFAIK, people are using bots to assist them with disambiguation (e.g. solve_disambiguation.py for pywikipediabot) but still actually require a human to decide on how a link is disambiguated. The bot just helps reduce the editing time required to disambiguate a link. If there are several hundred links to do, this makes a big difference. Making a policy that a bot cannot disambiguate links on talk pages is easily defeated by doing it manually. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWolf_0f32.html" title="User:RedWolf">RedWolf</a> 08:19, Aug 7, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The text of what one writes is their text, signed by them. It would also not be appropriate to do a copyedit of one's comments, even if it does not look like it changes the meaning. Indeed, it is confusing when a person edits their own comments if that edit is out of the order of the discussion. As for your main point: in that case, there should be a policy that all modifications of discussion pages be attended to by a real person. - <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a> 17:07, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if Wiki policy (although I have not found anything yet on the issue), says that links on talk pages should not be disambiguated, so be it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Link rot bot</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I'm interested in creating a 'bot for detecting link rot. As I see it at present, I'd get the bot to download a random page once per suitable time period. The bot would then extract external links from the page, and check the pages pointed to by these links to see if they are still there. Links which remain inaccessible for (say) a number of days would then be listed on a web page. Humans could then occasionally check a page (on my server) to find a list of dead links, and the wikipedia pages that they're on, and could go and have a look.</p>
<p>Comments? If I did this, I would write the program myself and host the bot here (University of Westminster, UK).</p>

<dd>It's certainly worth doing, although I think you'd need a degree of manual verification of each apparently successful link (that is, you couldn't say a successful HTTP request necessarily meant the exlink was still valid). One thing you don't need to do is to check against an online copy of wikipedia. It'll be much faster, easier, and less server-mangling, if you download a copy of mediawiki and a recent cur database drop, and run the bot on an offline copy. You also don't have to write all of the bot yourself - there's already a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywikipediabot/" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywikipediabot/" rel="nofollow">python framework</a> for bots which interact with wikipedia. I believe this is what <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopbanana_c4c6.html" title="User:Topbanana">User:Topbanana</a> uses for compiling <a href="../../../o/f/f/Wikipedia%7EOffline_reports_ce70.html" title="Wikipedia:Offline reports">Wikipedia:Offline reports</a>. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 20:54, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm. I see the point of using an offline database rather than downloading from wikipedia. A list of links would be most of the work, and the rest of the programming would be easy. For the kind of thing I'm thinking of, it'd probably be easier for me to write a bot from scratch, rather than use the framework. However, I'm worried about how much space all the data would take up. I was thinking of running this on one of my servers that only has a few gig free space. The list of links would surely not be that big, no? I was thinking of doing verification based on the http error code (using wget so that temporarily moved links are resolved). More careful verification of the contents of the page the link points at would wait for version 2.0. - <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss-c_943c.html" title="User:Ross-c">Ross-c</a> 20:41, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a good idea, and seems like it will be run in a sensible manner. (I would also not want to see strange IUPAC names as article titles of chemicals everyone knows by a more common name). I might even go a step further though and say the IUPAC name should be somewhere in articles with common names, and they often are. See <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">Caffeine</a>. I don't know what possible objection there would be to changing the names from a random hodge-podge of spelling and previous deprecated standards to the <b>current international standard</b> which is used and accepted by chemists around the world.

<dd>Good idea. That follows the current Wikipedia manual of style, since the IUPAC names are names with <i>particular spellings</i> and the manual of style says to use them. With other spellings, they would not be those names. I agree with the purpose of this bot. It's silly not to use standardized scientific names and spellings in articles on chemicals and chemistry, whatever one uses elsewhere. But it would indeed be useful and best and, indeed, necessary to also sometimes mention the older names (and to always do so in articles on the particular substances), to make clear to non-chemists that traditional and new terminology are talking about the same things. It is very wrong for an encyclopedia for general users not to use standardized scientific terminology in its scientific articles where there is standardization, except in special circumstances. Otherwise the encyclopedia is providing increasingly outdated terminology to the users. And different terminology in different articles produces confusion. I'm not a chemist, but in reading something to do with chemistry, I would like to see things spelled out using proper, standardized terminology. Equally, it is wrong not to provide equations between varying terminology that a general reader is also likely to come across, so that I can tell that an article in Wikipedia is talking about exactly the same thing as a book from from 1950, presuming that they are talking about exactly the same thing, or that an article is talking about the same thing as a book released in 2004 if there are alternate conventions still in popular use and scientific use. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:29, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Makes a lot of sense to me. The changeover from ferrous &amp; ferric to iron (II) &amp; iron (III), etc., started at least 30 years ago, and has nothing to do with American vs British spelling. The IUPAC system is consistent and easier to understand than the historical accidents it replaces. I'm quite puzzled by the opposition to the proposed name changes. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E.

<dd>Go for it. The new names are the overwhelming usage in chemical practice, and anyone who went to school or took their degree in the past 30 years will have used them unless they were deliberately taught "old style" names from outdated textbooks. Still, we should preserve a mention of the old names in a chemical's own article, even after we have updated the main title to IUPAC convention, just as we should keep a mention of old alchemical names. And, of course, no renaming <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffiene.html" title="Caffiene">caffiene</a> to 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 11:44, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Objection time</span></h2>
<p>I've found two recent cases in which, after a week of no comments at all on their requests, people began running bots. Both of these bots have caused some amount of controversy. (In one case, because people listed objections before the bot was run, but after a week had passed. In the other because the bot started making bad edits.)

Simply saying that the categories survived <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> does not implicitely say that a bot should be changing thousands of articles. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:08, 2004 Sep 26 (UTC)

<li>The chronology was the other way round: it ran before the categories were listed for deletion. -- User:Docu

<li>If anyone wants to go about 15000 edits into the bot's contrib list, they will see those categories being implemented.

<p>That a number of people are still complaining about the categories makes me wary of their expansion.

<p>A bit of care with this bot please - it added [[Category:1981 births]] to <a href="../../../o/w/e/Owen_Hargreaves_cafa.html" title="Owen Hargreaves">Owen Hargreaves</a> over 3 days after this article had a copyvio notice slapped on it.

<dd>The category was indeed added based on my summary check of the article in the cur table available for download. The page later showed up on last week's check for sortkeys (the category <a href="../../../p/o/s/Category%7EPossible_copyright_violations_fd04.html" title="Category:Possible copyright violations">Possible_copyright_violations</a> sorts by title rather than surname). As I figured it's not a problem to leave the article title categorized, I didn't change it (either the page would get restored or deleted). -- User:Docu</dd>

<p>I object to this bot. Widely used templates should be hard to delete. The only time I could see a use for automated destruction of a template is when the template was created through an automated means. It shouldn't be easier to destroy than to create. I am also hesitant about letting Snowspinner run this bot unilaterally. Taking a look at templates for deletion he seems to get into heated arguments in favor of deleting certain templates, and I don't trust him to understand when lack of dissent comes from the fact that not many people are aware of the discussion. A template which is widely used and was not created through automated means should be strongly presumed to not have a consensus for removal, dispite the fact that no one came to its rescue on TfD (which unlike VfD is not very well advertised). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning)</p>

I have no problem with a bot that asks yes/no and provides you with the appropriate information to make the best choice! -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 04:36, Nov 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For what its worth, I plan to resume the rambot's tasks sometime possibly in the next couple of days. This is not a departure from previous actions, but I thought I should at least mention it for those who care. See "<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">rambot</a>" for some of the things that will be performed.

<p>Once the rambot is unblocked and the discussions on server load below are fully and completely hashed out, I plan to run a bunch of various tasks. In terms of cities and counties, I plan to add <a href="../../../u/n/2F/UN_LOCODE_825d.html" title="UN/LOCODE">UN/LOCODEs</a> to the cities that have them. This will include setting up shortcuts in bulk to facilitate easy usage (e.g. <a href="../../../u/s/l/UN_LOCODE%7EUSLAX_2828.html" title="UN/LOCODE:USLAX">UN/LOCODE:USLAX</a> for <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>). Simultaneously with this I will be adding <a href="../../../m/a/p/Template%7EMapit-US-cityscale_9e1e.html" title="Template:Mapit-US-cityscale">Template:Mapit-US-cityscale</a> templates to the external links section of every city that has GPS coordinates listed. This is a thousands of cities. This will add automatic links to street maps, satellite photos, and a topographical map of the location in question, a terribly useful thing to have. (See the example in <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Ohio_cd1a.html" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>). In addition to the tasks above, I also plan to add a short two or three sentence request to every user talk page who has not been asked about multi-licensing. This latter option may not happen depending on whether or not I can get developer help to do it directly with the database to eliminate server load and the need to use a bot.

<p>This entire bot policy is mostly the design of a very small group of people. The discussion on the limitation on how fast a bot operates was discussed on IRC, and therefore we have no way of knowing who or what came up with it. IIRC, I was the one who originally added the 3-point policy, which was later turned into a 4-point policy when "approved" as added. Everyone has since almost religiously followed both forms of the policy, and it has worked quite well as general guidelines. The problem with the other specific rules is that they are quite inflexible and not strictly followed by bot owners, particularly the speed restrictions. Part of this is because we generally trust a bot after it has proven itself, but a lot has to do with the relatively few number of people who frequent this page. It is quite hard to get an adequate consensus, as it is often typically biased either in favor of bots or not in favor, depending. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man"></a> – <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup>[[]] 21:59, Dec 16, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is bigger than the technical aspects of bot policy. I think what we need is a broad consensus one way or another on whether it is a good idea to allow people to leave automated bulk messages on user talk pages. Personally, I would vote no for the following reasons: 1) It will quickly make talk pages considerably less useful as they fill up with junk (as we've seen with other channels). 2) It will give an inordinately powerful voice to those who run robots. I think this should be resolved among the broader community as a matter of policy. I don't see why the next mass posting run can't wait until this is settled.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rambot clarification</span></h2>
<p>I need to clarify what I want to do with the rambot. After using the rambot to do reads an discover which users have edited rambot articles, I then plan to take that list and ask all of the people on the list that I have not already asked. To do so, I would use the bot to add a short message which would link to a page with more detailed information. I would do somewhat small batches of users at a time, something like 50-100 users, and then wait for responses. The reason for this is because if I go to fast, not only does it look like mass-quick-spam, but it also causes too many users to respond at once. When users have stopped responding and their questions answered, I will do another batch of users, as appropriate until the task is completed. This behavior will be significantly different from the previous action of doing about 1,000 people in a very short time with a very large spam-like message. The main purpose is to save me the time from having to manually open their talk page, click on "Post a comment", and finally copy and paste the message before saving it. I figure it will save me at least 10-30 minutes per batch so I can do other things at the same time. There has been the suggestion to try and get help from a database administrator to help allieviate any potential strain on the server. This would probably require adding the message to all of the user account at once, but would not require using the bot. If anyone would rather have this option, mention it. If neither option is acceptable, I will manually perform the action. Does anyone have any objections to this new behavior, and if so which category do they fit in: (1) Problems with posting a short message on multi-licensing? (2) Problems with a bot posting messages on user talk pages? (3) Other concerns? <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man"></a> – <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup>[[]] 19:14, Dec 16, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">transactions per minute</span></h2>
<p>Having recently started the <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">rambot</a>, it comes to little surprise that someone is unhappy. I've gotten a complaint from <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocu_0014.html" title="User:Docu">User:Docu</a> stating that I have been violating the 6 transactions per minute rule specified on the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Bots</a> page, which is true. As requested, I am bringing it up here so that the "rule" might be "changed". For the record, the bot does not violate any of <b>harmless</b>, <b>server hog</b>, <b>useful</b>, or <b>approved</b>. Since the transaction rule was at best discussed based on <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> discussions that are not logged, I have no way of knowing the precident for it. So I will try my best. There originally were three compelling reasons to limit bot transactions: 1) Server Load, 2) the Recent Changes was too cluttered otherwise, and 3) to allow time for other users to verify the changes made by the bot. #1 never existed as the bot's edits represent a tiny fraction of the total server load. #2 was fixed by the implementation of the bot flag which was implemented BECAUSE of the rambot. #3 applies to those bots with small data sets or those data sets that vary greatly. The rambot's data set is so large that adding delay makes for an unmanageable amount of time to complete even very simple tasks. When I move to the cities (from counties), the amount of time will increase by more than 10 times. What I am saying is that no one is going to check 2,000 let along 35,000 articles, so #3 is not compelling. What does not change is that people can randomly sample the data (as I do when constantly monitoring the bot run). And the user's contributions can easily be checked. If there was a lot of variability in the changes, then there MAY be a reason to check more of the entries, but still no reason to slow down. Wikipedia is not about strict rules but an ever-changing evironment that adapts. In fact, aside from NPOV, there are not many hard and fast rules at all. I will make all efforts to enforce accuracy, but what were talking about is the difference between a week of editing vs. 3 weeks of editing. Maybe 2 weeks of time is meaningless to a lot of people, but not to me. If it makes everyone feel better, I can run three bots from three different IP addresses on three different data sets, and that would technically not violate any of the rules. The point being that the rule makes no sense out of context. I'm not even suggesting that we change the guideline. As a general guideline it makes perfect sense, but as we mention at the start of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikiprojects</a>, these things are what a group of users got together to work on, and they are not hard and fast rules. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 03:30, Nov 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The guideliness already make sure that a bot is to perform a subset of changes at a very slow speed to allow everyone to verify that it is working. After that point it is permitted to move to the faster speeds. The rambot does not perform any pipelining, but it could be modified to perform multiple changes in parallel. To date I have not done this, but I have considered it: I don't know, technically speaking, how fast is too fast, but doing things in series is never going to cause a performance hit. I've arbitrarily drawn the line at doing things in parallel, but I suppose a reasonable amount of parallelization couldn't hurt performance. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 04:23, Nov 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>6 transactions per minute?! That's all that's currently allowed for bots that have proved themselves? That's crazy. That is absolutely nuts. I'm still fine-tuning the <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_Link_Suggester_233d.html" title="User:Nickj/Link Suggester">link suggester</a>, and intending to do a number of trial runs (each run a bit larger than the last), so as to have a progressive phase-in and give time for feedback to be incorporated. However, in a full test run there were 210931 pages with suggested links. Now, at 6 transactions per minute running non-stop that'll take 35155 minutes = 585 hours = 24 days to upload. That's nearly a month! Now, I don't have any problem at all with going slowly at first whilst something isn't proven, but going so slowly after that's already happened just seems silly. Surely there needs to be some latitude given to bots that are proven, and that the vast majority of people don't have any objection to, and that would actually benefit from being able to go faster (e.g. currently RamBot and D6, and hopefully at some point in the future the link suggester). - <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> 05:04, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such a short comment requiring such a long answer ;-) Here goes!</dd>
<dd>The idea of adding suggestions to the talk pages is that:
<ol>
<li>They're suggestions - a user may not like some of them - and so the actual article should <b>never</b> be automatically modified. People feel strongly about this, and I agree with them.</li>
<li>By adding suggestions to the talk page, those suggestions are automatically associated with the page, and visible to anyone watching the page, all without the problems inherent in modifying the page.</li>
<li>Currently the link suggester shows suggested links <i>from</i> a page, but I also want to show suggested links <i>to</i> a page (but only if there are outgoing links as well).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The problems with listing suggestions separately as a big series of list pages are that:
<ol>
<li>Point 2 above is lost.</li>
<li>It would be a <b>huge</b> number of pages, much much more than 100 or 200. With 210931 pages with suggestions, at around 3.8 suggestions on average per page, that's over 800,000 suggestions in total. My experience with exactly this kind of process with making lists of changes (with creating the data for the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Wiki_Syntax_e9db.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Wiki Syntax">Wiki Syntax Project</a>) has shown that 140 suggestions per page (includes link to page, word that can be linked, and context of the change) is the perfect size to get the page size just under the 32K suggested maximum page size. 800000 / 140 means there would be 5715 pages.</li>
<li>Then people have to process those 5715 pages. As it happens, I've also had experience with asking people for their help in processing changes listed on pages (again as part of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Wiki_Syntax_e9db.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Wiki Syntax">Wiki Syntax Project</a>), and it has taken a lot of effort by a lot of people to get through just 26 pages of suggested changes in around a week. At that rate of progress, with the same consistent and concerted effort (which would probably be very hard to do over such a long-haul project), it would take around 220 weeks to process all of the suggestions, which equals <b>4.2 years</b>.</li>
<li>Point 3 above is lost unless you have twice as many pages (a list to, and a list from), which would be 11430 pages.</li>
<li>Over such a long period of time, with the rapid pace of change in the Wikipedia, the data would age very rapidly, and quickly become irrelevant to the content that was actually on the pages at the time a human got around to looking at the suggestion.</li>
<li>In other words, the most viable approach appears to be to distribute the problem of processing the links out to the page authors / maintainers by putting those suggestions on the talk pages (and this act of distributing the problem is one of the most fundamental reasons why the Wikipedia is so successful). Of course, page authors can ignore the suggestions (personally, I wouldn't, if I thought that they were good suggestions, and if I cared about the page) - and with the tests, sometimes people ignore the suggestions, and sometimes they use them. Of course if you ignore the suggestions, then you're no worse off than you were before.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Re: Making the database available. I have some very paranoid questions about this:
<ol>
<li>What are you going to do with it that's different from what I'm going to do with it?</li>
<li>If you've got a good idea, let me know, I'm perfectly happy to give credit where credit is due.</li>
<li>If you do something that doesn't work, or that causes problems, how can I be sure that this won't reflect badly in any way on the link suggester project?</li>
</ol>

<dd>I know those questions seem paranoid, but there's a very good reason for me to feel paranoid about this data: People can be extremely suspicious of and prejudiced against bots, and it would really annoy me to have made an effort, and then have it tarnished or the project blocked based on what someone else did using data generated by the link suggester.

<dd>Regarding what I'd do with the database, I'm really not sure, but I should note that I currently run a Wikipedia mirror/fork. Maybe I could find some patterns and apply a subset of it directly to my copy of Wikipedia. Maybe I could make a 3D image of the suggested links. Maybe I could give statistics on the articles with the highest/lowest % of links/suggested links. Maybe I could sort the list by number of links to/from a certain term, with or without filtering by type of link (a person, a place, etc). I wouldn't use it to run a bot on Wikipedia, if that's your concern. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 21:44, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, someone with a data set larger than mine! Woohoo. I only have 35,000 - 40,000 articles to check :) By "Transactions" I was referring to "edits". For every one edit the rambot does, it requires a number of reads. But it seems like no one cares if we increase or eliminate the speed limit for proven bots. I suppose not even 120 edits per minute would be a problem, but I don't know what the maximum would be. Without delaying, I only average about 15 edits per minute. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 12:43, Nov 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So when the system is slow, you still want to ram through your aotmated edits when a human has to wait over a minute for a page save due to system response? Don't you think humans should get better response times than bots, especially fully automated bots? When the system is having a good response time then I don't see a problem in allowing bots more leeway in how much load they put on the servers but I still think system response time should give precedence to humans rather than to the bots when the site slows down. Fully automated bots should, for the most part, only run during excess capacity times IMHO. Perhaps a system load monitor could auto throttle bot marked accounts when a certain threshold is reached? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWolf_0f32.html" title="User:RedWolf">RedWolf</a> 08:03, Nov 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not particularly suggesting that if the system is slow that a bot should try to hog the system. In fact that would violate the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Server_hog.html" title="Server hog">server hog</a> principle and be in violation of policy. The fact of the matter is that even when Wikipedia is running slow we have been told by developers that the serial bot edits are negligible and do not constitute a server hog. This is a common false perception and no developer to date has changed this and the hardware has VASTLY improved since that statement was made. In fact when Wikipedia is slow, the rambot slows down as well. Nevertheless, if it could be proven that bots were causing a slow down, a system load monitor/auto throttle of some sort would be great and I would wholeheartedly support that. I havn't done it yet, but I was going to make a page to control the rambot's settings that it would periodically monitor so that it's speed could be adjusted on the fly from Wikipedia itself. In the worst case, however, a bot can be temporarily banned if causing trouble. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 13:01, Nov 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My only concern with changing the rule, and this doesn't really apply to Rambot, is that going over 6 transactions per minute makes your changes really hard to revert. Thus we start getting into a technocracy where whoever has the faster bot wins. Yes, there is an approval process for bots, but there really isn't that much interest in it. I'd favor approving an increase in the speed limit for rambot, for this particular run. I'd also favor allowing others to receive an increase for a specific run which is extremely well defined. But I think this should require a specific proposal which is approved by at least say 10 people and after the bot has already run in slow mode for a day or so. As for the speed, 120/minute sounds a little high. I'd want some input from a few developers before going over 60/minute or so (which I believe is the read-only speed limit in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt" rel="nofollow">robots.txt</a> file). The details could be worked out, but that's my suggestion rather than eliminating the rule. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 13:27, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>6/minute may not be the exact cutoff, but as a bot can run 24 hours a day I think it's quite enough before we should require consensus for a specific run. I'd say 8,600 a day is probably too high. I'd prefer capping bot edits at more like 1,000 per day unless there is a clear consensus for a well-defined run. If the per day limit were set at 1000 we could up the per minute limit. Maybe 60/minute off-peak? I dunno, whatever Jamesday wants for the per minute limit :). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 05:29, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Two more comments on rambot. I'm hesitant about adding "WikiProject boilerplating to the talk page of the state's cities." I don't think it's useful, and I think it's harmful, as it suggests that there is discussion on the talk page when it's really just a spam link to someone's project. Secondly, I'd like to see the details of the "automatic disambiguation". This is a very hard thing to do right. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 13:36, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, I have not done any wikiproject boilerplating partially because some people don't like the idea. It has already been done for the U.S. County articles, but I stopped at that. Nevertheless, it IS just the talk page and I don't believe it is spam, as Wikiprojects are quite optional and used all over the place. I wouldn't mind renewing a discussion about this, but I don't know where to bring it up. It wouldn't be hard to make a simple Wikiproject template that is short and concise and doesn't take up too much space. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 14:55, Nov 11, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps I used a bit too harsh a term calling it "spam", but at least one problem I have is that it makes the "discussion" link blue, which makes me think there's a discussion, but it's just a link to a project which I already have heard about many times. Personally I wouldn't have a problem if this were only done to discussion pages which already existed, but I don't know how useful you would find that. The best place to start the discussion would probably be here, but since people have already objected I think it's your responsibility to either show that the objectors have changed their mind or show that there is such overwhelming support for this that we should ignore the objections. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 17:38, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Second, "automatic disambiguation" is vague, but much of this has already been done. Some cities exist at "City, State", but the "City" article may not exist, so it could be a redirect to "City, State". But maybe there are more than one "City" with the same name, so the "City" article (if it does not exist) should be a disambiguation page to all of those cities with the same name. The process can be taken a step up too. "City, State" may be disambiguated to "City, County 1, State" and "City, County 2, State", etc, if the page does not already exist. In the time that I have not done this, some of this has already been done, but I'm sure some have been missed. Does this help to explain it? I'm not ready to perform this kind of task yet. Oh, and it used to include the "City, ST" -&gt; "City, State" redirects too, but most of these have been done as well. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 14:55, Nov 11, 2004 (UTC)

<p>With regard to the bot speed limit, the best solution to hundreds or thousands of bad bot edits is to do another bot run to clean up. In the very worst case, a generic "revert bot" can just undo all the bad bot's recent edits. With my list of 50,000 changes, what I did was run the first dozen or so, wait a day, check for comments, and only when everything was settled, let it run unattended. It has taken days or weeks for people to find some systematic errors, which I will be fixing myself with some cleanup runs. I don't think the speed limit really helped much. It just means that I have to check my bot every day to make sure it's still running, which is time I could be spending readying subsequent runs or editing articles. Sometimes it auto-detects systematic errors, and the speed limit actually creates a delay in me noticing that. Articles also get edited during the course of the run, which can cause some inconsistencies, above and beyond the fact that a long run leaves some articles one way and others a different way, for a longer period of time than a short run. It's also something of a waste of time for human editors to be running after a bot to fix bad edits as they happen, when bad edits could be reverted en masse automatically. So I don't think having humans be able to keep up with the actual editing process is necessarily a good reason for a speed limit. If something has gone wrong, it should be just as easy to deal with after the fact and while it's in progress.</p>
<p>Perhaps an official, community-approved "revert bot", which could be deployed on short notice, would make sure that's the case.</p>
<p>In short, I think restricting bots to sequential edits is sufficient, as long as the number of people running bots (and the number of bots per person) is small compared to the Wikipedia population (or, more directly, server capacity). My bot automatically stops editing if Wikipedia takes too long to respond, on the general theory that load is probably too high, or that something else has gone wrong. But if even immediate sequential edits have a negligible performance impact, raising the speed limit will probably improve human productivity. Bot authors need to supervise their bots less, and human editors will be not be making changes that a bot was going to get around to anyway, or that a slow-running bot will later come by and obsolete.</p>
<p>It should be a stated rule that bot owners shall not knowingly make ongoing, conflicting edits with one another. We have the three-revert rule to prevent humans from operating on the "fastest mouse wins" principle. Given the potentially large number of articles involved, I think there's good reason to have a one-revert rule for bots. The idea is that if a bot owner would like to change or revert what another bot owner has done, they should get community approval in the appropriate forum. Which they really should be getting anyway, but perhaps an explicit rule would make people more comfortable. I think this issue is rather orthogonal to the speed limit issue. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 06:34, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with everything just said almost exclusively. I must say that many times errors have been found in rambot articles, sometimes months later. A simple cleanup bot run has worked every time.

I would also like to note that if a bot does make mistakes, I agree that a subsequent bot run can clean it up, and that for the most part the bot authors are fairly well upstanding types and will clean up any unintended messes. I also agree that the throttle rule for bots is obsolete and should be done away with unless it can be proven that the bots are slowing the servers down to something more than a neglible amount. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> 04:11, Nov 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ram-Man, you've severely under-stated the load issue from bots. It is not a trivial portion of the load at the limiting rates given in the current policy. The site currently sees about 25 write "queries" per second average, perhaps twice that at peak times; about 250,000 edits/moves/whatever per week total for the English language Wikipedia. Limiting write rate, no reads at all, is perhaps 100-150 write queries per second for the main service database servers (depends on the operation, edit saves are more costly than many). Limiting write rate for one of the backup slaves is about 25-35 writes per second and for another a bit higher. One edit save involves anywhere from about 6 to thousands of write queries (relatively few are that costly) immediately and perhaps 5-10 later when the first reader comes along. Call it about 8 per save on average for immediate effect. One bot at the current limit of 6 per minute for 8 hours a day can do 20,160 edits, about 10% of the total for the English language. Odds are that those will be happening at the busiest times for the site and will have a greater negative effect than the count implies because of their timing. Each of those changes also flushes the changed page from the site caches, a significant apache web server and squid cache server load factor.</p>
<p>You'll need to find a better way to do this, one which, at a minimum, can be run at off peak times. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 04:51, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, I missed this comment in the entire document! Oh well, now I've seen it. BTW, 6/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 2,880/day, not 20,160, which is a week. That's a long time to do that many edits. The last few bot runs would have taken a substantially longer period of time because they consisted of 60,000 or so edits doing a number of tasks. That's three weeks of doing nothing but the bot for 8 hours a day. I just can't dedicate that kind of time and expect to get things done, but I suppose if there is a physical reason I can't there is nothing I can do about it. But of course all this assumes ideal circumstances. In reality Wikipedia slows and speeds up and during the time I edit (quite probably peak time) quite often the bot is only able to edit at 5 or 6 per minute, sometimes slower. When Wikipedia is more responsive, the bot naturally is able to edit faster, just as any regular user would be. Thank you at least for explaining this situation to me! But I hope you see my dilema, as I work with a very large set of articles (about 35,000). But even in the worst case scenario, the bot represents at <i>most</i> 2% of maximum writes (assumes 100), more often it would be less than 0.5%, as I rarely get more than 1 edit every 2 seconds without throttling. Of course I don't know what affect the read activity skews the results. I suppose the only way to speed this up is better hardware? <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man"></a> – <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup>[[]] 18:08, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About 250,000 changes per week for en wikipedia. 20,160 per week for one bot running 8 hours a day a the current policy limit of 6 per minute is 8% of that. Run the bot 24 hours a day and it's 24% for one bot. Run 8 hours a day at 2 seconds per edit and it's 100,800 or 40% of the weekly edit count. At present there are 19 accounts with the bot flag and were 234,343 operations in the preceding 7 days. The actual number of those edits performed by bot-flagged acounts was 10,524 or 4.5%, broken down as follows:</p>

<p>For about 10 hours a day the systems are operating within about 15% of the highest load typically seen on any given day (based on the Squid stats linked from <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers" class="extiw" title="meta:Wikimedia_servers">Meta:Wikimedia servers</a>). Seems unlikely that a bot running at a significant rate when the system is within 15% of peak Monday load (the busiest day, typically) isn't doing harm. Load decreases steadily during the week and by Friday the load has dropped substantially. Saturday is generally pretty quiet, an ideal day for bots to run - peaks may be as low as 700 requests per second, while without Apache CPU limiting slowing things down Monday can be peaking a over 1,100 requests per second. Of those requests, about 78% are served from Squid cache. How did the bot operators do at avoiding peak times? Here are the figures for Monday 1300-2300, the times when the system was within 15% of max load:</p>

<p>Through chance or design the bot operators did avoid the worst response time period on the busiest day of the week but the bots in use didn't avoid the busiest times on the rest of the week.</p>
<p>One well and visibly monitored factor is apache web server CPU load. The ganglia stats linked from the servers page wil tell you the percentage of CPU use on those servers. If that CPU use is 90%, response time is very significantly affected; buy more threshold is unofficially set at 60% at peak times and max comfort level is about 85% for load which can be shed easily. As you can tell (if the charts are up again after last night's work), now is usually a bad time to be running bots.</p>
<p>The 25-35 updates per second database slave is no longer a factor. It's now the primary upload/download server for the site. New slowest is about 40-60 per second, to a pair of 250GB 7200RPM SATA drives in RAID 0 with about 300MB of RAM allocated to database duty.</p>

<dd>The current CPU load and other factors affecting system load should be periodically written (every 10-15 minutes perhaps) to a file in a well-known location accessible to bots, similar to robots.txt. The bots could then monitor this file as it runs and reduce activity as the system load increases and increase activity as system load decreases. At a certain threshold, perhaps 90% of load, bots could even put themselves into a hold until load backs off below the threshold. If this option is undertaken, the pywikipediabot core code should be updated accordingly. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWolf_0f32.html" title="User:RedWolf">RedWolf</a> 05:57, Dec 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Resolution</span></h3>
<p>So it sounds like the concern that sequential edits with no delay will cause excessive server load has been addressed with the fact that our current hardware makes this kind load negligible. Concerns about runaway bots making bad or conflicting changes can be accommodated with a simple rule and the ability to call out a "revert bot" after community approval, respectively.</p>
<p>Therefore, I propose changing the policy from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bots should wait for 30-60 seconds between edits until it is accepted the bot is OK, afterwards waiting at least 10 seconds between edits after a steward has marked them as a bot</li>
</ol>
<p>to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unmarked bots (those not approved by <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a>) must wait 30-60 seconds between edits. This is partly to allow human editors time to notice any bad edits before too many are made.</li>
<li>Marked bots (those approved by <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a> and marked as a bot by a [[m:stewards|steward]) may make sequential edits without delay but may not parallelize requests. This is to prevent excessive server load.</li>
<li>Bot operators sometimes make mistakes or unpopular decisions. A large number of "bad" edits can easily be made faster and more conveniently than human editors can revert them. If you discover a bot making bad edits, the first step is to leave a personal message for the owner of the bot on their user page. Most bot owners are responsible and will stop damage in progress and usually clean up their own messes. If a bot owner is unable or unwilling to undo a large series of "bad" edits, please post a request for discussion and assistance on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a>. At worst, someone will have to run a "revert bot" to undo all of the "problem" bot's edits back to a certain point in time. There's certainly no need to waste human editor time doing a manual cleanup of a bot's mess when an automated solution is available.</li>
<li>Bots should not revert the work of other bots without consent of the original bot operator or community approval. If you are planning on reverting the work of a bot, post a note on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot for adding "missing" Redirect and Disambig pages - should it be done?</span></h2>
<p>I've been thinking about a way of creating some "missing" redirects and disambig pages. There's some <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html#Possible_future_projects" title="User:Nickj">info about it here</a>, but the short version is that people had to go out of their way to link a bit of text on something other than just the straight text itself - i.e. the link target and the link label differ, and the label has no page currently, but the target does. Using that information, we can add redirects (where all the links agree), or disambiguation pages (where they don't).</p>
<p>Using this method, I've made example lists of "missing" redirects and disambiguation pages:</p>
<p>Redirects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_redirects-000.txt_a1ab.html" title="User:Nickj/redirects-000.txt">redirects-000</a></li>

<li>redirects-022</li>
<li>redirects-023</li>
<li>redirects-024</li>
<li>redirects-025</li>

<li>disambig-002</li>
<li>disambig-003</li>
<li>disambig-004</li>
<li>disambig-005</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is currently just a proof-of-concept. The actual lists that would be used would not be these exact lists, and could be filtered a bit more, redirects that have been added since removed, etc. The lists are just here to provide something concrete for you to see to illustrate the idea.</li>
<li>The number of times something has matched a possible redirect or disambig is shown by the number to the right of each link in the above lists. I can change the cut-offs for these numbers if and when required, so if they're too low let me know.</li>
<li>If there are specific things that you think should be removed / filtered from the lists, then that can be done as well. Just give me some kind of regular expression or wildcard syntax that tells me what you don't want link to or from - to give you some examples of these, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_redirect-cleanup.sql_0c27.html" title="User:Nickj/redirect-cleanup.sql">here is the query file</a> I'm currently using to remove unwanted redirects and disambiguations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the question I had is this: Do you think auto-creating redirects like this is a good idea? and Do you think auto-creating the disambiguation pages like this is a good idea? Would it help? If the consensus is that it's a bad idea, then I'll drop it, but if the consensus is that it's a good idea, then I'll make a simple bot that does this.</p>
<p>Also to give you a ballpark idea of the amount of new pages that we're talking about, in this dataset it's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of redirect pages: 13571</li>
<li>Number of disambig pages: 1162</li>

<ul>
<li>25 mm → 25 mm caliber -- could easily cause unexpected links.</li>
<li>1963 election → Canadian federal election, 1963 -- will cause unexpected links once we start getting articles on other 1963 elections.</li>
<li>102nd → 102nd United States Congress -- there's no logical reason for the redirect to point there.</li>
<li>'50s → 1950s -- if the Wikipedia is still around in this format 50 years from now, "'50s" will be ambiguous.</li>
<li>586 BCE → 580s BC -- can easily cause problems if someone wants to link to 586 BC.</li>

Thank you for your comments. I was starting to wonder whether anyone was going to reply! On those inappropriate suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>25 mm → 25 mm caliber -- could easily cause unexpected links.
<ul>
<li>But isn't the gun what people mean when they write 25 mm and make it a link?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1963 election → Canadian federal election, 1963 -- will cause unexpected links once we start getting articles on other 1963 elections.
<ul>
<li>Isn't that true of any redirect? That extra articles can appear, which mean a redirect becomes a disambiguation page? Nevertheless, I'll get any redirects from "% election%" (%=wildcard) to anything else removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>102nd → 102nd United States Congress -- there's no logical reason for the redirect to point there.
<ul>
<li>Agreed. I'll get any redirects to "% United States Congress" removed from suggested redirects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>'50s → 1950s -- if the Wikipedia is still around in this format 50 years from now, "'50s" will be ambiguous.
<ul>
<li>Then in 2050 this can become a disambiguation page ... I'll be 76 then, so personally I'll probably be more worried about getting my colostomy bag changed :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>586 BCE → 580s BC -- can easily cause problems if someone wants to link to 586 BC.
<ul>
<li>Yes, but <a href="../../../5/8/6/586_BC_a316.html" title="586 BC">586 BC</a> (note no 'E') currently <b>is</b> a redirect to <a href="../../../5/8/0/580s_BC_b145.html" title="580s BC">580s BC</a>.

<p>It certainly seems like a good idea to me to <i>suggest</i> redirects/disambigs for humans to inspect. (And certainly once there's an approved list, it's much faster if a bot comes along and does the heavy clicking.) It's not unlike what I've been doing with <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAuto-categorization_b505.html" title="Wikipedia:Auto-categorization">Wikipedia:Auto-categorization</a> and Category:Orphaned categories. This sort of prep works seems to make human editors more enthusiastic and also saves a lot of time once someone does actually get around to completing these tasks. With the latter, I sort by frequency and then alphabetically, which may or not be helpful for your lists. I was thinking that supplying a snippet of context around the broken links might be helpful. If there are like 50 pages that point to the same place, it would be a bit cumbersome to show 50 lines just for that one page, but for 5-10, if context were included it might be a lot faster to verify that all of the articles were, in fact, referring to the same entity. It would make the pages longer, though. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 07:21, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not an objection to this one. Anyone contemplating such daily article templates should know that a change in the template purges all of the pages which contain it from both the Squid and parser caches. We rely on the Squids to serve over 75% of all hits and raising that even to 80% would cut the Apache web server capability need by perhaps 15-20%. That makes putting them on large numbers of pages containdicated if performance is a concern. Better to put an unchanging ad on the pages and let people choose to add them to a sub-page of their talk page so they can keep an eye on their favorite things. These also tend to foul up the most wanted articles report but they aren't popular enough yet to be a major pain there.

They can always be added later, I suppose if some better system is worked out. <b>Update:</b> See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Loyal%2C_Wisconsin&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=8531676" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Loyal%2C_Wisconsin&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=8531676" rel="nofollow">here</a> for an example of some of the current work being done. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man"></a> – <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup>[[]] 20:58, Dec 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That new map template is very cool. Obviously, Australia needs one too! So I've <a href="../../../m/a/p/Template%7EMapit-AUS-suburbscale_7585.html" title="Template:Mapit-AUS-suburbscale">copied it</a>, and added it to <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales_3916.html#External_links" title="Summer Hill, New South Wales">an Australian suburb</a>. A big thumbs-up to adding this to the RamBot articles. All the best, -- <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> 04:36, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to request permission to run a bot, <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBot_5c57.html" title="User:DanBot">User:DanBot</a>, using pywikipediabot, whose primary purpose will be to make corrections to the various highly similar articles containing Formula One statistics. First, it will convert a bunch of navigation tables (such as the one at the bottom of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_Australian_Grand_Prix_acf3.html" title="1990 Australian Grand Prix">1990 Australian Grand Prix</a>) to templates (such as the one at the bottom of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Monaco_Grand_Prix_5cac.html" title="2004 Monaco Grand Prix">2004 Monaco Grand Prix</a>. The bot's other tasks will be similar tweaks to this limited body of articles. <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4"></a>— <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 04:25, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I plan on creating a bot to edit my userpage and update my personal statistics once a day during offpeak hours. I may work on other projects too at some point, for instance I have an idea for helping get media files from the various wiki's to commons, however I will test these on the test wiki first, and post my intentions here before I do anything different with the bot. <a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbecker_eaee.html" title="User:Mbecker"></a> — <a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbecker_eaee.html" title="User:Mbecker"><font color="#007700">マイケル</font></a> <a href="../../../m/b/e/User_talk%7EMbecker_0c8c.html" title="User talk:Mbecker"><font color="#FF9900">₪</font></a> 14:46, Dec 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>
