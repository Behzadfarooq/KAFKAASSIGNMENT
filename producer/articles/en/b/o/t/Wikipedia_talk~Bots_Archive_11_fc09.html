<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interwiki bot policy</span></h2>
<p>The existing policy on the project page is a bit vague on what interwiki bots are "known safe", etc., and I have posed some questions above that affect a lot of interwiki bots, including the two most recent requests for permission.</p>
<p>I propose the following slightly revised policy on Interwiki bots. I have posted an RFC pointing here. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:32, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>pywikipedia interwiki bot operators making links <i>from</i> the English Wikipedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must run the latest version.</li>
<li>Must update on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Must speak English well enough to respond to complaints about incorrect links or other bot behavior.</li>
<li>Must actively monitor their English talk page, or have a note directing English speakers to meta or another page which is actively monitored and where they are welcome to post in English.</li>
<li>Must ask for permission on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a> (primarily to allow people to voice any objections based on the history and reputation of the operator).</li>
<li>May conduct a short demonstration run immediately after requesting permission, so that participants can examine bot edits.</li>
<li>Need not speak the language of Wikipedias they are linking <i>to</i>, but this <i>is</i> encouraged. Obviously they will not be able to provide manual disambiguation for links to languages they do not understand.</li>
<li>Are encouraged to indicate on their English user pages which languages they speak.</li>
<li>Need not manually check all links made by their bot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-pywikipedia interwiki bot operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must ask for permission before doing a demonstration run.</li>
<li>Will need to have all links manually checked, at least during a test phase. This means they must speak the language of the target language(s), or find a volunteer who does.</li>
<li>Must speak English well enough to respond to complaints about incorrect links or other bot behavior.</li>
<li>Must actively monitor their English talk page, or have a note directing English speakers to meta or another page which is actively monitored and where they are welcome to post in English.</li>
<li>Are encouraged to indicate on their English user pages which languages they speak.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other editors who see semantically inappropriate interwiki links being made by bots are encouraged to fix those links manually. In general, our feeling is that automatic links which are mostly right are better than no links at all. If one or more bots are making a high percentage of erroneous links, editors are encouraged to leave a note on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">Wikipedia talk:Bots</a> and the talk page of the bot or bot operator. General feedback on interwiki bot performance is also welcome.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Comments/support/objections</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Part of the reason I'm confortable with bots making links to articles in languages the operators don't understand is that these links are being made in the English Wikipedia. Anyone who knows enough to complain about any such links should be able to do so in English. As long as the bot operator also speaks English, that should be fine. If the bot operator doesn't speak the target language, then it should be fine to trust the judgment of a human who claims to know the right answer over a bot which could easily have made a bad assumption. I'm comfortable letting pywikipedia bots make the assumptions they do because there seem to be a lot of them running, and there does not seem to be any complaints that they are habitually inaccurate. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:36, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about the removal of (not the modification of) interwiki links? They should also be listed under the Interwiki bot section on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a>. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 04:06, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>pywikipedia doesn't remove links without manual prompting, does it? Certainly no one who doesn't speak the target language (not just the source language, which in our case would be English) should remove an existing interwiki link. (Unless we have a policy encouraging removal of links to non-existing foreign-language articles?) Is that what you are getting at? -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:06, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Several people suggested why not simply disallow the creation of pages smaller than 15 bytes, well people would create a slightly larger page with nonsense.

<dd>I was the one that originally started bugging people about this idea. The bot is very reliable at detecting too small to be #redirect articles, and I thought it would be good to automatically delete them to save the admins time. Later, if this works, I think it would also be cool to test out the possibility of auto reverting page blanking, where if more than 90% of the page is blanked without an excuse, it automatically reverts its. One thing at a time though, I hope to see this implemented soon --<a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppleboy_7cf8.html" title="User:Appleboy">appleboy</a> 03:17, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It might be a good thing to avoid deleting anything that's a template. One example is a <tt>{{deletedpage}}</tt> (which happens to be 15 chars, but no reason it couldn't have been shorter). Or, it might theoretically be possible to have a very short template that performs some logic based on the {{PAGENAME}}. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 09:01, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Admins shouldn't, as I understand things, have editing privilages differnt from thsoe of ordinary users in good standing. a page that uses templates could have an arbitrarily long expansion for a very short source text. either the bot should ignore any page using transclusion, or it should count on the lenght of the text after transclusion, whichever is easiest to implemt, IMO. Recognizing the presence of a template is easy, after all. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:51, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Exeptions bot will not delete:</b></p>

<p><b>objection to 15 limit</b> - Please note: During debate on potential deletion of stub template redirects at <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a> and <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> it is often easier - so as not to get the "this may be deleted" message on the real template - to replace the redirect message with a simple template message. Thus, if a redirect to {{<a href="../../../a/_/_/Template%7EA_0eaa.html" title="Template:A">a</a>}} was being debated, the nominated template would contain the text {{tfd}}{{a}}. 12 characters. Then there's pages containing simply {{copyvio}} - 11 characters. I can't think of any smaller possibilities, but they may exist - and 15 is thus too big! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 01:49, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>

<dd>First of all - good idea, go to it. (With the no templates, no #redirect's limits) 15 chars seems fine to me, we can expand it upward if we still get lots of slightly longer bad pages. I find it ironic that people have often cried that their articles were deleted <i>automatically</i> and we were always able to say - no, we don't delete things automatically, someone just was watching really fast and deleted it by hand. Now we won't be able to say that. It probably would be good to put a tiny note in the start-a-new-article MediaWiki text saying something like "Articles with less than 15 characters will be automatically deleted" - so we can point people there when they complain. In any case, good idea, go to it. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 00:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good. Might I suggest also - if there wouldn't be one automatically - a 10 minute delay between the posting of the article and the automatic deletion, just in case the article was a valid one which glitched while being saved (as can happen with IE from time to time). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 00:43, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></dd>

<p>I have been requested by Cool Cat for his assistance, but in light that Cool Cat doesn't have admin powers, I have taken upon myself to write this bot. I have decided three levels for this bot: 15 bytes that are not redirects or templates will be deleted automatically by the bot. 42 bytes are automatically marked with {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} with the delete reason of "Bot detected new article less than 42 bytes, possibly spam."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot submissions</span></h2>
<p>Ok, so I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I couldn't find any other talk pages devoted to Wikipedia Bots so here goes; if a bot grabs a page via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Export" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Export" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Export</a> method (both for ease-of-parsing, and to ease the load on the server), is there any way to submit its edits? By checking the page's source while editing it seems each submission must be accompanied by an opaque hash value. Is this actually enforced? Or is there something I'm missing here?

<dd>You mean the wpEditToken? You can get that by loading the edit form; it's just there to detect edit conflicts. If you choose to use the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Special%7EExport_1a62.html" title="Special:Export">special:export</a> interface for getting the wikitext instead of ripping it out of the edit form (why?), make sure you <b>first</b> get an edit token and <b>then</b> load the text from special:export though, as otherwise there's a race condition where you could overwrite someone else's edits. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 12:03, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think you need to fetch and repost wpEdittime, wpStarttime, <i>and</i> wpEditToken from the edit form, to prevent various kinds of problems. Some of those are for security, and some are to detect edit conflicts.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notification Bot: cleaning up of Images with unknown....</span></h2>
<p>I would like for <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotificationBot_ebcc.html" title="User:NotificationBot">NotificationBot</a> to be allowed run to notify uploaders about their image in <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_with_unknown_source_b9fa.html" title="Category:Images with unknown source">Category:Images with unknown source</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_with_unknown_copyright_status_6afb.html" title="Category:Images with unknown copyright status">Category:Images with unknown copyright status</a>. I would also like to have the bot use two (not yet created) templates: {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_source_notified_78ed.html" title="Template:No source notified">No source notified</a>}} &amp; {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_license_notified_edad.html" title="Template:No license notified">no license notified</a>}}. The only difference in these two templates is, the following text will be added: <b>The user has been automatically notified by a bot.</b> Also, two new categories will be created: Category:Images with unknown source - notified &amp; Category:Images with unknown copyright status - notified with the cooresponding templates. These templates will replace the ones on the image and the bot will sign a date on the page to indicate when it first notified the person. I would also like for the bot to give second notification on the 5th or 6th day before the 7 day period, then final notification on the 7th day. On the 8th day, it will change the image page and add a {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} with the reason of: "User already warned automatically 3 times about changing copyright information on image. Final notice was given yesterday, at the end of the 7 day period mark." This bot will run daily every midnight on UTC.</p>
<p>Oh, and the notification text will be something that looks like this:</p>
<p>First notice:</p>

<li>I think it would be great for a bot to automate these notifications as they are a real pain to do manually. I think 3 notices might be excessive though.

<dd>It goes through the above categories. Unfortunately, it would have to make several notifications, one after another. The other alternative is for me to program it far more extensively to have it operate on a flatfile database, collect all the information on what user needs to be notified of what, notify them and change all the images there after. That would be invariably more complex than it is now, and far more time consuming for me to write. As for anything existing no source image over seven days old, it won't mark a speedy on those. Though, it could, but the point of the bot is to give the uploader notification of 7 days, THEN mark it with a speedy deletion tag. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 13:09, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree one notice is plenty. Either they ignore it, they aren't editing this week, or they respond to the first message, and multiple messages will just be annoying if they're ignoring it or not around. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 02:17, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It would definitely be annoying for someone to continually be getting image-deletion notices on their talk page while they were trying to edit. People who upload lots of images (assuming they are worth keeping) are making important contributions, and it would be nice to keep them happy. At least on the first run, a simple compromise might be to just drop a line and say, "We noticed you have uploaded multiple images with unknown source or copyright status. To avoid future messages like the one previously posted, you may wish to review your contributions and identify sources and licensing." But this risks them not knowing which 2 out of the 20 they uploaded were problematic, or someone deleting those while the bot was waiting (perhaps another 7 days) to posted the threatened messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could also just skip repeat customers on the first run, on the assumption that it will take a few days to run through all 20,000 or however many images need to be processed, and that a lot of people will probably check their other images after becoming aware that this might happen. I don't know which alternative is worse (annoyance or ignorance) but be prepared for complaints if you post more than two or three messages of the same kind to someone's user page in a relatively short timeframe. In the long run, will the bot check these categories every hour or every day or something? If it's hourly or thereabouts, I wouldn't worry about posting multiple messages. After the first one or two, they should get the idea, and stop uploading without attribution. It would be nice to batch-process, but I'd hate for that to delay implementation of this bot. Images are being deleted all the time, so people need to get notices ASAP. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 02:17, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, and what criteria does the bot use for marking {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}}? I would think that if anyone has edited either the image description page or the corresponding talk page since the notification, it should hold off and/or flag for manual review. And I presume responses to the bot owner's talk page would prevent an article being so flagged, if only through prompt manual intervention. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:23, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Issues</span></h3>
<p>There are some issues I'm trying to resolve. One of them is that the bot is over writing itself. My initial idea that I had for the project / program would that the bot would make a first pass on the category of images and move them into a notified category. After the 7 day period in the notified category, it would be presumed that the images can be deleted if they are still in that category. The problem now seems that I'd have to build up a list or category or a hash table based on repeat customers. A database may seem overkill, but it seems to me to be the most reasonable solution. We are talking about a great deal of images in that category that really need to be deleted and all the users need to be notified about them, even if they are not active no longer. This covers our butts from someone getting really pissed about an image deletion that they were not notified. It's more of a, "Yes, we did let you know, and you failed to do anything about it, so it's not our fault."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">301 redirects fixing</span></h2>
<p>As part of the project <a href="../../../d/e/a/Wikipedia%7EDead_external_links_8f0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dead external links">Wikipedia:Dead_external_links</a> I would like to fix 301 redirects. The bot will be run as <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhiviBot_07dc.html" title="User:KhiviBot">User:KhiviBot</a>.</p>
<p>This will be a manually assisted bot. It will be run using perl WWW-Mediawiki-Client-0.27. I believe cleaning up 301 redirects is a nice goal to have. Generating the list of url is a manual process since sometiimes the redirects might not be valid. Hence human intervention is needed to generate a list of url's. Once the url list is obtained then the bot can fix them.</p>
<p>Example of this is 114 instances of <a href="http://www.ex.ac.uk/trol/scol/ccleng.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ex.ac.uk/trol/scol/ccleng.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ex.ac.uk/trol/scol/ccleng.htm</a> .</p>

<dd>Seems like a good plan, only thing that has me slightly worried is that there could be people abusing HTTP 301 for temporary name changes or round robinning or such. Barring any examples of this actually happening I'd support a test run though. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 16:18, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds like a good idea, in general. The bot will need to retain the text which is displayed to the reader, if it already exists. It will also need to be excluded from talk pages of all namespaces. It might be prudent to exclude it from Wikipedia: space as well. There is one case where a simple replacement might do the wrong thing: if the URL is part of a citation that gives the date accessed. If the citation says "URL X, accessed on day A", then knowing both X and A, someone can find the document referenced on archive.org. The change we want to make is to "URL Y, accessed on day B", but a simple bot would do "URL Y, accessed on day A", which might not exist at archive.org. You might need to experiment a bit to find a heuristic to detect these cases and flag them for manual review. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 01:40, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bots and double redirects</span></h2>
<p>I notice <a href="../../../k/a/k/User%7EKakashi_Bot_ec07.html" title="User:Kakashi Bot">User:Kakashi Bot</a> is fixing double redirects like A -&gt; B -&gt; C, it sounds like by just assuming that A should point to C. Looking at <a href="../../../d/o/u/Special%7EDoubleRedirects_9b9f.html" title="Special:DoubleRedirects">Special:DoubleRedirects</a>, this is incorrect maybe 1% of the time. And many of the problems seem to occur with loops or bad human edits. Have we decided that any collateral damage here is acceptable, and in general, bots should just make this assumption? That would obviate the need for an entire project. Unless the bot could flag loops - that would be really handy. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:33, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see there are about 991 now, split across two pages. If we think this is OK, another run or two could clear these up entirely...I wonder how fast they are being created. Theoretically, this Special page is updated periodically. Hopefully, it's on a cron job, and it would be possible to put a bot on a cron job that ran just after the Special update. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>By the way, the list at Special page is only 80% to 90% accurate. There are some inaccuracies due to the fact that are some false positives in the data, which I reported as a bug already. The logic behind Kakashi Bot that I eventually wrote Kakashi Bot on the following premises:
<ol>
<li>If A <b>equals</b> C, then do nothing</li>
<li>If A exists <b>and</b> C exists <b>and</b> A is a redirect page <b>and</b> A <b>does not</b> redirect to C <b>and</b> A redirects to B, we assume B redirects to C and therefore redirecting A to C is not harmful.</li>
<li>If A's redirect target is not B, then do nothing and report the page as an error.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Of course, it would be far more logical not to trust the special page, find all the redirects that exist and find which of them are double, triple, etc redirects then have a bot operate on the following logic:</li>
<li>Premise: A is a double or more redirect.</li>
<li>In a <a href="../../../d/o/-/Do-while_loop.html" title="Do-while loop">do-while loop</a> fashion:
<ol>
<li>do:</li>
<li>if page X is redirect, add page X to queue Q, get the redirect target for page X, and set page X to the redirect target</li>
<li>else terminate the loop</li>
<li>(after the loop) Change all redirects in Q to point to X, which should be an article which all the redirects point to.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>That would technically solve all redirects. Of course, this is on the theory that all redirects in Q are valid moves and redirects. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 11:49, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though I think this simply makes the A-&gt;B-&gt;C rule transitive, it may have trouble with redirect loops. But anyway... -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 08:03, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After pondering what "safe" assumptions would be, I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's fine for redirect bots to assume that if A-&gt;B-&gt;C, A-&gt;C is OK, unless there's an exception</li>
<li>Exceptions:
<ul>
<li>There's any text on the page other than the redirect (such as a classification template)</li>
<li>There's a link to a subsection (check for "#" in the link)</li>
<li>A and C are the same page (A-&gt;B-&gt;A-&gt;B, etc.)</li>
<li>When starting to edit A, B turns out to be D (someone unexpectedly edited A)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beware <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3723" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:3723">Bugzilla:3723</a></li>
<li>Feature request <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3747" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:3747">Bugzilla:3747</a> is designed to reduce the number of double redirects created in the first place</li>
<li>Previous discussions:

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we'll see if there are any further complaints or problems. And yeah, querying a database directly would be great, though in the short run, I'm happy to have anything. Oh, and will someone be checking for double redirects that cannot be fixed automatically? It's fine with me if you want to just dump them into some category for random editors to fix. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 08:03, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
