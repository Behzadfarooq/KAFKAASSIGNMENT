<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tolkien Timeline Bot</span></h2>
<p>I can't help but notice (from hitting "Random page" over and over) that Wikipedia is chock full of information about Tolkien's universe, and that a bunch of it mirrors how Wikipedia treats the real universe. For example, just like there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Danish_monarchs_8df0.html" title="List of Danish monarchs">List of Danish monarchs</a>, there is also a list of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_Gondor_20df.html" title="Kings of Gondor">Kings of Gondor</a>. And if you look at, say, the page of the Gondorian king <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atanatar_II_0bc4.html" title="Atanatar II">Atanatar II</a>, you'll see one of those "preceded by/followed by" boxes, just like on the page of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_VI_of_Denmark_8c20.html" title="Eric VI of Denmark">Eric VI of Denmark</a>. So clearly, these Tolkien fans have put quite a bit of effort into their corner of Wikipedia. Furthermore, many and quite possibly most of these Tolkien-related pages mention some year or years in the fictional timeline. So, although I'm not particularly into Tolkien myself, I wonder if people would like to have "Tolkien years" pages similar to the existing "real years" pages (and similarly, decades pages, centuries pages, et cetera, and potentially stuff like "Middle-earth leaders by year" to echo the real life "leaders by year" pages). Tolkien pages could then link to [[2037 TA]] (i.e. "2037 Third Age"), for example, instead of just having it be plain text. If so, clearly a bot would be the way to go to build the base year/decade/century/etc. pages, which could then be populated by Tolkien fans at leisure. If people are interested, and there's not significant opposition, I might be willing to write such a bot (no promises yet). So, any interest or opposition? -<a href="../../../r/w/v/User%7ERwv37_36d4.html" title="User:Rwv37">Rwv37</a> 06:33, May 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I would think that there wouldn't be enough material to have individual year pages for Tolkien--hell, most of the real year pages are terrible (see <a href="../../../5/0/0/500.html" title="500">500</a>-<a href="../../../1/3/0/1300.html" title="1300">1300</a> for some prime examples). Honestly, more Tolkien isn't a huge priority for me, but I would support the idea if that's your thing. Just make sure you don't create a bunch of pages with no possible content. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> 06:44, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot to eliminate a lot of repetitive work on "List of encyclopedia topics"</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_encyclopedia_topics_47c4.html" title="Wikipedia:List of encyclopedia topics">Wikipedia:List_of_encyclopedia_topics</a> lists many, if not mostly, topics which should be redirects or diambig pages. Some are very obvious, such as all the counties. Other articles have been deemed so seldom worthy of entry to be siphoned off into another page (that is, the list of viruses.) Therefore, I'd like to write a script to do the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove viruses and worms from all the lists to be inserted into the list of viruses.</li>
<li>Remove user-created non-redirect articles with content over some number of characters.</li>
<li>Place all user-created redirects onto a page for scanning down by eye. For all those that seem sensible, they'll also be removed.</li>
<li>Compare every topic on the list with existing topics to determine if the names are different from current topics by the addition of words (the name of states or middle names in most cases). This will create a long list of script-proposed topics and redirect/disambiguation that I could scan for sensibility.</li>
<li>After scanning down the list, the script would make each disamb/redirect.</li>
<li>Finally, these would be removed from the lists, but rather than remove them from the numbered pages entirely, they'll be placed under a heading for each page so that other users can scan them for sensibility. The format would show both the old and redirected/disambiged links like "First Last -&gt; First M. Last" and "Some County -&gt; Some County, Texas &amp; Some Country, Maryland"</li>
</ol>
<p>I would try to make the script to edit each page on the list of topics once, but it would in all likelihood create thousands of redirect/disambig pages. The vast majority of these would be orphans. This has been discussed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EList_of_encyclopedia_topics_6d4d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:List of encyclopedia topics">Wikipedia talk:List of encyclopedia topics</a>. Basically, if the orphans are kosher, I think a script should be made to eliminate the easy ones. If they're a bad idea, I think this should be made immediately clear. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">CHL</a> 04:14, 14 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to clarify... What this bot is designed to do is to create redirects from "CityName, SN" to "CityName, State Name" so that, for instance, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica%2C_CA_0f6c.html" title="Santa Monica, CA">Santa Monica, CA</a> points to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica%2C_California_281b.html" title="Santa Monica, California">Santa Monica, California</a>, for all 30k Rambot articles, so that people can use the familiar US postal code abbreviations to locate the Rambot city articles. There are a couple sample redirects on the account <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethbot_5db6.html" title="User:Sethbot">User:Sethbot</a> from when I tested the bot, so you can see exactly what it does. -- <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 04:21, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure this is a good idea. I don't think the redirects the bot is going to make would be very useful, and I worry that they may encourage people to write the state abbreviations (which are meaningless for people like me who don't know them) in articles. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>

<dd>One thing that the redirects will discourage, however, is the creation of articles about these locations using the abbreviations (which does happen from time to time). They'll also make it much easier for people who work on the Rambot articles extensively (like me) to navigate to them more quickly with the "Go" button. This seems to fall within the two criterion of "alternative spellings" and "abbreviations" described on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_2592.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects">Wikipedia:redirects</a>. Furthermore, common misspellings are generally considered appropriate candidates for redirects, because they aid accidental linking (which, again, is intended to avert the creation of duplicate articles). -- <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 02:36, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you plan on converting <a href="../../../c/a/_/CA_3e8d.html" title="CA">CA</a> into a redirect to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> replacing the list of multiple uses we currently have (see also <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_and_abbreviations_b498.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation and abbreviations">Disambiguation and abbreviations</a> ) I don't see the advantage .. If you just want to add redirects as suggested on <a href="../../../i/s/o/Talk%7EISO_3166-2_5821.html" title="Talk:ISO 3166-2">Talk:ISO_3166-2</a> (end of page) this may help, but the issue raised at the beginning of the page may stil need to be resolved. -- User:Docu</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, I just read <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethbot_5db6.html" title="User:Sethbot">User:Sethbot</a> (it says "CityName, SN redirects to CityName, StateName"), ok .. if you want to. Not sure if it's really very useful, but it will definitely be more likely that people will be using them when writing. You may want to add a msg to the redirect (see <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediaWiki_custom_messages_c678.html#Redirect_pages" title="Wikipedia:MediaWiki custom messages">Wikipedia:MediaWiki_custom_messages#Redirect_pages</a> ) -- User:Docu</dd>

<dd>Regardless, these redirects are entirely consistent with current redirect guidelines on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_2592.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects">Wikipedia:Redirects</a>. These are probably good candidates for &lt;nowiki&gt;&#160;</dd>

<hr />
<p>This is a redirect from a title with an abbreviation.</p>
<p>For more information, follow the category link. &lt;/nowiki&gt;, or perhaps a new msg should be created for this purpose. The bottom line is that I want these redirects because 1) they make sense, and 2) they'd make jumping between rambot articles significantly faster. -- <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 04:21, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's much clearer now that there is an explication. BTW I'd create a msg for specially for these redirects, e.g. {{msg:R_from_state_code_format}} -- User:Docu</dd>

<p>I just wanted to add my thoughts here. The sethbot is great and all, but one must make sure what when redirecting from [[City, ST]] to [[City, State]] that the [[City, State]] article is not a disambiguation page. In the situation where there is more than one City in the same state with the same name, then that page should be a disambiguation page, not a redirect. I have the full database of all the names of the cities in my database and in the future was planning to do just this. Whatever sethbot misses I will take care of later, but I will also make sure that a redirect vs. a disambiguation page is used appropriately. --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">rambot</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm a bit confused: Why wouldn't we want <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germantown%2C_MD_9fd8.html" title="Germantown, MD">Germantown, MD</a> to point to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germantown%2C_Maryland_2bbb.html" title="Germantown, Maryland">Germantown, Maryland</a>? The redirect would point to the disambigation page, and that still facilitates finding the relevant article. The Sethbot pulls the list of articles off of Special:Allpages, so it should catch any articles that end in ", StateName" -- <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 16:46, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Duh, I wasn't thinking. Good thing I didn't start the process myself!&#160;;-) The Allpages sounds great. I guess I have no concerns then. Please disregard what I said above. Carry on. Oh one more thing: Are you checking to make sure that the article you are redirecting to is also not a redirect? We don't want double redirects.

<dd>Actually, it is not. The code Seth is probably referring to, is code that checks whether the page to be created already exists. In this case it is of course not created, and the operator is given a notification; the notification is different depending on whether the page is a normal page, a redirect page redirecting to the thing we intend to let a redirect to or a redirect page to somewhere else. If wanted, I'll program this functionality in, should be a matter of minutes only. - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 08:59, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Probably a moot point by now, but I support this bot. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 21:27, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Um, I do support this bot, but I actually think the two-letter state abbrviation should be lowercase--having it uppercase means (because of the odd mixed case) it won't be found by most users typing it in the search box, since they are likely to use all lower case (all lowercase also means it still gets found if they enter it the "right" way). I believe making them lowercase would also reduce (probably greatly) the 'using the abbreviation in articles' problem, as [[City, SN]] (which I believe is what most contributors would use in articles) would show as a red-link. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 22:39, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know if this will ever be needed on the English Wikipedia, but in case it is, I would like to get a consensus on using it before it's actually needed. Angbot is a deletion bot using the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/PyWikipediaBot" class="extiw" title="m:PyWikipediaBot">PyWikipediaBot</a> code (like the interlanguage-linking bots). The bot is only to be used in cases of mass page-creation vandalism. It was written in response to the recent situation at the Chinese Wikipedia where around 3000 pages needed to be deleted. The bot does not run autonomously. It simply makes the deletion process need one click instead of about four. I give it a list of pages to delete, it fetches those and displays each one to me in turn. I have to confirm whether I really want to delete the page. Is there any objection to running this on en if it's ever needed? It would not be used for normal deletion - only for very large cases of vandalism that would otherwise take hours to clear up. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 17:33, May 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wclarkbot</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to use various bot scripts under the account Wclarkbot. The first project I'd use a bot for would be to either move existing BC/AD pages to BCE/CE variants or else create BCE/CE redirects to the BC/AD pages (depending on the outcome of the discussion over at <strike>the Village Pump</strike> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)</a>).--<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 04:26, 2004 Jul 11 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually... in looking through some of the dates pages, it seems that a good deal of maintenance is needed anyway. For example, some otherwise empty dates are redirects to their appropriate decade (which makes sense) but other date pages are simply missing. In addition to any BCE redirects (since that's the way it seems to be leaning) I would most likely use a bot to make sure all date pages exist or at least redirect to their appropriate decade.--<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 05:51, 2004 Jul 11 (UTC)</p>
<p>I <i><b>strongly</b></i> object to even making this change, let alone having a bot do it. 05:57, Jul 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What change are you talking about? If you have a take on the BCE vs. BC issue, you can discuss it at <strike>the Village pump</strike> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)</a>. As I already pointed out, it looks like there's not going to be any consensus on switching to BCE. If you have an objection to creating redirects from <a href="../../../3/0/0/300_BCE_d8ea.html" title="300 BCE">300 BCE</a> to <a href="../../../3/0/0/300_BC_9fcc.html" title="300 BC">300 BC</a> (for example) I'd like to hear them.--<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 06:00, 2004 Jul 11 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also strongly disagree with this change on the grounds that BC/AD are more common designations. BCE can be used in academia, but wikipedia is for every user. Moreover, i frequently read books on ancient history (my neardy hobby) and i can tell that BC/AD is <i>at least</i> as common as the ACE notation. I am also astonished with the suggestion that BC (before Christ) might be offensive to non cristhians. This is to much of a radical change for one single user like Wclark (although certainly with good intentions) to make. I think this deserves at least a poll. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel G</a> 17:31, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

The question is whether anyone has any objections to a bot that <b>EITHER</b> renames BC pages to BCE versions (and creates appropriate redirects), <b>OR</b> creates BCE redirects to BC pages, <b>depending on what type of consensus is reached</b> (if any) in the other discussion. The way things are looking now, I'd most likely be using a bot to create the redirects from BCE to BC pages. If you have any objections to <i>that</i> then please raise them here, otherwise see the other discussion page.--<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 17:45, 2004 Jul 11 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since too many people are currently opposed to using BCE as the Wikipedia standard, I just went ahead and created all the remaining BCE -&gt; BC redirect pages by hand (there were only a few hundred of them that needed to be done). So I don't need Wclarkbot to do this anymore. HOWEVER, there are plenty of pages that need to have [[333 BC|333 BCE]] style dates converted to [[333 BCE]] (at least 500 of them, based on a very simple search). I'd like to use a bot to help me with some of that, and to check for other date formatting issues. Any objections to the modified proposal? --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 05:38, 2004 Jul 12 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see any objections that apply. Your complaint seems to be with switching over the actual pages to the BCE convention and making the BC pages redirects. I haven't done that, and never said I was going to do that <i>unless that was the consensus decision</i>. Again, if you have a complaint with using BCE redirects to the BC pages (so that those who prefer the BCE convention can simply link dates as [[333 BCE]] rather than having to do [[333 BC|333 BCE]], and also to ease tracking of BCE usage) -- or with my using a bot to alter these links -- I'd like to hear them. What I SHOUTED was not an opinion but a reiteration of my proposal (which most of those replying, including you, seemed to misunderstand). I don't follow what you mean by "countour objections" so could you please elaborate (perhaps on my <a href="../../../w/c/l/User_talk%7EWclark_0d71.html" title="User talk:Wclark">talk page</a> if you think this is the wrong place for the discussion)? --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 15:46, 2004 Jul 13 (UTC)</dd>
