<dd>Generally the "rule" on bot flags was to do with edits a minute rather than total edits. I was told 2 edits a min + flag it, otherwise it's not really necessary and likely more work for our 'crats.</dd>

<dd>I don't see any harm in flagging the bots, so either way works - the no-botflag thing was to reduce work for the 'crats. -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 07:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well bot flagging is incredibly easy for us.

<p>My bot is approved to tag uncategorised articles of various flavours, and there's a rather large backlog of these in the Jan. db dump. Many of these are very short articles, so it's probably more pragmatically useful to tag these with {tl|stub}}, rather than with {{<a href="../../../u/n/c/Template%7EUncat_fb5e.html" title="Template:Uncat">uncat</a>}}. The code would be identical (with an extra double-check for length of "live" article), and the effect very similar (unsorted stub vs. uncategorised article), but I thought I'd double-check with the BAG if it's felt that this would need separate task approval. I've already mentioned this at both <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_7aa0.html" title="WP:WSS">WP:WSS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/c/CAT%7ENOCAT_8fd0.html" title="CAT:NOCAT">CAT:NOCAT</a>, and I'll of course act in line with what they suggest for length threshold, whether the entire idea is a plan, etc. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:48, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not a BAG member, but I'd recommend that you get separate approval. {{<a href="../../../u/n/c/Template%7EUncat_fb5e.html" title="Template:Uncat">uncat</a>}} is objective and {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} is subjective, and although I'm not sure whether this is enough of a difference to prevent a bot adding {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} tags, I think it's enough of a difference that you should at least request approval for the new task. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 09:24, 29 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

<p>While I don't disagree that the discussion on the bot function is better discussed at the talk page for the relevant MoS, I am concerned that there has been no discussion about whether or not a bot should be allowed to continue when editors have raised concerns. The bot has currently been suspended by its operator&#160;:-) (31 Jan) but was not when concerns were first raised:</p>

<dd>I am not on the approvals group, though I imaging the approval will be suspended if and when there is a clear consensus to do so. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 21:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No one in the approvals group has responded to my or other concerns despite my comments here and also on the bot approval page. There is no apparent procedure for objecting to a bot's activities or for obtaining consensus to suspend. If the bot had not stopped voluntarily ... these edits will be hard to reverse, particularly the longer the discussion takes about the MoS and none of the date discussions have ever been quick or conclusive.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 21:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The way I see it, this is not a problem with the bot, but a disagreement with the function the bot is serving. Since the bot operator has stopped voluntarily, what action should the group take? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 21:36, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The bot carried on for more than 24 hours after objections were raised - ie voluntary cessation was not nearly quick enough. The operator even carried on ignoring queries altogether at one point until blocked for the purpose of drawing his attention to discussion querying his activities. This is a problem with the bot if it is not carrying out a universally agreed function. The MoS does not say for example that years must be linked for date preferences to work - for yearless dates, the MOS only deprecates the same because context might be lost (ie the date refers to this year but next year that might not be clear. The MoS does not mention date preferences as a reason for including the year. See <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Yearless_dates" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Yearless dates</a>. As Akradecki has pointed out, there has been discussion about piped dates - I do not think there is concensus to deprecate the piped year link <a href="../../../p/i/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EPiped_link_49c7.html#Disagree_with_year-in-x_no-piping_suggestion" title="Wikipedia talk:Piped link">one recent discussion</a>. Moreover, I note that <a href="../../../p/i/p/Wikipedia%7EPiped_link_ad60.html" title="Wikipedia:Piped link">Wikipedia:Piped link</a> is not even a guideline, it is a how-to. Akradecki also points out that some preferences are overridden in some contexts, for example resizing of thumbnails. Another user (in another discussion) has pointed out that mass edits to change dates are deprecated.</dd>
<dd>My question is though, what does it take to stop a bot? Where are the instructions to seek suspension so that a discussion can be had? As an admin I did not feel comfortable bout blocking the bot, I felt I had to to get the user to respond, having responded he kept on his merry way and I see no opportunity under the blocking policy to stop him again - what would stop him?--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 21:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please stop saying that I was ignoring queries until you blocked my bot. I already explained to you that the bot run in automatic mode. I wasn't around at that particular moment. <a href="../../../j/o/g/User%7EJogers_106b.html" title="User:Jogers">Jogers</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/g/User_talk%7EJogers_9401.html" title="User talk:Jogers">talk</a>) 23:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>A bot can be blocked for many reasons, by any admin. While the approvals group's permission is needed to run a bot, this permission does not guarantee community acceptance. I don't see how the bot approval group revoking permission to this bot would have helped this situation, considering any admin has the power to stop the bot, and the community has the power to agree to stop it. I still am not sure that the consensus is against this bot. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I can't see how you can see consensus one way or the other. At <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_Jogersbot_5d89.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Jogersbot">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Jogersbot</a> all I can see is an application by Jogers, discussion from three other editors, only one of which was really addressing the function itself. In the discussion Jogers notes potential for controversy "There is a long-standing guideline on WikiProject Music saying that piped links to "years in music" shouldn't be used at all. This seems to be somehow controversial though." Jogers has only dealt with one project, there are other projects which use the year in xxxx format, he did not consult with them. Above I have noted 5 overt objections.

<dd>That is an additional justification to block a bot, the standard reasons for blocking still apply to a bot. If you think it is going against consensus, talk to the human in charge, if they don't respond a block may be in order.

<p>As the approver of this bot, I think it is best to temporarily suspend operations of this bot until consensus can be reached by all relevant WikiProjects about whether they want the change for their particular "xxxx in yyyy" series. Jogers, I recommend you go around to the different applicable projects and attempt to gain consensus, and then on your userpage post a link to the consensus for each project. Once consensus has been reached for a particular project, then you can start changing their "xxxx in yyyy" links. I should also mention that blocking a bot is <i>no big deal</i>. Look at some of the best bots; they've been blocked numerous times, sometimes for very trivial reasons. â€”<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 22:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I <i>did</i> try rushing people, and see where it got me.&#160;:) (No comments at all in 5+ days...) On SelketBot: that raises the more general point of "when is an edit too minor to be worth doing at all?" (or relatedly, to be worth doing en masse). I must admit I've made edits by hand just to move a comma or period (typically to MoSify "aesthetic quotes", especially if they're used inconsistently, or in articles using Commonwealth English)). It's hard to argue that where there's a clear consensus (or painfully hammered-out style guidance, as the case may be) that articles shouldn't be put into conformance with it; but equally, it hardly seems like an urgent matter. So firstly, is there actually a clear consensus for this particular matter, as a style issue? Would it be worth testing same with a trial run, and waiting a week afterwards to see if people irately put them back, or complain? (Acceptance in practice may be a different matter from apparent agreement on the guideline page.) And, is it worth considering "low priority status" for bot tasks there's general acceptance of being carried out, but are extremely minor in nature? That is, they'd be subject to tighter constraints on edit rate and times and days of operation. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:30, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think that something that causes great delays in the bot approval process are requests which are very specific and not for a standard task. For example, Alai, I don't know if there has been consensus for the tasks that your bots wants to do, or really the effects of the task, since I'm not very familiar with that area (<a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_7aa0.html" title="WP:WSS">WP:WSS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/c/CAT%7ENOCAT_8fd0.html" title="CAT:NOCAT">CAT:NOCAT</a>). Something that would speed those approvals up would be a links to a place where consensus was formed, the task was discussed, and relevant policies, etc. Simple requests like <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_User%7EHBC_AIV_helperbot2_bfca.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/User:HBC AIV helperbot2">this</a> get approved in 6 minutes, and other requests don't. â€”<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 02:36, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>A question about the approval time has already been posed earlier (<a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_5816.html#Question_about_approval_time" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Requests for approval">Question about approval time</a>). But I don't think the question was really answered there, so I am posting it again. How long does it take to approve/disapprove a bot? I'm particularly interested in the maximum time it takes after all questions were answered.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html#Organization" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">Requests for approvals page</a> describes the time as <i>reasonable</i> which is a poor statement in my opinion, because it basically doesn't say anything. It's unprofessional and intransparent.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBot_policy_228c.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Bot policy">bot policy</a> article says, it might take <i>up to one week</i>. This would be a good time span, I think, and nobody will be angry when you're faster than that. Well, the reason why I'm writing this is that I posted my request for approval ten days ago and didn't even receive a comment from an approval group member yet. So, unfortunately, the goal to decide within a week seems unrealistic at the moment. I'm personally a bit disappointed but I hope my criticism here is constructive and my tone neutral anyway. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bot approval group should define a reasonable, realistic maximum decision time. This time can of course be exceeded when further discussion on a request is needed and <i>done</i>. I think that everyone will understand that.</li>
<li>Once defined, this time span should be the only one named at all relevant pages.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the group members currently look at the requests individually and comment on what they are interested in. Please find a way to make sure all requests are reviewed adequately. Assign the responsibility to one of your group members, if a request didn't get an answer after a few days. Or make a bot that notifies all group members if a request hasn't been reviewed within a certain timeâ€¦</li>
<li>The approval group should appoint new members (I saw that some already applied) if you feel that that you cannot answer all requests appropriately within the defined time.</li>
<li>The bot approval group could profit from someone with management skills â€” there's no reason why all group members must be bot experts themselves. You might be able to improve the coordination of approvals with someone focusing on managing the procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd be happy to hear the opinion of more than one approval group member. <small>Please don't comment on my bot here (I'm just adding this because that's how the discussion about the approval time went off-topic <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_5816.html#Question_about_approval_time" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Requests for approval">last time</a>).</small> â€” <a href="../../../o/c/o/User%7EOcolon_d9b7.html" title="User:Ocolon">Ocolon</a> 19:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If everything worked perfectly on this project, we'd be done.&#160;:) It's not so anything that needs doing needs someone to do it. If you can help with any of the above please do. The suggestion on a bot to track requests isn't a bad idea, something like <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFASUM_5aee.html" title="WP:RFASUM">WP:RFASUM</a> that lists the last time each bot request has been edited and perhaps the last time edited by a BAG memeber.

<dd>Echo much of Taxman, note though that although BAG doesn't have official "clerks", anyone is welcome to help with the clerk work. Some bag members only have expertise in some types of bots, and don't weigh in on other kinds, so that can lead to delay until they are reviewed. Although there are "time limits" in many project areas, such as xFD, RFA, etc; these are not "rules" and mroe reflect the community standard. Often bot requests are not out there to serve an urgent need of the community at large, and when they are (such as the replacement of recent high profile archiving bots) they are usually sent to speedy trials. â€” <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype">xaosflux</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 01:38, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree as well. Anyone at all who is familiar with a certain area can weigh in on a bot approval; confirmation from someone familiar with that area is very helpful in bot approvals. â€”<span style="color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M<small>ETS</small>501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 03:04, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I definitely agree with you on this point. I didn't mean to belittle comments by non BAG members, they are as valuable as those of BAG members. But someone has to decide finally and the decision is made by a bot approval group member. I also see your point on the problem with enforcing deadlines on volunteer work. You're right. But when there's a chance to have a new, qualified BAG member, please take it. It will most probably reduce the approval time and the amount of request reviewing everyone of you has to do.</dd>
<dd>I'm going to add a bot tracking approval requests as described by <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> to <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBot_requests_273d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bot requests">Wikipedia:Bot_requests</a>.

HighInBC had a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Approvals_group_b90f.html#Request_to_join_bot_approval_group" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Approvals group">recent request</a> to join and the advice given at that time was to become more active commenting on bots. After a cursory look, I'd say that there have probably not been enough edits since then to merit a change. Now I have not looked in major detail, but I'd at least be willing to endorse Martinp23 for candidacy/consideration, but I'd suggest that HighInBC take the previous advice and become more active. Hopefully some BAG members will comment here soon. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 02:46, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Let's wait a while and see if some other BAG members bother to comment, but if not, I'll just make the appointment without discussion. Again, HighInBC needs to comment more on bot proccedings or else make a strong case for why such experience doesn't matter (due perhaps to other knowledge). -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 20:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The letter of the law states that all tasks performed automatically must have approval. Now, in the face of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">IAR</a> and such, there is clearly some flexibility here. For example, if you use a bot without approval or for an unapproved task, you might get blocked. There have been cases where a bot operator was faced with a task that needed to be done in 24 hours, and as such he just went ahead and did it without approval. In cases like this, you need to judge whether or not what you are doing is controversial and be ready to answer for it if something goes wrong. Still, we have been reasonable in many cases. It is not uncommon for operators of interwiki bots to not be aware of the complex approvals process here on en and thus perform operations without seeking approval. In general if you have never run a bot, you should probably not be running unauthorized tasks ever. If you have a bot that's been approved and have performed some number of successful tasks, then you can use a bit more judgement. It's always a good idea to at least notify us of a new task. If it would be more work to go through an approvals process than it would be to actually do the task, then that may be one of those times. Of course no matter what you do, if you do it without approval, you do so at your own risk. Be warned! Perhaps we need a process for "request for quick approvals" or some such thing. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 20:45, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's based on trust. You just have to trust that the person is approving all edits and not doing it automatically. Basically, what RM and I are saying is to use your judgment. If a task needs doing, generally it's a good idea to seek approval, but if there is an urgent need for a small task and it is clearly, clearly uncontroversial (such as removing a deleted template), then you can go ahead and do it with an already-approved bot. â€”<span style="color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M<small>ETS</small>501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 01:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hallo, in oct. 2006 I asked for a botflag for my PortalBot. Now I read, that something has expired (?). I need the bot not every week, but in sometimes, I need it. Is there a way to get the botflag now&#160;? <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugiasstallputzer_5d8b.html" title="User:Augiasstallputzer">Augiasstallputzer</a> 22:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
