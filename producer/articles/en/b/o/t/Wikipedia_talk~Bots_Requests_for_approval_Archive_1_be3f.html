<h3><span class="mw-headline">Request for clarification&#160;: when is a bot approved here?</span></h3>
<p>Hi, I am <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_38fc.html" title="User:Walter">user:Walter</a>. I ask this in the function as steward. When user comes on Meta to ask for bot-status for EN Wikipedia it is not always clear for me of he has approval or not.</p>
<p>2 cases/examples;</p>
<p>Case 1</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_bot_status#en:User:CmdrObot" class="extiw" title="meta:Requests_for_bot_status">meta:Requests_for_bot_status#en:User:CmdrObot</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:User:CmdrObot" class="extiw" title="w:en:User:CmdrObot">w:en:User:CmdrObot</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a listing about this bot on the correct page. But there was no responds from the community.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approvals_904a.html#User:CmdrObot" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approvals">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approvals#User:CmdrObot</a></li>
</ul>
<p>User Fetofs responded that the bot is not approved. That it only can be rejected. And also point to the text on the top of that page. That seems strange to me because a request that has received no responds is not rejected. And not rejected is approved by default. But I possibly do not understand it. That is why I ask clarification about the process here.</p>
<p>Case 2</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_bot_status#en:User:Rschen7754bot" class="extiw" title="meta:Requests_for_bot_status">meta:Requests_for_bot_status#en:User:Rschen7754bot</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschen7754bot_6f46.html" title="User:Rschen7754bot">User:Rschen7754bot</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is discussion about its bot-status on <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Archive_13_c776.html#Rschen7754bot" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Archive 13">Wikipedia_talk:Bots/Archive_13#Rschen7754bot</a></p>
<p>According user Rschen7754 this is a community approval for bot-status. For me that is not so clear.</p>
<p>I like to get some advice so I do not need to ask users to take steps that are not needed but also that I only give bot-status with community approval. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_38fc.html" title="User:Walter">Walter</a> 15:32, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry if I didn't made myself clear. This second case is pretty clear - that was the place to request bot-status, and by the old rule, as that bot was not rejected, it was approved by default. My hunch is that this rule is also valid for the first bot, due to the lack of votes in that bot and previous bots, but I'd wait a while for confirmation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For future concerns, I suggest you take every bot in that area as approved by default. <b><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs"><font color="blue">F</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><i>e</i></font></a><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs"><font color="blue">tofs</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../f/e/t/User_talk%7EFetofs_75a9.html" title="User talk:Fetofs"><font color="maroon">Hello!</font></a></sup> 21:56, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for you responds. I find it very disappointing that the EN Wikipedia is so unclear about it bot policy. Other Wikis do that much better. I will consider nominations without responds as granted by default. --<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_38fc.html" title="User:Walter">Walter</a> 14:52, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It has always stated in the "rules" that the bot must wait a week to gather "rough consensus" before running, but in general they have assumed as unless opposed, then granted. Also, this page is rather new, before the discussion where directly on the bot talk page, so often the requests where lost in the page and forgotten, there was almost no procedure for approving and/or dissaproving a bot, I hope this can be better now. <sub>â†’<font style="color:#975612"><a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaToth_9bb9.html" title="User:AzaToth">A</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">z</font></a><a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaToth_9bb9.html" title="User:AzaToth">a</a></font><a href="../../../a/z/a/User_talk%7EAzaToth_5ca3.html" title="User talk:AzaToth"><font style="color:#325596">Toth</font></a></sub> 00:29, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There are two pages, Wikipedia:Requested bot flags and <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Approval_log_d863.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Approval log">Wikipedia:Bots/Approval log</a>, available for notifying bureaucrats of the need, and permission, to flag a bot.

They merely check whether it is technically feasible and fail to see if the bot's owner has informed anyone else, a project page, a process page, the pumps, the noticeboards: in short, anywhere but their own back yard. Please, would you apply some sense to the approvals and make sure that those likely to be affected by tens, or in some cases hundreds of these pseudo-trials have actually had a chance to say something about them.

<p><font color="#7B68EE">I think that creating a hard, inflexible limit on how many edits a bot may make during a trial is a very bad idea, especially since problems with bots often don't present themselves until they've made far more than 250 edits. I would, however, not be totally opposed to, as has been suggested, having the members of the bot approvals group mandate on a case-by-case basis how many edits each bot may make during its trial runs. In any case, though, I do not believe the real issue is how many edits bots in their trial runs are making, but rather that no one is closely watching these bots. Perhaps the answer is simply to draw attention to these newly approved bots, through what means I do not know--perhaps we could seek volunteers to closely monitor the edits made by bots in their trial runs and readily block any one that even appears to be editing strangely. I think that if we could gain more eyes closely reviewing bots in their trial runs then perhaps some of these mishaps could be avoided in the futire. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 04:21, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

Given the fact that approving a bot requires a degree of expertise, the first choice seems the best to me. I could of course be mistaken.
