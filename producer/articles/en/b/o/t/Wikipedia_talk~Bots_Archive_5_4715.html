<dd>I have signed the RfC that exists against you. I think you have vandalized in the past. I do not trust you not to vandalize in the future. I do not think you should have a bot. This is simple. This is straightforward. And this is something you entirely brought upon yourself by repeatedly causing trouble. You reap what you sow. As I've said, go a month without causing trouble, I'll withdraw my objection. But, quite frankly, PMing me in IRC to call me a "pre-eminent fuck" repeatedly does not make me think you should be trusted with a bot.

<dd>So which is it, categories or templates? Can you show any diffs where the bot "messed up" an article? You blocked because it was one of your templates which was removed, not because of any remote damage the bot was doing. You didn't even inform me on my talk page. Not only did you block the bot, but you blocked my live account and IP address - something the bot/blocking policy expressly forbids. After all, if I myself had manually removed the template, would youhave blocked me directly? Don't abuse your privileges to win fights. I suggest you read up on those policies, rather than make nasty comments. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 02:40, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unless anyone actually voices any objections to the <i>edits</i> that this bot (which uses standard pywikipediabot scripts) is performing, then its use will continue. I have always invited review of the entire edit history.

<dd>Snowspinner's objection was to <i>me</i>, not the bot. He raised that objection before I even started using it. Anyway, the "trust" issue is null because I've said I have no need or desire for a bot flag. Without that, the edits by the bot are visible on Recentchanges. I saw removal of the template you mentioned as pretty obvious and non-controversial. It was also completely reversible had any reasonably calm objection been noted at the time. This is all a tempest in a teapot. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 07:16, 2005 Jan 13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would've been true, if the vote had concluded. As I recall, <i>at the time</i>, Brockert was the only one that had commented on TFD request (which I myself nominated). This was not some shady attempt at bypassing the process -- I just really thought he wasn't aware of the typical use of templates and thought I'd save him the trouble of having to re-edit the pages to remove the template. I only ran the bot because I didn't want to manually do that either. It's not like any text was lost, nor was it something I couldn't have reverted immediately if there was a complaint. I apparently misread him, and now have been the target of his attention. I only wish there had been some good faith assumptions, and that he'd asked me on my talk apge about. It's hard, but people have to remember that launching into tirades is rarely productive. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 08:41, 2005 Jan 13 (UTC)

<p>Reading this whole thing has left me slightly dizzy. All I know is that when I took at look at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a> on 7 January, it was up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=9181040" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=9181040" rel="nofollow">well over 200KB</a> long. After a fair amount of work (I spent a good part of two days on it), it was down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=9248203" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;oldid=9248203" rel="nofollow">about 170KB</a>. Unfortunately, all the easy entries had been done. Basically all of the remaining ones need have have category entries in article deleted and/or changed, and doing that by hand is really painful. I did some (e.g. <a href="../../../g/o/v/Category%7EGovernment_of_North_Carolina_faec.html" title="Category:Government of North Carolina">Category:Government of North Carolina</a>) by hand, and it was a real drag (literally - with the Wikipedia being so slow).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, now <i>both</i> bots that were lending a hand with doing the grunt-work are now offline - the Pearl bot because it was doing things inefficiently, and this one because people don't want Netoholic running a bot.</p>
<p>(Although I'm sort of confused as to why - the bot isn't doing anything he can't do manually. Maybe Netoholic should write a program to generate "script" pages, like the one NickJ generates for adding Redirects - Netoholic can then cut-and-paste the resulting text into sub-pages of his user pages, and then open up a couple of browser windows on his PC, and go from window to window clicking on "Do it"/"Save page" links. It only take 4 mouse clicks for each one - I got to the point with NickJ's pages where I could keep 4 browers windows busy. How this differs in results from a slow-running bot is beyond me, but as far as I can see it's perfectly allowable.)</p>
<p>Anyway, as far as bots go, naybe there's a way to finesse the whole situation with Netoholic. How about one of the objectors to Netoholic running this bot instead runs a bot themselves to do <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a> stuff, then? I note that despite a lot of people's hard work, CfD is still a massive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=9343126" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=9343126" rel="nofollow">150KB</a>.

The result of shooting people in the park is destructive (socially, ethically), whilst the result of running this bot is constructive (performs useful work).

<dd>As long as we're talking logic, your justification for labeling my argument a straw man is based on a false premise: that the bot is uncontroversially productive in a positive way.

<p>I find this all very unfair, and spiteful, considering I have never done a thing to injure Wikipedia or cause strife. Although I have had disagreements with a few people here, I would never consider putting my thumb down on them if they are voicing a genuine request to help Wikipedia. I have approached every single objector here at one time or another and openly offered to work towards a mutually beneficial environment here, but I can't <i>make</i> people meet me half-way. None of this is about a bot, it's about people taking things the wrong way, holding grudges over unrelated events, and teaming up to kick me when I'm down. I'm fortunate that at least a few people have seen that I work here in complete good faith, and I hope the rest do as well, someday. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 20:45, 2005 Jan 14 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Netoholic, the basic problem is that you are flaunting policy here. You state repeatedly that you no longer desire to get a bot flag, and will just run the bot and expect that the contributions will be sufficient. The bot policy on wikipedia is fairly straightforward; while you did comply with the first step of listing it here, you never followed through with actually getting the bot marked as a bot for approval at h<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/requests_for_permissions" class="extiw" title="m:requests_for_permissions">m:requests for permissions</a>. Unfortunately, the issue has become so charged now that if you were to submit it there now it would be rejected for sure. I wish that we could just contact all parties involved in this dispute, and allow you to start the bot submission/approval procedure over from the very beginning. I'm not sure how exactly to go abou this- perhaps it requires a dispute resolution of some kind. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 21:59, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, "<i>flaunting policy</i>" is pretty strong language, since that is not my intent at all. My idea of not pushing for a bot flag was to try and bring compromise to this. If the actions could be monitored more easily, and the bot run slowly (2 edits per minute max), then objectors would be satisfied. I have no opinion either way. The problem with the "approval" system here is that it's most often done via tacit approval, a request sits here for a week with no replies and it's done, particularly for using the well-known pywikipediabot framework. Heck, I can't even find the discussions for many of the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bots listed as approved</a>. If people will agree to a "do over", we can try that.

<dd>Malfunctions happen. You can't predict every possible situation, so when you find something going wrong, the bot should be stopped immediately, the problem fixed, and the bot re-started, possibly with a note on the talk page about what happened.

But at anytime if there is a problem, I'd stop immediately. I've notified a few bot owners myself, and been largely ignored and had to ask for blocks, so I understand. Luckily, until this discussion started, noone has complained about it breaking an article. Even then, only two minor problems have been noted.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Moving category intro text for CFD</span></h3>
<p>I have used a new capability to fix the intro text in first two subcategories of Category:Japanese prefectures. The problem was when there is a long list of categories to be renamed, she was able to move articles and subcategories, but not intro text. The problem with intro text is that there might be some on both the source and destination pages, and a simple combination might be the wrong thing to do. Human intervention is needed to verify these moves and merges. I run Pearle in two steps. First, a TRANSFER_TEXT_CHECK command makes some suggestions about what the source and destination categories should be changed to. It automatically deals with {{cfd}} tags, merges lists of categories, and trims excess whitespace. Where the suggestion is wrong, I fix the text manually. Where the suggestion is correct, I simply run TRANSFER_TEXT_ACTUALLY with the same arguments, and the suggestion is automatically implemented.</p>
<p>Pearle is currently renaming subcategories Category:Japanese prefectures so that "prefecture" is capitalized where appropriate. I have scheduled a TRANSFER_TEXT_ACTUALLY run immediately thereafter, which will fix intro texts (which should also create the correct category hierarchy). Please let me know if you have any qualms about Pearle doing this on a routine basis to categories approved by <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> for deletion. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 00:23, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had previously replied on <a href="../../../p/e/a/User_talk%7EPearle_bd75.html" title="User talk:Pearle">User talk:Pearle</a> (since archived). When I first wrote the code, I had abstracted reads and writes, and so recycled this for moves, which unfortunately resulted in doing two edits in rapid succession in an attempt to make the move quasi-atomic. After reading the above discussion about server load, I decided to fix this problem. So, as it happens, by the time I noticed the complaint, the offending code had been re-written. Moves are now accomplished in one edit. At the same time, I added more sophisticated load-monitoring logic, so now Pearle waits extra-long if Wikipedia is running slow. Apologies for the load caused by the earlier double-edits. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 22:40, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="Q_.26_A_Round_1" id="Q_.26_A_Round_1"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Q &amp; A Round 1</span></h3>
<p>So I've done a few test runs of code to fix articles to conform to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interwiki links are at the bottom of a page.</li>
<li>Category links are above interwiki links.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several complications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people make invalid interwiki links</li>
<li>Sometimes people accidentally say [[Category:Foo]] when you mean [[:Category:Foo]]</li>
<li>HTML comments are sometimes interspersed with category and interwiki links, and sometimes these comments refer to the interwiki and category links.</li>
<li>Category and interwiki links are sometimes at the top of the page</li>
<li>Category and interwiki links are sometimes interspersed with body text or template tags</li>
<li>Sort order questions for category and interwiki links</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three very common types of invalid interwiki link, each of which starts with one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>zh-cn</li>
<li>minnan</li>
<li>zh-tw</li>
</ul>
<p>I can run an automated scan to detect all links with colons in them that don't go to a valid external wiki or a valid internal page. What would I do with this information? Make a long list on some page and hope that others come by to clean it up? Tag each article (or its talk page) with a template that indicates the presence of an invalid link (and hope others fix them)?</p>
<p>I am also wondering whether all "minnan" links should just be automatically converted to "zh-min-nan"? Should all "zh-tw" links be converted to "tw"? Would that leave "zh-cn" to "zh"? (Are these Chinese languages? I haven't bothered looking them up.)</p>
<p><br />
I started off with an algorithm that simply pulled all the valid category and interwiki links out of a page and then re-inserted them at the end, in the proper order. This causes any interspersed text to bubble up to before the category links, which is normally good, but bad if interwiki-related comments or invalid links are moved up, or accidental category links are yanked out of context.</p>
<p>It's difficult to tell on an automatic basis whether a comment refers to category links, interwiki links, or the body text. But because <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPearle_6f07.html" title="User:Pearle">Pearle</a> automatically adds categories to articles, as the rules stand, she must decide whether to put such links above or below a pre-interwiki comment.</p>
<p>So I have the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the convention for category and interwiki links need modification to facilitate automatic processing? (e.g. a standard place for interwiki or category-related comments?)</li>
<li>What is the proper algorithm for adding a category tag to an article?</li>
<li>Should I try to clean up the articles in which Pearle added category links to the last line of the article, or is there another bot already suited to this purpose?</li>
<li>Should there be a general cleanup effort to make articles conform to the convention? Can any of the common invalid interwiki links be auto-fixed? What should trigger a flag for manual inspection, and how should that flag be stored?</li>
<li>Should I put interwiki links in any kind of sort order? Only if I happen to be editing the article for other reasons anyway, or should there be a general sweep?</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> will likely continue to accumulate categories that need articles moved around by a bot until we can get this resolved.</p>
<p>My recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interwiki tags are dead last. They may be pulled from any part of the page.</li>
<li>Category tags immediately precede interwiki links. Any category tags separated by any body text or comments from the main group will trigger a flag for manual review.</li>
<li>Category links are separated from whatever precedes them by a single blank line.</li>
<li>Editors should not put any comments or body text below or among the category and interwiki links. Any such text will automatically be moved up.</li>
<li>There is no need for comments of the type "Interlanguage links below".</li>
<li>Invalid interwiki links are automatically moved up, but they trigger a flag for manual review.</li>
<li>The flag for manual review is a template which contains instructions and adds the article to a special category where editors who enjoy fixing this kind of problem can find them.</li>

<dd>Suggestions:
<ol>
<li>Any tag with non-tag text on the same line should be kept together; ie. if a category tag has a comment after it before Pearle goes through, it should have the comment afterwards as well.</li>
<li>The most common cause of category tags in the body of the article is as part of a maintainence template substitution (VfD etc). Those should be kept with the rest of the template to keep removing easy once it's no longer needed. If a category tag other than one of the maintainence categories is found, it should be flagged for review.</li>

<p>My remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>zh-cn and zh-tw should both be replaced by zh. These were used for 'Chinese (simplified characters)' and 'Chinese (traditional characters)' respectively, but since version 1.4, this is being solved in software, and both versions are at the same page.</li>
<li>I personally use 'minnan' rather than 'zh-min-nan'. Both are working; I like the first better. I have no idea of any official policy.</li>
<li>The Python bot is using your suggested order already, and can put them in that order if wanted.</li>
<li>Standard order for interwiki links is alphabetically by language name (transcripted to Roman script) on English. On most other languages it is alphabetically by language code (French, Polish, Finnish also alphabetize like en:, Hungarian and Hebrew are alphabetically by code but with English put first). - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 20:38, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC) (hoping he'll remember to check this page...)</li>

<p>Andre and Carnildo seem to have covered most things. The only additional comments are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes HTML comment tags are used around multiple lines, which may include categories</li>
<li>some categories and interwikis are placed on the same line, and need to be put on separate lines</li>
<li>comments, blank lines and the like introduce white space at the foot of articles: I think this is unsightly, but I don't know what to suggest to deal with this</li>
<li>there will probably be many more reasons to undertake work using bots like these in the future, so leave any clean-up work until such times. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 23:09, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agre with Carnildo's first point: any HTML comment on a category line should be kept on that line by the bot.

<p>Are comments such as &lt;!--interwiki --&gt; necessary? I was going to just remove them out of course, but then I thought that some people must have been confused, which is why you see these comments around. So then I was thinking perhaps a standard form might be nice, like:</p>

<p>or something?</p>
<p>&lt;!--Categories--&gt; seems completely unnecessary. I mean, what follows is a list of Category: tags. What else could it possibly be?</p>

<li>Pearle should attempt to do a category/interwiki cleanup whenever it edits an article, but there will be no mass cleanup run (except for articles already edited by Pearle) unless requested.</li>
<li>HTML comments on the same line following a category or interwiki tag will remain there. Any other text there will trigger a flag for review.</li>
<li>If a category or interwiki tag is found in the "body text" area, it will be flagged for review.</li>
<li>Canonicalize "zh-cn" (Chinese simplified) and "zh-tw" (Chinese traditional) to "zh" because the simplified/traditional distinction is now being solved in software.</li>
<li>Canonicalize "minnan" to "zh-min-nan", since only the latter is in the official, automatically updated list.</li>
<li>Multi-line HTML comments must be preserved</li>
<li>Separate category and interwiki links mashed together on the same line.</li>
<li>Don't change interwiki link sort order.</li>

<li>Find HTML tags everywhere else.</li>
<li>Find category links everywhere else.</li>
<li>Find interwiki links everywhere else.</li>
<li>Find template tags everywhere else.</li>
<li>Lump html tags following a category segment (except category and interwiki links) until the next newline into the category segment.</li>
<li>Lump everything following an interwiki segment (except category and interwiki links) until the next newline into the interwiki segment.</li>
<li>The remainder of the page will be tagged as body text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Move any category or interwiki links at the top of the page to the very bottom.</li>
<li>Move {{template tags}} before the category links, preserving whatever whitespace preceded or followed them.</li>

<li>&lt;!--interwiki--&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;!--categories--&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;!--interlanguage links--&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine whether or not the page should be flagged for manual review. Find the last non-category, non-interwiki segment. If there are any interwiki or category links before this segment, flag the page for manual review by adding a template at the end.</li>
<li>If the page has not been flagged: consolidate all interwiki links at the end, preceded by category links, preceded by all other segment types. Be sure to retain the original order of segments in each of the three groups.</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Comments</span></h4>
<p>Personally, I would remove/not add HTML comments. Besides, I feel it would be more productive if the bot would also add additional interwikis, rather just HTML comments. Many of pearle's recent contributions ("Minor category/interwiki code cleanup" on 05:00-06:00, 2005 Mar 12 ) seem to add just comments and re-arrange links. -- User:Docu</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it was requested that Pearle go back and rearrange category and interwiki links in cases where she failed to follow the established style. I'm restricting the current run to articles she's edited before, but there are also minor changes from the "recommended" style now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you're saying it's not particularly worthwhile to tidy things up in this way, I would agree. (As opposed to "please don't add HTML comments, ever" - if you mean that, then perhaps we would need to reconcile that opinion with the opinion of the editors who tend to leave these random comments lying around.) After the self-cleanup, such tidying will only be done in conjuction with a more important edit. Adding interwiki links is outside the scope of what I'm trying to do; I assume that could be done just by comparing what interwiki links other wikis have? That does sound like a good idea. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 00:09, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Originally posted at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a></i> Hey all, I was thinking about making a bot to browse through Wikipedia and generally help out in any way possible. I've recently learned how to access the internet using Java (which I know well) and I wanted to make a little program for practice. My question is, what should this bot do? I've thought about it, and right now I'm leaning towards having it make links more efficient by changing them so they directly link to a page if they're currently linked to a redirect. I figure it can't hurt, right? Anyways, what other miscellaneous chores should this bot do?

<dd>There's a downside in that piped links make the wikicode slightly harder to read for an editor, and, especially because editors are not all techy-types, we need to make it as readable as possible. For example, the wikitext could be either <tt>...[[National Security Agency|NSA]]...</tt> or <tt>...[[NSA]]...</tt> The latter is more readable. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 14:44, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<p>Hi pie4all88, Here's a possibility - don't know if you'll like it or not, but I'll just put it out there and you can decide what you think ....&#160;: Where A is a redirect to B (e.g. "<a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamsters.html" title="Hamsters">Hamsters</a>" → "<a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamster.html" title="Hamster">Hamster</a>"), and the word A is a plural of the word B (as defined <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/grammar/g_spelnoun.html" class="external text" title="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/grammar/g_spelnoun.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and where A does not contain the string "{{R from plural}}" (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Satellite_dishes&amp;redirect=no" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Satellite_dishes&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">this plural redirect</a> <i>does</i> contain that string, but most currently don't), then add the string " {{R from plural}}" to A, and save it. (Basically, this would put all the plural redirects into the right category.) If you don't like it then let me know, and if I think of anything else I'll let you know.

<dd>Categories with thousands of entries help a denial of service attack on the servers. To display a category page currently requires retrieving the full text of every article in the category, making a category with 5,000 entries cause the same work as 5,000 seldom-visited page views (not 5,000 normal page views because normal views tend to end up in cache). For that reason I was recently forced to remove the category (and image) from the GFDL template after it tripped the denial of service attack emergency response: one view of the category took the master server from 8 to over 700 pending queries in less than 30 seconds. And down again 30 seconds later after that page view. The damage can be significantly limited, for suitably small categories, by using the first letter or two letters of the page to create sub-categories, each of which is tolerably small. The sub-pages of allpages are currently set at 500, which is too high for comfort, but I've been reluctant to ask for that count to be reduced to 100, mostly because I know that there are improvements planned for MediaWiki version 1.5. Please refrain from using a bot to expand the number of such denial of service opportunities. We can in an emergency disable any of these things (by turning off category display, for example) but I'd much rather not have the opportunities created in the first place. Also see <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1058" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1058" rel="nofollow">bug 1058</a>, which is why I'm not asking a bot operator to split Category:GFDL or doing it myself on the servers, and <a href="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=973" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=973" rel="nofollow">bug 973</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 04:38, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoops... Ah... OK... How do I put this... Maybe "Houston, we (may) have a problem"&#160;? You see, I had no way of realising (until now) that large categories caused a problem, and there's a small project I'm running for <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_Redirects_f7eb.html" title="User:Nickj/Redirects">adding Missing Redirects</a>, and as part of that, well, new plural redirects are being added to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Category%7ERedirects_from_plurals_4f9c.html" title="Category:Redirects from plurals">the exact category described above</a>. Just to be clear though, this is humans doing the adding — bots are in no way doing any of the adding (it's just that I'm interested in bots, and I'm doing this other thing as well, so me seeing your message on this topic is basically just blind luck). Anyway, when redirects are plurals, they're getting put into this category. Currently there are 239 redirects in this category. By the time we're done, there will be (I estimate) 5000 redirects in this category - so in a few weeks that example 5000 item category will be, as it were, more of an actual than an example ... I guess this is all just proving your point about the joys of coping with exponential growth ... So, I guess my question is this: is it OK to keep adding stuff into this category, or do we need to stop doing that (irrelevant of the category being appropriate)?

<dd>You should also estimate exponential growth with doubling time of 8-12 weeks.

I call it 10% for convenience and a safety margin. So 5000 redirects by letter and you'd end up with the uncomfortably large 500 size for the worst case page. 12 months and four to six doublings and it's at 2000-8000. Oops.:) I haven't checked the actual article doubling time - I'm using the capacity doubling period. For 8000 10% 800 but something like Sc is likely to be the most popular and that's likely to be closer to 500. So: might try going to two letters initially, if you want to think a year ahead. Can skip two for letters with less than 1% frequency or any which show a worst case 12 month prediction under 50. MediaWiki 1.5 is planned to chop the article text out of the cur table and make just getting a title much less slow. But it's a bad idea to assume any delivery time for software.:) For now, anything which needs titles needs to have a target result of under 500 titles. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 13:31, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Looking at the StudentsReview page on the university in the example, the following message is given: "The survey data is not statistically reliable: It is not considered official, and has not been verified by Auburn University."

<dd>This is a generic disclaimer -- we are not piping in data for which there is insufficient representation. At some point (after we become more sophisticated), we'd like to add "School is a Baptist institution that is primarily African American", along with distributions of SAT/ACT scores, etc. We are standing behind this data now, so the disclaimer is not terribly applicable.</dd>
<dd>as for the license, we'd just like to say that we don't want people using our student opinion information for commercial (competitive) purposes (which we thought was compatible with the GFDL license), though we are ok with it being propagated around the web.</dd>
<dd>The information is in a template table, which we can easily update -- I myself suck (big time) as a graphic designer, which is why it probably looks bad -- though I tested it all on the preview pages first to make certain no problems would exist with wiki code.</dd>

<dd>Yes, but surely: 1) The component article contributions must be licensed in such a way as to be compatible with the GFDL - but I'm concerned this is not the case here; 2) When contributing to the Wikipedia now, the blurb under the edit box explicitly states "All contributions to Wikipedia are released under the GNU Free Documentation License". Surely therefore any article contributions are either an acceptance of the GFDL (if you're the copyright holder), or a confirmation that those materials should be safe to be released under the GFDL if you're not the copyright holder (such as copying public domain 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica material). If copyright holders then also want to release their contributions under additional licenses (such as in the free the RamBot articles push), then that's their prerogative, and I have no problem with that whatsoever. What concerns me most here is the contribution of additional article text, implying an acceptance of the GFDL, subsequently followed by the apparent addition of an extra licensing term which seems incompatible with the GFDL ("don't want people using our student opinion information for commercial (competitive) purposes"). -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 04:25, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well if it's public domain you can by definition do whatever you want it, including incorporating it into GFDL works - i.e. Public Domain imposes no restrictions, and is compatible with the GFDL. What worries me is if article content can be added that imposes more restrictions than the GFDL. In which case, I could, to illustrate the problem, create two new licenses: GFDL-mod-1 (the same as GFDL, plus imposes the restriction that content must not be mixed with GFDL-mod-2), and GFDL-mod-2 (the same as GFDL, plus imposes the restriction that content must not be mixed with GFDL-mod-1). I could then make two edits to an existing article, one under GFDL-mod-1, and the other under GFDL-mod-2. This would make it impossible to distribute the article as-is, without violating both of those licenses. And since the license is the thing that gives the right to distribute the text (at least until its copyright expires), then such an article could not and should not be distributed. All of which is a just a complicated way of saying that people should not be allowed to add extra licensing conditions to their article contributions above and beyond the GFDL, otherwise it opens up the most enormous can of worms. Hence my original objection to someone adding content, and then subsequently trying to add the extra condition that their content could not be used for a commercial purpose. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 07:37, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The two issues are the result of dealing with redirects listed on <a href="../../../o/f/f/Wikipedia%7EOffline_reports_This_is_one_of_the_most_linked_to_redirect_pages_e428.html" title="Wikipedia:Offline reports/This is one of the most linked to redirect pages">Wikipedia:Offline reports/This is one of the most linked to redirect pages</a>. It seems that attempting to fix the redirects cause grief for some people. As for <b>African-American</b> there was no talk at all on its talk page and neither is this alternate offically listed in the opening paragraph of the official page content at <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>. As for fixing <b>Mammalia</b> so it went directly to <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammal.html" title="Mammal">Mammal</a>, visually the user still sees "Mammalia". The <b>Mammalia</b> redirect has been in place for nearly 2½ years and unlikely to change. If there is a problem with bots fixing redirects, then this should be officially stated on the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a> page. Alternatively, if a policy should be set up such that any attempts to fix redirects by bots should first be proposed on this talk page (or perhaps a subpage might be better), then this is also acceptable. I will no longer run the bot to fix redirects listed on the above page until this is resolved. I will still run the bot to resolve disambiguation from time to time, as was its first purpose. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWolf_0f32.html" title="User:RedWolf">RedWolf</a> 19:09, Jan 2, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This "two and a half years" argument was also raised on the CanisRufus talk page. This argument is unconvincing largely because it had nothing to do with the question at hand. The fact that there has YET to be an article on Mammalia does not mean that there never WILL be one. In the past hour, 60 some odd articles that haven't existed "for the past two and a half years" were created. Under RW's rationale, any article that is now (and has been) a redirect will never become an article in its own right. I find this argument unconvincing. Also, with respect to African-American, the fact that there was no talk on the redirect page is unsurprising (most redirects don't get talk) and irrelevant. All that this goes to show is that RW didn't know that it was an inappropriate change at the time... which is fine. No one is accusing him of intentionally making imrproper changes. The point is that when it was brought to his attention, rather than enter into a discussion about it or apologize for the bot's unintended behavior, he became snide and defensive. This isn't an unforgiveable offense, it's just evidence that perhaps the bot should simply be used for disambiguation purposes as was originally stated... an (as far as I can tell) uncontroversial purpose. The position that redirects are, inherently, a "problem" to be "fixed" is not a universal one and there are people who do not subscribe to it. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 19:26, Jan 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bypassing a redirect in this way is a very bad practice and unnecessary. Redirects work for a reason, and it is entirely possible that the <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammalia.html" title="Mammalia">Mammalia</a> redirect, for instance, <i>might'</i> change to point somewhere else in the future. There may also be specific reasons for the links not bypassing the redirect, which you may be unaware (Whatlinkshere comes to mind). Last point, is that any bot doing disambiguation or bypassing redirects also should not be run blind - each case may be different, and requires someone to check the context. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 19:29, 2005 Jan 2 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Needless to say, a Wikipedia article is not definitive even for Wikipedia. Errors are introduced and corrected all the time. <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> is an example. The article is incorrectly titled, and the usage of the expression in the article is frequently wrong as well. The expression should <i>always</i> be hyphenated, whether it is a noun or an adjective. It should follow the pattern — it was <i>designed</i> to follow the pattern — of <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian-American_fe84.html" title="Italian-American">Italian-American</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-American_de59.html" title="Polish-American">Polish-American</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese-American_3f44.html" title="Japanese-American">Japanese-American</a>. I will not further elaborate on that fact; but all those who have edited pages and inserted ‘African-American’ or let it stand have agreed that that is the correct spelling. But because none of them had fixed the article <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>, RedWolf presumes that ‘African American’ is the undisputed correct version, and all instances of the hyphenated expression need to be changed. Now they will all need to be changed back. Of course, the examples I cite above are not all done correctly either — two of them redirect to page titles without hyphens, while the articles themselves jump back and forth. That just means that at some point they, too, will need to be fixed. Perhaps then it is a matter of dispute, or perhaps a matter of common ignorance. Either way, the bot was a crude way to address it. And the bot only replaced <i>linked</i> instances of ‘African-American’. The others were left alone, so that pages that had been internally consistent are no longer so. I agree that redirects are often the best solution. But if redirects are not desired, the appropriate solution was to change [[African-American]] to [[African American|African-American]], so that the change in link would not affect the spelling.<br />

<dd>I rolled back most of the s/African-American/African American/ changes made by the bot on Sunday afternoon. Some of the articles had already been changed so I was unable to rollback but those were maybe a dozen pages at most. While I was probably wrong in having the bot make this change, as Ford pointed out, there is a major inconsistency in the use (or non-use) of the hyphen. A encyclopedia should be consistent, which was all I was trying to accomplish.

<p>Hi, I'm writing this here because I'm active on this wiki and I wasn't sure where else to put it. The request I'm making is for (what I'm assuming would be) a simple bot for the <i>bosnian</i> language wikipedia. Basically we made several mistakes in writing articles for all the years, and fixing them now would mean tediously editing hundreds of articles. Namely, our articles for decades would be named, for example, "1960te" when they should have been "1960e", so we need to change the links to all of those on the pages for the years and centuries, redirect the articles for the decades, etc. Also, we in the end decided that we would use different words for "century" and "decade". If it's possible, could someone help us make a bot that would fix this problem? <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 19:25, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I was making an assumption above that probably isn't justified (it's very very late here, so forgive my incoherence) - will the blocks be permanent, or (like Proxy blocker's) a week or whatever? If the latter, how are you planning to deal with addresses that are still on the list, or on multiple lists? Unblock it and immediately reblock? And how often will it be run? —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 11:22, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Dunno. Currently proxy blocks are permanent, which makes sense, but once scripted there'd be no harm in making them shorter. Unblock and reblock isn't hard once you're not doing it manually. I'd guesstimate once every two weeks or every month should be sufficient to get most of them, but it's one of those things that'll have to be tweaked based on performance. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 11:28, 2005 Jan 23 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My last concerns (honest!): if not permanently blocking, I assume the bot'll be written so that it doesn't ever actually <i>shorten</i> a pre-existing block. Also, everyone makes mistakes; if other bots go berserk, though, any admin can immediately neutralize them with a block. This won't (as I understand it) stop a bot that only places or removes blocks itself.

<p>Thanks for your support everyone, I'm currently running the first batch of hosts at User:Fvw/proxytest and User:Fvw/proxytest2. A rought estimate gives that this run will find around 1000 open proxies. Blocking and unblocking those regularly would be too spammy in the block log, so I'm considering indefinite-blocking them and checking them regularly and unblocking when necessary. I'll put the list of blocked proxies up in my user space so should I disappear someone else can do the checking or unblock them. Sound ok? --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 08:33, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC)</p>
<p>Opposed. Something like this recently ran at the Japanese Wikipedia. One of the victims was a friend of mine from the Dutch Wikipedia who lives in Thailand. He automatically gets a proxy from his IP, which according to him is the largest in Thailand, which was recognised as an open proxy. To make a long story short, we could easily victimize innocent and useful users this way. - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 20:29, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a shame, and individual cases can be worked around, I've already agreed with Waerth that we're going to figure something out before we block the open proxy. It's not a reason not to block in the general case though.

<p>The blocking code currently in use on the site does a full table scan of the block table for every attempt to edit a page. That is, it does work proportional to the number of blocks in place and delays the edit page load and save until that has been done. Emergency changes to improve this behavior were requested by me and I've taken some steps myself to reduce the impact of this (I'm optimising the table almost every night). At present making the block list larger than it has to be to block those actually vandalising the site is piling on more trouble to an area which is already very troubled. Using a bot to dramatically expand the number of entries and slow down all edits while emergency steps are already being taken to try to reduce the pain in this area is contrary to the do no harm principle for bot operations. If this bot is seen adding entries, please block it immediately so that it doesn't slow down edits for all human and bot editors. If you're aware of any blocks not in place to deal with actual vandalism, please remove them until the programming changes are known to be in place on the live site. This is a typical query, taken from the slow query log of one of the database servers today:</p>
<pre>
/* Block::load */ SELECT * FROM `ipblocks` WHERE (ipb_address='81.57.248.96' OR ipb_user=3763);
</pre>
<p><i>Every edit page load</i> does that. Improved code is on the way but for now the use of two terms blocks the use of any index. Updated code, when in use, will use a union instead, so each part can use an index. Work to use memcached as a preliminary check is also ongoing, because crawlers loading edit pages and causing database checks have caused the site to be unusable (and the size of the block list affects how much pain they cause as well...) Likely to be in place within a few months. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 21:51, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WML Gateway</span></h2>
<p>Hi folks! I've been working on a <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wireless_Markup_Language_d293.html" title="Wireless Markup Language">WML</a> gateway so that I can read wikipedia on my moblie phone while waiting for public transport. The gateway is read only, and I've got no plans to change that. I think the bot policy is geared towards robots that edit, but I'm asking for permission here to be on the safe side. The gateway is apache/mod_perl/libwww-perl based. The gateway uses <a href="../../../e/x/p/Special%7EExport_1a62.html" title="Special:Export">Special:Export</a> as the backend, and then parses the wikimarkup to make a fairly basic WML page. Long term, I would like to see the functions of this gateway moved closer to the database, but I'm happy to keep it running as long as it is is needed (and I'm happy to switch it off as soon as it is not needed). There is a testing version avaiible on my DSL line (so it runs very slow when my flatmates are filesharing), however I will move it to a better hosted site once I've got permission. (I don't want to put the link anywhere too popular untill testing is finished and I've got permission to run a bot, so you will need to look at the Talk page for <a href="../../../w/a/p/Wikipedia%7EWAP_access_a588.html" title="Wikipedia:WAP access">Wikipedia:WAP_access</a> if you have a WML browser and want to try it).

<li>One vital precondition: the Special:Export page has a check box to include only the current version, not the full history. It is <b>vital</b> that your operations <b>always</b> use that check box. Some pages have many tens of thousands of revisions and that special page is already in the query killer because it has caused serious load problems. At present, every revision displayed can be assumed to cause at least one disk seek. Improvements are planned for MediaWiki 1.5, after not making the cut for 1.4. In addition, if your pages are going on a site which can be crawled, it's vital that you include a robots.txt file which gives any crawlers of your or other sites the same robots.txt instructions as given by the wikimedia servers. Bots crawling third party sites not doing this have led us to block the crawler of Ask Jeeves (ask.com) on a couple of occasions and proxying sites are likely to be very quickly firewalled if we notice that happening - which may mean firewalling you. Please exercise great care in this area - it's a high risk activity at present. I also strongly recommend including contact details in your browser ID string. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 22:12, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think you shouldn't allow crawling at all, i.e. Disallow: * in robots.txt.

</li>
<li>If needed, I'll write a cron job to grab the robots.txt once a week or however infrequenly it is updated. However, I'd be happier with a simple Disallow: * robots.txt. How paranoid should I be about robots that don't folow robots.txt?
<ul>
<li>Disallow: * should do the job. If not, well, we'll find out and are happy to remove a firewall rule once the problem is gone, if we do have to put one in because something unruly ignored it.

<p>Well, due to the security update, I will not be able to implement this bot yet, but I would like the approval to have my bot additionally do the following tasks at <s>roughly</s> <b>exactly</b> around every 00:00 UTC:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add each VFD subpage day. Example: <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 February 5}}</b>
<dl>
<dd>Reason for this is because the VFD system has changed such that each day has a subpage for VFD based on the UTC clock. The transincludes must be included every day in order to properly present the VFD. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 17:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Edit each new subpage day to include: == MONTHNAME DATE == (Like == February 5 ==)
<dl>
<dd>Again, VFD system changed, and each day will require to display its day section, allowing a person direct access to the VFD day. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 17:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><s>Take the last recently moved subpage day (transinclude) to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Old_499a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old</a>, edit all VFD subpages to include the content from <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_top_d7d6.html" title="Template:Vfd top">Template:Vfd top</a> and <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_bottom_f7cd.html" title="Template:Vfd bottom">Template:Vfd bottom</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Each VFD subpage includes the content from both of these templates. I believe they are not applied due to the technical limitations of the number of templates that can be used on each page. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 17:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Having a bot to update VfD would be <b>wonderful</b>. One suggestion: as step 3), have it create the subpage for <i>tomorrow</i>. There's no reason not to create it ahead of time, so it's ready when it's needed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About adding {{subst:vfd top}} and {{subst:vfd bottom}}: I don't know if this is such a good idea. When I'm scanning /Old, I ignore the sections with colored backgrounds, because they've already been closed. Adding the templates ahead of time would make it harder to see which pages have been processed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, if it's feasible, change "roughly around" to "exactly". This thing'll be run as a <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cron.html" title="Cron">cron</a> job anyway, so there's no reason not to run it at the right time. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 21:00, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're forgetting about the time it takes for it to get a Wikipedia page. That is why I say roughly. Because the load time to get the page is not always exact, the time when the bot posts something to the Wikipedia will not always fall exactly 00:00 UTC. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 00:54, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>How do you think I manage to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">do it by hand</a> every day at midnight (except when I flake out)? You load the page ten minutes early, get the changes ready, then hit "save page" at the right time. Edit conflicts aren't an issue, because the page is only edited once or twice a day. Of course, doing the same thing with a bot would complicate the code slightly. It's no big deal either way. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 05:10, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The code won't be complicated any further than it already is. If the bot runs exactly 10 minutes before the UTC date rolls over to the next day, all it has to do is search for the current date, then replace <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 February 5}}</b> for <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 February 5}}\n{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/TODAY}}</b>. Or in computing terms: <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/TODAY}}</b> for <b>{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/TODAY}}\n{{Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/TOMORROW}}</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:08, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, if it is running 10 minutes before the next UTC day, then yes, it would create the VFD page for tomorrow. I would actual want the bot to do that one hour before hand. just to be on the safe side. Of course, all changes presume that the Wikipedia is working, and is not down at the time of the updates. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:31, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, the additional complication would be having it wait until midnight before <i>submitting</i> the change. Also, there are actually 5 lines to edit on VfD.

<dl>
<dd>As I said, it would only be adding, not removing the discussions. Removing the discussion would still be a human job, since the bot will not know when a discussion is closed. It would be changing at line 13 and line 50, but it will not be making any changes at line 19 and line 45. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:57, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think there's a slight misconception here about how the edits to VfD work. Every day at midnight, the new day is added, and the oldest day (now 6 days old) is removed, and added to /Old. The discussions on that old day aren't <i>closed</i> yet—anyone can still vote. It's just that the day doesn't appear on the main VfD page anymore. The votes get closed one by one as someone gets around to closing and tallying them. There's no reason for the bot not to do the complete extension (all 5 lines of the diff above), and it would be tremendously helpful. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 21:17, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Another minor technicality: have it submit the changes for VfD <i>first</i>, and the change to /Old <i>second</i> (like, a couple seconds later).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Upload script request</span></h2>
<p>I'm in need of a script. I recently found a large dump of classical music, all CC-by-SA. I used wget recursively to fetch all of it (650 files; 5.29 gigs). I need to upload them now. I'd like to do it with a unix command line program. I figure the syntax should be something like:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>&gt;wikiupload Raul654bot:mypassword ./song.ogg --rate=100 --location=commons "This is a public domain song I uploaded {{PD}}"</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The 1st arguement is the username and password (necessary for uploading files)</li>
<li>The 2nd arguement is the file to upload. So in the case of uploading a large number of files, I can just use the *</li>
<li>The 3rd arguement specifices the upload rate. I believe this is necessary because bots are supposed to be able to run at low speeds initially.</li>
<li>The 4th arguement specifies where it should go: en, de, commons, wikibooks, etc.</li>
<li>The 5th arguement is the upload text - IE, the text to be put on the image page.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../../../c/u/r/CURL_a8bc.html" title="CURL">cURL</a> might already do what you're after. It's what I use for putting automated content into the Wikipedia - (I'm only adding article text, and I'm doing it using PHP's cURL library, so I don't think my code is likely to be of much use to you, otherwise I'd just give you the code). Nevertheless I think it should be able to do what you're after from the command line.</p>
<p>The following args look most applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li>--cookie (you'll need a cookie for your uploading data under your username / password)</li>
<li>--limit-rate (so as to not upload too fast)</li>
<li>--form (With various args as per the Upload forms, which will include the description, and the path to the file)</li>
<li>The destination URL (which will be different depending on where you want it to go, but will presumably be the commons most of the time).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're lucky then maybe someone has already done this using cURL on the command line, and will let us know the command they used.</p>
<p>Docs and source code available at: <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/" class="external free" title="http://curl.haxx.se/" rel="nofollow">http://curl.haxx.se/</a></p>
<p>Note that you'll probably have to call it multiple times (e.g. using "xargs"), if you want wildcard / multi-file-upload functionality.</p>

<hr />
<p>I talked it over with Kate ,and here's what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>curl -F wpName=Bob -F wpPassword=asdf --cookie-jar ./mycookies "http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?Special:Userlogin&amp;action=submit" &gt; output1.html</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>curl -F wpUpload=@./Bob_test_file.txt -F wpUploadDescription=This_is_a_test -F wpUploadAffirm=1 --limit-rate 100k --cookie-jar ./mycookies "http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?Special:Upload&amp;action=submit" &gt; output2.html</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one logs in Bob (whose password is asdf) and creates a cookie jar containing the log in cookie, and the second one actually does the upload (of file Bob_test_file.txt with description This_is_a_test). I tested, and the first one works *I think* but the 2nd one does not. I could appreciate someone helping debug it. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 09:38, Feb 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can try the pywikipediabot framework. They have a script called upload.py that you could use, if you made the script runable. Then you can create a perl script or a bash script based on upload.py to loop through the contents of the directory. I am uncertain if they have the pywikipedia framework ready for the commons. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 10:13, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Debugging - Raul, you did good, and you were 95% of the way there:</p>
<p>With the first command:</p>
<ul>
<li>I added wpLoginattempt="Log in" (which is the same as clicking the "log in" button) - (may or may not be needed, but it won't hurt).</li>
<li>Added wpRemember=1 (may or may not be needed, but it won't hurt).</li>
</ul>
<p>With the second command:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL could be wrong - I used <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload</a> instead.</li>
<li>Need the file's path in "wpUploadFile", rather than "wpUpload".</li>
<li>Add 'wpUpload="Upload file"', which is the same as clicking the button (may or may not be needed, but it won't hurt).</li>
<li>With uploading, I think you want "--cookie", rather than "--cookie-jar", since "--cookie" is read-only, whereas --cookie-jar is for storing stuff (i.e. use store to log in, then read to upload).</li>
<li>Note that you'll also want to put in a license tag in the description, otherwise the tagging folks will hunt down and nail you to a tree&#160;;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting all that together into two commands, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>First command&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<p>curl -F wpName=Nickj -F wpPassword=NotMyRealPassword -F wpLoginattempt="Log in" -F wpRemember=1 --cookie-jar ./mycookies "http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&amp;action=submit" &gt; output1.html</p>
<ul>
<li>Second command (note that I have omitted the rate limiting bit, as my installed curl is so ancient that it doesn't have that option, but you probably want to add it back):</li>
</ul>
<p>curl -F wpUpload="Upload file" -F wpUploadFile=@./Part_of_Great_Barrier_Reef_from_Helecopter.JPG -F wpUploadDescription="Photo I took in Jan 2005 over part of the Great Barrier Reef in a helicopter {{GFDL}}" -F wpUploadAffirm=1 --cookie ./mycookies "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" &gt; output2.html</p>

<dd>Ok, I did a lot of work on this. The problem is, the method above fails for files above 4.7 megs (5000000 bytes) because mediawiki gives you an "Are you sure you want to upload this big file?" prompt. I tried a workaround but it doesn't work yet. You can see my script <a href="http://udel.edu/~markpell/wikiupload" class="external text" title="http://udel.edu/~markpell/wikiupload" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>No, this is bad. The usual way to finalise the votes is to go to /Old, pick an article that hasn't been boked, and resolve it.
