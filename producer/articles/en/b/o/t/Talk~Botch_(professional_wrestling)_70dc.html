<p>Do we need this article? I know there's a list of "memorable" botches, but that's POV. The word botch has the exact same meaning in everyday context as it does in professional wrestling and besides, Wikipedia is not a dictionary. I'll redirect it to the article on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_slang.html" title="Professional wrestling slang">professional wrestling slang</a>. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 05:09, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You completely miss the point - you are correct, it is not a dictionary - but the article explains how "botch" fits into the context of wrestling, not a general definition of botch. My feeling is that having some examples of wrestling botches is helpful, and enough to justify have an explanatory article about what happens and that a wrestling botch can be fatal. Other than maybe a "botched" surgery, most botches in the general sense are not life-or-death. --<a href="../../../c/o/k/User%7ECokeBear_4362.html" title="User:CokeBear">CokeBear</a> 10:21, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>This is a fun page but in the interests of keeping it encyclopedic, the list should really only contain memorable or significant botches. Just because you saw Cena miss a move on Raw the other day, doesn't necessarily make it a list-worthy botch. Wrestlers botch all the time, if it causes injury or major embarrassment then consider adding it to the list. I also encourage others to prune the list as aggressively as they see fit, nothing here is verified so Jimbo's "aggressive removal of unverified information" edict should override any objections. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 13:47, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Agreed, this is turning into a near-weekly update page just because slight errors are almost guaranteed to happen every show. Stuff like the Gayda/Stratus bulldog and the Owen Hart piledriver are famous examples, but look at the stuff from Summerslam '06 that is listed...no one even remembers that now, and it's only a few weeks later. KaneRobot 22:51, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why is the Triple H/Mr Mcmahon 'botch' on there. It is just a minor mistake in the match which should not be up there. I agree with the people above in that only famous botches should be on there.60.227.99.12 06:45, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now I agree with most of the rulings on significant botches, because it defenintly helps clean up the article, but I DO think that we need one botch not on the list to be in there. I think the Big Show-Sabu match at SSLAM 06 should be listed with the biggest one from the match, because that is what many people seem to remember the most from that event (though given it was a somewhat lackluster event) and SummerSlam is generally thought of as the 2nd biggest PPV of the year. - JSelby posted this at 17:11, 7 October 2006 (EST)</p>
<p>Okay, here's a few botches that I'd like to consult wether are they or not worthy of being in the page (since there's lots of guys that enjoy randomly deleting stuff and I do not intend to add this stuff if it's up for deletion) I'm talking about Kane botching a Flying Clothesline to RVD in Summerslam 03, Kurt Angle breaking Bob Holly's arm with a Moonsault, Goldberg spearing the ring post face first, Brock Lesnar powerbombing Holly on his neck, Lesnar giving A-Train the F-5 on his head AND, The Shockmaster!!! LOL. So what you guys think? (If you are unaware of these botches I assure they're memorable, so I'll wait a couple of days for an answer before editing the article)Vicius 06:55, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
a better question would be why do they delete legitimate botches? Trish was deleted (even though it was a legit botch and fell into the context of the meaning at the top) as was the Owen hart fall (unless we are to belive him dying was scripted).</p>
<p>I'm just fallowing the definition, so either change the definition or quit deleting legitimate botches. –—Traiklin 16:02, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted the list of botches. First off, there's no established criteria for what a "notable" botch is so it might be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>.

<li>During the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Heavyweight_Championship_%28WWE%29_d3e9.html" title="World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)">World Heavyweight Championship</a> match at the <i><a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Rumble_%282003%29_ec31.html" title="Royal Rumble (2003)">2003 Royal Rumble</a></i>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Steiner_4527.html" title="Scott Steiner">Scott Steiner</a> (due to fatigue) botched a <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerbomb.html#Double_underhook_powerbomb" title="Powerbomb">double underhook powerbomb</a> on Triple H, and fell down on the mat, nearly dropping Triple H on his head. This botch has since been nicknamed <i>Stumble Bomb '03</i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> by the <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smark.html" title="Smark">smark</a> community in reference to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_throws.html#Tiger_driver" title="Professional wrestling throws">Tiger Driver '91</a> which unlike the botch is a move that is done in the same way but on purpose.</li>
<li>During the <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_the_Ring_8fcb.html#2001" title="King of the Ring">2001 King of the Ring</a></i>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shane_McMahon_d5fc.html" title="Shane McMahon">Shane McMahon</a> fought Kurt Angle in a Street Fight match. During the match, the script called for Kurt to give a belly-to-belly suplex to Shane in front of the glass window of the <i>King of the Ring</i> set. On his first attempt, Shane did not break the glass as scripted. He also was dropped nearly vertically on his head, resulting in Kurt waiting a minute for Shane to regain his bearings. On the second attempt, Shane successfully broke the glass as planned. However, the script called for Kurt to suplex Shane again from the inside of the set to the outside (through another glass window set). After 2 failed attempts that saw Shane dropped almost vertically on his head again, Kurt improvised by throwing Shane through the glass window, rather than attempting anymore belly-to-belly suplexes and risking seriously injuring Shane. Despite landing on his head, Shane was able to finish the match as planned, and suffered no lasting effects from the match.</li>
<li>At <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/SuperBrawl_44c7.html#SuperBrawl_Revenge" title="SuperBrawl">SuperBrawl Revenge</a></i>, during a six-man tag, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Yun_156f.html" title="James Yun">Yun Yang</a> botched several spots in a row on Evan Karagious. First, Yang attempted a spin kick, but missed completely, and improvised with a punch to Evan's back. Yang then hooked Evan for a Russian Leg Sweep, but Evan fell too early, and Yang had to fall back after him, making the move look horribly botched. Yang immediately attempted a springboard move, but he slipped on the middle rope and merely twisted around and fell down onto his face as the crowd laughed. Yang finally picked Evan back up, and went for a reverse tombstone, but Evan's head landed nowhere even near the ground.</li>
<li>In the main event of <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/StarrCade_956a.html#1999" title="StarrCade">StarrCade 1999</a></i> (a <a href="../../../w/c/w/WCW_World_Heavyweight_Championship_c8a6.html" title="WCW World Heavyweight Championship">WCW World Title</a> match between champion <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bret_Hart_747e.html" title="Bret Hart">Bret Hart</a> and challenger <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Goldberg_6e6d.html" title="Bill Goldberg">Goldberg</a>), Goldberg nailed Hart with a superkick to the head. Hart suffered a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concussion.html" title="Concussion">concussion</a> as a result of the kick, forcing him to retire from pro wrestling. He believes that the concussion was a causal factor in his 2002 <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a>.</li>
<li>At <i><a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor_Series_%282002%29_143d.html" title="Survivor Series (2002)">Survivor Series 2002</a></i>, during the opening match between <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Hardy_135b.html" title="Jeff Hardy">Jeff Hardy</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Lamonica_4707.html" title="Mark Lamonica">Bubba Ray Dudley</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Hyson_7c19.html" title="Matt Hyson">Spike Dudley</a> vs. <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Anoai_19c1.html" title="Matt Anoai">Rosey</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Fatu_3747.html" title="Eddie Fatu">Jamal</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rico_Constantino_c10d.html" title="Rico Constantino">Rico</a>, the match was briefly exposed. Rico had climbed the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnbuckle.html" title="Turnbuckle">turnbuckle</a> and the plan was to have him be shoved off by Jeff Hardy. Hardy completely missed his cue (he was too busy brawling outside), causing a frustrated Rico to shout "Come on Jeff, goddamnit!"</li>
<li>During the <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Women%27s_Championship_6b16.html" title="WWE Women's Championship">WWE Women's Championship</a> match at <i><a href="../../../w/r/e/WrestleMania_22_7b4e.html" title="WrestleMania 22">WrestleMania 22</a></i> between Trish Stratus and Mickie James, the plan was to have James win the Women's Championship by stealing Stratus' finisher (the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques.html#Springboard_bulldog" title="Professional wrestling aerial techniques">Stratusfaction</a>). However, as James attempted the move, her feet slipped on the ropes, causing Stratus to fall to the mat and James landing right on top of her. Disappointment was clearly seen on both Stratus and James' faces, which resulted in James quickly having to nail Stratus with a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_attacks.html#Spin_kick" title="Professional wrestling attacks">Mick Kick</a> for the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rushed_finish.html" title="Rushed finish">rushed finish</a>. The botch was later edited out of the WrestleMania 22 DVD.</li>
<li>At <i><a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_No_Mercy_b296.html#2002" title="WWE No Mercy">No Mercy 2002</a></i>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Jericho_f48a.html" title="Chris Jericho">Chris Jericho</a> went for a Springboard dropkick during a tag match between him and <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Reso_28ce.html" title="Jason Reso">Christian</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booker_Huffman_504c.html" title="Booker Huffman">Booker T</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil_Runnels_III_e560.html" title="Virgil Runnels III">Goldust</a>. The turnbuckle literally snapped upon contact causing the ring ropes to collapse leading Jericho to hit a regular, top rope Moonsault as an improvised finish. The ring ropes had to be re-installed before the remainder of the event could continue.</li>
<li>During the <i>TNA World X-Cup 2004</i>, <a href="../../../j/u/v/Juventud_Guerrera_993d.html" title="Juventud Guerrera">Juventud Guerrera</a> botched a Juvi Driver on <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Lynn_3135.html" title="Jerry Lynn">Jerry Lynn</a>. Instead of dropping Lynn on his back/shoulders, Guerrerra turned Lynn too far and dropped Lynn on his shoulder, tearing the tendon from the bone in his rotator cuff.</li>
<li>At Summerslam 2000 Triple H attempted to Pedigree Kurt Angle on top of an announce table when the table collapsed and they both fell, Angle received a big cut on his forehead.</li>
<li>At Cyber Sunday 2006, Mickie James went for a Springboard Tornado DDT, and when trying to hit the ropes, her feet slipped and she landed on top of Lita. This prompted J.R. to exclaim: "What the hell was that!"</li>
<li>At Armageddon 2006 Jeff Hardy went for a "See-saw" type move by jumping into a ladder perched on top of another ladder hitting Joey Mercury's nose and under his left eye causing Mercury to get four fractures on the inside of his nose, 5 stitches on the inside and 15 stitches on the outside of his nose and cheek. It also caused his left eye to be swollen shut and continual internal bleeding from his nose and eye.” <a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/exclusives/38575801" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/exclusives/38575801" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
<li>At New Years Revolution 2007, Triple H attempted a spinebuster on Randy Orton. Triple H landed wrong, and tore his quadricep.</li>

<p>I like this page. Although I think from the paragraph that starts 'at wrestlemania 23...' should be deleted. Those last few paragraphs don't seem to have anything to do with the rest of the article at all.</p>
