<dd><i>Although she was not a classical 'botanist'</i></dd>

<p>I find it hard to agree with this statement. What is a classical botanist? McClintock worked with plants to understand cytogenetics and epigenetics. She is definitely a botanist, even a 'classical' botanist. This page should be helping people understand that the term botanist is quite broad. This sentence seems to imply that botanist only do taxonomy of plants. I think it should be changed. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> 17:28, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think what you say proves the statement is essentially correct. A "classical botanist" is one steeped in taxonomy. It not at all implies that "botanist only do taxonomy of plants" since it clearly states a "<u>classical</u> botanist". As time passes, what is classical might change, but there is presently nothing wrong with the statement. I think you are misinterpreting "classical" to mean something like "real"—not the case. Think of "classical" as meaning "ancient". - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 04:51, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Marshman, I suppose I am wondering if classical has any meaning. Was Hooke classical? He used a microscope in the same way as McClintock. Was Mendel classical? He used genetics in the same way as McClintock. Personally, I think she was a classical botanist. I prefer to see it in the terms of botantists being leaders in the biological sciences rather than botanists breaking with the traditions of classical botany. Does that make sense? <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> 15:25, 12 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it has a meaning, and that is the meaning intended by the statement. I'd have not thought of putting it that way myself and do not even know if it fits in her case; but you are dissecting a term that does convey an admittedly vague concept of what botanists mostly did in the "classical period". One could similarly say, she was a "modern botanist", and no one would argue that that simply is not true because Hooke (decidely not "modern") also used a microscope! - Change the statement to something more descriptive of the field as she practiced it if you like - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 18:03, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>The statement "...weeds, which are plants that are deemed by people to be growing in the wrong place..." is ridiculous in an article about botany. If that's all there were to it, weed ecology would not exist, and we'd be studying "weed psychology" and "weed sociology". The fact remains that there are important biological factors that make weeds weedy. Since there is at least one editor who prefers to revert an unreferenced edit by a botanist to a previous, equally unreferenced statement, I'll be assembling my references to add some real science both to the paragraph in this article and to <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weed.html" title="Weed">weed</a>, but because I have a day job, it won't happen right away.--<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Clark_2ae7.html" title="User:Curtis Clark">Curtis Clark</a> 04:34, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article's rather poorly written and sparse--the weeds are just part of it. It would be nice, Curtis, if you upgraded this on weeds and the weed article, though. I love it when I learn something new on Wikipedia that contradicts what was studied in school like, "r-selected does not say anything about weeds" after always having weeds as an example of r-selected plants. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:13, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
