<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unapproved Functions on Approved Bots</span></h2>
<p>My understanding of <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/f/WP%7EBRFA_d541.html" title="WP:BRFA">WP:BRFA</a> is that bots are only flagged and approved for specific functions.</p>
<p>For instance, if I requested approval to create a bot to substitute templates, I would request approval for substituting templates. I would complete a trial run. If that run was without errors, complaints, or blocks, I would make note of that on <a href="../../../b/r/f/WP%7EBRFA_d541.html" title="WP:BRFA">WP:BRFA</a>, someone from the approvals group would approve it, and a crat would set a flag.</p>
<p>Let's say I then decided to use my bot to unicode articles. It's not a controversial action, and I'm not specifically hurting anyone.</p>
<p>Would such an action (unapproved, albeit reasonable), be: a violation of WP:BOT or a reason for an admin to block my bot?</p>
<p>Personally, I think it would, but I'd like some feedback from B/AG members and other admins/crats. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DodgerBlue"><b>alpha</b></font><font color="black"><b>Chimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>laudare</b></a></sup> 17:18, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If someone complains as to what you're doing, then it is blockable. There's ways to unicodify an article and render it completely useless, so it is not exacly non-controversial. A side edit from time to time may not hurt, but it's always good to just ask here, just in case. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 17:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was once blocked when I was running a bot for an unapproved task. It was controversial to be sure, and while the block upset me at first, it was fully justified. There is a huge bias here in favor of persons. If *anyone* has an issue with a bot (within reason), it can be blocked. And I agree with this policy. Nobody's bot is that important. I'd have to agree that the occasional small "side edit" or "side task" is acceptable. Afterall, we all "<a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Ignore All Rules</a>" and "<a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">Be Bold</a>" from time to time. Of course if you don't ensure that your bot follows the appropriate rules while running "unapproved", then you run the risk of being blocked or even worse permanently losing your ability to use a bot. The latter case probably wouldn't happen, but you never know. It is possible. — <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup> 18:20, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I agree with all that. Specifically with regards to blocking, blocking a bot is very different from blocking a human, and if it's misbehaving it's no big deal blocking it and then talking to the operator to get things sorted out (who lest we forget <i>is</i> a human with human feelings). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The way I see it is that there are a number of issues. Let's just split bot tasks into a couple realms. <b>First</b>, you have approved bots and unapproved bots. The process for creating a bot <i>the first time</i> should be difficult, because the risk of a bad bot is great. However, the task for adding a new task to a bot should not be as difficult, since there should be sufficient proof that the bot owner is responsible, and whenever possible we give editors the benefit of the doubt, especially if using well-established bot software. <b>Secondly</b>, we have the issue of scale. A bot may be doing 50 edits or 40,000+ edits (like a typical rambot run). It makes no sense to spend a week or two approving a request that could have been annoyingly accomplished manually during that time. So without an serious conclusion here, it would seem that new bots and those with longer edit requirements should bear the greatest amount of scrutiny. Right now the policy doesn't differentiate to that degree. Afterall, it is already painfully simple to block bots on a whim and small tasks are unlikely to be that damaging. Besides, it isn't hard to make the owner of the bot repair the damage caused, and if they don't repair the damage it is simple to revoke bot priveledges. <b>Thirdly</b>, it is important to respect the bot owners, which is often not considered. An edit is an edit no matter who makes it, bot or human. Bad (and good) edits affect everyone equally no matter the source. This is the reason that unapproved bots are allowed from time to time. We don't require approval from normal users for the same tasks, why should we from bots? I think this third issue is the reason for so much grey area and informality in both requests and approvals. And of course the other two issues affect the acceptance of an unapproved task. — <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup> 19:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously the issue of scale is there. If someone is doing 40 edits, there's a big difference from 40,000 (or even 400 edits). As for your third point, the difference between me and a bot is that I am not (humanly) able to edit the encyclopedia on such a speed and large scale. A 40,000 edit run is tantamount to a policy change, and should be treated as such, and afforded the same due process. If a bot owner chooses not to listen (or even attempt to solicit) the will of the community, his bot should be blocked indefinitely and de-flagged. I'd also consider sanctions against the user. I don't think the controversialness of the bot function should have any effect.</dd>
<dd>Getting back to the original question: Does anybody see a problem (I know I don't) in blocking an approved bot that is doing an unapproved function? I personally would like every bot owner to request every thing they do. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DodgerBlue"><b>alpha</b></font><font color="black"><b>Chimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>laudare</b></a></sup> 20:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's again a circular question: it depends on what the bot is doing, and how much of {{whatever}} it is doing. If I log in as a bot and forget to log out, see vandalism and revert it manually while logged in as the bot, I sure hope I don't get blocked because I'm an anti-vandalism bot or something similar. But if I start running a copy of <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawkerbot2_313a.html" title="User:Tawkerbot2">Tawkerbot2</a> without telling anyone, I sure hope I get blocked. It really is a matter of discretion. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 20:29, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It is always a matter of common sense, for example, if a bot is doing something similar to a previous task, but has not explicitly been given permission, and no one is complaining then blocking is clearly just going to waste everyone's time. However, even if a bot explicitly has permssion, but is causing trouble, then it should be blocked. However, one thing that should always be remembered is that blocking a bot will almost certainly auto block the owner as well, as they will share an IP, so <i>asking</i> them to stop first is <i>always</i> a good idea. Also, AWB always stops when it gets a message, so if a user is known to be using AWB, then a block should never be needed, unless the user is refusing to stop of course. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 20:59, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just remember that this page is open to community input, so we like to wait a few days for that and also just to be a bit sure.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bot Flag Pages</span></h2>
<p>Ironically, after all the attention my recent RfB brought (so that I could set bot flags), the recent approved bots were not quickly set. Perhaps some of this is a problem with the two pages: Wikipedia:Requested bot flags and <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Approval_log_d863.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Approval log">Wikipedia:Bots/Approval log</a>. These two pages basically do the same thing. I'm going to merge these pages together, and we'll have to sort it out later. It is just too much hassle to update TWO pages AND the archive AND the requests for approval page. I'm just going to slim down the process. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 02:16, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the pages are a mess, I don't like the Log page at all. All approved bots are already in the archives here, and the operators summarize them on the Bots page. Too much <i>paper</i>work. If flags aren't involved, we don't need to get crats involved, so the Requests bot flags may be useful. I've updated the approved section of this request page to say approved for oepratiosn, incstead of approved for flag, as not all of them will need to be flagged. Most bots can flag their operations as minor to be filterable on RC; many operators like to run multiple tasks under their bot, sometimes these requrie them to be flagged as normal, sometimes not; unless an editor is making a single purpose bot, or a bot that will only ever do flaggable items, no need to flag it. Generally if their edits/min are going to be &lt;3, they don't really need a flag either. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Even if it is less than 3 per minute, they should still have a flag. These types of things are additive: One or two bots isn't a problem, but add them all together and it passed the threshold. It is work that doesn't need to show up in RC normally, minor or not. Vandals can use "minor edit" as well, so the bot flag helps in all vandalism patrol. But yes, there are a few cases where not having a bot flag is great, but that is probably the exception to the rule.</li>
<li>I've held off on merging the pages for now, as we can probably have a fun discussion about it. I'm going to just be bold and try a few things though, see what happens&#160;:)</li>

<dd>Hi all. About the delay in flagging approved bots: for most of the Bureacrat-related duties, there's a little delay. Even in RfA, which is the more "critical" of everything Bureaucrats do, there can be some delay. That's a side effect of the fact that the Bureaucrat group is supposed to be a small one, for security reasons. Currently, with Essjay inactive, we are a little more busy than usual.<br />
For my part, I've got all of the bot-related forums on my watchlist, but because of the high traffic, I'm seldom lucky enough to see an "approved" edit when I access my watchlist. I know it's a little more work, but posting to our Noticeboard is indeed the quickest way to get an approved bot flagged. Since I seem to be sort of the "main" Bureaucrat on the "bot flagging front" for the moment, I'd like to say to the Approvals Group members mainly, but also to all users that may be concerned: please feel absolutely free to ping me directly on my talk page or even e-mail for your bot flagging needs&#160;;) — although if you post only in one of those places, other Bureaucrats will not know about it, and thus won't be able to carry out the request if they come around before I do. But in any case, I'm at your disposal, so that we can get approved bots flagged as soon as possible.

<dd>Nichalp had mentioned a new forum as well. I like the idea. Something along the lines of <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a>, that is, succinct, with a predefined format that would include the name of the bot and links to the relevant discussion and, perhaps just to make it quicker, a diff to the edit in which an Approvals Group member gave the final endorsement (I always copy those into the "comment" section of the "makebot" tool). We don't need to protect it. We'd have instructions at the top (as we do at WP:CHU), which could include a list with the names of the members of the Approvals Group, explaining (if we decide to do it that way) that only members of the Approvals Group may post there requesting a flag for a bot. So, naturally, if someone else posts, we will deny the request immediately, or remove it from the page.<br />
In fact, this page should have two sections: one, and by far the busier one, would be to grant flags to approved bots; the other would be one to request removal of the flags from bots that have either lost endorsement or whose opperator simply decide to "debot" (this one may not be restricted to Approvals Group members, since bot opperators may wish to relinquish their bots' flag themselves).

At minimum we should do something about the expired request, but I'd like to get some thought on what next to do. Should we just approve the bot? What about a bot flag, should it have one? I personally say, yes, that's what the bot flag is for, since all bot edits are additive and there is no compelling reason to not hide the bot edits. Essjay is trusted and it is my understanding that the actions being performed are not controversial, problematic, or overly complex, so thus it should be flagged. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 19:33, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(ec)It appears as if the request above was for *additional* functionality, to do user pages in addition to project talk pages (which is apparently what User:EssjayBot III is supposed to do). I don't know where this was previously discussed or how it was approved. Perhaps it wasn't approved. In any case, I don't see a problem with it at this point. The issue at hand is what to do since 1) Essjay is inactive while his bot continues to run, 2) the bot runs without a bot flag, and 3) the request above appears to be what EssjayBot III is designed to do, but not approved for, so maybe we should approve it. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 20:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've sorted out the pages. The point in the bot flag is to not clog up recent changes with minor(ish) edits, the nature of this bot doesn't tally with that rationale, low edit count bots tend not to be flagged so they do have the transparency of appearing in RC. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, since I've just recently been pushing my agenda on the usage of bot flags, that's why I brought it up&#160;;-) I looked at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval&amp;oldid=66664389#EssjayBot_II" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval&amp;oldid=66664389#EssjayBot_II" rel="nofollow">history</a> when it was approved, and I see that you, Essjay, and Xaosflux all were in agreement about it having no flag. Still, at this point the changes made by the bot can be considered trivial and/or low-risk, as it has been making these changes for months now without incident, AFAIK. IMO, there is no longer any reason for it to NOT have a bot flag. Again, the point of the bot flag is not to make bot changes invisible. The point is to make people who don't care about them to have the ability to turn them off. That isn't to stop RC patrol from looking at bot edits to ensure their accuracy. The point is that *any* edits that do not need to be checked by vandalism patrols is good to have filtered out. I don't see why it needs to be checked by more eyes. THe pages that get archived have enough eyes as it is. If a mistake were made, it would be caught quickly, and almost always because of the users of those pages, not because of RC. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 20:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't intend to argue the point beyond this, because ultimately it makes little or no difference to me, and the owner of the bot was of course more than capable of flaging the bot. I disagree slightly with your view on this in that many people will ignore bot flagged edits regardless of their option to not do so, thus by giving out bot flags we are giving people a facility to sweep under a lot of peoples radar. Bots like this if working properly (and provide the user acts resposibly with the account) I agree there is probably little concern about, the concern is in the opposite circumstance where the bot is malfunctioning or the owner is acting irresponsibly with the bot account. Given the impact of having an additional 2-10 edits show up a day versus the "risk" element, it doesn't appear to me to be a clear cut case either way. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:42, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Essjay is a bureaucrat, so obviously we have *no* concern about acting irresponsibly. If that were the case, the bot flag would be the least of anyone's concern. If it was a different user I'd perhaps feel differently. Since bot edits are additive and the pages edited are high profile pages with lots of users checking the history, I think a bot flag makes sense here, but because of the low number of edits, I also do not feel like it *has* to be that way. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 20:47, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(ec)As an aside, I was somewhat serious about my agenda. But no so much that I don't want to establish consensus. When the bot flag was first created, its purpose was to hide the rambot. My changes were not trivial in a large number of cases, but the flag was granted anyway. Anyway, I have a particular viewpoint of how the bot flag should be used. Other persons have a *totally* different perspective, perhaps from the newer Wikipedia era of not trusting anyone (so much for <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a>!). In any case, there is no written policy of when a bot flag should and should not be assigned although some discussion has already occurred, and we will at some point have to come to a consensus on this very issue, which is why I bring it up. I just think it important to keep in mind that the bot flag does not shield the bot from being checked. I myself sometimes do some RC patrol for bot edits. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 20:43, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arrgh, you've drawn me in. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> is certainly not an issue here, as the owner of the bot is in a fairly trusted position, checkuser, boardvote, oversight etc. That said <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> is also not a call to shut your eyes and hope, we aren't insulting anybody or suggesting bad faith by presenting their bot edits without the bot flag, the same way we aren't with their regular edits. I'm not assuming anyone/everyone will turn rogue otherwise I'd suggest that we never bot flagged anyone and I wouldn't by default exclude bot edits in the IRC bot I run for several wikis.</dd>
<dd>One argument to this would be of course that we don't filter flag normal editors as bots, because part of RC is also because people may actually be genuinely interested in the changes from a non-vandalism hunting perspective. The nature of the filtering which is all or nothing, whereas I would have a fair guess that the majority of people aren't interested in seeing (say) interwiki links being added/removed, I'm not so sure I cam say the same of every bot task. Part of the equation also has to be if the edits "logically" fit as bot edits. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 21:03, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're points are well taken, and I apologize for "drawing you in". I would like to get the opinions of others as well, so a statement from everyone is helpful to try to determine consensus on this issue (if it exists). I'd agree with next to everything that you've said, as it is quite reasonable. I apologize for invoking AGF inappropriately. Your points <i>in general</i> are quite good. If I might nitpick some more, in the case of Essjay, archiving pages is to me almost on the order of interwiki links. They are being archived because no one cares about the discussion anymore. If people were still interesting in seeing those changes on RC, they'd have taken a vested interest in the discussion. I can't imagine why anyone would want to know from RC whether talk pages have been archived. A watchlist entry would be a *much* better alternative than trying to find it in RC! -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 21:16, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an interesting question and response. I have thought about downloading a subset of Wikipedia (probably in the few times 10000 page range) for my own private uses with refreshes to my local copy every few months.

<dd>Off the cuff, 20000 articles is substantial, but not determetial. How often would this be downloaded, and how quickly? Also once downloaded, what do you plan on doing with it?

<p>(deindent)I wanted to add this note: An acceptable use for downloading 20,000 articles is for some task that is going to be used to improve Wikipedia. It is perhaps not acceptable if the use is for some external use. I suppose it is a judgement call, but if I had to download 30,000 U.S. city articles, say, to fact check them and for other offline processing tasks, then it would be acceptable. But if I was downloading those same articles for another purpose unrelated to improving Wikipedia articles, then I would expect such a request to be denied. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 16:47, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We could clearly use more members to the approvals group, although the addition of new members has <i>vastly</i> increased the speed of approvals. The next step is to perhaps establish a more stable process for adding new members.

<dd>This is an excellent point. Obviously in the case of alphachimp, he couldn't very well comment on his own bot, but *anyone* can participate in the approval <i>process</i>.

<dd>I don't see an need for more members at this time. Perhaps the procedure could be fined tuned. I often want to wait at least a bit for comments by other BAG memembers or outsiders.

<p>I want to get permission to run a bot to add about 1300 articles I'm writing. The situation is fairly straightforward but there's one small hitch: the bot will be run by another Wikipedian on my behalf. (BTW, I believe he's trustworthy, seeing how he's been a positive contributor to the project for at least as long as I've been around.) I'm doing it this way because I'd rather hand this work to someone who has done it before, rather than create a bot more or less from scratch &amp; operate it myself for a one-time run. Is there anything I need to state in my request other than who will be running the bot? Do I need to create a special account for the bot to operate under?

<dd>GFDL is the biggest thing to worry about here, if 1300 new articles are created, they will be licensed under the account that creates them, a new bot account may be approriate, with it giving attribution to you, the bot owner.

<li>Well, first off, you need a pressing need for a bot with sysop privileges. The TawkerbotTorA wasn't one, as the vandalism from Tor proxies, as well as the advice to Chinese users, contradicted the stated need. Also, you need to assert whether something can only be done via an admin bot; if coding an extension is feasible, then go for that instead. IMO, sysopbots should be the absolute last resort. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 01:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Assistance scripts seem absolutely OK for me. For instance, VoA's script includes a rollback all tool, a delete all page creations tool and a block all AOL button. Those are controlled by humans, they just speed up a few very tedious processes. I'd encourage development of this type of admin tool. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>Alphachimp</b></a> 03:45, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>What we need is a framework for approving such tasks that need to run under unique accounts. Currently any sort of proposal to run an automated tool "legally" on a seperate account gets a huge share of "admin bots are scary" type&#160;!votes. Bots w/ elevated access can help us out if we provide carefully limited situations - the trick is to provide a framework that allows us to get help in the day to day operation w/o raising more fears. We need to help people see that sysop bots are not a doomsday situation, they can help us keep this place running. Anyways, I've been in discussion w/ a few people re this and there's some progress being made -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 05:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A good start would be to define what admin tasks a bot can sensibly do. Admin buttons are for:
<ul>
<li>Blocking/Unblocking</li>
<li>Deleting/Undeleting</li>
<li>Protecting/Unprotecting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>All of those in generality require some level of intelligence and discretion, there isn't a simple algorithm to determine when those actions should be taken. There are of course instances where a subset can be defined within the scope of a bot. (e.g. blocking page move vandals, blocking dodgy usernames, undoing "expired" page protection etc.) but at the same time, all these things which can be defined as a simple algorithm could be incorporated into Mediawiki and arguably done better than a bot could hope to achieve. (Pagemove rate could be limited, bad usernames could stopped being created, proper expiry could be add to page protection). The admin bot to date being Curps suffered many of the issues people object to in admin bots, it had false positives and was subject to scope creep (it started as a bad username blocking tool for a short term problem when we had a sustained attack of 100's/minute of dodgy usernames being created), and arguably redueced any urgency in dealing with those things being added to mediawiki. Of course the demise of the bot also didn't signal the end of the world, dodgy usernames haven't been a big problem, nor have we had a huge influx of pagemove vandals. For me the way Curps bot came about done was the "right" way, a bot implemented to resolve a short term problem against th users own account (maintaining a strong personal accountability), where it went wrong was that the functionality wasn't absorbed into mediawiki and the bot stopped. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 08:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

On some other Wikimedia wikis, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Special%7EImport_69f0.html" title="Special:Import">Special:Import</a> is an admin action too (I'm not sure about enwiki), and I can imagine mass transwikis taking place quite easily too. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 13:24, 17 October 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)

Editing protected pages, very few things are that urgent they won't wait until protection is removed (it's almost always temporary) or the few problem pages done manually. (This is actually a problem for some of our substing bots dealing with userpages which have since been protected due to abuse by the blocked user, which I guess will never be deprotected, though again there is a question of is it really that important? many of those pages will never be viewed again, certainly not often enough to concern ourselves about server load)<br />

<p>An idea was discussed a bit in the -admins channel re dealing with vandalism new pages (aka G1, the super super obvious stuff) - essentially if it fit a modified set of criteria for Tawkerbot2 and eventually (after running it in add to a speedy delete list for a while... and approval) an automatic speedy. The rough thought had a pretty warm reception on -admins - It might be something worth exploring (I talk msg'd xaosflux and how I post here&#160;:) (I can't see how we could integrate it into MW atm) -- Tawker 00:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds reasonable. Of course this could be worked into MW, if you can code a set of rules in a bot that same set of rule could be coded into MW to stop the page being created in the first place. The question would be could it be done better there, on first thoughts I'm not sure it could for a couple of reasons (i) by nature this is quite instance specific so probably best outside of the mainline code (ii) People would just mould theirnonsense around those rules until it got accepted. The latter has a risk of happening with a bot of this nature particularly if it deleted them quickly (though TB2s success perhaps demonstrates the intelligence (or lack thereof) of the average vandal). But early days yet a speedy tagging bot (or a parallel bot tagged speedy) might be interesting to see how well it performed. Alternatively it might be interesting to do something like this just listing up potentials on a page and work out later how many actually got tagged by someone, how many got missed by humans within a given timeframe, how many got tagged by humans but not the bot (perhaps a harder problem to solve, having to work through the delete log and try and work out which were speedies...) and how many shouldn't have been tagged, refine it repeat etc. then we'd have some hard number to demonstrate. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:07, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And a downside. New page patrol is more than just tagging speedies, it's also tagging stubs, cleanup etc. etc. So even if the bot tagged them chances are someone would/shuld still look at them anyway, though longer term that might be an argument to let it go straight for the delete... --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:13, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This wouldn't be that hard to code, but the real question is it really usefull. Giving every new user the same generic message may take away from the welcoming aspect.

<dd>The idea has been rejected many times over at <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOTREQ_4084.html" title="WP:BOTREQ">WP:BOTREQ</a>.

<dd>As already said really it'd take away the personal touch. (MediaWiki could easily set up and initial talk page with and initial message on account creation).

<dd>Perhaps, following on for Xaosflux's idea, we could do a bot wo find users who have x edits and who haven't been welcomed, and either give them an information message, or add them to a list of un welcomed users, for humans to welcome. The problem I see with this is finding out whither a user has been welcomed if they have deleted the message from their page - perhaps we'ed need to look for empty talk pages.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Read only bot</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I was wondering, do I need approval for a bot that reads wikipedia(not excessivly, around 3 requests per minute) but does not write/change? I am thinking of a script that find potentially bad edits, but in such a way that automatic changes would be bad as it is not accurate, and simply gives me(a human with an account in good standing) a list of urls to diffs.</p>
<p>I only ask this as it seems wikipedia refuses clients with unknown, or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl.html" title="Perl">perl</a> based useragents. I could easily spoof a common set of headers, but I want to know if passive, gentle(slow) automatic reading of wikipedia needs special permsision.</p>

<p>I've got a similar read-only question. I have a couple of things in mind, including an anti-linkspam monitor, that could use a real-time feed of recent changes. I'm aware of the IRC channel, and built a parser for that, but I'd also like to get the content of the change. Does somebody already have a richer feed? If not, I'm like to build and publish one. For that, should I get approval before I start development? In load it would be no worse than some of the vandal-fighting tools, but at one fetch per edit, it's still not small.
