<dd>I'm skeptical that it's a good idea to have a bot automatically make any interwiki links. Shouldn't they all be checked by a human to make sure the target actually covers the same topic as the source? It's perfectly find to have an automated process <i>suggest</i> interwiki links and/or help a human make links faster, though. Out of curiousity, how will your bot be deciding which links to suggest? -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 03:31, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you are doing offline processing of database dumps, and using the result to guide manual edits, there is no need to request permission here. A script that helps a human editor make changes one at a time (like a javascript script) and where the human checks the output is not a bot, and no permission is required. Any process that makes edits automatically, or which makes multiple edits in response to a human's command, is a bot, and requires community pre-approval. Automated processes using admin priviliges should also be approved here. Read-only spiders are discouraged.

<dd>That definition would make some stuff we have been traditionally treating as bots such as semi automated disambig tools (retrive what links here for a disambig and then let a user quickly process each of the pages linking to the disambig by selecting one of the items on the disambig page to change the link to) not count as bots any more.

<p>I don't understand your question; I also understand Croat and Bosnian (very similar languages to Slovene). Also, after I posted this request, I was asked by Serbian community to use KocjoBot on&#160;:sr; so this bot will be running on&#160;:bs,&#160;:en, hr:,&#160;:sl: and&#160;:sr. Because a lot of these WP has foreign iw, but others don't have theirs, so IMHO I think that this Bot is great need to coordinate these WP.

<dd>We have a policy on the English Wikipedia, which is to ask Interwiki linking bot operators to understand the language that they plan to interwiki with. If you do understand the languages written on bs, en, hr, sl, &amp; sr, then you are permitted to run a trial period of one week. If no complaints are made within that week, you can continue to run your bot.

<dd>It is still general English Wikipedia policy for bots to run a trial run of one week, even if you have been running it elsewhere. Sorry, we deal with a lot of stupid vandals around the English Wikipedia. It is not to say you are one, but it needs to be proven that you aren't one. A trial run of one week will assert whether your bot is: harmless, useful, and not a server hog. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 08:30, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The bot recognized such "articles" (minimal text) as non-text and removes it from the list. If you see, what is on the page you'll see. If that is a problem, OK. I've already made modification. About "beyond what it's approved for": I meant that I'll be running bot on 5 WP with fixing IW of all languages, not just these 5. If this is problem, sorry for not making more clear. BTW.

<dd>At this time it will be restricted to the main collaboration of the week, and possibly the UK collaboration of the fortnight (as I am semi-involved in this). The bot would update the "number of votes by X" by counting the number of votes made (the number of lines starting with #, without a&#160;: (which would indicate a reply to a support vote) and with a signature in the line in the support section), discarding any votes from IP addresses, and changing the date and number of votes required appropriately. If a nomination failed to get the correct number of votes, as calculated above, it would remove it from the page and add it to the archive page. For both stages I would run trials where the bot would suggest a change to make before enabling the bot to do it automatically. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 19:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A fair point. This is something which would be a minor problem with the automatic removal of unsuccessful nominations rather than updating the no. of votes required and date for ones which get the required number of votes (as someone could remove the sockpuppet votes when they were detected, and the bot would correct the no. of votes required and date). It would only be a problem with removal because the article would stay nominated even though it may have been unsuccessful (and only kept due to the sockpuppets). However, I think that having an article stay by mistake is better than having an article removed by mistake, which is more likely if the bot attempted to do sockpuppet detection. I don't see this bot as being a substitute for people looking over the nominations, just a substitute for updating the no. of votes required and date, which is menial. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 21:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nominations are not signed (the first vote is that of the nominator); I'm assuming you mean unsigned votes, and the answer is that typically the signature is the only text left by the voter and a vote without a signature I believe it is a non-issue. In the event it occured, the bot would not count it as a vote (but would if the person later added their signature or someone used the {{<a href="../../../u/n/s/Template%7EUnsigned_e4f5.html" title="Template:Unsigned">unsigned</a>}} template). <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 21:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was running the bot with autonomous mode. When running in autonomous mode, the bot tries to collect interwiki links and update it. (The bot don't run in en: now.)</p>
<p>When I got the bot permission in en:, The bot could update only the home language wikipedia. At that time to update a link using a bot, I have to run the bot on ko: first; analyze the log of bot; change the language setting to en:; and update a missing links depending on the log. This process is easy to do mistakes and sometimes outdated. (The time difference between running of the bot in ko: and en: can be a week or more.)</p>
<p>The pywikipedia software was updated to allow multiple site simultaneously after July.

Many other bot operators also use it. It is hard to say that the program is perfect, but it works well.</p>

<dd>How does it determine which articles are the same without user intervention? Just because <i>nl:A</i> links to <i>ko:B</i> and <i>ko:B</i> links to <i>en:C</i>, doesn't necessarily mean <i>nl:A</i> should link to <i>en:C</i> (or vice-versa). Article topics are frequently chosen differently which causes the link between <i>nl:A</i> and <i>ko:B</i> to be off but a reasonable approximation, however compounding the topic approximation error of nl→ko and ko→en is going to get an even worse match for the nl→en.</dd>

<p>The pywikipedia framework just assumes that any link to or from en:A is just as good as any other link, and that if fr:B links to en:A, any links to and from fr:B might as well go directly to en:A. Unless there is a conflict, e.g. nl:C links to fr:B and en:D, in which case it asks for manual intervention.</p>
<p>We should be explicit - do we want to establish a policy that all interwiki links must be manually reviewed? Personally, I think an interwiki link to a slightly-off article is better than none at all, and humans can check that sort of thing after the fact.</p>
<p>I think it's important to insist that bots only modify articles <i>in</i> languages the bot operator can understand, to deal with complaints from denizens of that Wikipedia.</p>
<p>But what about links <i>to</i> various other Wikipedias? If we insist on manual review of all interwiki links, then obviously bot operators must speak the target language. (And by doing so we miss out on some of the links suggested by the pywikipedia method.) But with an automated default, what's wrong with bot operators replying to a complaint, "I don't speak German; if you do and you think the link should be changed, go ahead"?</p>
<p>If we insist on manual review (whether while the bot is running or afterwords, by looking at contribs) we have a lot of enforcement to catch up on. If we don't, then we can basically give blanket permission to run any standard interwiki bot based on pywikipedia for anyone that can speak English and who we trust to run a bot. Personally, I'm fine with the latter. Some WikiProject can systematically check interwiki links, if they want, either by following bots around, or in some other fashion. (After all, people make bad interwiki links, too, whether because they don't speak a certain language very well, or because they didn't know that there's a better article to link to.) -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 02:10, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

It automatically leaves {{<a href="../../../n/o/w/Template%7ENowCommons_a542.html" title="Template:NowCommons">NowCommons</a>}} macro on the original one. If you are complaining to moving images in hidden (bot account), I can change it. -- <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChongDae_7d74.html" title="User:ChongDae">ChongDae</a> 08:09, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
