<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rambot demographics to past tense</span></h2>
<p>The majority of the US location articles that were added by <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">Rambot</a> are written in the present tense. "As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, the population is... the average income is... the majority of families have..." etc. These should be changed to past tense.</p>
<p>It's pretty straightforward to do - within the demographics section, replace "is" with "was" (10 instances); replace "are" with "were" (12 instances); replace "have" with "had" (4 instances). I've been doing this manually when I come across them (see, for example, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasper%2C_New_York_9d4a.html" title="Jasper, New York">Jasper, New York</a>), but that'll take a while across 30,000 articles and it seems to me like a task ideally suited to a bot. Any offers? --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 10:07, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I'm pretty sure these should remain present tense. They are still describing the current world, just somewhat inaccurately. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 09:38, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They are absolutely not describing the current world. They are <i>explicitly</i> describing what the situation was six years ago, at the time of the last census. They should be changed because a) except for the very smallest of communities, these figures are unlikely to still be accurate; b) even where the figures haven't changed, we don't know that - all that we know, verifiably, is what the situation was six years ago; c) it's simply bad grammar to say, "As of the census of 2000, there are 1,270 people... residing in the town"; d) these articles are currently inconsistent, as the intro is already in the past tense. Note that I am not suggesting that the "geography" section (also based on the census bureau figures) should be changed to past tense, as the area of the towns and the portion covered by water is unlikely to have changed. --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 11:07, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Referral ID spam remove bot</span></h2>
<p>I've been removing referral IDs from outgoing links I've been able to find every now and then. I frankly don't like the idea that someone could make money from Wikipedia by sneaking these links into places where they even could be considered legit.</p>
<p>What I'd like this bot to do is to find links that contain a referral ID, strip it off and post a normal one that works just as well.</p>
<p><b>example:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000W5L/sr=1-1/qid=1138522986/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0299503-7272610?%5Fencoding=UTF8" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000W5L/sr=1-1/qid=1138522986/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0299503-7272610?%5Fencoding=UTF8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000W5L/sr=1-1/qid=1138522986/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0299503-7272610?%5Fencoding=UTF8</a></p>
<p>becomes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000W5L/sr=1-1/qid=1138522986/" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000W5L/sr=1-1/qid=1138522986/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000W5L/sr=1-1/qid=1138522986/</a></p>

<dd>That's a good idea. I did a quick search over the enwiki dump from 20060125 and there are about 1500 amazon links with /ref in them. Note that you can reduce the URLs even further. Your example can be reduced to:</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ladnav bot, to reverse a vandal</span></h2>
<p>Since fy: has been getting a higher load of real vandalism lately (as opposed to the occasional graffiti-editor), I'm looking for a way to revert the contributions of a specified anonymous user in a somewhat automated way. As the bot bit does have a function in this process, as done by administrators, I expected to find an actual bot to help them out, but I can't find it. If I'm blind, could someone point me in the right direction. If not, would someone be willing and able to write such a bot? The task seems pretty straight forward; it's just an awful lot of clicking when done by hand. 217.123.4.108 21:03, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The backlog on <a href="../../../c/l/e/Category%7ECleanup_by_month_e71f.html" title="Category:Cleanup by month">Category:Cleanup by month</a> is getting out of control, with 1.3% of Wikipedia currently tagged for cleanup. In order to speed the cleanup process, I propose a janitor bot to move "cleanup" pages that belong in other maintenance departments elsewhere.</p>
<p>The bot would have the following proposed behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>If {{cleanup}} is found on a list, replace it with cleanup-list.</li>
<li>If {{cleanup}} is found on a disambig, replace it with disambig-cleanup.</li>
<li>If less than MINWIKILINK % of the text contains hyperlinks within Wikipedia, replace {{cleanup}} with {{wikify}}. A proposed value for MINWIKILINK is 0.1%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two tasks appear to be within the capabilities of current bots, and should be easy to accomplish. Going through the capabilities of current <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a> does not show the capability to determine percentage of wiki links, but this is probably not a difficult task, as word counting and a repeated regexp search for /[[*]]/ should be all that's required.</p>

<p>It might be nice if American Cities/Towns were displayed as nicely as British towns were. E.g. on the right side are all the vital/geo stats, and the articles expalins the town in question. American towns currently get a red dot on a map of the state they are in, but the non-American readers probably have no idea where the dot is in realtion to the USA as a whole. In general, the system from American towns/cities/etc seems a bit American-centric. Maybe I'm off base. I wouldn't mind a discussion, as I feel I can learn quite a bit more about British towns in general than the American counterparts by the general info displayed.</p>

<p>is there a bot that can perform search functions to link Wikipedia articles that are relevant to a Wikibook? Also, and, more generally, Wikicities, other areas of WikiBooks, Wiktionary, (And, I know, getting less likely the heuristic would be able to discern what was relevant, but i'd rather delete bad links than put in all of my own.)

<p>There has been discussion at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_31e1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization">Wikipedia talk:Categorization</a> about repopulating some categories that had previously been depopulated after being divided into subcategories. One example is <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_actors_3f14.html" title="Category:American actors">Category:American actors</a>. There is a good deal of support for doing this. Before there was {{<a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECategoryTOC_eea2.html" title="Template:CategoryTOC">CategoryTOC</a>}} it was necessary to break large categories into smaller subcategories, and there is a value in having these smaller categories. However, categories also serve as the master index of subjects and it is often frustrating to have to look in several subcategories to browse through the articles in a subject. A good example of this is <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilm_directors_457f.html" title="Category:Film directors">Category:Film directors</a>. The proposal is to keep the subcategories, but also have articles duplicated in parent (or grand-parent) categories up to the level of topic articles.</p>
<p>I am wondering if a bot could be created to run frequently (once a day?) which would go through a list of categories that should be duplicated in other categories and check to see if the duplications exist. If they do not, they would be added. I suspect that there will need to be a page created to discuss this duplication process (Wikipedia:Duplicated Categories?) and editing the list of duplications would probably have to be limited to admins. By having this bot, a person could add the lowest level category that applies and the category would also end up in the higher level categories. The bot would have to look at each article in the category and see if the higher level categorization exists, if it does not, the categorization would be added. For categories of people, the piping should be copied so that the article is alphabetized correctly.</p>
<p>Another bot might scan through the higher level lists and collate a list of articles that have not been put in any of the lower level subcategories.</p>
<p>I am just wondering if this is possible. There would have to be quite a bit of discussion about whether this should happen and how it will happen. First I want to know what is possible.

<dd>Well, if you just want the bot to add a category (the higher up one) to every page in a list its trivial, any pywikipedia bot (including Tawkerbot) can do it. If you want the AI, that's getting into fuzzy logic and might be a little trickier -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 18:35, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What do you mean by the AI? Are you talking about the piping? The bot can look at the categorization for the subcategory and use the same piping when adding the categorization in the parent category. As a test, would it be possible to duplicate the categorization of the articles in <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_film_actors_613a.html" title="Category:American film actors">Category:American film actors</a> so that they are also in <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_actors_3f14.html" title="Category:American actors">Category:American actors</a>. In this case the aphabetizing of each article in <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_actors_3f14.html" title="Category:American actors">Category:American actors</a> would be the same when copying the piping from <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_film_actors_613a.html" title="Category:American film actors">Category:American film actors</a>. I've been doing this with AWB and it takes quite a bit of work and there are hundreds of articles.

<dd>By "AI" he means that the bot will run on its own with artificial intelligence. A pywikipediabot can't run on it's own, as the human must tell it what do, where to do it, etc. <b><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs"><font color="blue">F</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><i>e</i></font></a><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs"><font color="blue">tofs</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../f/e/t/User_talk%7EFetofs_75a9.html" title="User talk:Fetofs"><font color="maroon">Hello!</font></a></sup> 12:05, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to be that a better solution would be to get the MediaWiki software to display all subcat articles of a particular category.

<dd>This is a common response that I've heard for about a year and a half. I am not convinced that this will ever happen, and I'm not sure it needs to happen. Usually, the higher level categories only have subcategories. Having them populated adds the flexibility of seeing the larger sets and the smaller ones. If having a large number of articles makes it difficult to see the set of subcategories, it is possible to split the category such as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Category%7EOperas_d24f.html" title="Category:Operas">Category:Operas</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Category%7EOpera_5482.html" title="Category:Opera">Category:Opera</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 21:43, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spoken Wikipedia Project</span></h2>
<p>Hi there! Those on the <a href="../../../s/p/o/WP%7ESPOKEN_8e38.html" title="WP:SPOKEN">Spoken Wikipedia Project</a> would like to explore using a bot to help with our work. Here are a couple of things that have come up in discussions with other project members:</p>
<p><a name="RSS_Feed_Updater" id="RSS_Feed_Updater"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">RSS Feed Updater</span></h3>
<p>Right now, we have a manually-updated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia/rss" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia/rss" rel="nofollow">RSS feed</a> that lists new articles that have been recorded. That way, project members and casual listeners can find our new content easily. It would be great if we had a way to automate this, to save <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESCEhardt_7145.html" title="User:SCEhardt">SCEhardt</a> the work. Let me know if you're interested in that project.</p>
<p><a name="Tagging" id="Tagging"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Tagging</span></h3>
<p>Currently, we use several tags for our project:</p>
<p>1. We have a tag that people use <b>when they request an article</b> to have read aloud and recorded.</p>
<p>2. We are discussing two tags that project members can add to the article's talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>One that <b>replaces the request tag</b> when a project member has volunteered to record the article</li>
<li>a related tag to use when a project member decides to record an article, but <b>nobody has requested it for recording</b>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once an article is recorded and uploaded:</p>
<p>3. We have a couple of tags that go on the article's page itself:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>one for recordings that are <b>a single file.</b></li>
<li>and one for <b>long recordings that have been split into several parts</b> for faster downloading</li>
<li>and one for recordings of a <b>page summarised in another article</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. In addition to that, we add a tag to the article's <i>talk page</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A version for recordings <b>where the article is unchanged</b> (stable versions, for example)</li>
<li>And we have a version that is used <b>when the article has changed</b>--it provides a link to the old version that the recording it based on.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>5. Additionally, we have a tag that goes on the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a> page that alerts people that the article is available in an audio format, too.</p>
<p>6. Finally,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>We add a tag for the article on <a href="../../../s/p/o/Category%7ESpoken_articles_3e07.html" title="Category:Spoken articles">Category:Spoken articles</a></li>
<li>But of course, there's a slight variation to the tag if the article <b>was featured at the time of the recording</b>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>So as you can see, we use between 4 and 6 tags for each recording. They all serve a good purpose: they promote the project, help organize our work, and make sure that people can find our recordings.</p>
<p>However, it's a lot of work to do this. Not all of these tags can be automated, but it seems to me that at least a couple could be. For instance, #4 might be. And it would be very useful if we could automate #6.</p>
<p>Again, if this idea is something you;d like to pursue, I can re-explain all of this and/or provide more details. <a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkamaeleon_b2c2.html" title="User:Ckamaeleon">Ckamaeleon</a> <a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkamaeleon_a5ca.html" title="User talk:Ckamaeleon">((T))</a> 02:41, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AllyUnion's Bots</span></h2>
<p>Several of AllyUnion's bots appear to have gone offline several days ago. It's only when the automated tasks that you are used to being done don't get done that you realize how much you depend on a bot. And this is currently the case. From AllyUnion's user page, it appears that he is mostly on wikibreak. I tried emailing him, but his email does not work. So I've left a message on his talk page. But if he's on break, who knows when he will see it.</p>
<p>So the next question becomes, how long do we wait until the bots are declared out of service, and how then can we get some other bots to pick up the duties. Specific bots that appear to be down include:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>NekoDaemon being out of service is what brought this all to my attention, as CFD is one of my normal home playgrounds.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV detector bot</span></h2>
<p>I can envision the development of a bot that searches for phrases such as "is a great", "is a fantastic", "is a terrific", "is an awful" ..etc. that could indicate strong POV within the article text.

<dd>Barring exceptionally brilliant AI, the bot would not be able to conclude from the context whether the statement is truly POV or not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Western Reserve bot</span></h2>
<p>Someone has put the following paragraph in a bunch of articles on Ohio townships:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"(Note: The U.S. Census Bureau counts township populations in the Connecticut Western Reserve as distinct from any municipalities located within the township. For populations of any municipalities within the township, please read the corresponding articles for those municipalities.)"</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is inaccurate. Some municipalities in Western Reserve townships, such as <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortland%2C_Ohio_3f0a.html" title="Cortland, Ohio">Cortland, Ohio</a>, are independent from surrounding townships. Others, such as <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton_Falls%2C_Ohio_fcfd.html" title="Newton Falls, Ohio">Newton Falls, Ohio</a>, are part of the surrounding townships. This is no different than anywhere else in Ohio.</p>
<p>I'd like to see a bot that would delete the paragraph from all pages on which it is found. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 02:24, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(There was <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobo_2836.html" title="User:Cobo">User:Cobo</a> of course, but that doesn't seem to have ever taken off.)</p>
<p>I find a lot of copyvios that have been dormant for months... and it seems like there are probably tons out there, if I can just check a few random articles and find one pretty fast. It seems like a bot with an organized approach would uncover thousands, and with an easy methodology... just select a few random 5-10 word phrases from the article, no punctuation, and search on Google, Altavista, etc for the exact phrase. The bot would make a list of any positive results. Of course it would have to ignore wikipedia mirrors. The odds of it listing a copyvio of something that is actually PD/GPL are low, in my experience, people are more interested in copying and pasting press releases, corporate bios, etc. than Project Gutenberg kind of stuff. But even still... that's where the human factor comes in.</p>
<p>The bot would just create a simple list of possible copyvios (with URLs), so it would be 100% non-invasive... humans (me, for example) would go through the list and handle as appropriate. The list could be stored in the bots userspace or wherever... I imagine it wouldn't be hard to drum up some people to go through it.</p>
<p>There are over a million articles now so it would be a lot of work and time... but afterwards it could perhaps monitor new articles (though that might be mre difficult to implement). Also since it's not live, I'm not even sure it would need to be flagged as a bot... all it would do is upload a list eventually, or in installments perhaps.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not a programmer... so I have no idea how hard this would be to implement. But given that it's not live, it could presumably be written in any language, up to Visual Basic. I've been thinking about this for a while though, and I think it would make a very positive impact on Wikipedia, and our goal of creating a truly free encyclopedia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dictionary bot</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to find out if there is a bot created already that establishes a dictionary of terms found in a wiki site. Currently, there is no listing of definitions, and the terms end up being fairly convoluted at times.</p>
<p>I am able to generate a list of all the terms, and also to create definitions (manually), but I need to go back through the wiki site and create links from those terms to the dictionary. Further, some of the terms are too common to automatically replace using a bot, so they need to be removed from the "link creation" process, yet still remain in the dictionary. Is there something like this I can use as a bot base? Or is it simple to write?</p>
<p>Please note that this is for a mediawiki site. Is there a way that mediawiki can be set up to do this? (I have only glanced at the software docs, as I am not the admin).</p>
<p>Admins, you may email me with any responses. Thanks in advance!</p>

<dd>Tawker,</dd>
<dd>I don't mean every word on the page. All terms would be defined in a separate page - a dictionary page. Each term on this page would have an associated code - a simple "1" or "0", for example. This code could be listed anywhere in the definition, hidden or not. What this code would do is tell the bot, "Ok, this term is something to go through the wiki site and make into a link back here." or else would say, "Ok, don't make links of this term on the wiki site."</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Language-links Checker</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed by browsing some of the Wikipedia Chinese articles that they will often link to an English page which has no corresponding link back to the Chinese version, and even one or two Chinese pages with no link to the relevant English article. I came across this actually several times in a short period of time, and would guess it to be not all that uncommon.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if someone could create a bot to scan pages and follow the links to different language versions, and make sure that all of the different translations are linked up. (i.e. that if a page exists in 15 different languages on any given topic, that each of those 15 versions has links to all 14 others).</p>
<p>Aside from just making it easier to find content in multiple languages, this may also encourage users to contribute in more than one language if they know the article exists in a second language they are familiar with.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

For example, the bot would create redirects like <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution_Calling_091d.html" title="Revolution Calling">this one</a> for the tracks at <a href="../../../m/i/n/Operation%7E_Mindcrime_6f8a.html#Track_listing" title="Operation: Mindcrime">Operation: Mindcrime#Track listing</a>.

<p>Note to whomever undertakes this task, it would be adviseable to create disambiguation pages in many cases. Thus, if the bot detects that the page it is about to create already exists as an {{<a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_song_729d.html" title="Template:R from song">R from song</a>}}, it could determine the artist/band and the year associated with both songs and create a dab page, e.g.:</p>
<p><tt>'''Foo at Tiffany's''' can refer to:<br />
*[[Foo at Tiffany's (Steely Dan song)]], from the 1988 album ''[[Becker's Mom (album)|Becker's Mom]]''<br />
*[[Foo at Tiffany's (Tupac song)]], from the 2007 album ''[[R U Still Buyin' Dis?]]''</tt></p>
<p>Obviously the titles are fictitious, but the scenario is real. Each of these two links would then be created as a redirect to the article about the album on which the song was released. I'm thinking the above should only apply in the case of unrelated songs. Cover versions should, in my opinion, redirect to the original release, or be combined on the same line of the disambiguation page, if "Foo at Tiffany's" also refers to something else, such as a film. This would most likely require manual intervention.</p>
<p>In the event that the title does refer only to a song, and equally notable versions of the same song have been released my more than one artist, it should probably be created as a distinct article explaining this. — <small>Apr. 29, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[10:35] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">High Schools</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I don't know if this would be feasible, but I thought I would put it out there for discussion. It might be helpful (possible?) to create a bot that creates articles for all high schools. Just about every state has an article named "List of High Schools in XXXXX", XXXXX being the state, as well as a "Wikipedia Project Missing encyclopedic articles/High Schools/US/XXXXX", again XXXXX being the name of the state. The bot could (for instance) make an article with the name of the school and then the name of the city and state in parentheses (since a high school is often named the same as other high schools, ex: <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southside_High_School_%28Gadsden%2C_Alabama%29_a8de.html" title="Southside High School (Gadsden, Alabama)">Southside High School (Gadsden, Alabama)</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southside_High_School_%28Fort_Smith%2C_Arkansas%29_f22a.html" title="Southside High School (Fort Smith, Arkansas)">Southside High School (Fort Smith, Arkansas)</a>. The beginning article could be a stub that said only: "XXXXXXXXXX High School is a secondary education school located in CITY, STATE.", or something of that nature. It is my opinion that a lot of people that attend a high school, or alumni of a high school would be much more apt to edit an existing article on their high school than create a brand new article on their high school (much more so than other articles on wikipedia).

<dl>
<dd>Something similar to this has been attempted before, see Wikipedia:Long term abuse/B-Movie Bandit. Horrible idea, I'm afraid. "Articles" (sub-stubs that is), especially those which are impossible to expand and impermissable to delete, should be avoided at all costs. — <small>Apr. 24, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[01:24] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt>

<dd>Perhaps I do not understand, 1) How does someone using several IPs to edit have something to do with this topic? and 2) How would the articles be impossible to expand? I have created articles in the past as stubs and they have been expanded. I was just thinking that there are only a few high schools that have articles now, and if you look at either of the 2 lists I mentioned for any of the states, you can see only about 10-20% of high schools have articles. It just seems as if there should be more high schools represented, and as it stands now, some are extremely well represented (have long articles), some have a little info, and some have absolutely no info. The types of articles that high schools fall into are different than other types of articles in that many people attended (and therefore theoretically have intimate knowledge of) said high schools, plus the types of people that will be searching for high schools will be much more likely to expand existing articles than even know how to go about creating a brand new article. This may not be the greatest idea, I admit, but the reasons you gave don't seem to apply to this request. If the concept was misunderstood, I can attempt to restate it in a different way. (<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">Cardsplayer4life</a> 02:06, 24 April 2006 (UTC))</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>It appears Wikipedia already has around 50,000 high school related pages<sup class="plainlinks"><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;as_epq=high+school&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=title&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=wikipedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;as_epq=high+school&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=title&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, and a significant number of them are starved of content. I have a more useful suggestion, but it would require more effort to set up. A bot could scan the categories populated by the various <tt>{{*-school-stub}}</tt> templates, and for the articles we already have, e.g. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_High_School_%28Des_Moines%29_c762.html" title="Herbert Hoover High School (Des Moines)">Herbert Hoover High School (Des Moines)</a>, determine a [name, location] pair, form a search engine query, e.g. <tt style="background: lightyellow">%2B%22Herbert+Hoover+High+School%22+%2B%22Des+Moines%22+-%22Wikipedia%22</tt>, produce a URL, e.g. <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Herbert+Hoover+High+School%22+%2B%22Des+Moines%22+-%22Wikipedia%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Herbert+Hoover+High+School%22+%2B%22Des+Moines%22+-%22Wikipedia%22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></span>, and post it to the article's talk page, to assist anybody who may have a keen interest in improving the article, but no idea where and how to find the info.</p>
<p>Further, with a little bit of fuzzy logic, it may be possible to ascertain some vital statistics (e.g. enrollment, year of establishment, mascot, name of current principal...) with a <i>reasonable</i> (but far from perfect) degree of accuracy, and enumerate them in the form of a bulleted list on the stub's talk page, including also a link to the page(s) from which the information was derived. A human could follow the links, verify the factoids, hopefully also locate additional information while visiting the various sites (some of them might be obscure news articles, for example), and then add the information to the article.</p>
<p>If somebody wanted to run a bot like that, and a critical mass of other people were willing to follow up on each result posting, this idea could be a successful operation, improve Wikipedia's coverage of non-notable schools, make the existing stubs worth keeping, and help reduce the community's animosity toward the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> project as a whole.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">General Vandalism bot.</span></h2>
<p>I think that when a page or more of text is deleted from a single article, a bot should undo the change. Since the standards of information that are put into the article are fairly high, anyone deleting a lot of this information is likely a vandal. For someone who is actually doing work, the bot should send them their alterations in it's response (So if it's valid they don't have to retype it) and give a link to a human editor they can appeal to if their editing wasn't vandalism.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Innapropriate terminology bot?</span></h2>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>There seem to be about 145 articles (Google search terms USS + Splashed) on US Navy ships of the Second World war that use the terms "splash", "splashing" or "splashed" as euphimisms for the shooting down by US Forces of aircraft flown specifically by Japaneese pilots, or crashes involving such aircraft. The wording appears to have been taken in verbatim from the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_American_Naval_Fighting_Ships_7979.html" title="Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships">Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships</a>. It could be argued that this terminology makes light of the deaths of the young men involved. If this argument is accepted then is this something a bot could be used to fix?</p>
