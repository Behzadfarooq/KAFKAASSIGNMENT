<h2><span class="mw-headline">When to use a Bot user account</span></h2>
<p>Hi! I have a question about the difference between using a bot and the very useful <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupin_68a5.html" title="User:Lupin">User:Lupin</a>'s Popups tool. I've tried working with solve_disambiguation.py in manual mode in conjunction with the popup-tool and met with great success. Based on the information contained within the <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a> article page, any use of pywikipedia should be done under a bot account. Though, I don't see much difference in running the bot in a manual mode (where each edit is scrutinized and responded to on screen) and using the Popups tool to do the same thing. Would one also need a bot account to use the automated editing available in Popups? Just wondering before I consider continuing with pywikipedia or stick with Popups. Thanks&#160;:-). <b>&gt;:</b> <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobyWayne_5f41.html" title="User:RobyWayne"><b>Roby Wayne</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobyWayne_f7a9.html" title="User talk:RobyWayne">Talk</a></sup> 07:30, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I (Luigi30) am looking for approval on a bot to clean out <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>'s created articles. Obviously it'd require approval to delete each link so I don't clean out legitimate blue links (redirects, sources). It'd run using pywikipedia. I don't think I'd need to run it more than once a week seeing as how infrequently Requested Articles is used. It takes me 3 hours to do it by hand, I'd say it'd take a couple hours to put together the bot and it'd be a whole lot quicker to delete each one.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interwiki Bot policy</span></h2>
<p>On basis of what is the interwiki bot policy being made? The policy as it is now makes it impossible to actually run the bot, because it will get all interwikis. Apparently it was created by someone who has not first checked the actual working of the bot. Who was it, where has this been decided, and what can I do to get the policy under discussion again? - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 09:16, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may propose a new policy here. The consideration was after a considerable screw up made by <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlacus_7d8f.html" title="User:Flacus">Flacus</a> and his <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlaBot_747f.html" title="User:FlaBot">FlaBot</a> (F<a href="../../../l/_/_/L.html" title="L">la</a>Bot) which removed interwiki links on several articles. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlacus_7d8f.html" title="User:Flacus">Flacus</a> made no attempt to continuously check his bot at the time, and his bot was subsequently banned. He also attempted to, apparently, get his bot unblocked by stating that his bot was confused for a vandal bot with <a href="../../../f/i/a/User%7EFIaBot_ff63.html" title="User:FIaBot">FIaBot</a> (F<a href="../../../i/_/_/I.html" title="I">Ia</a>Bot).</dd>
<dd>According to the block log:
<ul>
<li>00:22, 11 May 2005 AllyUnion blocked "User:FlaBot" with an expiry time of 3 weeks (Bot not operating as intended; Removing zh-min-nan or zh (chinese) links.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And according to the contributions: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FIaBot_1190.html" title="Special:Contributions/FIaBot">Contributions of FIaBot</a> (F<a href="../../../i/_/_/I.html" title="I">Ia</a>Bot)
<ul>
<li>18:48, 11 May 2005 (hist) (diff) m Japanese cuisine (robot Modifying:de)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Flacus was also repeatedly warned, both on his German userpage and his English userpage to fix his bot, but to no avail. See: <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Archive_interwiki_350e.html#FlaBot" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Archive interwiki">Wikipedia_talk:Bots/Archive_interwiki#FlaBot</a>. However, since his unbanning, his bot seems to be operating properly. The main issue of concern here is that we have bots that seem to operate, and end up removing interwiki links. Shouldn't the removal of interwiki links be done by someone who familiar with the language? --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 21:39, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, shouldn't they reasonably understand English if they plan to run their bot here or at least have someone who can speak for them? --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 22:03, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's hard for me to check the facts here; the edit you give above is indeed by FIabot rather than Flabot as he claims, but there are other complaints on the history page of the user discussion page which do seem to be valid.</dd>
<dd>However, I still am of the opinion that restricting bots to only edit languages known by their operators is too strict. First, the basic working of the bot includes the addition of interwiki links on pages that interwiki links exist to. Secondly, a lot of information can be found in languages that one does not speak. As an example I show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=F%C3%A4rgelanda_Municipality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27560118" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=F%C3%A4rgelanda_Municipality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27560118" rel="nofollow">this recent edit by Robbot</a> - I do not speak Swedish, but I understand enough of it and of Wikipedia to realize that <a href="../../../../sv/f/%C3%A4/r/F%C3%A4rgelanda.html" class="extiw" title="sv:Färgelanda">sv:Färgelanda</a> is a disambiguation page, and that of the three meanings on the disambiguation page, <a href="../../../f/%C3%A4/r/F%C3%A4rgelanda_Municipality_8704.html" title="Färgelanda Municipality">Färgelanda Municipality</a> corresponds to <a href="../../../../sv/f/%C3%A4/r/F%C3%A4rgelanda_kommun.html" class="extiw" title="sv:Färgelanda_kommun">sv:Färgelanda kommun</a>. - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 10:45, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One thing I do, but which I guess is hard to get into rules, is that I check through the 'normal browser' before allowing Robbot to remove a page or before making a decision where there is more than one page found for a language. - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 13:20, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>How about we amend the policy to the following:</p>
<hr />
<p>If using the pywikipedia framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please run the latest version</li>
<li>Update on a daily basis</li>
</ul>
<p>Users who run such bots must prove themselves to be <b>responsible</b> and <b>harmless</b>, and work closely with the community of interwiki bot operators. Users who come from other language Wikipedias must demonstrate some proof of credibility, such as being an Administrator of a major language Wikipedia, Bureacrat, developer for the pywikipedia framework, or being vouched by a credibile user on the English Wikipedia.</p>
<hr />
<p>Would that be much better? Instead of focusing on whether a user can speak the language, how about focus on whether the user is responsible enough to keep on eye on their bot, and stop their bot if it goes awry. The issue that I want to try to avoid is that an operator of an interwiki bot refuses to stop his or her bot on the basis they believe it is working correctly, when there is evidence that is not. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 00:15, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would be acceptable to me, yes. The important thing in my opinion would be that people are careful when doing removals or non-trivial changes to interwiki links with their bots.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reporting unauthorised bots</span></h2>
<p>I'm wondering if it would be worth having a standardised means of flagging unauthorised bots. How about a template to stick on the user talk page of a suspected bot? It would serve a triple purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>to tell the user to confirm if he/she/it is a bot or not, and where to request approval before continuing (just in case the human behind it sees it) (not to forget the possibility of the same user account being used for both bot and human edits)</li>
<li>to inform others that it is a suspected bot</li>
<li>to produce a list of unauthorised bots that admins can examine, either by <i>What links here</i> or a category.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Unauthorized bots should be blocked, without exception, unless they have requested permission here, or at least indicated that it is a bot. For example, <a href="../../../k/a/k/User%7EKakashi_Bot_ec07.html" title="User:Kakashi Bot">Kakashi Bot</a> is not necessarily an authorized bot, but it is listed under "Bots running without a flag" on the project page. Kakashi Bot is subject to human scrutiny, and is intentionally left without a bot flag. I was blocked for running unauthorized bot as well. Typically, it is asked that editors do not run bot-assisted or bot edits under their own account. Exceptions are made to this for administrative oriented bots, like <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> who runs an autoblocker. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 21:47, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, but my points are:
<ul>
<li>Not all of us have the power to block.</li>
<li>Sometimes one may be unsure whether a user making bot-like edits really is a bot.</li>
<li>There's always the possibility of a random person, especially one who hasn't gone through the bot approval process, using a single account (or raw IP address) for bot and manual edits, either to try and disguise that he/she/it is running a bot or out of not knowing better, and that this needs to be taken into consideration when verifying bot accusations.</li>

<ol>
<li>References are usually primary resources, and an encyclopaedia is a secondary resource</li>
<li>References are places you are directed to to check the veracity of the text in the article: in this case, the article is <i>based</i> on the 1911, so you would go elsewhere to check the validity of the 1911 itself.</li>

<p>So far, I've been running it to correct "test" to "Test" (in the sense of <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test match</a>, an international cricket match). The bot is written in Perl and it works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>User (me) launches the program</li>
<li>It reads List of international cricketers, and downloads the first few that it hasn't read before</li>
<li>It finds ones with "test" in, changes "test" to "Test", and pops them up in a browser for me to read</li>
<li>When it's found 20 candidate articles, it stops</li>
<li>Then I go through the suggested changes and commit the correct ones</li>
</ol>
<p>So it doesn't make any edits itself. I run it occasionally, it downloads maybe fifty pages, I make twenty edits myself in the space of a minute or two, and then I wait a few minutes or a few hours before running it again. Have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Stephen_Turner&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Stephen_Turner&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">my last 500 contributions</a> for the typical impact.</p>
<p>My ideas for future tasks that this could do</p>
<ol>
<li>Link "Test" and "Test match" to <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test cricket</a>, not to <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_match.html" title="Test match">Test match</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test.html" title="Test">Test</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure all short biographies have {{cricketbio-stub}}</li>
<li>Add <i>country</i>-bio-stub to all cricketbio-stubs (ask on country page first, because this could generate a lot of new stubs in their lists).</li>
<li>Find articles entitled "N (cricketer)" but not linked from "N".</li>
<li>Find very short (sub-stub) articles, because an anonymous user has recently been making a lot of these.</li>
</ol>
<p>We currently have something over 1500 cricket biographies, and a few hundred other cricket articles, so a program like this is a natural solution to improve conformance to <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECRICKET_ce01.html" title="WP:CRICKET">WikiProject Cricket</a> agreed house style.</p>
<p>So my questions are</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this a bot that requires approval?</li>
<li>If so, may I have approval?</li>
<li>Even if not, should I run it as a separate user instead of as me, and should that user have the bot flag?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks very much. I hope that's enough information, but please ask if you need to know anything more.</p>

<dd>jguk: Agreed, although I think that would be a job for a bot that committed its own edits (there are too many of them, and no risk of false positives), and I'm not sure I want to get into that yet. My program is deliberately ignoring those at the moment. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> 13:54, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks very much, but I'm still unclear about one thing. Should I make the edits from a bot account or from my own account? Given that the bot is not making the edits itself but just suggesting edits to me.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inter-wiki image harvesting/diffusion?</span></h2>
<p>I had an idea this evening - what about a bot or similar program (perhaps running on a local copy of wikipedia). It would cross reference between articles in different languages, looking for images that are in one, but not another.</p>
<p>Images frequently break the language barrier, and who knows what hidden gems might be found using this methodology? I propose that the results of this program would be put in a Wikipedia namespace page, so that individuals could work on cross-dissemination of images in a decentralized fashion (in the spirit of wikipedia).</p>
<p>A much more aggressive approach (I'm not sure what I think about this) would be to have a bot take this output and tag the bottom of every page for which an image was available in another language.</p>
<p>What do people think? I wouldn't mind providing some of the programming talent for this, but this kind of wikiwide action would need some pretty hefty official support. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinWick_e7b0.html" title="User:JustinWick">JustinWick</a> 01:33, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you mean the images that reside on WikiCommons or just images that are missing in general? Please remember, there are fair use images on the English Wikipedia that can not be transferred to other projects. Also, we have Commons images, which are used across several projects. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 03:46, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Fair Use is a very gray area (at least in the united states) but... I am only talking about taking images from, say, the English version of wikipedia, say for an article on robotics (how apropos) and suggesting its inclusion in articles about robots in other languages of wikipedia (if they don't have it already). This way if any language gets a nice image for an article, there's a good chance that it can be reused in other languages. It seems unlikely to me that this transfer would be considered illegal (wikipedias of all languages have the same legal status, right?) but I admit I am no legal expert! - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinWick_e7b0.html" title="User:JustinWick">JustinWick</a> 16:26, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I had a similar thought to this as well, it would be best done off-line on the database dumps rather than by bot. I imagine it would look at the inter language links on an en article, then see if any of the linked to foreign articles (or a maybe just the fr and de articles) have more images than the english one, and generating a list of these articles, and the missing images. Generating a list off-line would not need any community support, and would make a nice community project. Hope that makes sense. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 16:46, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that that's the most computationally efficient way to do it, that's actually, in my mind, the easy part. To me the hard part is - people in other languages are trying to improve their articles, how do they know someone has compiled this great list? Moreso, how do they know the particular article they are looking at has some alternate images? - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinWick_e7b0.html" title="User:JustinWick">JustinWick</a> 17:05, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such suggested images are okay for suggestions, compiled as a report from an offline database dump and should rather be placed on meta or something, and so long as the suggested image has a free license. However, it be more beneficial for suggestion images to be moved to the Commons and placed on a gallery on the subject. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 16:54, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can see it being put in the Commons, however the big thing I'm worried about is, how do people editing articles know this resource is available for a particular article? Maybe if there was some way of getting a Wikipedia Project started for media cross-distribution, such that people in different languages would just take articles off the list and put whatever images are appropriate into each article for which they are available. (marking them off when they are done). - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinWick_e7b0.html" title="User:JustinWick">JustinWick</a> 17:05, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
