<dd><b>Trial run bloody well unapproved</b>. He set it to tag for deletion hundreds and hundreds of categories that, whilst empty, are key elements in series of categories (like buildings by year, for years we don't have a buliding for yet). I've just sat and reverted them, and <i>I don't have a bot</i>. Much greater thought needs to be applied before approving expansions like this. Please; would this page stop handing approvals out for pointless tasks that don't need doing, and that need doing with a modicum of human judgement? Having witless bots do things merely for the sake of not having them idle is irritating at best. And this particular bot has already had one run of other edits (substs) reverted for also being wrong, and pointless. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 01:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We do run short trials to see what may happen and require further review before just letting bots go. I'm not sure why we really need empty cats such as Category:5.56mm machine guns (one of the cats tagged). <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#1" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#1</a> does state that empty categories are speediable, and according to your statements above these may not even fall in to the <i>old categories that may have contained articles before, requiring further investigation</i>. If consensus is that we should have all of these empty categories, how did we end up with the speedy criteria? Regardless, due to this complaint, trials relating to editing the categories themselves are suspended, but ones that are preparing lists are not. Additionally, there has got to be a better way to keep track of the gathering then categorizing the categories. This bot has been blocked by Splash, pending a response. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:29, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well no, there were some that did seem a bit arbitrary, but I wasn't going to manually review each of 500ish categories when ~99% of them needed reverting. I do not think there is necessarily a "consensus" somewhere I can point to about the categories, but it does seem fairly obvious to me (and others at <a href="../../../k/b/d/User_talk%7EKbdank71_a40d.html#Bot-tagging_of_unused_categories" title="User talk:Kbdank71">User talk:Kbdank71#Bot-tagging of unused categories</a>) that obliterating large chunks of sequenced categories, just because they happen to be empty is wrong. Empty categories should be deleted when they risk confusion or duplication etc; that's what the CSD is for, not for indiscriminate application. Also, just because something meets a CSD does not mean it is <i>required</i> to be deleted, only that it <i>may</i> be.</dd>

<dd>Xaosflux, to answer your question, yes, I'm fine of course with someone unblocking the bot once its owner appreciates the difference in the manner it needs to be operated. Not merely asking here and getting an out-of-context nod before embarking on major-sized operations like this without checking <i>very thoroughly, in advance</i> that they make sense. WP:BOLD does not need to apply to bots. That said, I do not view the unblock as at all time-critical; the action of this bot fall well below the 'critical' threshold and in some cases well below the 'useful' threshold.</dd>

<dd>On a broader note, I'd like it if runs of 500 hundred edits were not the trial size. These have to be reverted by patient humans, and the whole point of a trial is to save time if things go belly up. I would think trials of no more than 50, with well announced trialling would be <i>very</i> much more appropriate. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 02:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What it is key to take away from this, Betacommand, is that you <i><b>must check with relevant projects and processes and people</b></i> before undertaking sweeping actions with a bot that are not precedented. Not before, to my knowledge have categories been mass eliminated under CSD C1, and so CfD should have been contacted before going ahead. This approvals page is evidently rather below-par for making sure of the utility and appropriateness of the editing the bot will undertake, really only making sure it is technically sound and possible. It is your responsibility to do the necessary homework. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 19:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that this bot is a good idea. If someone where create the category, you expect it to have at least one item.

<dd>Well obviously sequential years have navigational value if I'm a newbie trying to work out what categories I can use without realising I can make them (particularly if I'm an anon and prohibited from creating pages at all). -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 19:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>After receiving confirmation that this function is disabled for the time being (logs will still be written for debug purposes, but the bot will not make live edits related to this), I've unblocked the bot. However, if the bot is making any funny edits, feel free to reblock again. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 06:07, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I see no problem with this task. However, if certian categories are "required" or whatever, why not tag them with a template to that effect? Bots can detect the template and ignore it, and it will give humans the same cue. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazycomputers_f72a.html" title="User:Crazycomputers">Chris</a> <a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazycomputers_ef3d.html" title="User talk:Crazycomputers">(talk)</a> 02:13, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Chris on this, a template would be a good idea, that makes the bot easily future-compatible, which is important for maintenance of series categories. I think that the task is a good idea, as long as some sort of exceptions mechanism is implemented, and all the needed categories are tagged before the bot runs.--<b><span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalme_b457.html" title="User:Digitalme">digital_m</a><a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalme_EA_0684.html" title="User:Digitalme/EA"><span style="color:green;">e</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../d/i/g/User_talk%7EDigitalme_e893.html" title="User talk:Digitalme">Talk</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Digitalme_d720.html" title="Special:Contributions/Digitalme">Contribs</a>)</sup></span></b> 02:59, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

is how I marked the categories ‘‘‘NEVER’’’ did I list it for deletion or attempt to speedy it, all the bot did at this point was state '<i><b>This page meets Wikipedia's <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>'</b></i>.

<dd>The CSDs are things that <i>may</i> be speedily deleted if an admin agrees with you. They are not things that <i>must</i> be. It does strike me that perhaps you don't agree that you should check with relevant projects, people and processes before deploying your bot. That's a little disappointing. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 23:44, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was planning to work with CSD to implament this task once i was completely comfortable with the logging and taging of old categories by the bot. you blocked my bot before i could do this. if you will look above i was thinking about putting a link on WP:CSD as a solution but i was planning to discuss this with CSD before nominating anything for deletion. As per above (my previous post) i am still waiting for the answers to the questions about your actions and the what policy that you were using for a guideline for reverting the tags and blocking of my bot. where is there a discussion about keeping them. and the other qusetions that i have rasied <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> 04:22, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, I am <b>approving</b> this bot on a trial run under the following conditions</p>
<ol>
<li>This trial is no more than 50 edits</li>
<li>The bot will not tag w/ any tag that will add items to CAT:CSD, use a seperate sub-category like Tawkerbot on old user talk pages did.</li>
<li>If it's a subcategory something should show to that extent (unless someone has a diff to prove otherwise) - if there is nothing there (say the category page is blank) for goodness sakes tag it!</li>

<dd>Nice…and you can see straight off the bat that those "A-class…" categories are each part of a set and should be tagged for exemption somehow. No mistake, this <b>is</b> a useful tool for rootling out categories which have gone unused and unloved, it just needs some mechanism for detecting those which are lying in wait for articles to populate them <b>as part of an ongoing process</b>.<br />
One thing though: it would have been nice if the bot had spelt "<i>Catagories</i>" correctly <a href="../../../f/a/c/Image%7EFace-crying.svg_8273.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e9/Face-crying.svg/20px-Face-crying.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../f/a/c/Image%7EFace-crying.svg_8273.html" /></a> HTH HAND —<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 08:25, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is still no good. The trial has flagged a number of categories tagged as category redirects that have very obvious reason to exist for that purpose: to help prevent people categorising articles into them by seeing the red box that says "no, please put them in that category over there". It also tagged one category as meeting speedy criteria when it is currently on CfD. Betacommand, you seem to be unable to accept that <i><b>BEFORE</b></i> you do this, <i><b>YOU NEED TO CHECK WITH SOME PAGE OTHER THAN THIS ONE</b></i>. I can't make this any clearer than bold, italic capitals, and I've said as much several times earlier. The 'approvers' on this page do not apparently check that anybody actually cares whether or not your bot does stuff, and so you have to do that legwork yourself, before before before before before before before you jump in and do it. Now two of us have pointed out things wrong with this trial, I trust that it is unapproved - again. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 17:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

There's many categories that are empty, true, but that doesn't mean that they <b>must</b> be deleted. In fact, in most cases, they should not be, as they may be part of broader category schemes that aren't empty. There's no way to instill that kind of AI to a bot, so, as a result, I don't think a bot would be appropriate for this task. <b>Oppose</b>. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 07:58, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Responce:</b> the bot has no AI I am its brain, I am currently working to identify all categories that should be kept like the A-Class artices you pointed out the bot only tags categories that i find, and even after they are identified as being empty for more that 4 days doent mean that they will be marked for deletion Because of some issuse that have been brought up durring this disscusion i was planning to manually examim all of the categories that meet the criteria befor putting them up for deletion. Just because my bot tags an article doesnt mean that it <i>must</i> be deleted or may deleted so far the tags only state that the category has been empty for more that four days and meeets the criteria for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#1" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#1</a> it doesnt list them for deletion all it does is identify old empty categories.

</dl>
<p>And if that does not seem to work for this task I have an alternate solution have the bot add all unused categories to a parent category such as category:Abandoned category as of ..... That Would allow users to quickly identify old empty categories by date. this would not involve marking categories for deletion or placing a template on the page it would be something like the orphaned category page only this Would identify abandoned categories <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> 05:41, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see a need to.

<dd>I recommend using my plugin when you're tagging for projects which it specifically supports, and optionally for all such requests. I'm in the process of writing a page explaining <i>why</i> but trust me, it makes your life easier&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Also, please be aware that there is mounting dissatisfaction at the number of talk pages with multiple tags, so if you get requests which would result in lots of double tagging - because the projects share scope but don't work together - you might want to gently ask them to consider template sharing.</dd>
<dd>Those points aside, this is a mostly non-controversial task which you've been doing for a long time. The request you showed us looks fine too.

As per kingboyk's motion for a speedy close. This is the least controversial of Betacommand's tasks. I should also note that I approved of his usage of "Infoboxneeded" on those talk pages, as that was similar enough. Placing maintenance tags for the Wikiprojects on article talk pages is exactly what he is doing here, whether or not it is labeled "WikiProjectXXXX" or not. It should be pretty obvious whether a differently named tag is sufficiently different to require bot approval. I should note that I like when Betacommand takes requests from specific WikiProjects to do these things. Just be careful, as kingboyk points out, that these types of banners may at some point be frowned upon, so care must be taken to stop immediately if anyone complains and engage in a dialogue as appropriate. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 13:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Per <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> and <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_W_134c.html" title="WP:CFD/W">WP:CFD/W</a> decisions either remove a category or rename it. same thing cydebot does. in regard to TFD I have only done one or two such request but I might as well get approval for any future request if they come up. {{smiley}} was a widely used template with at least four variants of it, a total of over 50 parser functions that were used to display facial images. there was a TfD in which it was decided that {{smiley}} should be deleted. But if users just removed the {{smilely|what ever face number}} that would /could change the tone and meaning behind the post. I was asked to orphan and delete the templates when that was done per tfd. I coded several bot runs (basically one per template). Mets you pointed out one diff that was made in that run on the previous discussion of BCbot. Without checking for parser functions I just substed it. when it was pointed out that it used parser functions (part way through the first template) I then coded BCBot to examine the templates and play template namespace and figure out what the parser functions did and then replace the template with what ever the template would have render into any way. IE {{Smilely|happy}} would become Image:Happy face.jpg or what ever the corispnding image would have been. this was extremely esoteric template task that I doubt any other bot operator would have bothered to do.
