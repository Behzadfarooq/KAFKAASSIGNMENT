<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/Bottom_%28TV_series%29_dffb.html" title="Edit section: Origins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h2>
<p>The idea for <i>Bottom</i> was spawned when, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, Mayall and Edmondson co-starred in the West End production of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Beckett_de21.html" title="Samuel Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>'s <i><a href="../../../w/a/i/Waiting_for_Godot_fef6.html" title="Waiting for Godot">Waiting for Godot</a></i> at the Queen's Theatre. Mayall and Edmonson have said <i>Bottom</i> was often aimed to be more than just a series of toilet gags but a cruder cousin to plays like <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, about the pointlessness of life.</p>
<p>However, the origins of the characters are rooted much deeper. Mayall and Edmondson had been working together since the late 1970's when they teamed up as "<a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_Coyote_8aab.html" title="20th Century Coyote">20th Century Coyote</a>". Over the course of their career, they developed the characters of Richie and Eddie, based loosely on their own relationship. The names themselves come from Mayall's and Edmondson's own nicknames for each other - many of Mayall's characters are referred to by some variation of the name "Richard" and "Eddie" is taken from "Eddie Monsoon", Edmondson's nickname since University which is a play on his surname (compare with <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolutely_Fabulous_b11b.html#Cast" title="Absolutely Fabulous">Edina Monsoon</a> in <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolutely_Fabulous_b11b.html" title="Absolutely Fabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a>, played by Edmondson's wife <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Saunders_a7e1.html" title="Jennifer Saunders">Jennifer Saunders</a>).</p>
<p>The duo would use characters similar to Eddie and Richie in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dangerous_Brothers_73bd.html" title="The Dangerous Brothers">The Dangerous Brothers</a></i> (Sir Richard Dangerous and Sir Adrian Dangerous, 1985); <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Young_Ones_%28TV_series%29_7edb.html" title="The Young Ones (TV series)">The Young Ones</a></i> (Rick and Vyvyan, 1982 &amp; 1984); <i><a href="../../../f/i/l/Filthy_Rich_and_Catflap_4b90.html" title="Filthy Rich and Catflap">Filthy Rich and Catflap</a></i> (Richie Rich and Eddie Catflap, 1987); <i><a href="../../../m/r/_/Mr_Jolly_Lives_Next_Door_57eb.html" title="Mr Jolly Lives Next Door">Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door</a></i> (names not mentioned, 1988); and finally in their adaptation of <i>Waiting for Godot</i> (1991).</p>
<p>Mayall and Edmonson originally planned to call the series <i>Your Bottom</i>, intending viewers to say such things as "I saw Your Bottom on television last night". Eventually they settled for just <i>Bottom</i>, which both suited the toilet humour of the series, and the fact that Richie and Eddie were 'at the bottom of life's heap'. It also provided the ability to produce episodes titled "<a href="../../../27/s/_/%27s_Up_7505.html" title="'s Up">'s Up</a>" and "'s Out".</p>
<p><a name="Richie_.26_Eddie" id="Richie_.26_Eddie"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/Bottom_%28TV_series%29_dffb.html" title="Edit section: Richie &amp; Eddie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Richie &amp; Eddie</span></h2>
<p>Richie is a perpetually optimistic dimwit, while Eddie is a cheerfully <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violent.html" title="Violent">violent</a> <a href="../../../d/i/p/Dipsomaniac.html" title="Dipsomaniac">dipsomaniac</a>. Their arguments often lead to exaggerated, destructive fight scenes. Some have likened this to a live action <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon.html" title="Cartoon">cartoon</a>. However, the boisterousness is somewhat more graphic: examples include heads slammed in and under refrigerators; hands stapled to tables; legs being chainsawed off; genitalia slammed in doors or set on fire; fingers cut off; televisions smashed over heads; darts, forks, or fingers winding up in eyes; faces shoved in camp fires; legs broken or teeth knocked out. Some of the visual effects used for these events are very realistic, whereas others are deliberately fake. All are accompanied by a variety of over-the-top sound effects. In spite of this, the <a href="../../../b/b/f/BBFC_4bc7.html" title="BBFC">BBFC</a> has given the <i>Bottom: The Complete Series</i> <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> a classification of <b>15</b>, with a violence rating of "None".</p>
<p>Richie is known to be a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin.html" title="Virgin">virgin</a> (Eddie stole Richie's only ever "girlfriend", Ethel Cardue, and sometimes torments Richie with how he had sex with her), with a microscopic <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> (which he sometimes mistakes for his only <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pubic_hair.html" title="Pubic hair">pube</a>). However in the episode 'Digger' he almost has sex with a wealthy foreign countess, Lady Natasha Latisha Sarah Jane Wellsly Smythe Smythe Smythe Smythe Oblomov Boblomov Dob, after he and Eddie join a dating agency. After lying about being the Duke of Kidderminster he is set up with Lady Natasha, and to pay for the expensive food and suits for their first meeting he sells one of his kidneys. It becomes apparent that Lady Natasha is only after Richie for his 'wealth'. Towards the end of the episode, as Richie moves in to have sex with Lady Natasha he has an apparent heart attack, and is rushed to hospital. Whilst waiting for the ambulance Eddie has sex with Lady Natasha, as he did Ethel. In the ambulance in the final sequences of the episode Richie is distraught and states, 'if my ticker hadn't given out, I reckon she could've had my cherry.' This is when Eddie informs him that it wasn't his heart at all, but his remaining kidney, because the cheap surgeon Eddie lined up to remove Richie's kidney botched the operation and 're-wired' the 'system' wrong and the whole system 'backfired'. At this point Richie proceeds to electrocute Eddie with the defibulators. He also tends to believe that any <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">woman</a> who doesn't fancy him must be a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a>. He is also unsure of the decade, claiming in the same episode (Carnival), that it is both the 80's and then 70's later on- with a bemused Eddie looking to the camera at both times. Richie usually wears a white shirt (tucked into his <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undergarment.html" title="Undergarment">Y-fronts</a>) and slim black tie (with tie clip), blue jeans (with a belt that clearly misses most of the loops) and has a light brown raincoat. He also occasionally wears brown trousers, held up with braces, and a red tie. His character is aspirational, pretentious, and occasionally a snob.</p>
<p>Eddie is an alcoholic (he claims that this is because he "drinks a lot"). He wears <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasses.html" title="Glasses">glasses</a> akin to those of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Morecambe_1ad8.html" title="Eric Morecambe">Eric Morecambe</a>, a brown suit and a white shirt with a black spotted tie. Despite having a shaven head, he sports <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideburns.html" title="Sideburns">sideburns</a>. He also has a brown <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trilby.html" title="Trilby">trilby</a> hat and a tweed overcoat. He has two real friends, called Spudgun (Steve O'Donnell) and Dave Hedgehog (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Ryan_4912.html" title="Christopher Ryan">Christopher Ryan</a>). Richie does not have any friends and sometimes appropriates Spudgun and Dave if in need of company.</p>

<p>Richie and Eddie bare perhaps closer inspection than any of Mayall and Edmondson's other characters. Despite sharing a deep mutual hatred, the two are eternally entwined due to their basic flaws. Eddie's alcoholism and violent nature mean that he has not been able to hold down a steady <a href="../../../e/m/p/Employment.html" title="Employment">job</a> since his very short-lived career as a "<a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunny_girl.html" title="Bunny girl">bunny girl</a>", back in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, and it is unlikely that any <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landlord.html" title="Landlord">landlord</a> would grant him tenancy, even if he could afford the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_rent.html" title="Economic rent">rent</a>. He is therefore forced to rely upon Richie's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charity_%28virtue%29.html" title="Charity (virtue)">charity</a>. Richie, on the other hand, is such a self-obsessed, perverted, wittering git that without Eddie, it is unlikely that he would make another friend. The two have an unspoken acceptance of their co-dependency and their relationship tends to fluctuate between acting like a married couple (filling in the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossword.html" title="Crossword">crossword</a> together, Richie putting an unconscious Eddie to bed every night) and frustrated (often violent) desperation: so much so that both have attempted <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> — Eddie drinking <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach.html" title="Bleach">bleach</a> (albeit drunkenly) and Richie drinking poison milk and trying to <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_gas.html" title="Natural gas">gas</a> himself in the oven (an attempt at "guilting" Eddie into buying him a drink). In fact, both men have died in numerous episodes, only to resurface unharmed the following episode. This partnership has similarities to those of <i><a href="../../../s/t/e/Steptoe_and_Son_cbf4.html" title="Steptoe and Son">Steptoe and Son</a></i>, and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Hancock_af19.html" title="Tony Hancock">Hancock</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sid_James_0b2b.html" title="Sid James">Sid</a> in <i><a href="../../../h/a/n/Hancock%27s_Half_Hour_609c.html" title="Hancock's Half Hour">Hancock's Half Hour</a></i>.</p>
<p>Richie is in heavy <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial.html" title="Denial">denial</a> and has <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delusion.html" title="Delusion">delusions</a> of grandeur. He once tried to convince a <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands</a> ex-serviceman that he had fought ten years there, seizing the fictitious "Straud Hill" and liberated the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley%2C_Falkland_Islands_435f.html" title="Stanley, Falkland Islands">Stanley</a> branch of <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a>). Eddie, in comparison is grounded and seems to have quite good general knowledge, which he keeps to himself. He can play chess (and spends six hours trying, unsuccessfully, to teach Richie), he knows a fair amount about <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Bonaparte_f92d.html" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_10be.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Wellington</a> (who Richie claims invented the Chelsea Boot) and appears well versed in the works of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Vivaldi_0c3c.html" title="Antonio Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a>, (whom Richie believes to be a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> player). Eddie is also a great one for plans - though most involve trying to get a free pint from Dick Head, the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landlord.html" title="Landlord">landlord</a> at the Lamb and Flag. One such scheme, in the episode "Dough", involved Eddie printing <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterfeit.html" title="Counterfeit">counterfeit</a> money, which he plasters with <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornographic</a> doodles of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Family_5f5c.html" title="Royal Family">Royal Family</a> and other such celebrities (on the <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">£</a>5 the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen</a> "gets her jugs out", on the £10 note there is an <a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgy.html" title="Orgy">orgy</a> involving Meryl Streep, the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Edinburgh_458a.html" title="Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Charlton_472c.html" title="Bobby Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a>, and on the £27 note there is a picture of <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvester_Stallone_7277.html" title="Sylvester Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> "<a href="../../../f/i/s/Fisting.html" title="Fisting">fisting</a>" Mr MacHenry (from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magic_Roundabout_1fab.html" title="The Magic Roundabout">The Magic Roundabout</a></i>)).</p>
<p>Richie and Eddie's relatives are often mentioned: Richie's grandad was at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Somme_c1c5.html" title="Battle of the Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>, while Eddie's uncle used to work in a prison, sewing mailbags and doing anything they told him to do. Richie's auntie is very rich and dies in one episode with her nephew inheriting a large sum of money. Richie's dad, Oswald Richard, was an acquaintance of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and betrayed <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. According to Richie, his dad moved in mysterious circles, because he had one leg shorter than the other. Richie's sister lives near Hammersmith and apparently looks just like her brother, albeit "with smaller jugs". Eddie's mother was a wrestler named "Adolf Hitler".</p>

<p>Five live theatre shows have been spun off over the years, and have been extremely popular. The two performers often (apparently) forget their lines and have to ad lib. They also often make fun of the town/city in which they are playing by making the locals out to be stupid. These productions are far cruder than the television incarnation, and feature new elements such as Richie's latent <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and desire to have sex with Eddie. Invariably, a member of the audience will shout out the phrase "Have a <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wank.html" title="Wank">wank</a>!" which was then used as a mass audience heckle in the Weapons Grade Y-Fronts show.</p>

<p>Though the pair are currently working apart, a fourth series was written, but the BBC declined the script, despite announcing that <i>Bottom</i> would return in a voice-over during the end credits of the original broadcast of the final episode. Edmondson has, however, stated in interviews that he would like to make another series of <i>Bottom</i> with Mayall, but "in about 15 years' time, when they are old men." Rik Mayall maintains that they will work together again in the future, they just need "a good idea."</p>
<p>However, in December 2004, almost exactly one year after the <i>Weapons Grade Y-Fronts</i> tour had ended, Adrian Edmondson told the British <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mirror_c617.html" title="Daily Mirror">Daily Mirror</a> newspaper that the pair felt it was "[...] definitely time to stop. We're both getting too old. We both realised that the show wasn't as engaging as it used to be. We were starting to look a bit ridiculous. [...] We're both nearly 50 and we're starting to feel slightly undignified talking about wanking and knobs constantly." <a href="http://www.fountain76.freeserve.co.uk/rikade/html/news.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fountain76.freeserve.co.uk/rikade/html/news.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This statement effectively ended Edmondson's and Mayall's working partnership that had lasted for almost 25 years.</p>

<p>Following the "Hooligan's Island" tour, Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson wrote a spin-off movie together, which Edmondson directed, entitled <i><a href="../../../g/u/e/Guest_House_Paradiso_c2bd.html" title="Guest House Paradiso">Guest House Paradiso</a></i>, released in 1999. It uses characters based on the Richie and Eddie characters used by the pair for much of their careers, the differing situation (in which Richie and Eddie run a filthy hotel next to a nuclear power plant) suggests that these characters have fled to the south coast complete with different surnames ("Richard Twat/Thwaite" and "Eddie Elizabeth Ndingobamba") after returning from Hooligan's Island and discovering that they are still hunted for regicide, after killing the queen in The Big Number 2 Tour.</p>
