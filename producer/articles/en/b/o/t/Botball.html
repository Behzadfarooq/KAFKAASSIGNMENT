<p>The Botball competition introduces students to the field of robotics where they apply science, technology, engineering, and math. Botball robots are required to be completely autonomous during the game using computer programming to start, stop, and maneuver on the game board. Students learn to utilize sensors to detect changes in light, sound, distance, and color. The robot’s actions are based on the feedback from the sensors combined with the computer programming conceived and tested by the students in advance. Botball robots are constructed with <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lego.html" title="Lego">Legos</a> with strict limitations on other materials. The challenge which these robots are to complete changes yearly, however, some factors remain the same from year-to-year. These factors include the continued use of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_C_6f53.html" title="Interactive C">Interactive C</a> as the programming language, <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lego.html" title="Lego">Legos</a> as the base for building, and <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Boy_a165.html" title="Game Boy">Game Boys</a> with the <a href="../../../x/b/c/XBC_276a.html" title="XBC">XBC</a> as the controller. The schedule of Botball also remains roughly the same each year being divided into three parts, the pre-conference season, the regional building and programming season and tournament, as well as the additional national building and programming season and tournament.</p>
<p>The official Botball season begins with a two day professional development workshop generally held near the beginning of the new year. However, before this conference is the pre-conference season when teams are formed, basic ideas are taught to new team members, as well as completing a website research and design challenge.</p>
<p>The conference is where educators and team leaders learn about current robotics technology and how to implement it into their classroom or community. Through the course of the workshop, participants receive all the information about the current Botball game and the reusable robotics kit and components, and construct a working demo-bot. The game layout and rules are announced day two and teams have about seven weeks until the region's competition date.</p>

<p>Following the workshop, students are given about seven weeks to design, build, program a team of mobile, autonomous robots and a website documenting their process. Participants compete against each other on a 4’ x 8’ playing field in a fast paced, non-destructive regional tournament. The robots are student built and programmed to maneuver on the game board without the need for remote control.</p>
<p>Botball events are currently held in 14 regions across the nation and in 3 Middle Eastern countries:</p>

<p>Later, usually at the beginning of July, there is a national competition, where teams from any region can compete, no matter their score in Regionals. The National Conference on Educational Robotics (NCER) has various "breakout" sessions, and other activities.

<p>Like many of life’s challenges, the Botball Program presents an open-ended problem with a variety of solutions. The many different scoring methods offer teams challenges at different levels - requiring them to make decisions about strategy, design, and construction. This gives teams experience in evaluating options and working towards a solution.</p>
<p>A lot of teams find that keeping with the KISS philosophy of Keep It Simple Stupid is often the best solution for a complex problem.</p>

<p>There is no driver! Botball robots are completely autonomous and rely on their computer programming to start, stop, and maneuver on the game board. Each robot uses sensors to detect changes in light, sound, distance, and color. The robot’s actions are based on the feedback from the sensors combined with the computer programming written and implemented by the students in advance.</p>

<p>In order for students to apply the subjects they learn in school, they must be able to use those subjects in a way that is meaningful. By designing, building, programming, and documenting robots, students use science, engineering, technology, math, and writing skills in a hands-on project that reinforces their learning.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/t/Botball.html" title="Edit section: 2005 Competition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2005 Competition</span></h2>
<p>In 2005, the Botball challenge was to design bots that would collect and sort garbage, and retrieve an orange ball, and the Botguy toy from its perch in the center of the playing field. Each orange ball (there was one on each side of the board) was worth 10 points for getting it on the player's side, and an additional 20 points for placing it in the correct location. Botguy was worth 50 points when placed correctly. Among the trash items, the bottles were worth 10 points each if placed in the "recycling bin" container, and the trash was worth 5 points if placed in the trash container.</p>
<p>The competition also included a research and design website challenge that was judged several months before the competition. In 2005, the research challenge was won by <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punahou_School_b7dd.html" title="Punahou School">Punahou School</a>. The overall competition was divided into seeding rounds, documentation website competition, and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-elimination.html" title="Double-elimination">double-elimination</a> head-to-head rounds. Norman High School of Norman, <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma.html" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> took first place at the national competition at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Florida_9bc8.html" title="University of North Florida">University of North Florida</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, the first ever Botball to be held outside of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> took place in <a href="../../../d/o/h/Doha.html" title="Doha">Doha</a>, <a href="../../../q/a/t/Qatar.html" title="Qatar">Qatar</a>. Five schools competed and the event was won by <b>Qatar Academy</b> led by Md Rezwan Al Islam, who is currently a Computer Science student in Carnegie Mellon University Qatar. The tournament was hosted by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnegie_Mellon_56c8.html" title="Carnegie Mellon">Carnegie Mellon</a> University, held at the Qatar Foundation, and was overseen by several representatives of the <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robotics.html" title="Robotics">robotics</a> division.

<p>Beginning with the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> season, Botball will use two <a href="../../../x/b/c/XBC_276a.html" title="XBC">Xport Botball Controllers</a> instead of <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handyboard.html" title="Handyboard">Handyboard</a> or <a href="../../../r/c/x/RCX_5a6e.html" title="RCX">RCX</a> processors. The sides of the board are split into three sections - red, green, and gold. These are for sorting <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribbles.html" title="Tribbles">tribbles</a>, represented by small fuzzy balls. The tribbles are spread throughout the board, with nine on each side. Six are located on the outside edge, and three are inside a PVC tube. There is a pendulum in the center with two platforms. One holds a green, yellow, and orange poof ball on each end, and the other contains Botguy and six tribbles. Each tribble is worth one point in your black scoring area or in the incorrect colored sections in the back. They are worth two points in the correct colored sections. Each poof ball is worth 6 points in their correct sections (orange is considered red), and 3 points in the incorrect zones and the black zone. Botguy is worth 4 points in the red zone, three points in the black zone, and 2 anywhere else on your side. Southwest Covenant High School won the 2006 national double elimination tournament in the final round against Norman High School, though Norman won overall. The final round was exciting for most of the crowd, as it ended with the Southwest Covenant robot inches from the ground (See video here: <a href="http://www.kipr.org/videos/2006/BB06%20National%20Final%20Round.mov" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kipr.org/videos/2006/BB06%20National%20Final%20Round.mov" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Or read about it here:<a href="http://www.botball.org/botnews/blog/ncer/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.botball.org/botnews/blog/ncer/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>)</p>

<p>Beyond Botball is a game distributed by KISS Institute for Practical Robotics to encourage ongoing robotics education beyond the high school level.</p>
<p><b>Botball for Grown up Kids!</b></p>
<p>College and university educators are encouraged to use the Beyond Botball game spec as a project in their science and engineering courses. Mentors, parents and teachers of Botball teams are encouraged to focus their own creative energies into a solution for Beyond Botball (let the kids build their own robots!). Some examples of how Beyond Botball has been used in college courses can be found in this AAAI Spring Symposium <a href="http://www.botball.org/_files/2007/NCER/beyond.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.botball.org/_files/2007/NCER/beyond.pdf" rel="nofollow">paper</a>.</p>
<p>We hope that those of you who create a team of robots to play Beyond Botball will bring them to the National Conference on Educational Robotics (NCER) and participate in the International Beyond Botball Tournament. Registration for Beyond Botball at NCER will be available soon. You can read more about the National Conference on Educational Robotics <a href="http://www.botball.org/current-season/national_conference.php" class="external text" title="http://www.botball.org/current-season/national_conference.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond Botball is a high-energy game designed for any robot enthusiast who has finished high school or its equivalent. College students, hobbyists, engineers, teachers, etc are all invited to compete. The game is played on a 4’ x 8’ board. Your robot competes by using robot design and strategy to move objects into scoring position in a challenging robot face-off. Following robot guidelines, Beyond Botball participants build robots using any building materials, processors, and sensors they feel serve the objective of the game. The game rules and guidelines can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.botball.org" class="external text" title="http://www.botball.org" rel="nofollow">Botball.org</a> and the competition will take place at the 2007 National Conference on Educational Robotics in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>

<p><b>This Year’s Game</b></p>
<p>The game is played on a 4 foot x 8 foot board. Your robot competes by using robot design and strategy to move objects into scoring position in a challenging robot face-off. Following robot guidelines, Beyond Botball participants build robots using any building materials, processors, and sensors they feel serve the objective of the game. The competition will take place at the 2007 National Conference on Educational Robotics in Honolulu, HI on July 10-13.</p>
<p>The National Conference on Educational Robotics gives students, teachers, and robotics professionals the chance to show their work on the playing field as well as share their ideas and give presentations in various breakout sessions. All papers presented will be published in the 2007 NCER Conference Proceedings. Cost for participation in the Beyond Botball competition at NCER includes an individual registration fee for the National Conference on Educational Robotics plus a $25 team entry fee.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Participation Eligibility</b></p>
<p>Beyond Botball teams must consist of AT LEAST one team member who has finished high school or its equivalent by January 2007. Team members who are middle or high school aged are required to be on a regular Botball team in order to participate on a Beyond Botball team.</p>

<p>In 1994 David Miller, Marc Slack, and Cathryne Stein established KISS Institute for Practical Robotics in Fairfax, Virginia. KISS Institute relocated its headquarters to Norman, Oklahoma in 1999.</p>
<p>The Botball Educational Robotics Program began in Florida in 1997. Since that time the Botball Program has impacted approximately 79,517 individuals including 34,220 students. About 2,569 teachers have participated in Botball and attended the hands-on Professional Development Educator Workshops.</p>
<p>1,710 Botball kits have been distributed to students and teachers in schools and communities across the nation.</p>
<p>100% of teachers surveyed indicated that Botball was a valuable experience for their students.</p>
<p>90% of Botball teachers rated the technical content and presentation of the Professional Development Educator Workshops as good to excellent.</p>
<p>93% of students surveyed stated that Botball was one of the best or better things they’ve ever participated in at school.</p>
<p>89% of students feel more confi dent with technology after participating in Botball.</p>
<p>Just over one third of Botball students were undecided about their college careers, and after participating in Botball 100% of these students now plan to pursue a degree in a technical or math-related field.</p>
<p>Each Botball season concludes with the National Conference on Educational Robotics held in the summer. Some of the highlights of the National Conference include: the International Botball Tournament, Beyond Botball (for the post high school crowd), Autonomous Robotics Showcase, breakout sessions, and guest speakers from nationally recognized organizations such as NASA and the Naval Research Laboratory.</p>
<p>About 2,000 students, teachers, parents, mentors, and sponsors have attended our National Conference on Educational Robotics over the past five years.</p>
<p>The ‘KISS’ in KISS Institute stands for the old engineering acronym: ‘Keep It Simple Stupid’.</p>
