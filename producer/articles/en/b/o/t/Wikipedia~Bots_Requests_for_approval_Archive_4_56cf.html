<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluxbot_9a79.html" title="User:Fluxbot">Fluxbot</a> request for approval</span></h2>
<p>I'm requesting approval to run <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluxbot_9a79.html" title="User:Fluxbot">Fluxbot</a> with <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> semi-automatic mode.</p>
<p>Please consider the uses below seperatley.</p>
<a name="Primary_Use" id="Primary_Use"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Primary Use</span></h3>
<p>It's primary purpose would be updating article categories that qualify under <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFDS_402f.html" title="WP:CFDS">CFDS</a>. I currently run these either by hand, or with <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> under my admin account. Working CFDS requires an admin, as the final step is a deletion. The deletion would of course always be run manually by my admin account.</p>
<p>AWB's throtle feature would be utilized to prevent excessive server utilization.</p>
<p>These categories can be quite large at times, so in addition to running with AWB's automode, a bot flag may be useful to reduce overhead on recent change patrollers. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:57, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<a name="Secondary_Use" id="Secondary_Use"></a>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Secondary Use</span></h3>
<p>A seconday proposed use would be replacing user space templates that have been migrated according to <a href="../../../t/g/s/WP%7ETGS_438a.html" title="WP:TGS">The German Solution</a>. A bandaid solution on these is temporarily leaving Tempalte: --&gt; User: redirects in place, pending cleanups. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 05:03, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sounds good, I'd recommend some form of sanity-checking on the cfd tasks. People make mistakes. If the bot reads some incorrectly formatted (or just plain wrong) category information, some fool will be like "zomg broken bot" and block it indefinitely. — <small>Jun. 13, '06</small> <tt><b>[03:19] &lt;<u class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freak</a>|<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a></u>&gt;</b></tt></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimpbot_48b3.html" title="User:Alphachimpbot">User:Alphachimpbot</a> requesting approval</span></h2>
<p>This bot would run in <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB's</a> automatic mode on my second computer using my <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimpbot_48b3.html" title="User:Alphachimpbot">User:Alphachimpbot</a> account. It would automate the tedious task of assigning a particular month tag to articles listed in [[Category:Wikipedia cleanup]]. Wikipedia cleanup states that the pages are automatically assigned a month after 24 hours. In my experience, however, this is not the case. The bot users listed on the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_Taskforce_Members_Members_by_interest_f3d8.html#Bot_programmers" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup Taskforce/Members/Members by interest">Wikipedia:Cleanup_Taskforce/Members/Members_by_interest#Bot_programmers</a> are all currently inactive.</p>
<p>I've been doing this task for several days on my primary (<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp">User:Alphachimp</a>} account. To say the least, it is incredibly tedious and easily automated. Admittedly, the changes I've made using my primary account have been somewhat larger than those I am proposing. I have removed multiple wiki links, removed stub cats for large articles, categorized, and unicoded the articles. I am <i>not</i> proposing these changes. This bot would <i>only</i> replace the {{cleanup}} tag with the {{Cleanup-date|MONTH YEAR}}.</p>
<p>As to the scope of the changes, there are currently 1210 pages listed on [[Category:Wikipedia cleanup]]. The bot would specify the specific current month as the situation merited (probably once daily). I would be open to suggestions for best run times to minimize server stress and response times. The bot would run at 30-60 second intervals, as specified on <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a>. It would always be attended, and I would be willing to submit to a trial run (although I have already been making these changes manually).</p>
<p>I appreciate your consideration. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 22:35, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would be running as the bot. I am run by Alphachimp. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimpbot_48b3.html" title="User:Alphachimpbot">Alphachimpbot</a> 22:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, <b>go ahead and trial it</b> for a week, it looks ok to me -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 23:51, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The 1 week period is over. All told, Alphachimpbot updated over 1300 articles, reducing the size of the general cleanup category by over 80%. I modified the find replace to include common misspellings and mistakes involving the cleanup templates, which further helped remove articles. In one week's operation, I received one complaint, namely, that the bot did not mark edits as minor. It has since been corrected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you review the bot's contributions, please note that the last section of contributions were made manually before permission was granted to trial the bot. They were the result of logging into Alphachimpbot in IE while AWB was active.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moving forward, I would like permission to add the following features/scope:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Append date specific wikify tag (a large portion of articles are tagged for both cleanup and wikify)...this would cut down on edit numbers.</li>
<li>Replace subst'ed cleanup templates from general cleanup and cleanup-by-month categories per <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html#Templates_that_should_NOT_be_substituted" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">Wikipedia:Template_substitution#Templates_that_should_NOT_be_substituted</a></li>
<li>Unicode articles flagged for non-month specific cleanup. These articles are <i>already</i> being edited by the bot. (I'm sure that this has been proposed before...just figured I would ask).</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>So yeah. If I were you, I would approve <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimpbot_48b3.html" title="User:Alphachimpbot">Alphachimpbot</a> for continued use. Let me know if you have any questions or issues needing clarification.

<p>OK, so first round is done. 439 new stubs were created, 24 had pre-existing articles and weren't touched by the bot.</p>
<p>I'd like to do Senate (100 people + replacement MPs / term) and earlier terms.</p>
<p>I think it would make sense to import every MP since 1989. Earlier (Communist) parliament wasn't that important, and I think significant number of MPs from that time weren't really notable enough for encyclopedia. And there isn't that much data about those times on parliament's website in any case.</p>
<p>So we have five terms to do: 1989-1991, 1991-1993, 1993-1997, 1997-2001, and 2001-2005. The first two have no photos (but many MPs were also in the parliament later, so we may still have their phonos), but these were pretty hot times, so it would be silly not to have them described. As 43% of current MPs were in parliament before I guess that would be some 1700 new stubs.</p>
<p>The data for each term is different, so I'll make a few samples before running.</p>

If there's no change, it doesn't edit.

<dd>It's similar to DumbBOT above, in the sense that it processes a category, but the process is even simpler. Due to the simplicity of the bot and the way it is written, any possible damage would be limited to the target page, no injection is possible, and it could be stopped by removing the delimited region from the target page. Moving cases from new to open to closed is still manual, and always would be. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricj_5aca.html" title="User:Ericj">EricJ</a> 00:47, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The bot's duties include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery of the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Esperanza</a> Newsletter (roughly monthly).</li>

<p>As of now, the newsletter has been delivered succesfully 4 times, with much success (only a few errors which have since been corrected). The spamming is getting heavy though (400+ members) and hard on the RC (many complaints about poisoned watchlists also), which leads me to request a bot flag. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisza13_4392.html" title="User:Misza13">Misza</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><span style="color:green"><b>13</b></span></a> <sup><u><b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMisza13_b5fd.html" title="User talk:Misza13">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Misza13_ad6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Misza13">C</a></b></u></sup> 12:17, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The newsletter delivery is fine, per the same type of authorization as the Signpost's bot, as is the archiving, per the same authorization as Werdna's archive bot. If you're going to actively use it to do mass bypassing of redirects in the future, you should bring the proposal here first for a quick scan, but that's unimportant at the moment if it is not actively doing this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the Defcon updates, it strikes me this might be best done with a second bot account. The newsletter delivery and such could well be done while flagged to avoid flooding RC, but the Defcon reporting, if permitted, should not be being done at a speed necessary for a bot flag, and really isn't the kind of thing you want hidden from RC. The idea itself is something that I've not seen proposed before, and I'm leaving it open to community input. The other two functions, though, are fine. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 12:47, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstableBot_337a.html" title="User:KonstableBot">User:KonstableBot</a></span></h2>
<p>I request to run an <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> based bot under the account <a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstableBot_337a.html" title="User:KonstableBot">User:KonstableBot</a>. I intend to initially use it to do automatic <a href="../../../u/n/i/Wikipedia%7EUnicode_032b.html" title="Wikipedia:Unicode">Unicodification</a> of articles relating to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. There are a lot of place names and terms used throughout the articles which are in <a href="../../../t/e/_/Te_Reo_M%C4%81ori_f4e7.html" title="Te Reo Māori">Te Reo Māori</a> and it can be needlessly difficult to read and edit some articles due to use of HTML special characters rather than unicode. Later on I may expand to unicodify other areas of Wikipedia if there is a need. The bot would make edits automatically using AWB's existing features (unicodification only, everything else turned off). --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konstable</a> 15:20, 8 July 2006 (UTC) <u>After some thinking I realised that the Unicodification task of NZ articles would only take a couple of days at the most. So I would like to extend my request to allow me to help out with subst:'ing templates, more specifically for user and user talk namespaces. I would choose targets using "What links here" for each template found under: <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html#User_namespace" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">Wikipedia:Template substitution#User_namespace</a>.</u>--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konstable</a> 00:19, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Is unicoding actually that important? I understand that it is hard to edit non-unicode characters. I think that there are some issues with unicoded characters rendering properly in IE. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 17:06, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A good example can be seen on a some edits I made using AWB earlier: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ng%C4%81i_Tahu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62705222" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ng%C4%81i_Tahu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62705222" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waitaha&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62705287" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waitaha&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62705287" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I would select articles using <a href="../../../n/e/w/Category%7ENew_Zealand_77f7.html" title="Category:New Zealand">Category:New Zealand</a> and its sub-categories. Unicodifyied articles is handled by the MediaWiki software so that browsers that don't fully support the unicode characters get the HTML codes for the characters instead, so it has no dangers. In fact there used to be a bot (now inactive) doing this - <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurpsbot-unicodify_bd8d.html" title="User:Curpsbot-unicodify">User:Curpsbot-unicodify</a>--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konstable</a> 00:19, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good examples. It looks good to me. The one problem I see is something I mentioned to Winhunter. Have you also selected the "Apply General Fixes" option? The diffs I was looking at seemed to have some whitespace and category order moving going on (contradictory to your comment above?). Apply general fixes is generally OK in articles where unicoding is already happening, but I'm very apprehensive about moving around whitespace when it's the only edit. Am I looking at the diffs correctly?<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 02:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The diffs I used as an example were made by me manually (and from my usual account). I won't have the general fixes option turned on while running the bot automatically - apart from the whitespace problem I also generally don't want AWB to just swap around the stub and the Category tags. With <i>Auto-tag</i> I'm not sure if it can create some problems, so I will leave that turned off also. So the only option turned on will be <i>Unicodify whole article</i>.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konstable</a> 02:25, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Looks great. I think just unicode is the best options config. There are already two of us asking to subst talk page templates, but I'm sure that there's room for one more =). <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 02:30, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see no reason not to give it a try. Don't start the subst: function until after your trial, but you're welcome to do a trial on the unicodification. Try to throttle edits to 2-3 a minute until a flag is approved, and check back with us after a decent test set has been done. (Usually we'd say a week, but you may well be done within a week, so check back after having done enough for us to have a good idea that everything is okay.) <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 05:50, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>While there were no problems created by this, I am not satisfied that this is useful enough for the New Zealand category. The problem is that the amount of articles with proper <a href="../../../t/e/_/Te_Reo_M%C4%81ori_f4e7.html" title="Te Reo Māori">Māori</a> spelling is pretty low (me and another user are already in the process of fixing the spelling, but this cannot be done with a bot). The result seems to be that the bot ends up doing mostly minor things like replacing superscript, dash and space special characters with unicode. So instead I will continue unicodification on Arab-related articles instead - I had a quick run through it and it definitely needs much more work than the New Zealand categories.--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konstable</a> 03:02, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">User:TuspmBot</span></h2>
<p>Hello. This is my first time trying to request permission to run a bot so I apologize if some things aren't so neat. Anyway, I am requesting permission to run TuspmBot (as you can see, I've already set up a userpage for it). I plan on this bot being a spell-checking bot and manually operated. You can expect the bot to run everyday. The language the bot will use will be English. The purpose of my bot is to correct spelling errors on Wikipedia and make it a more better website. I've been part of the Wikipedia community since February 2006 and I already have over 2,000 edits (most of which are reverting vandalism). I would like to have this bot to assist me in fixing common spelling mistakes. Thank you. --<a href="../../../t/u/s/User%7ETuspm_0ac8.html" title="User:Tuspm"><font color="blue"><b>Tuspm</b></font></a> <sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../t/u/s/User_talk%7ETuspm_cc2e.html" title="User talk:Tuspm">Talk</a></font> | <font color="blue"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tuspm_9581.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tuspm">Contribs</a></font> | <font color="blue"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Tuspm_ae0f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Tuspm">E-Mail Me</a></font></sup> 17:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>One suggestion: Wdefconbot should display (in IRC channel) which wiki user last edited the template, so that vandalism on the template itself can be easily detected. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">WinHunter</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWinhunter_2903.html" title="User talk:Winhunter">talk</a>)</sup> 14:27, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No major objections really, but allowing any user in the channel to use the bot to make an edit seems to me to violate the policy against role accounts... accounts for a specific role that many people have access too... The policy allows exemptions agreed to by the foundation (their PR firm or somesuch was allowed one). Perhaps you should ask for one for this as well? -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 01:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I have no problems with this one, as for the role account concerns, I think it's pretty obvious what it's doing and isn't a concern at all (in that sort of regard the Tawkerbot series is a role account as multiple people have access to those accounts) - Essjay has my full approval to flag this one -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 02:02, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was my impression that they could change the behavior of the tawkerbot accounts, but not make a specific edit with them as this allows and is designed to do...

If I see other tasks I could ask the bot to help with then I will ask permission here first.

<dd>Unicodifying is a good idea. It appears, however, that you are also using the "Apply General Fixes" setting in AWB. This will probably lead to a lot of unneccessary edits for things like page reordering and the like. Is there a way to make it only apply those general fixes on pages WITH unicode changes?<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 20:18, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Appearently not, so I think I am going to turn that option off in bot edits. The option in the bot would be "Auto tag" &amp; "Unidifify whole article" with "Apply general fixes" unchecked (those diff links are human-assisted, so it's ok to edit with that option). --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">WinHunter</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWinhunter_2903.html" title="User talk:Winhunter">talk</a>)</sup> 20:24, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That seems a lot better to me. Obviously having "apply general fixes" checked is OK for human-assisted edits, but for bot edits it can be a bit troublesome (you don't want your bot just moving whitespace). I'm still a little confused about the "auto tag" feature (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser#.22Set_options.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser#.22Set_options.22" rel="nofollow">here</a> on AWB page]. I've racked up a couple thousand manual edits using AWB, and have never really seen it in action. Do you have any examples of that option at work? <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 20:35, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yea.. auto tag rarely kicks in, so I think I can't really provide diff links. In my memory, it only happened a couple times in some very short articles where it automatically tagged them with {{stub}}, so I think it's ok to unicodify with that option on (though I don't really mind turning it off since it rarely kicks in anyways). --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">WinHunter</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWinhunter_2903.html" title="User talk:Winhunter">talk</a>)</sup> 21:04, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've had the same experience. It rarely kicks in. Personally, I would not check that option, just because we don't really have any hard and fast diffs. But yeah, looks good to me.

<li>Similar to KonstableBot, WinBot have gone through at least 10,000 articles (can't remember the exact count though) and made 1,464 edits to this moment, everything looks good so far. While I am doing this, I came up with a method to find articles that needs to be unicodified from DB dump, using the regex similar to this one: "<i>&amp;#(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9);</i>".

<li>The dump scanning software that comes with AWB has an option to detect unicode, which can be combined with the other options.

<li>This bot is supposed to be manually run.</li>
<li>I will run XaxaBot once, before examining the output and making any code changes. If I write code to upload pages, I will upload one page per test run.</li>
<li>This is a python bot written in the pywikipedia framework.</li>
<li>This bot is only for sandbox purposes. If I'm going to write a bot to help <a href="../../../e/c/h/WP%7EECHO_a399.html" title="WP:ECHO">Project Echo</a>, I need to know it's going to work before I submit it formally. I'm a bad programmer (methodologically speaking), so I need to test each line or function of code before moving on. As far as importance, I will also be using this bot to test code for bots for the Bot Request page.</li>
</ol>
<p>More comments: In it's current state, it fails the usefulness requirement, but that will necessarily change in time. I can vouch for it's harmlessness because I meticulously check output for errors before running a real test which includes an upload action. It will not be a server hog because I will happily use database dumps (they're as good as the real thing, right?).</p>

<dd>If you'll only be running it in your sandbox at this point, there is no need to request approval. Do your testing in your sandbox, get it working, and then bring it back to us once it's ready to do what it's programmed to do.

<p>Just so I understand things clearly...If I ran a snippet of recursion code to progressively download every non-orphaned article with the pywikipedia framework, there's a built-in throttle so there'd be no problem, right?

<p>I'm not sure if I can approve my own bot, as I am in the approvals group, but I see no problem with it, as it's behaving just as the AFD functionality does. It'll create the page at midnight EASTERN, rather than UTC like the AFD functions.</p>

<li>What: The main role of this bot will be to deliver the WP:MILHIST newsletter every month to people who subscribed to it. Currently, we have to do this by hand and each month, our coordinator has to search for volunteers, while a bot could do the job pretty well (it is messages appending).</li>
<li>It will also deprecate some existing templates, as our templates system evolved in the past months. It is a one-shot job, but there are at least 2000 links to be updated. The job is simple enough to be given to a bot.</li>
<li>It will sometimes be run in semi-auto mode when making article tagging. (I just don't want to do this with my main account).</li>
<li>It will run using AWB in automatic (first case) and semi-automatic (second case) mode, and AWB is quite time-tested, so no code of my own is involved. In any case, it will run under a constant supervision. I'm sure I will find other uses for him, but these two are very important by themselves.

<li>The newsletter delivery is approved outright; you're welcome to begin that whenever. If you are going to use the same bot account (I'd suggest using different accounts to do different things, making it easy to keep track of what is going on), then we will need to wait for the necessary trials to complete before flagging. Likewise, the template matter can be done without any problem. As for the last two, I'd prefer you came to us with specific examples of what you plan to do, as in "I will be working on [List of pages] doing [action]." It seems to me this is really a matter of two separate bots: one that does the WikiProject's work, and another that does your personal work. I'd suggest splitting the two so we can go ahead and flag the project's bot and keep discussing yours. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 00:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

This will be manually-assisted; in other words, while the "automatic" feature will be used in AWB, it will have to be started manually and be monitored at all times. Given that I can't program (well, excluding java, which isn't an ideal language for bots), the account will not and can not do much else. I am also aware that manually-assisted use of AWB doesn't require a bot flag; however, I would like to not flood RC with the nearly 200 users on the spamlist. The account will only run and spam the people on the list on distribution days (usually late Mondays or early Tuesdays) when <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalbot_531d.html" title="User:Ralbot">Ralbot</a> is unavailable, meaning that the account should be sparingly used. I don't anticipate a problem with using AWB for this purpose.

I've been waiting and watching to see if it would come back to life, or if AllyUnion would be around to fix it, but that hasn't happpened. As such, I've gotten ahold of a sandbox reset script (thanks <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofjude_9d65.html" title="User:Bookofjude">Jude</a>) and set EssjayBot up to be able to run it. Assuming there won't be any objections, as all it does is reset the sandbox, I'd like input on how often to have it done; there is a manual reset function as well, located at <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/sandbox.php" class="external free" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/sandbox.php" rel="nofollow">http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/sandbox.php</a>. For me it's just a matter of setting the crontab and letting it run; I just need to know what to put in.</p>
<p>For the moment, I have it set to reset my own sandbox, to prevent abuse until everything is cleared; I will look at the best way to have it do everything that Sandbot handled shortly. I intend this as a temporary measure, with every confidence that Sandbot will be back; if not, I'll register a more appropriate name and set it up dedicated. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 06:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, here's the update. I've gotten everything worked out so that it will cover all the sandboxes that Sandbot covered; a full list is on User:Essjaybot. There are manual resets for all the sandboxes (but not the talk pages) listed there. Additionally, unless I've messed up my crontab entry, it should run to clean the main sandbox &amp; talk page every 12 hours (noon and midnight), and to clean all the others on Sunday night at midnight (I assume that is local time for Zedler). Per Tawker's authorization, I'm flagging it as a bot. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 12:42, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_To_do_1b4e.html#Oversized_categories_to_be_split" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/To do">substantial backlog</a> of re-sorting tasks for already-identified stubs in oversized categories. Sometimes these are double-stubbed with two stub types that now have been given a common child type, and this is in such cases becomes a purely mechanical task of replacing {{X-stub}} and {{Y-stub}} with {{X-Y-stub}}. To help deal with these, I've written a <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_replace-diffs_ea6c.html" title="User:Alai/replace-diffs">simple extension of replace.py</a> (please excuse my Python) which does such replacements, on an "all or nothing" basis (that is, it makes no change if it's not able to replace both original templates with the new one). This would run on lists of double-tagged articles produced from an offline partial database dump, and/or StubSense. As this uses different code from that already trialed and approved, I suggest a new trial run under a non-bot-flagged account, <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaibotToo_2890.html" title="User:AlaibotToo">User:AlaibotToo</a>, with the final-approved (if and when) updates to be done with the existing bot-flagged account. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 04:15, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Trial started, a couple of hundred done so far; feel free to review whenever's good for the AG. Addendum: I'd also like to "roll in" the related task of re-stubbing single existing stub types, using the standard template.py code. Should be straightforward from a code point of view, being unmolested by my rehacking, the art in this instance is running it on the right stubs... (Generated from category intersection, as above.) For example: the members of both <a href="../../../o/r/g/Category%7EOrganization_stubs_ed58.html" title="Category:Organization stubs">Cat:organization stubs</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/n/Category%7ENon-profit_organizations_e4aa.html" title="Category:Non-profit organizations">Cat:Non-profit organizations</a>, changing the stub type (only) to <a href="../../../n/o/n/Category%7ENon-profit_organization_stubs_0b02.html" title="Category:Non-profit organization stubs">Cat:Non-profit organization stubs</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>EssjayBot's little brother, EssjayBot II, would like approval to archive pages in the same fashion as <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticbot_0a2d.html" title="User:Crypticbot">Crypticbot</a> did. This <u>is not</u> the Crypticbot code, but a pywikipedia version worked up by Misza13. It archives based on the last timestamp in a section, working in whole-number days; sections without timestamps will be untouched.</p>
<p>Since WerdnaBot is handling most of Crypticbot's old haunts, my intention is to set it up to do various other pages that are not regularly archived: <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a>, <a href="../../../b/n/_/WP%7EBN_7f9b.html" title="WP:BN">WP:BN</a>, and the talk pages of each. My intent is to have anything older than 2 days archived off CHU, anything older than 7 days archived off BN, and anything older than 10 days archived off the talk pages. Anyone interested in using EssjayBot II for archiving should drop me a talk page message.</p>
<p>I've done a quick test in my sandbox and everything seems in order. Due to the nature of the bot (archiving pages) and the limited number of times it should be editing, I don't think a flag is needed or desirable.

<dd>It creates archive pages where necessary; the archive number is hard coded for now, so when it needs to move to a new archive, I just go in and increase it by one, and if the page doesn't exist, it will create it. (This makes it unsuitable for large pages like AN/ANI right now, but I hope to have an autoincrementer available before too long.)

I've also offered the functionality to the Arbitration Committee for their talk page, and perhaps the Requests for Clarification section of RFAR.

<li>Wouldn't it be better to report potential copyvios (at an IRC channel, and at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> or a similar page for non-IRC folks) instead of just tagging them outright? Also, you could use Copyscape, similar to how the Spanish Wikipedia implemented this idea. Try talking to <a href="../../../../es/o/r/g/User%7EOrgullomoore_36b5.html" class="extiw" title="es:User:Orgullomoore">User:Orgullomoore</a> for ideas. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 06:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I suppose since the bot is bound to have a large number of false detections of coyvios it would be best to report it in a way other than simply tagging articles for speedy deletion. I like Titoxd's idea of listing the possible copyvios on a page similar to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">AIV</a> (later, perhaps, I can implement an IRC notification bot if this goes okay). I looked at copyscape, however, and it only will allow for 50 scans per month unless I pay them money, which I am not willing to do.

<li>What would be best is if it put a notice on the talk page "This article might be a copyvio" and added that article to a daily list (in the bot's userspace) of suspected copyvios. Then humans could use their judgement to deal with them properly... overall I think it would speed things up tremendously, since we'd have all the likely copyvios in one place. It should probably avoid testing any phrases in quotation marks, but other than that, I don't think it would pick up a huge number of false positives. In my experience with newpage patrol, for every 99 copyvios there's maybe 1 article legitimately copied from a PD/GPL site. Like I said earlier, it's rather amazing that we don't have a bot doing this already, and I'm glad someone's developing it finally.

<ul>
<li>The problem with putting a notice on a talk page would be that it would create a large number of talk pages for deleted articles; that being said, if you still think it is a good idea, I will trust your judgement and implement it anyway once I am confident in the bot's accuracy. Also, just out of curiosity, what do you think is wrong with searching for exact phrases? (when I was not testing for exact phrases, the bot claimed that a page was a copyvio of a webpage that listed virtually every word in the English language).

<dd>Oh, you're probably right about the talkpages, I hadn't thought of that. For the other thing, I mean that it shouldn't search for phrases that were originally in quotation marks in the test article, since those are probably quotations that might be fair use. But it should definently search for other exact phrases from the article on Google/Yahoo whatever. By the way, I think Google limits you to 3,000 searches/day, Yahoo might too... not sure if that will have an impact. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:09, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree; the bot <i>will</i> have a fair amount of errors because of the concerns voiced above. Thus, the bot will edit only one page, which will be outside article space. This page would contain a listing of suspected copyvios found by the bot. During the trial period, I would set the bot to edit a page in my userspace; if the bot is successful, perhaps the page could be moved to the Wikipedia namespace. Does that address your concern?

<dd>I have not done so yet; however, based on tests so far, I would estimate that the backlog would be manageable. It is hard to tell for sure though, without a trial. Thus, I just started the bot so it commits to a file, and does not touch Wikipedia. When I finish this trial, I will be able to give an estimation of how many suspected copyvios it finds per day. -- <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><b><font color="blue">Where</font></b></a> 19:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just did a 36 minute test, in which 4 potential copyvios were identified. If I did the calculatins correctly, this would mean that 160 potential copyvios would be identified on a daily basis (assuming that the rate of copyvios is constant, which is obviously not the case). This is a lot, but should be manageable (especially if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion#Amending_A8.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion#Amending_A8.3F" rel="nofollow">A8 is amended</a>).

<dd>Been looking pretty good, some false positives though, so think this should stick to listing on a copyvio patrol type page rather then tagging the articles (early request). The trial period usually lasts a week-whenever it's done&#160;:) Upon going live, do you have a project page this would go to, or would you keep it in your userspace?; if possible perhaps a "reported at ~~~~~" or a per day break might be helpful. This bot looks like it's being useful though, just have to get the results in front of some live editors. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 03:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree completely that the bot most certainly cannot be trusted to directly tag articles (if I change my mind, I would come back here, but I don't think it is possible to get it at the desired level of acuracy). I would prefer to move <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_cp_0ca6.html" title="User:Where/cp">User:Where/cp</a> to <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_copyright_violations_65c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected copyright violations">Wikipedia:Suspected copyright violations</a>, or something of that nature. The bot now includes timestamps, as you suggested. -- <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><b><font color="blue">Where</font></b></a> 02:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bot approved, no bot flag though (edits are not high-speed, and the edit summaries may be useful on a watch list).— <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Final suggestions on this page:If possible take the parts out about "remove this line" from the edit summaries, make the project page, and a /Reports subpage; transclude the subpage to the main page (that way people can watch list it serperatley if desired). Then get the word out (<a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, link on <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>, <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">WP:VP</a>, etc pages. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
