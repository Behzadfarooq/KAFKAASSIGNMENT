<h2><span class="mw-headline">Footnote bot</span></h2>
<p>This bot will be used in the assistance and correction of pages using footnotes. No proposed name has yet been suggested for the username and the code for this is still unwritten.</p>
<p>I am proposing that the bot performs like this: (all pages refer to subpages of the bot's user space or a Wikipedia Project page)</p>
<ol>
<li>Every hour, check for articles listed by users at a <font color="blue"><u>/To Do/2007 April 6</u></font> subpage... either at its user page or a Wikipedia project page</li>
<li>Fix template usage of the footnotes on that page and re-arrange them in order on the given page</li>
<li>Remove added article on the /To Do/ page to <font color="blue"><u>/Completed/2007 April 6</u></font> subpage.</li>
</ol>
<p>The initial suggestion was to actually browse all pages using the template. I think that's a bad idea, as we're at half a million articles and the amount of pages the bot needs to work at is really limited. Personally, I like the idea of having a dog like bot where you tell it, "Fix bot, fix." is a better implementation. That way, 1) it doesn't need to bog the Wikipedia down searching for articles it needs to fix, 2) articles can be fixed when they need to. Users would just simply leave the footnotes out of order and the bot would come around to correct the ordering. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:53, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There have been several different footnote proposals and corresponding templates. Would this theoretical bot be working with <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnote3_96a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnote3">Wikipedia:Footnote3</a>? Certainly crawling all articles that use footnotes would put undue burden on the site. But much of the point of the bot would be to catch footnotes which <i>accidentally</i> get put out of order. A good compromise would be to load the "todo" page with the results of a <a href="../../../d/a/t/Wikipedia%7EDatabase_download_51c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Database download">Wikipedia:Database download</a> analysis. It would also be nice to convert all pages to use the same footnoting system, but that might require broader community consensus. (Unless there are only a few non-standard pages, in which case they can be re-done by hand.) -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 01:08, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This could optionally be added to Grammar bot as an extension... anyway...</p>
<p>Basic idea: Change <i>text</i> in {{text}} and [[text]] to remove all underscores. The only exception that it will not change is anything within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.

<dd>I can program that. I will run the basic query I will run off, but it will have many many false positives. (No worries, it won't make <i>edits</i> that are false positives.)

<dd>Is this bot still planned?

</dl>
<p>This sounds like a solution in search of a problem, to me. I'd be obliged if it could avoid any templates or tables in its processing, because I use the underscore separator in order to keep multi-word links on the same line, rather than having a wrap at the internal space. I changed the section name as well, to reflect that it's not a correction, but a replacement. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 16:43, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is certainly a problem. All right, it's no more than an aesthetic annoyance, but I've seen no end of links like <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main_Page</a> in the main text for absolutely no reason.</dd>
<dd>The VP discussion also says something about using non-breaking spaces in links, but that doesn't seem to work. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">Nickptar</a> 14:57, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just an idea... maybe convert all those large numbers like 100000000 to something with commas like 100,000,000.

<dd>Please consider that the comma use is not universal, in large parts of Europe, it is common to interchange the decimal point and the comma. We have a decimal comma and write 100.000.000.

<dd>Not all. <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> uses the comma as a decimal seperator, and a space as the seperator.

Its purpose is to help with issues on the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="commons:">Wikipedia Commons</a>. There is only one task that the bot is supposed to do at the moment: help renaming media files on the commons. Suppose there were two identical files (e.g. images) on the Commons that might even have been uploaded from different language Wikipedias.

<dd>As for the dictionary, it uses a wordlist and a set of regexp generators matching common mistakes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tagging</span></h2>
<p>I just started developing a bot which, at the moment, bears the name Tagbot. It would help with the tedious work that is <a href="../../../i/t/_/WP%7EIT_ff0f.html" title="WP:IT">Image Tagging</a>. It's task would be simple, it would find untagged images and tag them with {{No source}}. Then it would find the user who first uploaded it and leave a message on his/her talk page saying something like "Hi! Image XXX that you uploaded is untagged. This is bad because..... You tag an image by putting......etc.". This purpose of this would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many images would be automatically tagged by the user</li>
<li>It would tag all images with {{unverified}}, and thats better than nothing.</li>
<li>It would make actual image tagging much easier to organize, as you simply would have to look at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_with_unknown_source_b9fa.html" title="Category:Images with unknown source">Category:Images with unknown source</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was thinking it might be best to hear comments and/or get permission before I got too deep into the process. So what y'all think? By the way, it might also be a good idea to change Mediawiki to automatically add an unverified-tag to a new image, to ensure no untagged images. So, what y'all think? <a href="../../../g/k/h/User%7EGkhan_3d68.html" title="User:Gkhan">Gkhan</a> 01:23, Apr 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>One problem with this: a number of images have copyright information included, but it's in a pre-tagging form. Would it be possible to make this bot into a semi-automated process? What I'm envisioning is
<ol>
<li>The bot finds an untagged image</li>
<li>It shows the image, on its Wikipedia page, to the user monitoring the process</li>
<li>The user either indicates the tag that should be added to the page, or indicates that the bot should tag it {{unverified}} and post on the uploader's user page.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If the whole system is made simple enough, copies of the bot software could be distributed to everyone who's participating in the image tagging process. How does this sound? --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 01:44, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It does sound good, I like it alot. One thing though, the way I was imagining the bot was that I should download the database and look up the images to be tagged, because thats the only way I can think of that would work short of making database requests. I suppose I can do two versions, one that tags all images with something like {{to-be-tagged}} an then the tagging-"client" that is distrobuted could read off that list (the Category-list that is). I am not qualified to asses the server hog this would create, but it sounds good (great!) to me. <a href="../../../g/k/h/User%7EGkhan_3d68.html" title="User:Gkhan">Gkhan</a> 01:57, Apr 30, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My understanding is that, with the current server software, categories with large numbers of pages should be avoided if at all possible. Viewing such a category puts almost as much load on the server as viewing each individual article in the category. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 02:10, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That can't possibly be true! When you add or remove a category from an article doesn't some sort of list become edited that the Category-page reads from (atleast thats what I, an amateur, incompetent and inexperienced programmer would do (I'm not really that bad, only as a comparison to mediawiki-developers)). Viewing a category-page should only be as hard as reading from that list, right? Although when you look at an image category, it displays all images. That most certainly is a server hog (it would be nice with some developer-input though). <a href="../../../g/k/h/User%7EGkhan_3d68.html" title="User:Gkhan">Gkhan</a> 02:41, Apr 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've finished a bot that can upload quotes as well as other financial data (such as market cap, dividends, etc) on publically traded companies daily, from the machine readable interface provided by Yahoo Finance. It downloads a list of stock symbols and the format template from wiki pages, then sticks them data for each symbol in its own page in the Template namespace (something like Template:Stock:AAPL, for example).* Is this something that people are interested in? I guess it boils down to a somewhat philosophical question as to whether this kind of timely information should be considered "encyclopedic".</p>

<dd>The question would be more of how many pages and how many symbols are we talking about, and which markets are you referring to. Furthermore, I'd very much prefer to keep the bot's edits out of the template space. Template:Stock:AAPL seems a bit excessive and rather unusual. Let me see here... the NYSE starts at around 9 AM ET and closes at 5 PM ET. So, you'd have about 16 hours to update NYSE stocks. Assuming if you updated a page every 30 seconds, which is the typical recommended editing speed, you'd only be able to update 1920 stocks out of the 2800 stocks traded on NYSE. That only gives you 68.6% of all the stocks on NYSE. Assuming if we allow you to "push" the limit, having an edit period of 10 second apart... 28000 seconds which is 466 minutes and 40 seconds which is 7 hours, 46 seconds, and 40 seconds. So, you'd have to have your bot edit at least 15 second part each day to update stock information on all NYSE traded stocks. Do you think it still is a bit excessive? -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 07:11, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your proposal is a little draconian. I do think it's fair to ask bot authors to announce their bot here, to describe what their bot is doing, to run under a bot account, and to limit the bot's rate of activity. And it's fair to have a policy of block-on-sight for rogue bots. But I don't think it's fair to require administrator approval to run a bot at all. What if no sysop is available or interested enough to comment? And what gives administrators the insight and knowledge to judge whether a bot deserves to be given a chance to prove itself? Administrators are supposed to be janitorial assistants, not technical experts. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 22:21, 2005 May 29 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ditto; There's more than enough red tape for bots already, please let's not make it any worse than it already is by applying pseudo-legal concepts to wiki bots. Perhaps ask people to go slowly in the first week the bot is run, thus allowing time for feedback before a full rollout; but let's not discourage contributions (or encourage illicit bots) by making the bar so excessively high that people either say "stuff that", or start operating without first requesting approval (which are precisely the outcomes that excessive regulation will encourage). <i>Furthermore, in its comment, it should declare what it is doing</i> - this I do agree with, but as a guideline or recommendation. -- <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 02:50, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, maybe not necessarily an administrator. I think someone should review what a bot does... because I think the whole "if no one says anything" policy should be slightly reconsidered. What I'm trying to say is that bots should be always given a trial period of one week, then stopped and reviewed over by someone. I suggested sysops, because we don't need anyone technical to review if a bot's edits are harmful. Usually a smart person can determine whether a bot's edits are harmful. I suggested sysops because they have the power to block bots anyway... If a bot's edits are harmful, then they should be blocked, however it should be here where a bot's owner can attempt to discuss in order to unblock their bot for another trial run. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 05:20, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Policy: spelling</span></h2>
<p><i>There should be no (unattended) spelling fixing bots; it is quite simply not technically possible to create such a bot that will not make incorrect changes; if the big office utility companies can't make a perfect automated spellchecker, you most likely can't either</i></p>
<p>It seems like this is too harsh. The comparison with word processing spellcheckers isn't a fair one, because the needs are different -- we don't need a bot that would be a "perfect" spellchecker, just one that would (1) make many useful corrections, but (2) <b>when in doubt</b> leave articles alone. It seems like it wouldn't be impossible to make a spelling bot that would have a "certainty metric" for how sure it was that the correction was a needed one, and only make it if it was extremely sure.</p>
<p>I know this page is for requesting bots, but there ought to be a place to discuss the content of this page as well, and if not here I don't know where.

<dd>I agree with these comments. We have spam filters that have exceedingly low false-positive levels (on the order of maybe 1 in 10,000 mails). Why shouldn't it be possible to build a similarly conservative spell checker? Besides this, I can tell you that "the big office utility companies" are almost certainly working on context-sensitive spellchecking technology with much-reduced false-positive and false-negative rates and larger dictionaries. There have been recent papers on context-sensitive spellchecking which found about 97% of errors and produced almost no false positives at all; it could even be trained on the existing body of Wikipedia text, so that it recognizes many specialised terms. I was thinking of creating a tool that does this type of spellchecking. This rule suffers from a lack of imagination.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, I really don't see any need for fully automatic spellchecking. Page update speeds are slow enough that human review shouldn't cost much relative time, provided that it's not wrong too often. It can simply list its corrections and ask them to hit ENTER if they're all good. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 17:56, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A small note here... part of the reason is that we have this difference between various spellings in English. While some people might write <i>Internationalization</i>, others might write it as <i>Internationalisation</i>. Both are still correct, but one is used over the other depending on the country you are from. Furthermore, a spellbot must recognize and skip over Unicode characters as well as HTML codes, wiki codes, in addition to any languages that use partial English for pronounation or actual words. Such examples is <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanji.html" title="Romanji">Romanji</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, and so on. An automatic bot correcting this may accidently change something in an article not necessarily intended... and a simple revert back defeats the purpose of the bot especially if it made only one mistake out of the entire page that it just corrected. (Assuming that the one mistake is not easily corrected by a human editor.) Just some of my thoughts on the matter. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:13, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh yes, don't forget proper nouns such as names of places, people, things... We don't know how accurate it will be on the Wikipedia. It might be 97%, it might be lower. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:15, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think you are right to point out these difficulties, but I think that they are surmountable, and that some one could conceivably make a useful spell checker (defined as finding some small, but nontrivial amount of wrong spellings, and making false-positives, i.e. "corrections" that shouldn't be made, almost never). You would just have to make it extremely conservative, as Deco was saying. It wouldn't get all, or maybe not even most, mispellings, but as long as it got some of them, and didn't make any false-positives, it would be useful. You could program it to not correct <i>anything</i> with a capital letter, for example, which would cover the proper name problem. You could also program it to recognize all the various English spellings pretty easily. It's probably not a huge issue, since I almost never find misspellings, but I think it could be done, and I'd hate to see someone be discouraged from trying if the policy is worded too strongly.

<dd>What about sciencific names? There is a certain degree of intelligence it does require... A person can easily determine between a typo and a misspelling... I'm not completely certain a computer can. I would not mind if we had a bot that "prompted" the spelling errors or highlight them in some manner. Nor would I mind that it is a bot that corrects the most common mistakes. Correcting the most common mistakes of misspellings would yield better results, I believe. I'm just really concern that the bot runs into a strange word and it doesn't know it... but finds a match in its dictionary and changes the word. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:03, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This really isn't possible because there are a number of circumstances in which we'd want to deliberately misspell a word, for example in an exact quotation with [sic] or mentioning "this name is commonly misspelled as <i>foo</i>". We even have articles about spelling usage like <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misspelling.html" title="Misspelling">Misspelling</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/h/Teh.html" title="Teh">Teh</a>. What's considered a misspelling in modern English might have been used in the past before spelling was standardized, so it could appear in quotations from old sources or in an explanation of the etymology of a word. Articles often give "pronounced like" spellings of words that may be the same as common misspellings. What is a misspelling in English might be the correct spelling in a foreign language we're quoting. I'm sure there's other situations I haven't thought of. There's just no way you can rule all of this out, no matter how conservatively you construct your word list. <a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDopefishJustin_bbf5.html" title="User:DopefishJustin">DopefishJustin</a> <a href="../../../d/o/p/User_talk%7EDopefishJustin_562f.html" title="User talk:DopefishJustin">(･∀･)</a> June 30, 2005 21:36 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Procedure for user supervised scripts</span></h2>
<p>I am presently designing <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERABot_8d9b.html" title="User:RABot">RABot</a> to simplify some of the tasks associated with maintaining the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">requested articles</a> pages, namely deletion of created articles and sorting / tidying up article lists.</p>
<p>Because of the variations in formatting across different request pages and the complexities of ways in which people make requests, this is a fairly complicated parsing task. The scripts I've created so far are fairly accurate and do a good job of handling many things, but it is unlikely that this will ever be able to run unsupervised since there will likely always be people adding bizarrely formatted requested that the scripts choke on. (It is supposed to ignore things it can't parse, but sometimes it thinks it understands things it really doesn't.) So as a result, I plan to manually check and approve all its proposed edits before committing them.</p>
<p>So my question is, what is the procedure for getting approval for running scripts like this? It is not really a bot in the sense that it will not be running independantly, but it does use the Python bot library and have a seperate user account. The bots page isn't particularly clear on what is expected before running supervised scripts like this.</p>
<p>Once it reaches a point where I feel it is well-behaved enough that I want to start using it in maintaining the requested articles pages, I intend to write a detailed description of what it is trying to do (e.g. remove created articles and sort lists) and discuss its presense on the RA talk pages. Is that enough?</p>

<dd>I personally don't think that this particular bot is a good idea. If a certain link in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">Wikipedia:requested articles</a> becomes blue, that is the article is created, I think it is good for a human editor to inspect that article, see if it indeed corresponds to the title, clean it up if necessary, and only later remove it. Also, having a blue link or two in this list is not something as serios as to spend a lot of time creating and debugging a bot.

<dd>If you haven't recently, you might want to take a look over <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_requested_articles_f999.html" title="Category:Wikipedia requested articles">Category:Wikipedia requested articles</a>, there are a lot of links even if you aren't paying attention to somewhat ugly dump pages like <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_list_of_missing_pharmacology_2757.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/list of missing pharmacology">Wikipedia:Requested articles/list of missing pharmacology</a>. Some users, like <a href="../../../d/m/g/User%7EDMG413_758c.html" title="User:DMG413">User:DMG413</a>, climb high in the edit count primarily by removing blue links from those lists. In a perfect world, you would be right and people would take a careful look at each article before removing it, but a single request page might get 5-10 blue links a day and go for week without being cleaned. At which point no reasonable person is actually going to look through the articles.

<dd>Technically, your bot would qualify under being manual controlled "bot assistant." More or less a specialized editor, if you will. Regardless, asking permission from the community helps to confirm what you are doing. I'd recommend that you perform all edits under what "seems" to be a bot account, and give it a test run. Since your bot has an objection from Oleg Alexandrov, please run your bot slow (maybe edits that are at least 1 minute apart), and for about a week. When the week is up, ask Oleg Alexandrov if he still objects to the use of your manually controlled bot. Stop immediately, if anyone makes a complaint that your bot is not working properly or doing something not intended. In any case, I'd like to give you a trial week, and even if you screw up, it still be easy to revert your edits anyway. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:49, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
