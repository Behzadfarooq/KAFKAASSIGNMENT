<h2><span class="mw-headline">New behavior for OrphanBot</span></h2>
<p>Since the situation with unsourced images is now somewhat under control, I've modified OrphanBot's behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>OrphanBot will now convert tags from the {{nosource}} and {{nosource|~~~~~}} formats to the {{nosource|day=|month=|year=}} format, which categorizes the images by date, making it easier to see which images need deleting. OrphanBot will also create these categories if needed.</li>
<li>OrphanBot will notify uploaders about unsourced images. Notification will only be given if OrphanBot can't find a link to the image on the user's talk page: if it finds a link, there's a good chance that the user has already been notified.</li>
<li>OrphanBot will only orphan images that are older than six days. Hopefully this will get <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">User:Sam Spade</a> off my back -- he only wants me to remove image <i>after</i> they've been deleted.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AlvestrandNLBot</span></h2>
<p>This is a project in the making, not an existing bot... I created a couple of lines of Perl that allowed me to pull up a subsection of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> in a format that would allow me to cut-and-paste it into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a>. This led to some discussion, which included the points that:</p>
<ul>
<li>This would be much more useful if it also read the article pointed to and attempted to pull some basic biographical data from there</li>
<li>Letting the script do the paste-back to Wikipedia itself would make some issues (particularly Unicode ones) easier</li>
<li>If the two changes above were made, the result would most certainly need permission to run under the Wikipedia bot policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I'm hereby asking permission. The account for the bot is not created, the script is not written. But I would like to make sure I'm not getting ahead of myself. --<a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvestrand_d574.html" title="User:Alvestrand">Alvestrand</a> 13:31, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A clarification: if someone is using their browser to make fast edits, either with keyboard shortcuts or perhaps using a JavaScript tool or something like <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greasemonkey.html" title="Greasemonkey">Greasemonkey</a>, does that exempt them from this policy? I have noted a few cases of late where editors are making 10 edits per minute or more for extended periods, and when queried, they say they are not running a bot, but rather using browser features.

<dd>Acutally the answer was "Use a bot flag to avoid clogging up recent changes" (paraphrase). Recent changes also has a "minor changes" flag, and a "logged in user flag" either of which can be used for that same purpose. The only distinction bots have is trusted status. Also things have changed since the early days, with 100+ changes a minute the rationale for a bot flag is slightly different - about 11% of changes are by bots (according to a recent poll of 500 changes) , and they are running all the time. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>. 14:50, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The bot flag is just another filter on the RC feed, most users don't review bot changes on flagged bots because they assume they're approved. I see the main point of a bot flag is to avoid clogging up RC, I run my bot at 12 edits a min during off peak slow hours (especially when I'm doing an 8K job) - I checked with the bot filter off and my bot was 1 in 5 edits, its mostly just a trust/filtering thing. One with AWB can do the same amount of edits or more just clicking next each time. <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 07:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first sentence of <a href="../../../b/_/_/WP%7EB_5622.html" title="WP:B">WP:B</a> seems very misleading to me. Many bots are not just automated processes but rather have a large degree of human input. I have seen this first sentence cause some confusion.

It wasn't at all clear to me when I was writing CricketBot that it was a bot, but the advice here seemed to be that it should be regarded as one. But then <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> was invented, and says at the top of its page that it's not a bot, even though I don't really see the difference. So I'm still a bit confused about this. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephen_Turner_5111.html" title="User talk:Stephen Turner">Talk</a>) 18:42, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AWB is not a bot in the sense that it is automatic, but people use it - as they have used other tools - under a "bot account" to seperate out their user contributions. I think we need to differentiate between bots that are automatic and bots that are actually users using some kind of tool (interwiki, disambiguation, javascripts, AWB etc.) <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 19:13, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a direct interest in this issue too. I have always been a fast manual editor. People have frequently suggested incorrectly that my manual edits are automated. It was easy to say 'no I am not a bot'. After I started using AWB and scripts, I get the same suggestions but it is not so easy to know what to say in response. As I see it, there are two viewpoints:
<ul>
<li>1. The editor's viewpoint</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The editor knows whether a page edit is manual, software assisted or automatic.
<ul>
<li>2. The onlooker's viewpoint</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The onlooker can only see: edit frequency; edit count; edit content.</dd>
<dd>Some of the fears of automation relate to edit validation and editor responsibility. Perhaps we should describe editing in those terms e.g. fully automated editing of a page is not validated so perhaps it can be called 'unsupervised', 'unchecked' or some word like that. If a human checks each page, it could be called 'supervised', 'checked', or something like that. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 19:53, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I checked my contributions from when I was using AWB for disambiguation yesterday, and it looks like I averaged (pulls out calculator) 2.13 edits per minute during the time periods in which I was working. I don't think I'm likely to go much faster than this (DAB work requires a certain amount of thought), but I probably will be working at near this speed on a fairly regular basis. Do I need to request a bot to work at this speed, and, if so, would it be a bigger hassle to create a bot account and get it approved or to slow down to whatever would be an acceptable speed? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 05:18, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>2.13 edits per min is borderline bot flag. The policy is not to run a unflagged bot faster than once every 30s so you're borderline.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mathbot Complaint</span></h2>
<p>Mathbot is pasting messages in user's talk pages asking them to do more edit summaries. I find this very obnoxious. Wikipedia is supposed to improve by cooperation and peer review <i>in the act of editing itself</i>. The kind of eye-in-the-sky monitoring of this bot-function is IMHO quite contrary to that spirit. Also, I think there should be a very high burden of proof on bots who leave messages in user's talk pages. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 20:20, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The guideline at <a href="../../../e/s/_/WP%7EES_f020.html" title="WP:ES">WP:ES</a> recommends the use of edit summaries. I don't know mathbot's full scope, but considering it does the edit summary checks for RFA I would think that checking for edit summary use and letting people know is within its operating guidelines. I found it amusing that you didn't use an edit summary on either of your edits (both as the anon and as yourself) here, btw. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 20:37, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for interpretation of policy</span></h2>
<p>The policy text uses the terms <i>general consensus</i> and <i>any objections</i> but it is not clear about what happens when there *are* objections. An editor says <i>I think one legitimate oppose is all that should be required to deny a bot operating approval</i>. I can see his reading of the text but he happens to be opposed to my application and I would like an independent view. It is a very simple and very powerful rule that could be stated clearly.</p>
<p>If that is the policy then I was wasting my time applying. And over 50 voters were wasting their time voting/debating.</p>
<p>I presume that all those taking part in the debate would like to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Did Bobblebot get a <i>Rough consensus</i>?</li>
<li>2. Did Bobblebot get approval or didn't it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Can I have an opinion from somebody independent? Thanks. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">bobblewik</a> 18:04, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was wondering this too. The current policy seems very unclear to me. It says "Get a rough consensus" and then in the very next sentence it says "see if there are any objections, and if there aren't, go ahead". Is it really the intention that one (well-intentioned) editor is all that's required to veto any bot? So running a bot needs unanimity, not just consensus? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephen_Turner_5111.html" title="User talk:Stephen Turner">Talk</a>) 18:15, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say Bobblebot got a rough consensus. My counting isn't very good, but numbers look to be about 42 people for and about 15 against. Not as clear as would be desirable. But numbers are only part of consensus, and since there is a general presumption that we <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> my suggestion below, is that we give BB the 1 week testing as suggested by policy page. However I'm not sure if I'm neutral. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 18:30 <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_March_864d.html" title="9 March">9 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<p>From <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a>, the burden of proof is upon the bot owner to demonstrate the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The bot is harmless</li>
<li>The bot is useful</li>
<li>The bot is not a server hog</li>
<li>The bot has been approved</li>
</ol>
<p>If people oppose, it's because that people do not believe the bot owner has demonstrated the previous four issues to be true for the bot sufficiently. There is good reason for these policies for bots, a "rough" consensus is not good enough. Rather than trying to circumvent the bot policy, demonstrate the previous issues to be true.</p>
<p>I for one don't believe that the bot is harmless (given the numerous examples of mistakes reported by other editors on Bobblewik's talk page), and I don't believe it is useful - I for one find links around dates useful for browsing to other historical events occuring at a similar time. The bot has been "tested" enough already, when it was being run without permission, and unless Bobblewik explains how he's changed his bot to now be harmless and useful, I don't see how "testing" it for another week will be of any advantage to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 19:18, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bobblebot part 2</span></h2>
<p>As far as I can see, Bobbblewik has done everything by the book.</p>
<ul>
<li>He's reduced his editing speed as requested by other users.</li>
<li>He's suspended editing altogether for two long periods, to allow consensus to develop.</li>
<li>His edits are broadly in line with MoS.</li>
<li>He doesn't edit-war.</li>
<li>He remains civil.</li>
<li>He's submitted a bot request, although it is arguable he doesn't need to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now <i>it looks as if</i> those that object to his edits, rather than coming up with a good reason or trying to negotiate, are saying that any objection means he can't run under a bot flag. The project page is confused on this point "Get a rough consensus on the talk page that it is a good idea. Wait a week to see if there are any objections, and if there aren't, go ahead and run it for a short period so it can be monitored."</p>
<p>Can we please say at this point - "Bobblewick, run your one week test, and lets gather some feedback."

<li>If both spellings are present in the article, count each instance of each word, and if one is Y percent more prevalent than the other, replace all to fit the majority.</li>

<dd>Some ideas. If an article is about a British place then it generally gets British spelling - so a human would have to check for things like that on every page (for all Commonwealth countries etc), so the bot deosn't make a mistake. Also, spelling can be rather complicated. For example the word <i>theatre</i>. That is the British spelling, but American's use it when talking about Broadway. So an article about an American actor may trick the bot. That's one exception, there could be more. Are there many articles are suffering from this problem, are there any statistics?--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 06:41, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the input. This proposal isn't based on statistics, but just on my experience browsing Wikipedia, where spelling 'style' often changes from paragraph to paragraph. As to the first dilemma, how about a piece of code that checks the first 100 words or so for the words "Britain", "British", "American", "United States", or even more specific terms, and if they point towards a certain spelling, go with that? (Maybe even human-assisted.) Again, if both were present, they would be sent to a page for human decision. I'm not sure what to do as far as Broadway, unless such exceptions are well documented somewhere. - <span style="font-family:Optima, Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElAmericano_1aa7.html" title="User:ElAmericano"><span style="color:red">El</span><span style="color:blue">Americano</span></a></span> (<a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElAmericano_bc88.html" title="User talk:ElAmericano"><small>dímelo</small></a>) 14:11, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm very uncomfortable with the idea of a bot actually making these changes, I would prefer that the bot stored a list of pages with inconsistent spelling as some maintenance page, and left it up to humans to actually make the necessary changes. Remember, also, that Wikipedia's policy is to use the original language spelling, not the most common. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalrias_6b30.html" title="User:Talrias">Talrias</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalrias_9ef0.html" title="User talk:Talrias">t</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Talrias_7d2c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Talrias">e</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Talrias_2658.html" title="Special:Contributions/Talrias">c</a>) 14:56, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I'll make a statistics-generating bot, then.

<dd>It's been discussed before, and there's no reliable way to do this. Among other things, many "no license" tags are applied by the uploader, since "some website" and "don't know" in the dropdown menu on the upload screen both do this. Also, several dozen license templates based on incorrect understandings of law have been redirected to {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_license_827d.html" title="Template:No license">no license</a>}}, with more added all the time. Sometimes, the person tagging the image substs the template, and occasionally someone else does so at a later date. And then there's the slowdown from trawling through histories: OrphanBot can currently process about 200 images an hour, so handling the "no source" and "no license" categories takes between 12 and 24 hours right now. Adding in history checks would reduce this to around 150 images an hour for the "no license" catetory, and around 100 an hour for the "no source" category. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 20:53, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The tagging is actually done by people in <a href="../../../u/n/t/Wikipedia%7EUntagged_images_0448.html" title="Wikipedia:Untagged images">Wikipedia:Untagged images</a> then, Orphanbot simply delinks images that are already tagged as having no source or no license. It lists the articles it delinked from on the image page also, which is helpful for the admin who may be deleting if it was tagged in error to relink the image. So orphanbot really is just notifying uploaders and delinking the images (which notifies anyone who has the article on their watch list). The actual tagging and deletion are still done by people, and there is a 7 day window (if we keep up!) between those events. There was a recent problem with some people tagging a lot of images as having no source in error, which may be the real cause of this complaint, but that was unrelated to orphanbot really. - <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion"><font style="color:#137300;"><b>cohesion</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion"><font style="color:#f98c0d;"><b>t</b></font></a></sup> 09:48, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh... I guess that clears things up <i>somewhat</i>. I still have the objection about which images are tagged, since there seems to be little effort to determine their actual source and status.

<dd>When the image is tagged as no source for example, it goes into a date-based category, then after 7 days an admin will go through and delete them, checking of course that they are tagged correctly etc. When they are tagged incorrectly orphanbot will still have delinked them, but listed the articles they used to be in, so personally I just go to those articles and revert orphanbot and tag the image correctly. I assume most people do this although I can't be certain. Yes, there isn't a whole lot of effort put into finding the source, but with the amount of images and the amount of people we really rely more on the uploader for that. Often if the uploader just writes the source in text we can find the correct tag for them and tag it, but when they don't provide anything at all in most cases we will simply say no source and move on. This doesn't explain the little hiccup in the system last week when <i>lots</i> of images were indiscrimately tagged as no source...&#160;:( - <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion"><font style="color:#137300;"><b>cohesion</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion"><font style="color:#f98c0d;"><b>t</b></font></a></sup> 10:55, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

Removing the images was discussed and approved on the Administrators' Noticeboard.</li>
<li>Your complaints have been ignored largely because they're based on incorrect assumptions and disagreement with Wikipedia policy. Roughly 97.5% of all images OrphanBot has removed from pages have subsequently been deleted. It is Wikipedia policy to delete images that have no source or license information, and, while no policy requires removing deleted images from pages that use those images, it's generally a good idea. It's also a hell of a lot easier to remove those images <i>before</i> they're deleted. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 21:08, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>A little addition on Carnildo's last point: By yanking them from the articles it makes the pending deletion visable to the users most interested and able and try to fix/replace the image... not the uploader, not the users cleaning up image tags, but the editors of the article where the image was in use. Yanking the no source images is pretty much the most friendly thing we can do... unless you suggest the bot spam the talk page of every user who has edited an article containing the image.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 03:56, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New pages patrol bot</span></h2>
<p>I would like to run a bot that reads the recent changes irc output (in a similar way to <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_CDVF_0a2d.html" title="User:CryptoDerk/CDVF">CryptoDerk's Vandal Fighter</a>). The bot will tag very obvious vandalism for deletion (although <i>most</i> of this is already caught), very short articles as stubs and articles with no links as needing wikification. The bot will only read the articles when they are over a certain age (i.e. when they are no longer on the first page of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">newpages</a> list) to avoid any edit conflicts.</p>
<p>My motivation for this is the increasing volume of substandard articles that we receive that just end up floating around, anyone who has scanned the database will know what I'm talking about. I would like to test it for a week, and then assess how useful it is. I have written most of the software already (in <a href="../../../c/_/s/C_Sharp_2d4c.html" title="C Sharp">c#</a>), and providing there are no major objections I will probably be ready to test in a week or so. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:46, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
