<li>What: The purpose of this bot is to do WikiProject maintenance for whatever WikiProject thinks its services are useful. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Anime_and_Manga_7d56.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and Manga">WikiProject Anime and Manga</a> will be the first beneficiary if this bot is approved. Of course, all its actions will have to be approved by any WikiProject before it is used on that WikiProject, as while in many cases they may be very useful, some WikiProjects may have different sorting systems that this bot should not mess with.</li>
<li>Why: I have noticed that WikiProjects run into a few problems in terms of raw sorting. First of all, there are often a huge number of stubs (hundreds or thousands) that <i>belong</i> in the category of a WikiProject (with the appropriate template in the discussion page) but have not been included. A bot could easily do this. There are other similar things, of course, that the bot could also do.</li>
<li>Exactly What:
<ul>
<li>Put all "anime and manga stubs" not in WikiProject Anime and Manga into Wikiproject Anime and Manga as Stub-Class.</li>
<li>If WikiProject Anime and Manga lists a stub as anything but stub-class, remove the stub tag as long as the article is more than 1000 characters long. If it is shorter, do nothing, as it could be an actual stub. The 1000-character cutoff isn't an arbitrary cutoff, but simply a safety feature to avoid a really short article that was accidentally listed as a non-stub in the article rating scale to stop being called a stub.</li>
<li>For all projects with their own rating system, turn all GA-class articles in those projects that aren't listed as GA or better into GA-class articles under that project (this will start with WikiProject Anime and Manga only).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It uses PyWikipedia Framework. It won't be a server hog because it will be run manually (i.e. only when I tell it to), so instead of patrolling recent changes for hours on end it will simply patrol the categories when told to, probably weekly or every few days.</li>
<li>There are thousands of articles here that need proper sorting, and a bot in my opinion is the best way to do it. In addition, if there is some sort of mistake (i.e. a B-Class article that's currently a stub that gets unlisted as a stub when it shouldn't be), it isn't devastating: a 99% success rate would add far more good than it would bad, and I highly doubt it would have any real failures, unless some fool ran around rating Stubs as B-Class articles. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 10:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I don't see a problem, as long as it's being sponsored by a Wikiproject, and the exact details of what it is going to do are approved here in advance. We don't generally give a "whatever you need it to do" clearance; you tell us specifically what it will do, and we approve that. If you add something, you drop a note here saying what you're adding, and we say yea or nay. I see no problem why it can't have a trial period once it's set up and has a specific list of tasks. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 00:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its not really "sponsored" just yet: I'm asking what people think of it on the WikiProject talk page. So far I've received no disapproval--they've also made suggestions as to what I can and can't do in regards to sorting using the bot. You can find the discussion so far <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Anime_and_manga_ecff.html#New_Bot" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Anime and manga">here</a>. How much approval should I look to get before I set the bot into motion? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 01:09, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><font color="red">Dear God no!!!!</font> You don't seem to realise that stubs and Stub-Class articles are two completely different things! The terminology is admittedly extremely confusing (and the sooner something is done about it, the better). Also you clearly don't understand that length is only a minor consideration when it comes to working out what a stub is. An article swith one line of text followed by a list of 50 examples, or one line of text followed by a large table, is definitely a stub and likely well over 1000 characters. This is why stubs are sorted by hand, rather than by some automated method. Having the bot run in this way could well reverse much of the work of the Stub sorting wikiproject. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:29, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Just for clarity) Hence why I said "as long as it's being sponsored by a Wikiproject, and the exact details of what it is going to do are approved here in advance." My take would be that the Wikiproject people would be quick enough to know what should and shouldn't be done, and that as long as specific changes are set out here before they are done, there is plenty of time for approval. Just saying that for the sake of clarity on my earlier comments. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 01:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have similar concerns to Grutness. The whole concept of a "stub class article" is poorly defined at best: at a deletion discussion on one such category, one WP1.0ist argued to keep them separate specifically on the grounds that "Stub class" is not the same as "stub"; another wanted to keep, on the basis that they were essentially the same. This needs to be much more clearly defined before a bot goes around making sweeping changes based on an assumption one way or the other. I see no evidence of support for this at the indicated Wikiproject, and the following comment sounds like opposition, or at least a reservation, to me: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Anime_and_manga&amp;diff=64391527&amp;oldid=64385585" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Anime_and_manga&amp;diff=64391527&amp;oldid=64385585" rel="nofollow">"It probably should go case-by-case (which I guess isn't what you want to hear for a bot, huh)."</a> I'm especially opposed to stub-tag <i>removal</i> by bot; if a B-grade article is still tagged as a stub, there's clearly been a snafu someplace, since appropriate tagging and categorisation should be <i>required</i> to get it to that standard: much better to detect these by category intersection sorts of report generation, and have someone fix them manually. Stub-tagging might be more reasonable, but again, it's been specifically claimed by one person that some "Stub class" articles are <i>not</i> stubs, so this would require clarification and refinement; it would also have to be done very carefully to make sure that the "Stub class" tag, and the "stub" tag have the same scope by topic, and that no more specific tag applied instead. (For example, doing this to apply a single stub type to the whole of WPJ Albums, or WPJ Military History, would be a disaster.) <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 04:06, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hope nobody minds my ill-informed opinion, but to incorporate Alai's suggestion into the bot sounds like a benefit. Without doing any editing, the bot could see how many articles have been snafu'd in such a manner and generate a report to somebody's userpage. It almost sounds like this should be a generic bot that Project leaders could download and configure for their specific purposes, or you could keep it proprietary and write all those little sub-bots yourself.&#160;;) <a href="../../../x/a/x/User%7EXaxafrad_ba3a.html" title="User:Xaxafrad">Xaxafrad</a> 04:20, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I had been informed by many that stub-class articles and stubs were in fact the same thing, and that anything above a stub-class article could not possibly be a stub. I had also been told that anything under the category "anime and manga stubs" most certainly belongs in Wikiproject Anime and Manga as a stub-class article. So who's right? I'm now getting confused... <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 09:48, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And in addition, wouldn't the most recent assessment of an article always be trusted? It seems as if most of the stub categorization was made months or even years ago, and hundreds of articles are still marked as stubs that have expanded far more since then, and have much higher ratings within the WikiProject. Are you saying that WikiProject ratings are totally useless and cannot be used to justify removing a stub tag? The WikiProject members would disagree. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 10:00, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and also, is there anything wrong with simply having the bot shove all the Anime and Manga Stubs into the Wikiproject? There's a huge number that aren't part of the WikiProject, and nobody seems to have a problem with assigning them to the Project. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 13:03, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If "Stub class article" and "stub" really are the same, then we're back with my original concerns, i.e., why have two sets of categories for the same thing, thereby duplicating work, and causing exactly the sort of inconsistency described? See for example <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Assessment_489f.html#.22Stub_Class.22" title="Wikipedia talk:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment">this discussion</a>, in which the matter is made... well, rather opaque, actually. One claim seems to be that a "long but useless" article would be "Stub class", but not a "stub" (though personally I would say that a textually long article can still be a stub, so even that's far from clear either way). It's possible one implies the other, but not vice versa, for example. No, I'm not saying assessment ratings are totally useless: are you saying stub tags are totally useless? Members of <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_7aa0.html" title="WP:WSS">WP:WSS</a> would disagree. An automated rule that simply <i>assumes</i> which of the two is incorrect is highly problematic, either way. An assessment that ignores the presence of a stub tag is either a) using different criteria for the two, or b) failing to leave the article in a state consistent with said assessment; a <i>person</i> has made them inconsistent, and a <i>person</i> (same or otherwise) should make a judgement as to how to make them consistent. People are stub-tagging things all the time, I see no reliable basis for assuming that the assessment rating is either more reliable, or more recent. I have no objection to the application of WPJ-tags by bot, <i>if</i> the associated WPJ has expressly agreed to the basis this is being done on, in their particular case. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 14:58, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the input, <b>Alai</b>. I've made a revised set of things the bot could do:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Put all "anime and manga stubs" not in WikiProject Anime and Manga into Wikiproject Anime and Manga as Stub-Class. There's no way for the bot to figure out if they deserve a higher rating than Stub-Class, so its fair to start them off there.</li>
<li>For all projects with their own rating system, turn all GA-class articles in those projects that aren't listed as GA or better into GA-class articles under that project (this will start with WikiProject Anime and Manga only). Do the same with FAC articles that aren't listed as FACs under the WikiProject system. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 15:15, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That seems completely fine, no objections to those tasks. Obviously in each case consultation with the wikiproject, and confirmation with them of the scope of the articles they're "adopting" thereby would be indicated. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Seems fine to me as long as there is agrement at the project.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:14, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Before I run the bot, I want to see what Wikipedians think of another idea I had in mind (possibly a second thing the bot can do). How about a routine that checks through Wikipedia articles and fixes redirects: i.e. if an article links to "Blue", when the actual article is "Blue (colour)" and there is a redirect between the two (not a disambig), the original article will be changed to link to "Blue (colour)." The appearance of the page will remain unchanged: only the link in the code will be changed. This would probably slightly lower the load on Wikimedia servers by lowering the number of redirects. In addition, its always struck me as somewhat odd to have articles link to redirects, as redirects make more sense as methods of catching various user-inputted article names and sending them to the right article. This especially applies to older articles that link to a main article which has now been moved. What do you all think? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 19:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Doesn't seem such a good idea to me.

<li>Actually, it's a feature I've been working on quite some time ago. I think that a massive fixup of links on a page is a good idea.
