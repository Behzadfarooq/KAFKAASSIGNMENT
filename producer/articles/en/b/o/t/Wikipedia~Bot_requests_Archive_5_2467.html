<p>Currently, png flag images are being replaced by superior svg versions.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Duplicate link removal</span></h2>
<p>Constantly edited articles, especially current events, are severely susceptible to linking to the same subjects more than once. Subjects linked in an article should be linked only once at usually the first instance of the subject keyword. Is there a bot that performs duplicate link removal? I imagine how the bot would function is first by indexing the links on a page, identifying links that occur more than once, and removing the additional links from the bottom of the article upward. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 19:16, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My citations bot is being rewritten, and logic to recognize several types of duplicate information is part of the tasks to be done. A side effect of the rewrite is that it will be easy to examine all the wikilinks. If nobody else tackles this, remind me in a few weeks or grab the code for parsing WikiSyntax from pywikipedia's standardize_notes.py.

<dd>I think this is a bad idea. If you use the table of contents at the top of an article to jump to a particular section, you would get many linkable topics without any links. Not very useful for navigation. First mention in a section might be a better policy. First mention of a topic only is too strict. Enforcing this policy via bot is too strict. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisRuvolo_1990.html" title="User talk:ChrisRuvolo">t</a>) 14:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well you should take it up with the manual of style, but it is for the reasons you give that software does not do it automatically, and it certainly shouldn't be done with a fully automatic bot. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 14:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't aware of this in the MOS. I just updated <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hairspray_%28movie%29.html" title="Hairspray (movie)">Hairspray_(movie)</a> because Divine was listed in the intro as a link but not elsewhere. Further down the page, there is a list of the cast, where he isn't linked, which looks really strange (because everyone else is linked). Linking only once makes sense but not in an instance like this. --<a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeekybroad_799d.html" title="User:Geekybroad">geekyßroad</a> 01:44, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The manual of style states "a link is repeated in the same article (although there may be case for duplicating an important link that is distant from the previous occurrence)" so i think its quite clear that human judgement is needed before removing additional links. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 01:48, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I used to share your thinking about redundant links, but eventually I came to realize the same thing as Martin above. It makes a lot more sense to make this a one-link-per-section enforcement bot.

<p>Looking over <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">Category:Wikipedia backlog</a>, I notice several perennial backlogs for which a bot may be of assistance. I would like to hear the opinion of people more versed in botting than I am. In particular, I think the Move To Wiktionary/Wikibooks/Meta may be bottable (it probably requires a human doublecheck to see if things are properly tagged, but after that transwiking is still a lot of work and a bot would automatically fill in the transwiki log)</p>

<p>This is probably a stupid point (and a bot may be doing it already), but I noticed on a visit to a random US city that an anon had corrected the infobox to account for an additional hour of difference with UTC after Daylight Saving Time ended.

<dd>Hrm. So it's not just a conversion of an old template to a new one, but changing hardcoded tables.

<dd>As mentioned in Tt:Infobox Country, I'm working on a template extraction bot for the country infoboxes. As a side effect of a new design, that bot will probably be easily extended to understand the structure of the templates so translations between variations of those infoboxes can be done. At present I'm coding the action logic for this specific task as I haven't identified a way to generalize the tasks for more general manipulations.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NowCommons</span></h2>
<p>Hi, A bot for clearing the never-ending backlog at NowCommons is needed to do the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The {{<a href="../../../n/o/w/Template%7ENowCommons_a542.html" title="Template:NowCommons">NowCommons</a>}} on images should be replaced with {{<a href="../../../n/o/w/Template%7ENowCommonsThis_046c.html" title="Template:NowCommonsThis">NowCommonsThis</a>}}, if the image is uploaded to commons with the same name.</li>
<li>It should check whether the file exists on commons.</li>
<li>And whether The entry has proper copyright information on the commons page and proper attribution is given to the uploader/creator and the file history is copied in the case of GFDL'ed images.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the bot can do task 1, that alone would considerably speed up the whole process.

<dd>Funny that you mention it...on es: just last week we did something similar. I wrote a bot that checked all of es:'s images and checked if commons had an image with the same title. If it did, the image description was marked with a template. This not only helped us to find images that we had on es: as well as on commons, it also helped us find images with name conflicts. Ex: "Mango.jpg" on es: and "Mango.jpg" on commons were not the same picture and consequently "mango.jpg" was inaccessible from es:. Humans than came by and confirmed whether they were identical images or they were a problem name, and acted accordingly. I would be more than willing to run this bot on en:, but I don't have a flag...perhaps I could pass the code to a bot operator here?

Here's a list of what we would need (and this would be for all pages that use the Infobox Film template only):</p>
<ul>
<li>movie_language should be changed to language</li>
<li>image caption should be changed to caption</li>
<li>movie_name should be changed to movie</li>
<li>original_score should be changed to music</li>
<li>"awards" field and what ever follows "=" in the template should be removed, same for</li>
<li>"proceeded by" and "followed by" (these were in some old movie templates but are no longer used)</li>

<dd>personally it pisses me off when people "fix" single redirects. it puts trash in my watchlist display and loads of piped links make wikitext harder to read (which is never a good thing). <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 02:07, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. Many such redirects should <i>not</i> be fixed, e.g. <a href="../../../r/e/d/Category%7ERedirects_with_possibilities_4322.html" title="Category:Redirects with possibilities">Category:Redirects with possibilities</a>. A bot to do this for some of the other redirect categories (particularly <a href="../../../r/e/d/Category%7ERedirects_from_misspellings_ef53.html" title="Category:Redirects from misspellings">Category:Redirects from misspellings</a>) might be in order, but certainly not for <i>all</i> redirects. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 02:16, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What would be great is changing links that are already piped, and that point to redirects that are not in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Category%7ERedirects_with_possibilities_4322.html" title="Category:Redirects with possibilities">Category:Redirects with possibilities</a>, to point to the real target article. I have seen and manually fixed a bunch of these, so they seem common enough to deserve a bot. I don't know of any situation in which that would be an undesirable edit (if such a thing was a bot, I believe its edits would not show up on recent-changes pages, which includes watchlists?).</dd>
<dd>If this proposal or a variant of it is okay, I'd like to write the bot to do it (because, e.g., programming is fun). (Is looking at the pywikipedia bots' code and wikipedia.py a right way to go about figuring out how to write a bot? Is there more bot-coding-related documentation somewhere?) —<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Dupree_b6ce.html" title="User:Isaac Dupree">Isaac&#160;Dupree</a><sup><a href="../../../i/s/a/User_talk%7EIsaac_Dupree_1d6b.html" title="User talk:Isaac Dupree">(talk)</a></sup> 21:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still disagree with the idea of a bot changing non-piped links into piped ones. both because it makes the wikitext harder to read and because <a href="../../../r/e/d/Category%7ERedirects_with_possibilities_4322.html" title="Category:Redirects with possibilities">Category:Redirects with possibilities</a> is unlikely to be comprehensive. Chaging known misspellings (don't pipe in this case just replace). Really stupid stuff like linking to one redirect to a page whilst using the title of another and linking to a redirect and titling it with the articles real name would be good to clean up too. Other existing piped links should probablly require manual approval of the change after a human has checked for a pluralisation piping for a redirect with a possibility. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 23:28, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We need to make things clearer; it looks like, e.g., Plugwash thought someone had disagreed with his first comment, when it seems neither Cryptic nor I did. Therefore I present a list of cases that may be considered wiki-editable by anyone, including adding to the list; the analyses presented there should reflect the discussion, though, which may continue after the list. —<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Dupree_b6ce.html" title="User:Isaac Dupree">Isaac&#160;Dupree</a><sup><a href="../../../i/s/a/User_talk%7EIsaac_Dupree_1d6b.html" title="User talk:Isaac Dupree">(talk)</a></sup> 11:33, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To make matters more complicated, the list that I get from "what links here" suddenly got a lot smaller. It appears to be because some of the template references include "template". So, instead of having {{Numismaticnotice}}, lots of pages have {{template:Numismaticnotice }} or sometimes {{Template:Numismaticnotic}}, and unfortunately there may be others slight changes but I don't know. I haven't updated the list, so the one at articles (link above) is still the full list. Is there a bot that can go through those articles and fix them? Or is it a bug? The template looks right on the page.

<dd>If you know a resource which has a lot of the information you need available to the public <i>without copyright</i>, and in a predictable format it might be possible.<br />
For example, you can find just about any movie at <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a> and it will tell you the date released, who is in it, and all sorts of other information. The problem with a resource like <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a> is that the information belongs to <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a> (see <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html#Copyright_issues" title="IMDB">IMDB#Copyright_issues</a>). However, since it sounds like you are after statistics and factoids it might be legal to use a bot to collect this information which you then interpret and enter into wikipedia.<br />
Unfortunately, without a resource which has already organized this information once, it would require a bot of extraordinary abilities to make any sense of the internet and find what you need. I hope I understood your question. --Phil Harnish (<a href="../../../a/m/p/User%7EAmpre_ae73.html" title="User:Ampre">Info</a> | <a href="../../../a/m/p/User_talk%7EAmpre_ec85.html" title="User talk:Ampre">Talk</a>) 08:59, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll give it some thought... But how would one go about this? downloading each file individualy and checking md5sums?

<dd>Thanks, F of N! I tried doing it manually as Orgullomoore suggested; since there are thousands of blocked users and many of them have no edits at all (all edits deleted, or blocked for username violation before they could edit), but since you can't tell that until you look at the contribs, it was unbelievably inefficient.
