<p>Just a question, but on the Bottom Series Two DVD, it says that Holy is the uncensored version. I take it that when originally shown, the BBC had to cut out the section where Richie's finger is sliced off - or is it when Richie is being hanged by the rope during the opening segment? <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatsuyaJounouchi_32f6.html" title="User:KatsuyaJounouchi">KatsuyaJounouchi</a> 15:08, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guest_House_Paradiso_c2bd.html" title="Guest House Paradiso">Guest House Paradiso</a>, their last names are different. Well, Eddie's definitely is, I'm not sure if Richie's is mentioned. Probably more something for the article on the film when it gets written.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Richies name most certainly was mentioned. It was "Twat". That was, like, the running joke in the film, 'cause he keeps trying to get folk to pronounce it "Thwait". Eddies is mentioned in the breakfasat scene, but it's practically fucking unpronouncable.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 15:16, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Richard's name is "Richard Twat" in the film; Eddie's is Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba.--taiq</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for this is likely to be copyright. I would guess that Rik &amp; Ade would need the BBC's permission to use the Bottom chatacters and setting in a film.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 17:25, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you watch Bottom 3: Hooligan's Island, it explains that they had to 'do a runner' after they were caught on Ecsatcy. The program in the DVD case credits Adrian Edmondson as 'Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba' and Rik Mayall as 'Richie Twat'. Maybe they had to change their names? And in response to the BBC's involvement in the changing of the names, Bottom 3 was filmed with BBC money. Strangly enough, in Bottom Live 2003 (The last one), Richies name is Richard Richards again. Continuty error huh? Treen</p>

<p>Here are some things I think should be changed:</p>
<p>"Bottom was a British sitcom" -- it still is!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Nah, it's not being made anymore</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"candles shoved in eyes" -- I can't remember this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>It's in the film</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"penises set on fire" -- I'd argue that it's just the crotch area, not the penis specifically.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Richie refers to the dangers posed by a fire as he is "so well hung". I've never heard of anyone bragging about having a well hung "crotch".</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A number of the mentioned acts of violence only happen once, and shouldn't be plural.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Change it then</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"can play chess (and spends 6 hours trying" -- I remember it as longer.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Change it then</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"he knows a fair amount about Napoleon and Wellington" -- only a few well-known facts are mentioned, that's not a "fair amount".</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>I think that's a fair amount, not exessive, but not ignorant like richie</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"appears well versed in the works of Vivaldi" -- because he recognises Vivaldi's most famous piece?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Compared to the rest of the characters encountered in bottom, yeah, it is.</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Richie's Auntie is very rich and dies in one episode" -- to be completely pedantic about it, she actually dies _before_ the episode...</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Yeah, that is overly pedantic</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Adolf Hitler (the real one, not Eddie's mother)" -- we don't for sure know whether Eddie's mother actually was the real one. Stranger thing have happened! (in Bottom)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>I don't know whether a man giving birth some 10 years after his death is possable even in this reality, but I would like to think it was. Only problem is, try explaining it to someone who's never seen the show.</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Richie's sister lives near Hammersmith and apparently looks just like Richie." -- but has smaller breasts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>What's you point?</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Eddie or other people refering to his last name, Hitler, usually asking if he is related to Adolf Hitler. Which usually causes confusion as Eddie's mother is called Adolf Hitler." -- I can only remember this happening once.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Nah, it happened on a few occasions.</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Richie being very patriotic, usually invoving him saying 'We are English after all'" -- how often does this happen? Once or twice perhaps, not "in most episodes".</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>THEN CHANGE IT.</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Eddie looking at the audience when Richie is talking complete rubbish." -- I can't remember this happening at all. It's rare that either of them break the fourth wall, and I don't think it ever happens as described here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Bollocks! That happens a lot! Honsetly, just take a look</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Richie making fun of Eddie's favourite football team Queens Park Rangers (QPR)." -- Where does this happen?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>I remember a few occasions of this</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"as they often forget their lines and have to ad-lib" -- I've heard it claimed that these ad libs are the same every evening though... Niels E</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>No comment</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these points do not regard things I've written, but never the less, I think they should stand, and if something is so obviously wrong, you don't need to consult the talk page about it, you can just change it.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 22:28, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've edited the opening paragraph where it reads "and later a series of stage shows and a film" to remove the film reference, as it wasn't actually the Bottom film (the title and the characters' names being two major differences from Bottom).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Come on, it certainly WAS a Bottom film. The characters surnames and the setting was changed, true, but the first names (which is all they were ever really called) and their apperances (Eddie's in aprticular) were unchanged. And the setting was changed in the 1997 and 2001 stage shows as well as a few of the episodes (e.g. "Hole"), it was still Bottom. Plus, I remeber is being advertised as "The Bottom Movie" on the DVD case and as "They're Back" on the cinema posters. I agree some distinction should be made from the series though.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 13:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I truly feel that bio pages for both Richie Richards and Edward Hitler should be made for this site. However, I am not the person to do that. Not only do I not have the right to do so, since I am just a contributor and not a registered user, I do not have the knowledge of the two characters that I'm sure others are just filled with. So please, if you are a registered user and knows a lot about Richie or Edward, please make their own bio pages for WIKI. If BIO pages can be made for Amanda Krueger and Barney Gumble (just type there names in the search bar), then the Hammersmith Hardmen deserve one too. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.195.44.152 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.195.44.152.html" title="User talk:71.195.44.152">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.195.44.152_2084.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.195.44.152">contribs</a>).</small></p>
