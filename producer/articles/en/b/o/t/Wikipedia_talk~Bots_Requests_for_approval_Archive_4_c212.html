<h2><span class="mw-headline">Multiple Requests</span></h2>
<p>I have <s>around three</s> four requests for extra tasks on MartinBotII to make, all relating to wikiprojects. To avoid spamming the BRFA page, should I put the the three really simple tasks (which don't edit the mainspace) in one request, and the other (which, at most, involves putting article talk pages in categories, and which runs similarly to MathBot) in another? Or all four together? I'm not sure what the norm is for this - any input appreciated. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 14:29, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll outline them below:
<ol>
<li>Do the same as task 2 on MartinBotII (approved), but for other Wikiprojects (per requests), using exactly the same system, just different message, recipient and opt-out pages</li>
<li>Update the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Trains_Recent_changes_d8d3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains/Recent changes">Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains/Recent changes</a> list of articles by editting sub-pages of that, based on which article talk pages contain the project banner (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Trains/Recent_changes/X&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85661795" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Trains/Recent_changes/X&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85661795" rel="nofollow">diff</a>)</li>
<li>Produce a list of all wikiproject pages for the WikiProject Directory, displaying them in a table <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:MartinBotII/WPStability&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84864894" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:MartinBotII/WPStability&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84864894" rel="nofollow">diff</a> and making a seperate list of new projects <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:MartinBotII/NewWP&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84865124" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:MartinBotII/NewWP&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=84865124" rel="nofollow">diff</a>.</li>

<dd>These are the non-mainspace (talk) edtting tasks, which are fairly simple. All have been fully tested, as shown by the diffs. The other task is for <a href="../../../1/_/_/WP%7E1_e7ae.html" title="WP:1">WP V1.0</a> and does the same sort of thing as MathBot, except that all features aren't yet implemented. The main difference is that, in its tables, it only lists articles which have been rated by a wikiprject and achieve a score based on calculations done by the bot based on the rating and importance of the article. For the tests thus far, all those articles which have achieved the minimum score on the wikiprjects which were tested were put into sub-pages of <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinBotII_WP1.0_450f.html" title="User:MartinBotII/WP1.0">this page</a>. This was only a very limited trial - when approved, the bot will add all the talk pages of all those articles (and images) which meet the requirements to a category - this is the reason that I've isolated this project, along with the potential for a huge number of edits (depending on overall quality of course, but could go into tens of thousands (spread out over weeks). <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 14:49, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for proposed bot review</span></h2>
<p>I have not used or written a WP bot before (except simple read-only for analysis) and I have a couple of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a centralized place for someone to propose (not to request) a bot that doesn't yet exist, to get the equivalent of a pre-implementation design review?</li>
<li>On the assumption that this is the place (for now), my idea is to write a bot (in perl) that can revert in two modes:</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Vandal mode: by looking for specific strings and regular expressions; and</li>
<li>Linkspam mode: by looking for links to web sites that are on a blacklist</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The sites that are 'guarded' would normally be a very small number (like someone's small watch list) and each could have its own custom set of 'typical' vandal strings/regexps, and/or its own set of blacklisted external link sites. All reversions would include Talk page message to the user, would follow 3RR (or less, for safety), would leave clear edit summaries, etc. Of course once a prototype version is available, I plan to bring it here for approval (it would be run in manual mode until bullet proof), but I would appreciate getting preliminary comments prior to investing any serious effort.

<dd>This seems similar to my second bot, which goes after shared IPs and suspicious new users (likely socks) to a watchlist, along with link spam revert ability.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 17:14, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I read the external 'specs' available at your bot page. If it supports specific tools for EL enforcement (by specifiying blacklisted linked sites <i>per article</i>) then I can't find it. If it supports custom regexps for vandal edit detection <i>per article</i> then I can't find that either. Those are the 2 main missions I see for my proposed bots - customization <i>per article</i> for vandal and linkspam protection. My plan is to implement it in perl. Do you, or does anyone else, see a problem with that concept? I know I myself need it as a user, but I don't want to invest the effort in it if it's already done somewhere, or if it violates some fundamental bot rule and has no chance for approval here. Any comments would be appreciated. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:37, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I noted above, the issue for me is not <i>need</i>, as to me personally it would be very useful to have that functionality - it would save me personally lots of menial work, which is what bots are for. I suspect that even if no one else except for me used that bot, it would still 'pay for itself' in time saved, after several months. If anyone else used it, it would be a bonus. But the real reason for my questions here is whether there is some procedural flaw that I am missing, that would preclude this proposed bot from ever being approved here, or whether someone has already built it and I missed it while going over the existing bot list. I am still waiting for an answer to either question. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:49, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Per-article customisation is an interesting idea, and could in theory capture persistent vandalism on a particular article that it's not practical or "safe" to revert in general. I think VoA may well be correct, though, that doing it this way could involve a lot of work, for relatively little benefit, but I don't think that's a basis on which the bot would fail to be approved on (wherein the principle is basically, prevention of bots doing harm). Also bear in mind that for linkspam that should be blacklisted in the general caes, there's <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="m:spam_blacklist">m:spam blacklist</a>, which solves the problem "at source". If you want a more formal answer from the BAG (as against from here in the peanut gallery), you might consider filing an approval request, but specifying that the trial wouldn't begin at once, assuming it wouldn't be an excessively long period to hold the request 'open' for. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 01:53, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the detailed response. Regarding the effort/benefit ratio, I think I can live with that, and the effort is (mostly) one-time, vs. hopefully a long period of benefits. Regarding the linkspam list, I think the issue there is that some linkspam is only posted (persistently) into one article, and I am not sure if it would instantly qualify for the global blacklist, although it may eventually. Regarding the application in a 'hold mode', I think I'll take a chance on the 'peanut gallery', enough to whip up a basic prototype, which I can then submit for approval.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Process streamlining</span></h2>
<p>Sorry, but I still can't figure when to grant access to a bot approved by the committe. Suggest the following setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>User places a request on Page 1. Discussion takes place here.</li>
<li>Committee approves the request, moves the approved transcluded subpage to Page 2</li>
<li>Bureaucrat who has page 2 on his watchlist then comes around granting the flag. Archives the template to page 3.</li>
</ol>

<dd>The approval process has been done readily by Redux and Taxman on numerous occasions without any problems. Perhaps I should explain how a bureaucrat should go about approving bots. When a bot is approved an approvals member places the new entry at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_de2f.html#Approved_Requests" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval#Approved Requests</a>. When you want to know if any bots need work, look there. The page itself is not editted that often except to add and remove (approved or otherwise) requests, so has been sufficient to merely watch the approvals page. I see no compelling reason to change how this works, although if there were enough people who wanted to we could. When a bot requires a flag, it will say so. So all you have to do is to look for something like "bot flag <b>required</b>" and take appropriate action. At that point it is the job of the bureaucrat to ensure that the approval is legitimate and properly sanctioned. The following diffs will show exactly how this is done: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABots%2FRequests_for_approval&amp;diff=91138479&amp;oldid=90989809" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABots%2FRequests_for_approval&amp;diff=91138479&amp;oldid=90989809" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=makebot&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ABot-Schafter" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=makebot&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ABot-Schafter" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The last link to the log shows how the bureaucrat has to manually check the approval to ensure that the approval is valid. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 18:14, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With regards to your suggestion, transcluded subpages generally are only used for the initial approval. Since they are large and take up a lot of space, we only use them for new approvals. New tasks and approved tasks are just linked from the main page. In your example there is no reason to move a transcluded subpage, since once a bot is initially approved or denied, the subpage is then no longer transcluded. I've found that using everyone on one page streamlines the process. When I want to get an overview of what is going on, I have one central page to deal with, rather than a 3 page system. I think you'd find that others would agree. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a></dd>

I've been manually debugging using dummy pages and my admin account, and I believe I am about ready to go from the point of view of having an operational bot.

<dd>I think it should be manually assisted by a human admin. I suppose if it passes the RfA as a bot then it should be valid, but I would not support such and RfA, not if it was not human supervised. Even the best scripts screw up once in a while. But as far as I am concerned, and RfA with full disclosure is as valid as any other, regardless of the operator, human or computer. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 00:59, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would take it to RfA before having a bureaucrat flag it as a sysop. Better to get community input before anything is done. The only problem is that it would probably be opposed...

<dd>After the discussion on the bot approval page concludes (note: I've added a few new questions and comments), I would suggest testing the bot on either another wiki or using user subpages here with example images (that aren't being used anywhere else). Following the test, the bot should then go to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">RfA</a>; it should definitely go through RfA to gain a sysop flag, not only because of the page is where all sysop requests have been placed, but because of the wider participation level there.

<dd>Concur with the above, it needs to go through RFA which so far has proved "challenging".

<dd>Personally, I'm inclined to believe that RFA is actually a bad way to manage/approve bots, since that community is far less attuned to the relevant technical issues than this one, but I don't want to try and make exceptions on my behalf. If people believe that RFA is the necessary thing then that is what I will do. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 21:40, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RFA isn't to approve the bot, it's to approve the admin status. Technically you need both approvals to get an admin bot, assuming an RFA succeeded then approval here is unlikely to fail because there isn't a broader community support for such function, but may still fail if it is considered to have technical gaps which may cause problems (Of course they can mostly be fixed). The bot approval group doesn't have a remit to approve admin status and history has shown that the community as a whole is pretty resistant to the idea. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 22:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd say you would have to go through RFA for the reasons people mentioned such as wider participation, etc. You'll definitely get some less than helpful opposition, but that shouldn't be enough to sink a well thought out proposal. Thinking from the last experience, it seems you'd have a much better chance if you got it fully approved by all members of the BAG first. I think a large part of the last one not succeeding was due to outstanding objections of BAG members. So basically it needs both processes, but you'd have an easier time if there were no unresolved issues here. Add to that having a number of trusted people review the code and you'd have a good shot. My other thought is instead of getting the admin bit, the bot could just maintain a checkpage that tells the current status of the pages that need to be protected for the current day and a list of pages that need to be protected for the next day. A bot would be very valuable for maintaining that list, whether or not it had the admin bit. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:51, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I posted this on AN, but maybe I should say it here too.

<p>MartinBotIII is currently performing a substing exercise on some of RefDeskBot's edits (which used a template which didn't work). I'm posting this here in the interests of openess - there should be no more than 1200 edits, at the throttle of 6 per minute. The bot will then do a very simple text replacement on the pages (after the substing). To make clear, there are some 600 pages, it of which will be edited twice. This is all being done in AWB, but the text replacement is outside of the bot's assigned task, so I'm inviting a BAG member to tell me to get approval, if I need it.

<dd>So basically you'll be making edits like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Computing/2006_December_1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99129708" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Computing/2006_December_1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99129708" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and then replacing 2007 with 2006 and then 2008 with 2007? —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 18:35, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes - exactly. It really just cleaning up the bad template, and fixing RefDeskBot's responsibility. The bot is being monitored, though is in automatic mode (doing substing right now). Will another BRFA be needed for the find-replace feature (I don't want to break any rules in a big way&#160;:)). <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 18:58, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
