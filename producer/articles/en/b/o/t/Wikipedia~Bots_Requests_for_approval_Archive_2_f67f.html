<h2><span class="mw-headline">William Allen Simpson running occasionally as Botryoidal</span></h2>
<p>Reading the instructions, it appears that it should be possible to run the standard py bot under our own name. I've been checking stuff by hand (orphaning templates) every day for the past several weeks that would be helped by a bit of automation. It's not currently a lot of edits per day, and it will be fairly slow as I'll be handling it late nights over dial-up. Any objections (or advice)?</p>

<dd>You need to outline exactly what work you are doing. If this has anything to do with disambiguation templates (or {{2LC}}, {{3LC}}, {{4LC}} etc) then I ask you to discuss any changes at the relevent project talk pages.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 03:06, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Of course, this is exactly the template changes that I've already posted at the relevant talk pages. I'm getting tired of doing them entirely by hand. I'm seeing a lot of repetition, and apparently simple tasks (like mere substitution) are easy to do with standard bot utilities. I won't write any additional code, and will run the utilities "as is" from the repository. Shouldn't affect the performance of this site.</p>

<p>Cannot, as I'm a longtime Unix(1977)/BSD(1983)/Mac(1984)/MacOSX kinda guy. But reading more of the instructions convinced me that it would be prudent to run a separate user. So, I just checked many variants of my name, and almost everything has already been taken by usernames with no edits! (FYI: Botch, Bottom, or Bottomless are still available.) Anyway, I'll try out Botryoidal later.</p>

<p>Gentlefolk, earlier today (middle of night local time) Commander Keene blocked both this (my) User and my new bot <a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotryoidal_61e8.html" title="User:Botryoidal">User:Botryoidal</a>. At the time, I gave up and went to bed. However, I just figured out that I was unblocked:</p>
<ul>
<li>2006-01-20 08:50:36 Commander Keane unblocked User:Botryoidal (collateral damage from blocking of Botryoidal)</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>2006-01-20 08:49:56 Commander Keane unblocked #84338 (collateral damage from blocking of Botryoidal)</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>2006-01-20 08:28:34 Commander Keane blocked "User:Botryoidal" with an expiry time of 24 hours (Unauthorised bot)</li>
</ul>
<p>I followed each and every step listed for starting to use the bot. The bot was run manually, and run throttled. Indeed, I was manually running in alphabetical batches (20-30 or so edits at a time), and had just started 'E' about four (4) minutes before!</p>
<p>The stated rules for administrator block require that</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. "... they are unapproved, doing something the operator didn't say they would do, messing up articles or editing too rapidly."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Certainly the bot wasn't doing anything that I didn't say it would do (it was only doing exactly one edit, and that was what I stated, orphaning a template that I'd <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_January_17&amp;oldid=35490511" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_January_17&amp;oldid=35490511" rel="nofollow">listed at WP:TFD</a>) several days ago.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Certainly the bot wasn't messing up articles. I tested the first edits one file at a time by hand, and I checked each and every batch of edits on my screen before running the next batch. Heck, I'm generally considered a fairly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_January_17&amp;diff=35657841&amp;oldid=35648721" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_January_17&amp;diff=35657841&amp;oldid=35648721" rel="nofollow">careful and cautious</a> "safe pair of hands"!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Certainly the bot wasn't editing too rapidly, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Botryoidal_4104.html" title="Special:Contributions/Botryoidal">Special:Contributions/Botryoidal</a> shows that the edits were throttled to 30 seconds (as required), and run in the slack time (as required).</li>
</ul>
<p>The stated rules for starting the bot say that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"2. New bots should run without a bot flag so people can check what it's doing.</dd>
<dd>"3. Until new bots are accepted as ok they should wait 30-60 seconds between edits."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, how exactly are perfectly performing bots supposed to qualify during their "initial one-week probation" demonstrating they are run responsibly, when an administrator blocks them without any valid reason?</p>

<dd>Botryoidal has not been approved for the one week trial. It was blocked because the operator has not outlined exactly what the bot is doing and why. The operator still has not outlined that. There has already been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29&amp;diff=35581271&amp;oldid=35565572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29&amp;diff=35581271&amp;oldid=35565572" rel="nofollow">a complaint</a> about the types of edits that the bot is doing. The edits need to be discussed before the bot makes any more.

<p>So, you admit you know <b>exactly</b> what the bot is doing! (I didn't think I could possibly have been more clear — in fact, considerably more clear than any other bot request on this list.)</p>
<p>Anybody who looks at that reference will note that it is actually posted several days <b>before the bot existed</b>. So, you <b>personally</b> object to the edits I've been carefully and considerately doing for weeks by hand. Well, I don't think this is the place to re-argue a two week straw poll, that was started because of the flagrant template redirecting and category closing surreptitiously done on New Years Eve <u>by the person you cite</u> (Tedernst), and fairly quickly reverted.</p>

<dd>No one has yet given you approval to run your bot, and therefore it was blocked a day after when no comment was made on whether it was approved or not. I still don't understand what you intend to do with your bot account, since I really don't see your proposal here. Just a lot of complaining. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 03:35, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AllyUnion, please go back to the first paragraph. Orphaning templates. In particular, those I've currently got listed in TfD, or those of mine currently in TfD Holding Cell. Pretty straightforward work I've been doing by hand for weeks.</p>

<p>Now that the templates (proposed, straw polled, survived TfD, and after related CfD of Feb 20) are clearly approved, please set the Bot flag.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Calm down, people; let's get this straightened out without a pile on</span></h3>
<p>The bot flag will not be set until approval for it is given; for this, the bot must pass a week's trial run without raising complaints. At no point did you receive approval for this, either. It may seem thoroughly unwiki, but you have to appreciate that we need to be stringent about what's doing what automated; a bot running out of control could do quite a bit of damage before we noticed and responded.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Accessing the servers for stats</span></h2>
<p>I am not really asking about a bot posting to pages itself (yet) but i run some scripts accessing all Special:Statistics?action=raw pages from Wikimedia servers to automatically create wikisyntax for pages with long statistics tables like <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias" rel="nofollow">1</a>,<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary" rel="nofollow">2</a>,<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikiquote" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikiquote" rel="nofollow">3</a>, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikibooks" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikibooks" rel="nofollow">4</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikinews" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikinews" rel="nofollow">5</a>. I just provide the wiki syntax <a href="http://s23.org/wikistats/" class="external text" title="http://s23.org/wikistats/" rel="nofollow">here</a> though and copy paste manually. My question is now: What time intervals are ok when accessing all those stats pages? What timing can i set my cronjob to without being seen as an annoyance? (when running the scripts to update my local database) and should i think about also posting the result automatically or rather not and just offer people to copy and paste. <a href="../../../m/u/t/User%7EMutante23_566f.html" title="User:Mutante23">Mutante23</a> 20:39, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am the admin of Czech Wikipedia and my main activity here on English is doing interwiki links. I run the multi-purpose robot on cs.wiki. I'd like to enable the robot doing interwiki to czech articles.</p>

<p>Per <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html#PorthosBot" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">wikipedia talk:bots#PorthosBot</a> (and other talk linked from there) I think it is clear:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorthosBot_4ac2.html" title="User:PorthosBot">PorthosBot</a> should immediately be de-flagged at en:wikipedia,</li>
<li>... so that this bot approval request can be assessed on its own merits.</li>
</ol>
<p>For my own opinion (in the "assessment of bot merits" meaning):</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably the interwiki-linking jobs of the bot are by themselves not problematic, but the bot operator should address issues, e.g. the issue mentioned at <a href="../../../p/o/r/User_talk%7EPorthosBot_a9b5.html#Incorrect_addition_of_interlanguage_links" title="User talk:PorthosBot">user talk:PorthosBot#Incorrect addition of interlanguage links</a>;</li>
<li>I hope communication in English isn't a problem... as mentioned by Rob above Zirland apparently didn't yet really understand implementation of current <i>bot policy</i> at <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOTS_070f.html#Current_policy_on_running_bots" title="WP:BOTS">WP:BOTS#Current policy on running bots</a>.</li>

<li>The templates thus posted are not in template namespace (e.g.: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lukobe&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42463027" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lukobe&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42463027" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), so: unnecessary overhead

<li>Suppose your project has an average of 100 contributors soon; A year later the wikipedia databases contain approx. 5000 times this string:<br />
==[[&lt;pagename&gt;]] won!== &lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 0 10%;"&gt; {| class="notice noprint" id="{{{id}}}" style="background: #ffccFF; border: 1px solid #ff33FF; margin: 0 auto;" |- | [[Image:Aidlogo.png|none|50px| ]] | Thank you for your support of the '''[[Wikipedia:Article Improvement Drive|Article Improvement Drive]]'''.&lt;br&gt;This week '''[[&lt;pagename&gt;]]''' was selected to be improved to [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured article]] [[Wikipedia:What is a featured article|status]].&lt;br&gt;Hope you can help… |} &lt;/div&gt;<br />
— i.e. approx. 5000 times over 200 characters (didn't count); it's possible to do the same requiring less than 10% of these resources, by typing the above in a template <i>once</i> (replacing &lt;pagename&gt; by {{{1}}}), so the database only has to digest 5000 times a string of this length: {{AIDnotif|&lt;pagename&gt;}}.<br />
Note that even then I don't think this a good idea. Afaik, all projects sending out invitations on user talk pages <i>by bot</i> stopped doing that (the last project I knew in this sense was Esperanza). --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 17:25, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point! Didn't remember of that. If we decide that it's OK to leave messages on talk pages, I'll make the new template and use it. And the decission whether to leave messages on talk pages will be made somewhere else. I myself don't plan on entering that discussion, I'm interested just in the result of the discussion, so I know how to program my bot. I'll inform the people on AID project to discuss that. For now, I'm dropping all of the features of the bot that are disputable, so we can use the features which are not disputable. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 18:41, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The bot adds non-content (or "project-related") templates to articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roma_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42461727" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roma_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42461727" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roma_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42461727</a> — whether or not such templates are desired in article namespace, should not be decided by a vote on the <i>bot</i> performing these changes: I mean: it is questionable whether such templates are called for in article namespace: I'm merely saying the discussion about these does not have to take place here, on the talk page of the "bots" page. Maybe there was some prior discussion (and <i>approval</i>) of the use of the {{<a href="../../../a/i/d/Template%7EAIDcur_0609.html" title="Template:AIDcur">AIDcur</a>}} template, if that is the case: please give a link where such discussion was concluded.

<dd>(PS by <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 12:09, 7 March 2006 (UTC):) until such approval is a fact, I suppose:
<ul>
<li>Such templates should only occur in <i>talk</i> namespace, like templates of similar initiatives, see <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Talk_namespace_0fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Talk namespace">Wikipedia:Template messages/Talk namespace</a></li>
<li>The model of the template should better conform to the generic template shown at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Talk_namespace_0fb1.html#WikiProject_generic_notice" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Talk namespace">Wikipedia:Template messages/Talk namespace#WikiProject generic notice</a>, i.e. {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProjectNotice_8601.html" title="Template:WikiProjectNotice">WikiProjectNotice</a>}}</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The bot was formed on rules which exist on AID (you can see those <a href="../../../a/i/d/WP%7EAID_M_8bf5.html" title="WP:AID/M">here</a>). This bot <b>just does what was previously done by hand</b>. Therefore, this is not the place to discuss such policies. If you do not approve this bot, the templates will be added by hand, as they have been for last few months. This bot does not impose new rules, it just automates the old ones. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 13:27, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"rules which exist on AID" — but apparently as rules for a small-scale project. You indicate yourself the project has grown quite a bit. Apart from the question whether the involved tasks need to be <i>automated</i>, the question whether it is a good idea to have AID as a <i>large scale project</i> needs to be answered too. Not on this page, as we both agree. But apparently the question wasn't answered elsewhere either (as you don't give a link to such discussion with conclusive decision - note that I didn't ask you to give a link to the page with the <i>rules</i>, but a link to the place(s) where it was decided that there is <i>broad community approval</i> of the mode of operation of the project). I don't see the need to give permission for <i>bot automatisation</i> as long as the other question isn't answered<br />
Apart from that, I don't think it a good idea to have templates like {{<a href="../../../a/i/d/Template%7EAIDcur_0609.html" title="Template:AIDcur">AIDcur</a>}} in <i>article namespace</i>, per <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">wikipedia:avoid self-references</a>. And even less when a bot would be given permission to place such templates in article namespace. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 17:25, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>As we agreed, this is not the place to discuss that, so I'll do the following: drop that feature untill the thing is discussed somewhere else. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 18:41, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The AID project is only one (of many) projects on article improvement: I don't say this project is necessarily worse or better than the other projects/initiatives, but maybe it shouldn't have a competitive advantage by being served by a bot (yet). The discussion about the various article improvement initiatives should take place elsewhere, not here on the bot talk page, IMHO. Was there any prior discussion (e.g.) in village pump? announced at RfC? etc... --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 11:24, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This project has currently 73 nominations. Every nomination has to be checked at least once a day (preferably every 6 hours). To check the nomination you have to count the votes, detect the anonymous ones, remove expired nominations and update header information on nominations. This is a tremendous amount of work, tremendous enough to make me learn python and learn how to write a bot withouth any how-tos. I insist that this project will colapse under it's own weight if this bot is suspended as the number of people willing to check the nominations is very small and shrinking. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 13:27, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I made no objections to that part of the bot operation, did I?
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I misinterpreted you. I felt that "<i>it shouldn't have a competitive advantage by being served by a bot</i>" was an objection. If it isn't, then everything's cool! --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 18:41, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I objected to the <i>serialized talk page posts</i> and to the <i>namespace where the bot places the AIDcur template</i>. I didn't see you would be prepared to modify your bot on these two points (well, are you?). I think it a bit curious I had to find out about these operations myself (you didn't mention them on the bot's talk page, apart from using the word "rollover", which I didn't know implied all that), so for the time being I'd disable these two operations of the bot (that is: <i>the posting of invitations on user talk pages</i>, and the <i>posting of a project template in article namespace instead of in talk namespace</i>). Unless these objections can be taken into account (or remedied by proof of wide community acceptance), <i>separately</i> from the project page check &amp; update functionality (which I don't object to), I'm opposed to the bot as a whole. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 17:25, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Objection taken in account, the two disputed features dropped utill consensus on those is reached.

<dd>I coded the bot from the ground up and I know precisely why it's messing up. It's called debugging.

<li>No, "clueless" included being clueless about wikisyntax for <i>image</i> tags; and in general that the bot messes with things between double square brackets, which is a completely different thing than doing spelling corrections in text outside double square brackets.<br />
Re. "debugging": not if it disturbs wikipedia: if your bot needs that kind of debugging, please contact MediaWiki developers and ask if they can provide an alpha or beta testrun environment for your new software. Until it tests positively (which it apparently does not do yet) it should not be used on life wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 09:21, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This bot activity must be suspended. First of all, you need a seperate bot account. Secondly you need to discuss why the bot has been making these errors that Francis Schonken indicated.

<dd>But <b>June 21</b> wasn't linked, it was already bold! The edit summary and comment make no sense. Of course, robots should not de-link dates, so there's nothing to stop!
<dl>
<dd>YOu are quite right that June 21 was already bold. Virtually every other day of the year page was self linked, this one had been unlinked by an anon. And yes the decision was on a talk page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Days_of_the_year_240f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Days of the year">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Days of the year</a>, in a discussion in which I was involved, and I'm sure that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Days_of_the_year_996b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Days of the year">Wikipedia:WikiProject Days of the year</a> doesn't have the same force as Policy or MoS. But it is really a rather specialised area to go onto an already bloated MoS. In terms of maintaining this style it is not unusual for either users or bots to delink and bold this per the normal procedure, which results in minor breakage. I have been through the entire year manually correcting it, very recently, and already some have been changed back by well inteniotned people or bots. People can be dissuaded with a comment, bots can't. Hence the solution adopted. If there's a better one almost certainly there is) I would be happy to adopt that. And if necessary I will edit all the 368+ date pages manually to implement it! <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 13:20 <a href="../../../2/6/_/26_March_04e7.html" title="26 March">26 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).

<dd>Would that be "at bot speed" and/or "using a (semi-)bot like AWB or other"?</dd>
<dd>I think the last sentence of your retort particularly <i>nasty</i>: it sounds like a declaration you'd rather start a revert war over this, than applying wikipedia consensus-seeking processes. Apparently the decisions taken at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Days_of_the_year_240f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Days of the year">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Days of the year</a> haven't reached a <i>broad consensus</i> yet – otherwise other people wouldn't object to it so strongly. So I'd suggest you work on <i>finding</i> such consensus, e.g. publicizing in <a href="../../../c/u/r/Wikipedia%7ECurrent_surveys_7ea5.html" title="Wikipedia:Current surveys">wikipedia:current surveys</a> or in Village Pump that you think the "Days of the year" WikiProject has developed some "best practice" recommendations, you'd like to see accepted by the community.</dd>
<dd>Unless finding such consensus, I don't think the issue re. SmackBot can be considered to have been properly addressed. If you stick to the "whatever happens I'll implement it" this is a belligerent attitude that might get you in trouble sooner or later (just drawing your attention that we're not only speaking about the <i>bot</i> account any more in that case, so this discussion would have to move to another page).</dd>
<dd>Just as a side note regarding the solution you defend: there are strong feelings by some wikipedians against including HTML commentary tags in wikipedia pages. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 16:33, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have to agree with the original request for removal of the bot flag. The flag was approved without any explanation from Rich Farmbrough as to what his bot was actually going to do, it was just a very vague request to be able to automate things which were tedious to do manually. That's not a request that should ever be honored. And the removing of date links does not have consensus. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:33, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not removing date links, just links to months and days of the week. If anyone thinks they should stay linked, please say so and I'll stop. (I had a request to delink years associated with months, which I turned down for precisely that reason.) In general you can stop SmackBot any time, using the Big Red Button (tm) on the user page. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 23:18 <a href="../../../2/7/_/27_March_06c1.html" title="27 March">27 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also must reluctantly support removing Smackbot's flag status. I made <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html#Smackbot_grammar_changes" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">two specific complaints</a> about Smackbot edits a couple weeks ago and received absolutely no reply from Rich. I support most of what Smackbot does, but Rich is a bit too liberal with his use of Smackbot and he seems unwilling to engage in discussion. Such behavior seems irresponsible to me. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 02:01, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I replied to almost every other post to my talk page. And I didn't miss you out for any unkind reason - I wrote a reply, but it never got posted - I don't know whether it was a browser crash or WP problems - my apologies for that. Nonetheless I'll talk to anyone, me, and often have. I'll also try to discuss, understand and explain, and will change my behaviour to accomodate others - viz slowing down, avoiding certain groups of pages, reverting or redoing, generating lists of problem pages, helping with tricky markup, adding a stop button. On the other hand this whole thing was kicked off by a user who hasn't replied to my messages, who has made misleading representations, and posted them on various admin pages without contacting me first - and has caused me (perhaps foolishly) to spend a lot of valuable time defending myself (on the other hand it's all a good learning...). Cest la vie. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 23:03 <a href="../../../2/8/_/28_March_a606.html" title="28 March">28 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<p>I'd agree to a go-ahead as a <i>de-flagged</i> bot. Following Zoe's reasoning above, I'd say either make this a "various tasks" AWB bot (in that case not bot-flagged); or a <i>flagged</i> bot, but then only if positive after a new <i>approval request</i> on the basis of one or a few precisely described tasks, and new approval requests if new types of tasks are added to that.</p>
<p>Rich, is that a choice you want to make? Or am I too narrow-minded here? --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 15:20, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a good deal closer. What I would suggest is leave it flagged, and I will look for approval for each task of over 100 edits. This is the way my thinking has been going with bots anyway, especially with the new streamline approval process. It won't impact single task bots, but blanket approval is a little bit OOT, anyway. What do the approvals group think? <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 00:47 <a href="../../../3/0/_/30_March_dc9b.html" title="30 March">30 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<p>To be honest, I've seen a lot of concerns raised above and I'm uncomfortable for this bot to retain a flag. I'd be open to Rich making some changes and sorting out problems (as he seems willing to do) and then approving another trial run, i.e. starting afresh; what do the others think? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Church</a> 01:28, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Was SmackBot de-flagged? (I don't know where to check that) – there appears to be pretty good consensus in this section (Zoe, Kaldari, Rob, myself,...) that this bot should be deflagged. Was that done?</li>
<li>SmackBot is "active" again (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bots&amp;curid=140123&amp;diff=46092284&amp;oldid=45978835" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bots&amp;curid=140123&amp;diff=46092284&amp;oldid=45978835" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>), just realised the bot was unblocked a few days ago, with a rather mysterious unblock message ("I'm an idiot, unblocking actual username") <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ASmackBot" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ASmackBot" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> - is SmackBot an "actual username", then it should be <b>non-botflag</b>, of course.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I asked the admin who blocked it to unblock, rather than some random admin. That admin simply "unblocked" "User:SmackBot" (i.e. User:User:SmackBot in error, before unblocking the "actual user name". Hence the comment. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 19:22 <a href="../../../3/0/_/30_March_dc9b.html" title="30 March">30 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<li>Don't agree SmackBot changing "<a href="../../../f/r/%C3%A9/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin_d24f.html" title="Frédéric Chopin">Chopin</a>'s" to "<a href="../../../f/r/%C3%A9/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin_d24f.html" title="Frédéric Chopin">Chopin's</a>" in the Claude Debussy article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claude_Debussy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45852083" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claude_Debussy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45852083" rel="nofollow">diff</a> - this was done 13:17, 28 March 2006).

<ul>
<li>"100 edits" rule proposed by Rich is one of the most nonsensical things I ever heard. A bot should not do a <i>single</i> contentious edit under a bot flag. It's specifically the small tasks, in the contentious/non contentious border zone for which no bot flag should be applied. These should be done as ordinary logged-in user, and not at bot speed (so that they are easier to <b>detect</b> and one gets a user-user interaction in case of disagreement, not a <i>user</i> vs. a <i>"I have permission to do this"</i> bot operator).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes your right about this ("these should be done as ordinary logged in user"). Maybe it's me but "one of the most nonsensical things I ever heard" is not perhaps the most tactful way of putting it. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 19:54 <a href="../../../3/0/_/30_March_dc9b.html" title="30 March">30 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<li>So I don't think SmackBot should do a *single* edit any more, until de-flagged or having acquired an approval on the basis of a *new* bot request.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tawkerbot (1) Fair Use Rationale Request Request</span></h2>
<p>This is a request for approval for an addition to <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawkerbot_3082.html" title="User:Tawkerbot">Tawkerbot</a>'s work (as the bot is idle right now)</p>
<p>The bot would leave a friendly message on an fair use image uploader's talk page to kindly leave a fair use rationale for the image.</p>
<p>It would essentially</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab a category of fair use images</li>
<li>Use a regex to see if the worlds "rationale" or "fair use" do not appear (outside of the template)</li>
<li>Post a message on the image uploader's talk page requesting that they rationalize the image. This could be done for all uploaders of an image or just the first one.</li>
</ol>
<p>I haven't seen anything that does it specifically and it might get us a little more than the 0.5% of images with fair use rationales. -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 15:39, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that most people don't understand fair use, and rationales are likely to be copy-and-pasted from some other image, leading to situations like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_Portugal_1772.html" title="List of Presidents of Portugal">List of Presidents of Portugal</a> where the "rationales" for the images claimed that the photos showed "how the event depicted was very historically significant to the general public", when most of them were random portraits. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 20:53, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Essentially I was planning on just looking for the words "rationale" and "fair use" not in the template category. It wouldn't be perfect but it would be better than nothing. What I'm thinking is a "fair use rationale help page" which would have examples etc, essentially a template that the bot would subst in.

<dd>Certainly it would be useful to create a list. Perhaps a a database scan would be better. Then I think the License Cleeanup project (or whatever it's called) should be asked to suggest the next step. Clearly we would like proper rationale on each page, but even asking the uploader for a rationale would show good faith. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 13:09 <a href="../../../2/9/_/29_March_accf.html" title="29 March">29 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<p>I'd like to see a pledge to eliminate too many false positives; also, please be aware that if this starts accelerating copy-pasting of fair use rationales as noted above, then it will need to stop. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Church</a> 00:50, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support this request, but I'd like this to generate a list of all images where the user was warned, if at all possible, so that users could watch for bad rationales. This could be easily achieved with one list linking to all images warned; in this way, the "related changes" special page could be utilized.

<dd>I dunno... If an image is fair-use and the template explains exactly why it's fair use, what further explanation is needed? (for instance, corporate logos... the template explains why fair use is used and when it's appropriate.)

<p>Please be aware that this Wikipedia has a policy against automated spelling correction bots which run unsupervised.

<p>I when he says "fix typos" he is referring to bypassing redirects tagged with {{<a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_misspelling_906c.html" title="Template:R from misspelling">R from misspelling</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_title_without_diacritics_10ca.html" title="Template:R from title without diacritics">R from title without diacritics</a>}}, and other redirects that involve decidedly non-ambiguous typographical errors. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><tt>[[José Canseco]]</tt> should always be changed to <tt>[[José Canseco]]</tt></dd>
</dl>
<p>The entire link text should be replaced, and <b>never</b> piped as <tt>[[José Canseco|José Canseco]]</tt> as this would remove the referring page from <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Jos%C3%A9_Canseco_e951.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/José Canseco">Special:Whatlinkshere/José Canseco</a> but keep the typographical error visible to the reader.

<p>No reason to object, obviously, but do you think you could easily peruse the article's history (not every edit, just the last edit of each month), searching for the relevant tag in the wikitext, to determine which month the template was actually added, rather than dating them all to the current month?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">CatHeadBot</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to run User:BmearnsCatHeadBot as an automated bot which will scan certain wikiproject related categories and "what links here" for related templates, and make sure that they are in synch. For instance, all articles in Category:WikiProject Musicians articles are supposed to have <a href="../../../m/u/s/Template%7EMusician_6c95.html" title="Template:Musician">Template:Musician</a> as a talk header on the article's talk page according to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Musicians_c847.html#Adding_articles" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians">WikiProject Musicians</a> guidelines. This bot will be using the Pywikipedia python library, and will only be run periodically. It will not automatically update anything without user input, instead it will compile a list of conflicts, and await further instructions on which of those pages to update. <b><a href="../../../b/m/e/User_talk%7EBmearns_89f8.html" title="User talk:Bmearns"><span style="color:green">B.</span></a><a href="../../../b/m/e/User%7EBmearns_0c69.html" title="User:Bmearns"><span style="color:navy">Mearns</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bmearns_15b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bmearns"><sup style="color:red">*</sup></a></b>, <tt style="color:pink">KSC</tt> 15:01, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I posted this request a week ago, and haven't heard anything. I'm a little confused about whether or not I was supposed to create a user page for the bot before or after approval, but I haven't done so yet.

<dd>Shouldn't these categories be confined only to the talk page anyway?

<dd>Compiling a list is not a bot job, either a database query or simply getting the two lists manually (AWB makes lists from what links here and categories easily) and then comparing them would be all round a much better solution. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 13:39, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well the idea was that the bot compiles the list, and then asks for feedback from the user on which pages should be fixed, and which shouldn't be, and then fixes the appropriate pages. It <b>could</b> be <i>all</i> automated, but that would make the bot a little dangerous in my opinion. For instance, the project page includes the template as an example, but it's not on the talk page. I don't want the bot changing that, so it tkaes some feedback so I can indicate not to "fix" that instance. <b><a href="../../../b/m/e/User_talk%7EBmearns_89f8.html" title="User talk:Bmearns"><span style="color:green">B.</span></a><a href="../../../b/m/e/User%7EBmearns_0c69.html" title="User:Bmearns"><span style="color:navy">Mearns</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bmearns_15b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bmearns"><sup style="color:red">*</sup></a></b>, <tt style="color:pink">KSC</tt> 14:34, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cydebot</span></h2>
<p>I would like permission to get <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECydebot_38a6.html" title="User:Cydebot">Cydebot</a> (<a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECydebot_35fe.html" title="User talk:Cydebot">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cydebot_474d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cydebot">contribs</a>) a bot flag. In the beginning I will run him manually, but in the future I hope to eventually have the task be fully automated. As for what the bot actually does ... I think I'll let Cydebot speak for himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am written using the pywikipedia framework. My sole goal thus far is to examine a day's block log, sniff out the indefinite blocks, parse the block reason, and if it is a username block, add {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlocked_b445.html" title="Template:UsernameBlocked">UsernameBlocked</a>}} to their talk page and {{Indefblocked-username}} to their userpage (if they aren't already there). I feel that this will be helpful because many users end up getting blocked but they do not know why, and although human administrators may be good at sniffing out the bad names, they aren't so good about always about leaving a message explaining the block. My reliable robotic nature will help me to overcome these human limitations. I am manually run for now, but eventually I expect to do my work automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this bot is important enough to justify receiving bot status because of the following rationale:</p>
<ol>
<li>In any given day, dozens, if not hundreds, of new user accounts are indefinitely blocked because of their name.</li>
<li>Very few, if any, are tagged with any sort of rationale. The only rationale is a cryptic "user..." block reason in the block log; newcomers aren't going to know what that means.</li>
<li>Some of the accounts being blocked are legitimate good faith attempts by newcomers.</li>
<li>We don't want to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite the newbies</a> and indefinitely block their accounts without a stated reason because that makes it very unlikely they will stick around and actually help the project.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, for non-username blocks, Cydebot will just leave the standard indef-blocked template.</p>

<p>Would like to submit <a href="../../../q/o/v/User%7EQovulwBot_fb4a.html" title="User:QovulwBot">QovulwBot</a> for approval or for a trial.</p>
<p>This is an automatic bot that will run through a list of 50-100 Wikipedia pages (for now 50-100, more after initial testing) pre-chosen by myself from a google search of wikipedia.org. It will search for these phrases (to be expanded later to the form the University &lt;verb&gt;)&#160;:</p>
<p>the University will</p>
<p>the University offers</p>
<p>the Univesrity is</p>
<p>the University does</p>
<p>and it will change them by making the capitalized 'U' into a lowercase 'u' per the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Institutions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Institutions</a>. It will run no faster than one edit per forty seconds and will terminate as soon as it exhausts all of the pages I give it to search.</p>
<p>QovulwBot is run on Python with the pywikipedia framework .</p>
<p>I realize this isn't the most <i>important</i> bot in some senses but it still does a viable service for en.wikipedia.org by correcting an infraction of the Manual of Style. Also, I think that this type of formatting will very rarely, <i>if ever</i> edit a false positive because of the rarity of such a false positive.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure if I understand the problem. If the page on the Esperanto wiki is not "corrected" enough for it to be moved to article space, we shouldn't be linking to it from other languages yet.

<p>Since I haven't heard anything yet, I put up some more example edits using some additional "spelling data". see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NedBot_ace3.html" title="Special:Contributions/NedBot">Special:Contributions/NedBot</a>. Also, I plan on making these replacement parameters apart of an open discussion on <a href="../../../d/i/g/WP%7EDIGI_48fe.html" title="WP:DIGI">WP:DIGI</a>, so the whole WikiProject will be able to get input to what terms, character names, etc that the bot will look for and replace.

<p>Still no word.. I'd like to rephrase my request a bit if that helps:</p>
<p>I went ahead and ran the bot on a good number of edits (each edit was manually assisted by myself). After a few hundred edits the bot ran without incident. Some of the basic text replacements it did involved: link correction, adhering to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a>, disambiguation link repair, formatting corrections established by <a href="../../../d/i/g/WP%7EDIGI_48fe.html" title="WP:DIGI">WP:DIGI</a>, and fictional character name typos. After doing so, I realized that in reality the usage of the bot will most likely be 1 - 3 hours, 2 or 3 days a week, which is less than I originally anticipated. The more of these basic edits the bot does, the less frequently it will be run. I imagine that in a month it will be ran maybe once a week, unless it's needed to help with some new layout decision by the Digimon WikiProject. Furthermore, the edits, types of edits, and any possible issues will be openly discussed with the WikiProject, allowing even more "eyes and ears" to make sure nothing bad happens.</p>
<p>I understand that there is reluctancy to approve a bot to work on articles that are border-line notable. However, as I pointed out before, allowing the bot to handle these minor things will allow the WikiProject to focus on more important matters, such as how to reduce the numbers and make the articles appropriate for Wikipedia. In addition, similar articles have even become <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Feature articles</a>, such as Pokemon's <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a>.</p>
<p>If there are no objections, I'd greatly appreciate NedBot being fully approved. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 07:25, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds good, assuming that the links with the colon are, in fact, broken, which I assume they are. If there were many more than your estimate, I'd just as soon suggest just asking the devs to have the mediawiki parser honor either syntax, similarly to the way dates are accepted either with, or without, a comma. But if it's as few as you say, and if the devs have better things to worry about, go right ahead, thanks. — <small>Apr. 20, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[17:24] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt></dd>

The bot have now gone through all relevant articles and fixed what it can but will be needed to run when new articles are created.</p>

<dd>All articles that are sub categorised from the Fish category is updated now with the current capability of the bot, but I will run the bot again every month or so to catch up with new articles. I have a plan to update the bot in the future to handle not only genera but the higher levels as family and order. I also plan to change the various types of fishbase links we have now into using the fishbase template and move them to the reference sections instead of the external links sectiosn where they are most of the time currently. I also have an idea to put the conservation status in the taxoboxes automatically(not sure if it is possible yet). But all these are long term plans. The point is that according to the rules I now run my bot to fast, since there are so many articles to scan, I must do that or it would take days to complete a total scan of all fish articles, now it takes a few hours, which is acceptable&#160;:-). What I am asking for is permission to run the bot at high speed, and I think the only way to get that permission is to get a bot flag!

<p>Hi, I ran this 'bot initially to create up to <s>432</s> 342 stubs such as <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrondissement_of_Abbeville_1c04.html" title="Arrondissement of Abbeville">Arrondissement_of_Abbeville</a>. Subsequently, I rewrote it in Spanish to create e.g. <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distrito_de_Abbeville#Comunas" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distrito_de_Abbeville#Comunas" rel="nofollow">Abbeville on es.wiki</a> incorporating some improvements - specifically formatting the commune info as a table rather than as the list format of the original. I'm now proposing running a version of the 'bot to read the English articles and convert their commune info to tables from lists. This was requested by several editors and I feel it would both save space and improve readability. Other advantages are that it will use a standard table template (better for maintainability) and I can do the es and fr interwikis (if they don't already exist) at the same time. It's using the pywiki framework and I suggest running at 2 edits/min max. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 15:57, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the feedback. I created these articles back last December and this is just a proposed enhancement (add postal code to commune). I'll certainly take a look at making the edits you suggest - probably relatively straightforward but I'll need to revist the code to be sure. There's no problem with generating the data - I've downloaded it from INSEE to a local database and massage it with Java. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></dd>

<dd>The bulk of these are now complete. There are 26 articles where the 'bot found Commune lists other than it was expecting - I'll need to look at those by hand. At least some of these are where editors have (rightly or wrongly) changed the lists, and I'll need to go back to INSEE to resolve. All in all, ended up more complex than I was expecting but a side benefit is that the commune order now follows a Unicode sort order. Once I've done this, I'll implement <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" title="User:Freakofnurture">user:freakofnurture</a>'s suggestions. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 17:05, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Werdnabot expansion (User-talk archival)</span></h2>
<p>Hi there. I've just written and tested a module for Werdnabot that will manage user talk pages for the user (the service is opt-in, and based on the user placing a template on their page). Currently, the proposal is that a user can place {{<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdnabot_Archiver_Template_f7a2.html" title="User:Werdnabot/Archiver/Template">User:Werdnabot/Archiver/Template</a>}} on their User talk page (or any other page), and Werdnabot will, at regular intervals, check for sections that are dated, do not contain &lt;!--Werdnabot-Noarchive--&gt;, and had a last post more than a user-specified age in days old, and archive these sections to a specified page. An example of this can be seen in this log entry for Werdnabot:</p>

<li>This doesn't comment one bit on the merit of the bot proposal. Since this suggested bot would actually help the encyclopedia by clearing out the Template: namespace, I can't exactly see why you think I should just go "edit the encyclopedia for a change". Frankly, that's kind of insulting. Guess what, I <i>do</i> edit the encyclopedia (check my edit counts). The thing is, we have thousands of editors working on the encyclopedia and not a single one working on cleaning up the Template: namespace ... so it's kind of obvious how I'm going to decide to prioritize my time. And once the bot is up and running it's not going to take a large time investment anyway; it's just taking time right now dealing with opposition from you and other people. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>Cyde&#160;Weys</b></span></font></a> 16:19, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I took up your invitation: less than a third of your edits are in article space. You're more interested in the community side of Wikipedia than in the encyclopaedia. Anything that doesn't strike at the root cause of userboxes is shit-stirring. If you really want to stop people putting userboxes on their pages then ask yourself why they put them there in the first place. I think it's just to make their pages look pretty. If you removed the prettyness (someone made a good suggestion on Jimbo's talk page a while back that proposed a purely text version) then userboxes wouldn't be half as attractive, and might waste away. In fact, if you really want people to concentrate their minds, then why not propose that all images are banned from every page but mainspace and image space. Userboxes would lose their pretty images because images would be banned in template space; userboxes usage would die away; voila. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 17:25, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To clarify, I "opposed" the suggested approval for the bot because of the massive controversy surrounding the bot.

Make one which follows a community approved policy and I will agree with it, ie. subst userboxes which have been through TfD before deletion.

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b> From the way you initially formulated your request it sounded quite alot like a bot meant to subst (almost) all userboxes, in preparation to delete them. There is no policy and certainly no consesus to do that, and using a bot to do it would only further pour oil into the fire. Should this bot only be used on Boxes with consensus to delete on TfD, my vote would become a weak support (though you should be aware that any glitches would draw alot of flak from userbox supporters)<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharonX_e9a8.html" title="User:CharonX">CharonX</a> 20:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really only have one question about the bot. Would it create the days one at a time, say... 10 minutes before the day, or would it create several at a time...

<dd>It currently creates 10 categories at time (or any other number).

<li>No reason why this can't be done semi-automatically, with supervised use of AWB, either under your normal account, or a special-purpose one, if you want your edit count to remain unbloated.

<p>I have bot permission for <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefanBot_34f7.html" title="User:StefanBot">User:StefanBot</a> and would now like to add functionality to add conservation status in the taxoboxes, (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_7339.html#What_to_include_in_reference_section" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life">discussion at project Tree of life</a> ) I assume that I have to ask for permission again?

<dd>Basically, to start, it's going to be just manually doing a find-and-replace of text with AutoWikiBrowser (the links at the bottom of every article need to be fixed every week), as well as archiving old stories by adding a category to them. It might also help with manual page moves, but that's not my concern right now. Hopefully, I'll eventually write an extension that will take in the article names and make the appropriate actions itself, including updating the main <i>Signpost</i> page and all sub-pages- it's quite a simplistic task manually, and wouldn't be too taxing for a bot. In any event, the <b>only</b> task it would handle as of this approval is <i>Signpost</i>-related materials- it would not venture into the mainspace, nor would it take any other tasks without me making another request somewhere down the line. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 14:33, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorglbot_114a.html" title="User:Zorglbot">Zorglbot</a>: rotate copyright problems pages</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to use a bot to rotate the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">copyright problems</a> pages. This means 3 edits per day, at or around 0:00 UTC: one to create a new page for the day (with a template containing instructions on how to list pages there, and a new section), one to add it to the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_NewListings_c6d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems/NewListings">new listing</a> page, and one to archive entries from the new listing that are older than 7 days. This was previously done by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_%27bot_00ba.html" title="User:Uncle G's 'bot">User:Uncle G's 'bot</a>, but he (and Uncle G himself) have not been active in the past few months. This is currently done manually by a few people (including me), but it happens sometimes that the pages are not updated for several days (e.g. in late April), meaning that some of the subpages are in limbo instead of being displayed with the other copyright problems. A bot would allow this simple rotation to be done automatically, at the right time and with minimal use of ressources. A quick poll on the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia_talk%7ECopyright_problems_c09f.html#Automatic_update_of_new_listings" title="Wikipedia talk:Copyright problems">copyright problems talk page</a> gave positive feedback to this idea.</p>
<p>I have put the technical details on <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorglbot_114a.html" title="User:Zorglbot">User:Zorglbot</a>, but in a nutshell, it is a bot written in Perl, it does not use a special framework but is based on the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/" class="external text" title="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/" rel="nofollow">WWW::Mechanize</a> module. For the first few days, I plan to run it myself, but if everything works well, the goal is of course to schedule it to run automatically.</p>
<p>This is a pretty simple bot; I have a few other ideas of very similar tasks that could be performed by such a bot, but first want to see how this one works out; if everything goes well, I'll come back and ask for approval for anything else.

<li>b) Every half hour mark (UTC) and every full hour mark (UTC); so once every 30 minutes. Though I will likely raise the time increments, since often it finds nothing to do.</li>
<li>c) The bot is coded in javascript, integrated into my Opera browser. Note that the bots loads page images only if cached so as to reduce server use.</li>
<li>d) As long as I set it to run, every half hour mark (UTC) it will check the protection log and go to WP:PP and delist anything that was unprotected (and still listed). Every full hour mark it will do the opposite: check for pages to add to the list. It only works for full and semi protected articles for now (I have not bothered to program in more yet)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>This bot is important so as too keep <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a> a good centralized place for admins to check up on the status of protected pages. <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">User:Splash</a> not to long ago worked hard at <a href="../../../s/e/m/Category%7ESemi-protected_fd05.html" title="Category:Semi-protected">Category:Semi-protected</a> to remove many articles that admins protected and forgot about. After I starting running my tool, while it was still part of my monobook, the semi-protected pages section at WP:PP doubled and the protected list went up in size by almost 50%. I have posted my other quick protection tab tools on WP:AN and talk for WP:PP, but relatively few people are using them, though many people still protect pages and never list them... Recently, many admins have noted<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:List_of_protected_pages#Semi_list_is_now_way_outdated" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:List_of_protected_pages#Semi_list_is_now_way_outdated" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> how poorly up to date the list had become a while ago, and as a result began to challenge its very existance<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Come_on.21" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Come_on.21" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:List_of_protected_pages#Why_this_page.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:List_of_protected_pages#Why_this_page.3F" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. I believe that this page serves Wikipedia by not allowing articles to "slip through cracks", being protected for weeks/months because people forgot. Page protection is, after all, "considered harmful" by guidelines. I would like this bot to be flagged if that helps.</p>

<dd>Go ahead and do a trial run, I'm interested in a few things though. It only has to load two pages right? The protection log and <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a>, and it only does one edit to update?

<dd>It loads the log, checks for listings/delistings, then checks WP:PP for those names. If it is listing, then it also goes back to the log to retrieve the summaries/date of the articles it will list and goes back to WP:PP in edit mode and paste them in and saves. It does one of these every 30 minutes while it is running, though I don't usually run it 24 hours, because that is usually just wasteful. It only edits WP:PP, on top of only doing it every 30 min (if it can find anything to do), so there is very little risk. The only small issue now is getting it to recognize deleted pages, which on occasion it still lists due to spelling errors in the explanations in the log, or a lack of a summary.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 04:55, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds good, I took a look at it's contribs and everything looks in order.

<dd>I usually click "run bot" before going to class and stop it when I want to do things that don't alot for background programs too well. I also run it at night. When I click "run", it checks to list things during N:00 and delist on N:30 (N = 0,1,2,3...). It will do its stuff automagically and save the page. It is possible for me to manually run the list or delist function, which I sometimes do using the tabs.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All_b66c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 05:23, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
