<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anyone willing to analyse some bot pseudocode?</span></h2>
<p>I'm building a research (ie, no edit) bot in C++... since I'm not really that experienced in programing I was wondering if someone would be willing to check my pseudocode?</p>
<p>The basic concept behind the bot is to identify when a particular string of text was added to an article using a binary search method. In theory it could search though the history of a page with 10,000 edits with less then 15 page-requests.</p>
<p>A research program like this will be a helpful tool in tracking down <i>subtle</i> vandals and spammers. So.. I've kinda drifted. Anyone more experienced with OOP languages want to audit my pseudocode? ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>)</sup> 23:59, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've written a perl interpretation of your pseudocode, but am having trouble understanding precisely the context of that block. How will it be used? Is that the 'main' function? Where is the return value used? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmax-_a23e.html" title="User:Jmax-">Jmax-</a> 08:41, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not certain, but I believe the idea is the user provides the wikipedia page and a string that's in the current version of the article. The function returns the diff of when that string was added. So, I would say that no this wouldn't be main, this would probably be 'search'. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 09:26, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it does have limitations. If the text was added in and taken out multiple times it won't necessarily find the -first- time the string was added, but it will find one of the times the string was added. There are a number of elements I haven't designed yet so the code is incomplete. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>)</sup> 17:38, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The basic idea here is that the user would input the name of the article to search and the string of text they were looking for and then the program would output a link to the first version of the page with that paticular string. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>)</sup> 17:43, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As was hinted at above, a binary search skips over many alterations. A binary search will find one alteration where the string appeared, but it might not be the first time the string appeared. The bot might look at versions 128, 64, 32, 48, 56, 60, 58, 59 and identify version 59 as having the string while 58 does not. But the string might have been inserted in version 34 and deleted in version 35, as well as several other times.

<dd>It at least can help in many situations. You wanted comments on the method, and now you know some of the limitations. If you really want to find the first insertion of a string you could examine the article-with-history format which is used in data dumps.

<dd><a href="../../../e/x/p/Help%7EExport_6ab9.html" title="Help:Export">Help:Export</a> says the full history for a page is available, but at bottom of page is a note that it has been disabled for performance reasons. If the history was available you'd have a single file where you'd just have to recognize the version header (and a few others such as Talk page) and by remembering the earliest version with the desired text be able to find the version in a single read of one file. At present that's only relevant if you search a mirror with export history enabled.

<dd>Although I don't think this is as big of issue as you guys do, I have a relatively elagent solution to the finding the first insertion problem. Run the exact same search again on only the preceding versions. Have it include a case where if it never finds the string it'll let the first search know it found the right one. This method won't work if the string has been absent from most of the versions, but by far the most common reason the original search won't work is it'll find pageblankings and attribute the sentence to the person that reverts it, this solution solves that problem. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 01:08, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">forced autoarchive</span></h2>
<p>I know there's already autoarchive bots running such as the one archiving this page, but I think a bot that operates a little differently could be effectively used to archive all article talkpages. First off, it would only archive talk pages that are very long, so 3 year old comments on a tiny talk page would be left untouched. When the bot runs across a very long talk page it will archive similarly to current bots, but with a high threshold, for example all sections older than 28 days (rather than the typical 7 days). Also, unlike current bots I'd suggest we make this opt out rather than opt in, although very busy talk pages or talk pages that are manually archived wouldn't be touched anyway because they'd either be short enough or would have no inactive sections. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 03:56, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unless I've missed something, Werdnabot is like the EssjayBots, it's an opt-in. Archiving all article talk pages on Wikipedia would require a bit more than just a new feature; it's going to have several hundred thousand talk pages to parse, it's going to need a lot more efficient code than the current opt-in code. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 04:08, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My apologies, I missed that part. Though that does bring up a new point - wouldn't this cause very unnecessary stress on the servers? Crawling through every single article talk page on wikipedia must be very bandwidth-intensive, even using Special:Export or an API, or some such. It would also create a huge number of new pages - again, putting strain on the database server. Does the small convenience of having a shorter talk page to look though justify this? Maybe I'm playing devil's advocate, but I'm sure this has been debated before and wasn't found to be such a good idea ^_^ <small><a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakingSpirit_eb4f.html" title="User:ShakingSpirit"><font color="#808080">ShakingSpirit</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShakingSpirit_9d42.html" title="User talk:ShakingSpirit"><font color="#000000">talk</font></a></sup></small></dd>

<dd>Well, it'll be a strain on the server that hosts it, parsing all those pages. However, if it's done right, it will only archive pages of a certain length, which should avoid most of the one or two line talk pages that are out there, thus reducing any server load. At this point, with 1,719,673 articles, 8,255,279 pages, and tens of thousands of edits a minute, one little bot archiving pages (and set on a delay, to avoid any problems) is hardly likely to bring the site down. As long as it is given a reasonable delay time on it's editing, it should be fine. The real problem will be getting the community signed on to the idea. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 04:28, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As for bandwidth, I don't think it would be an issue. First off it could run once on a database dump to get the ball rolling, then it could patrol recent changes looking only at "talk:" changes. If it still seems like it could hog bandwidth I can think of many more ways to cut down the number of pages it checks. First off ignore any pages that just had characters removed instead of added. Secondly only check every third page (or so), this operates under the premise that big talk pages get big because they're edited often, so it'll pop up again soon if it's going to need archiving. Thirdly, the bot could store a local hash table of page lengths so rather than loading the page each time it would add (or subtract) the number of characters listed on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Special:Recentchanges</a> and could only load the page if it needs archived. This wouldn't be as hard on a bot as it sounds, the storage space would only be a few megs because all it needs is the page's hash and size. Also the computation would be easy, because it would hash, not search for the page so the lookup time is O(1) and the calculations are all real simple. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 04:34, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suspect this idea has been thought of before but i don't see its fruit so here goes. When i first discovered the talk page here I couldn't for the life of me understand why wikipedia couldn't have a normal message box interface, even if it need be public. This simply means showing the <b>thread</b> of an exchange on different talkpages. It would save us having to keep an eye for a reply on the page we left a message the day before etc. A bot can simply thread a talk exchange, of course this would require tagging our talk as we reply to a message. This is more a navigational issue but since its not been integrated into the main wiki OS it seems to be left for a bot. I don't know how it would run though.

<dd>Why not a TalkBot? User A posts a message on User B's talk page. User B responds on his/her own talk page, and this posting invokes (somehow) the TalkBot (maybe a template in the section, like {{TalkBot}}?). The TalkBot determines that the orginal posting from A isn't on A's talk page, and so (a) copys the section heading on B's talk page to A's talk page as a new section; (b) adds <i>You wrote:</i> and the text of A's posting, to that page, and (c) copies B's response on B's page to A's talk page (all with proper indentation). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></dd>

<dd>It gets tricker if A responds on A's talk page and isn't a subscriber to the TalkBot service, but perhaps the bot could insert a hidden comment in the heading of the new section on A's talk page, such as &lt;--- Section serviced by TalkBot ---&gt;, and then watch for that textstring in the data stream?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page-protecting syso-bot</span></h2>
<p>People usually do a good job of protecting the templates on the Main Page; but there have been some that slip through the cracks and the results can be disastrous. I propose a bot that would be given sysop status. I know this is controversial, and there was a big discussion about a similar request at the AFD page awhile back. Such, anyone allowed to know the password must have already been approved for adminship through conventional means, and it should be open-source. It will protect the next day's templates in advance of them being on the Main Page (say, 24 hours) and then unprotect them afterwards. Preferably, it would make sure the pages stay protected until off the Main Page, and even be able to work with the pictures for POTD, but they'd have to be specified in advance, whereas the templates would run on the {{CURRENTDAY}} magic word system. This would be a big help in reducing the possibility of Main Page vandalism (believe me, it happens).--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHereToHelp_1de7.html" title="User:HereToHelp">Here</a><a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHereToHelp_c207.html" title="User talk:HereToHelp"><b>T</b></a><a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHereToHelp_1de7.html" title="User:HereToHelp">oHelp</a> 03:52, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">deletion bot</span></h2>
<p>I have the feeling I'm gonna get yelled at for this one, but how about a bot that deletes articles that have a clear concensus on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>. For example, it's quite obvious that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Myspacephobia_cb69.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Myspacephobia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Myspacephobia</a> is going to get deleted, but it's currently waiting for an admin to do the work. Yes I know this would mean an admin bot, but that's not without precedent. Also, this bot would ONLY work on articles with a very obvious concensus. As for vandals abusing the bot, I don't think it would be an issue. First off it'd ignore IPs, secondly it'd have a minimum amount of time for voting, and there's too many legitamate voters to contest a bad faith deletion for the bot to touch it. Btw, this bot would also close candidates that are clearly keep as well. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 07:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely not. AFD is not a vote, it's a discussion to achieve consensus. A bot will never be in a position to properly determine whether or not consensus is achieved. I'd strongly oppose both the creation and sysop status of such an account. (Coincidentally, from a purely technical angle, such a bot would probably not be difficult to create...) <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 07:45, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Although I understand your position, I'm not sure I agree with your argument. I agree that a computer couldn't tell who was winning a debate, but it could if both people were arguing the same side. Similarly this bot couldn't decide what consensus was concluded in an opposed discussion, but I don't see why it couldn't take advantage of the fact that everyone is on the same side of the discussion and that the concensus has already been reached. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 07:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So you're proposing that we break deletion debates down into purely mechanical decisions? There's a clear difference between achieving consensus and simply "counting the votes". Administrators use discretion to evaluate the weight and strength of the arguments presented, making a decision based not only on those facts that they have surmised, but also on the strength of those arguments. It's quite possible to achieve "no consensus" even with an overwhelming "vote" for deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 08:08, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But is it possible to achieve no concensus with 10 votes to delete and 0 to keep? <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 08:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely, because AFD is not a vote. It's possible that the arguments could be entirely baseless, and all of the "votes" placed afterwards could be founded on those arguments. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:MidnightBlue"><b>alphachimp</b></span></a> 08:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I understand that it's a discussion not a vote, but I would be astonished if that scenario had happened ever, let alone with any frequency. I confess I don't spend a lot of time on WP:AFD but I've spent a little and I find your argument specious. In fact, I think if that were to happen then even the admin that came along to close the debate would likely miss the same fallacy that the other 10 editors had. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 08:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>(undent) The issue of false positives is important. Certainly if a large majority of flaggings related to a particular phrase are in fact in error, that phrase shouldn't be used by the bot. But keep in mind that this flagging will only be used for new articles, which are much more likely to be spam then existing ones, so drawing conclusions from your search of existing articles isn't necessarily a good idea.</p>
<p>In any case, the bot should be tested by seeing what happens using a given phrase for (say) the first ten articles it finds. For example, <i>our products</i> looks like a good phrase to use. A google search on that found Enterprise Engineering Center (user who created article has done nothing else), plus several others (in the top 10 results) that were tagged as appearing to be advertisements.</p>
<p>Finally, the bot is only doing <i>flagging</i>. A human has to actually nominate an article for deletion (and it's easy to remove a template). But your comment does raise a point about there being a link to click on to complain about the bot. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 15:40, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It strikes me that the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian_spam_filtering.html" title="Bayesian spam filtering">Bayesian approach</a> commonly used to detect e-mail spam could work here as well. All we'd need (besides a <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_matter_of_programming.html" title="Simple matter of programming">simple matter of programming</a>) is a way to train the bot. I suppose, if the bot is watching the RC feed anyway, that deletion of a tagged article could be seen as a confirmation that it was spam, while removal of the tag could be taken as a sign that it was not (until and unless the article is deleted after all). But there would still need to be a manual training interface, if only for the initial training before the bot is started. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 03:23, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I like the idea of a Bayesian approach because of the simplicity. However, the bot training would always have to be manual in my opinion. Having the bot treat the deletion of a tagged article as spam will likely result in it learning some behaviors outside of its design scope. For instance, if it tags an article with patent nonsense that happens to trip the filter and that article is removed while the template is still intact, it will start gobbling up patent nonsense like there is no tomorrow. While that's not a bad thing, the template we'd be leaving on the page wouldn't accurately describe what's wrong with the page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So... either a manual interface would be necessary to make sure that the bot stays on target or we'd need to change the scope of the bot to encompass every kind of problem there is with a new page (spam, attack pages, patent nonsense, etc.) I think either approach would be good, but would anyone care to offer their feedback?

<dd>Nice to see someone working on this idea, why not have it archive the page like in the XFD's?

<dd>I figured we should have a more consistent FxC style independent of xFD style. Those big boxes and colored backgrounds make sense if the pages are still going to be transcluded along side live debates, like xFD, but it's a lot of excess formatting to add when people are less likely to be confused. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 21:07, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<ol>
<li>Check the promotion and non-promotion logs for any updates from Raul654</li>
<li>Add a note to the candidate sub page indicating promotion or not</li>
<li>Remove the page from WP:FAC if it is still there (this might simplify one of Raul654's mundane tasks)</li>
<li>Update the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFac_ebda.html" title="Template:Fac">fac</a>}} on the article talk page for non-promotions

<dd>Ancientpages has two problems. First, it only lists the oldest 1000 articles (that is, 1000 articles with the oldest "most recent edit"). That, of course, is plenty to work on for any project. But the second problem is that at least 90% of the 1000 articles are <i>disambiguation pages</i> - not what members of the project are really interested in. An ideal bot would be able to screen out disambiguation pages from its results.</dd>
<dd>Alternatively, I guess, a special page (database listing) similiar to ancientpages, but excluding disambiguation pages, would suffice. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 02:17, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, this could be done fairly easily with AWB or pywikipedia, but personally I'm not sure it should be done with a fully automated bot for the same reason that misspellings shouldn't be automatically 'fixed' by a bot - quite often times come up where it would make no sense to change "often times" to "often"...like in that sentence! ^_^ I suggest using AWB and checking each edit yourself before confirming the change. <small><a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakingSpirit_eb4f.html" title="User:ShakingSpirit"><font color="#808080">ShakingSpirit</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShakingSpirit_9d42.html" title="User talk:ShakingSpirit"><font color="#000000">talk</font></a></sup></small> 22:08, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AWB does some of this (partly reto-fitted from my list I think) , and I have done some of it with a lagreish reg-ex (see <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmackBot_cc7a.html" title="User:SmackBot">User:SmackBot</a>. I also have a project under development to classify headings as "always change, never change , sometimes change or don't know" which will have intimate knowledge of common capitlised things like CD and DVD.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Invariable symbols bot</span></h2>
<p>Unit symbols are invariable (unlike abbreviations), but there are nevertheless hundreds if not thousands of articles where "s" has been added improperly. A bot could fix this automatically, as the risk of confusion with correct English is about zero. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace "cms" with "cm" (centimetre)</li>
<li>Replace "ins" with "in" (inch) &lt;-- This one needs care (could be e.g. "ins and outs", "sit-ins", etc.)</li>
<li>Replace "kms" with "km" (kilometre)</li>
<li>Replace "mins" with "min" (minute)</li>
<li>Replace "mms" with "mm" (millimetre)</li>
<li>Replace "secs" with "s" (second)</li>
<li>Replace "yds" with "yd" (yard)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sought strings should be case sensitive, and the bot should leave instances immediately followed by a period alone (they could be legitimate abbreviations).</p>
<p>Other cases than those listed above probably exist.</p>

<dd>If I understand your idea corretly I think its a good one. What i understand is you want to find all standalone imperial measurements and add a parenthesised metric measurement too, and vice versa. ie if you find "1 mile" replace it with "1 mile (1.6km)" (or whatever). The bot would have to be very careful/intelligent, but I think it can be done and is a good idea. - <span style="color:#ccf;background:#ccf;border-style: single"><a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPocklingtonDan_89be.html" title="User:PocklingtonDan">PocklingtonDan</a></span> 08:16, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, thats exactly what I have in mind. It seems to me that us Americans will never convert to the metric system, and the rest of the world is not going to change measurements to accomadate us, so I figure it would be best to build a bot that can automatically handle the conversions rather than pester people to consistently make the conversions themselves. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomStar81_1354.html" title="User talk:TomStar81">Talk</a>) 08:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>(undent) It doesn't seem that controversial. Obviously some test runs, and starting slowly, would be appropriate.

<p>This oddities exist due to <a href="../../../d/p/l/WP%7EDPL_c093.html" title="WP:DPL">disambiguation</a>.

<dd>While I think the concept is a good idea, it's useful to a reader not to have to go <i>way back</i> (up) in an article to find a wikilink. I suggest that if the separation is more than 3000 characters (that's roughly 40 lines, i.e., almost a full page), then the second occurence should <i>not</i> be dewikilinked. (Character count does not include characters inside templates, images, references, or hidden/commented text.) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 17:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Since this is a bot without judgment, I'd strongly recommend "left alone" for any apparently duplicate wikilinks where the second instance is in the "See also" section. As for templates, I also suggest leaving them alone, for the same reason - anything requiring judgment isn't a good thing for a bot to do. The goal here should be to absolutely minimize false postitives (the bot doing something wrong); if that means it misses (say) 20% of the fixes it could make, that's fine, because it will still be fixing 80%. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 16:27, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does he mean just the trailing full stop/period? If so, then it should always g outside the closing quotation mark, but he seems to suggest you should never use punctuation within quotation marks, which I don't understand - quotation marks are used to quote somebody. If the words you are quoted would reasonable be punctuated when written in prose, then that punctuation is included, regardless of whether it is in punctuation marks. The following is perfectly valid punctuation, regardless of style:

<p>Hello, we are (finishing to) putting in place a new translation project.</p>
<p>There are two things I would greatly appreciate if it was done by a bot.</p>
<p>First, we had to make a small modification of the format of the translation pages which are used for every translation request. The task is : For every page in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETranslation_sub-pages_version_1_215e.html" title="Category:Translation sub-pages version 1">Category:Translation sub-pages version 1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Translation/1356_Basel_earthquake&amp;diff=98915118&amp;oldid=97582629" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Translation/1356_Basel_earthquake&amp;diff=98915118&amp;oldid=97582629" rel="nofollow">this kind of change</a> needs to be done.</p>
<p><br />
Second, there are a lot of categories to initialize with a very simple wikicode, 7 for each language and they are 50 of them. All red links of the array on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation___Lang_eb9a.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation/*/Lang">Wikipedia:Translation/*/Lang</a> (except the first column of the array which has a different syntax) should be initialized with the syntax explained on this page.</p>

I made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Translation/2dF_Galaxy_Redshift_Survey&amp;diff=100539345&amp;oldid=100462083" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Translation/2dF_Galaxy_Redshift_Survey&amp;diff=100539345&amp;oldid=100462083" rel="nofollow">sample diff</a> what I think should be done. Let me know if that's correct, and I'll get working. About your second request, that's also possible, but that'll require some minor custom programming, and I can do that when I'm done with your first request. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 23:23, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A more serious problem is the matter of <i>responsibility</i>. Wikipedia doesn't get sued (so far) because <i>editors</i> add words to articles; as long as the Wikimedia Foundation responds promptly when notified of problems, it's pretty safe, legally. But running a bot that creates new articles <i>without human review or intervention</i> is asking for trouble - after all, the bot would be <i>authorized</i> (by Wikipedia processes) to do so, which (arguably) makes the Wikimedia Foundation responsible for its edits, not the creator of the bot.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Punctuation and Grammar Bot Request</span></h2>
<p>As I was going over and serching articles yesterday, it shocked me to see how many articles had incorrect spelling, grammar and punctuation. I was thinking about a bot that will put all the punctuation (commas, periods, semi-colons, etc.), grammar (correctly capitallised nouns, etc.) and spelling (commonly known spelling errors) into place on any article it may 'crawl' across. Would appreciate anyone willing to create a bot for me.

<dd>And if you look two sections above this one, there was discussion of a bot to fix spelling problems.</dd>
<dd>In general, it's not trivial to write a bot, and they have to be very narrowly focused in order to work well (and, quite frankly, to get approved in the first place.) It's helpful to have a bit of programming background in order to understand what is feasible and what is not. For example, it would be great to have an EditorBot that would recognize all the errors identified by Strunk and White, and fix them - but no such thing exists, or could possibly exist (and if it did, Microsoft would pay a small fortune to incorporate it into their next version of Microsoft Word.) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 02:12, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you're saying there isn't really a need for a Punctuation and Grammar Bot? If not, why not suggest a few 'really needed' bots because I have always wanted to run a bot throughout my time here at Wikipedia. --<b><a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtranet_f624.html" title="User:Extranet">Extranet</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtranet_006f.html" title="User talk:Extranet">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extranet_2b61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extranet">Contribs</a>)</sup> 03:24, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I'm saying that (a) be specific and (b) understand the limits of what computers can and can't easily do.

<p>I was thinking how convenient it'd be for a bot to turn all the large amounts of web citations we have into the more formal referance tags. More specifically, it would turn this: [www.wikipedia.org] into:</p>
<p>&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=www.wikipedia.org |title=Main Page - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |accessdate=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Note, it would assume the date the link was added was the access date, a reasonable assumption. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 08:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A better example, please. First, it's against policy to cite Wikipedia as a reference/footnote. Second, any internal link (in the body of an article) should be wikified, such as (in this case) <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, rather than being a URL. <i><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></i> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">♫♫</a> 16:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can see such a bot being extremely valuable. A couple of thoughts: It could go to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Special%7ELinksearch_3efd.html" title="Special:Linksearch">Special:Linksearch</a> and get a list of all external links for a specific domain (e.g., CNN). It should understand that when a URL appears twice in a page, there should not be two identical footnotes (so, the first ref/footnote gets a name="X" argument). It probably should avoid pages that have both a "Notes" and a "References" section. It probably shouldn't footnote a URL if the URL is in the "External links" section. And, obviously, it should put as much information as possible into the "cite" template. <i><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></i> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">♫♫</a> 22:47, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Applying semi-protection requires administrator rights. No bot to date has been granted such rights, and it's extremely unlikely to be granted except in extraordinarily narrowly defined circumstances.</dd>
<dd>More generally, the page you cite isn't unique in being vandalized, and so you're really asking for a general-purpose vandal-fighting bot. The problem, of course, is recognizing what is vandalism and what is not. For example, a few days ago I deleted most of a talk section that violated <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. It would be hard for a bot to recognize that I wasn't vandalizing that page.</dd>
<dd>Requests for page protection should go to <a href="../../../r/p/p/WP%7ERPP_5127.html" title="WP:RPP">WP:RPP</a>. My sense is that administrators are pretty quick to respond to such requests, both to initiate and remove semi- or full protection, as appropriate. <i><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></i> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">♫♫</a> 22:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree that equipping a <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skynet.html" title="Skynet">bot with Administrator rights</a> may not be such a wise move. Thinking further, how about a user activated bot that reverts all subsequent IP edits, then shuts itself down at a random time between 5 minutes and one hour? Apart from whether this is a good idea or not, would this type of bot present any significant technical challenges and/or major policy problems for Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHailFire_f565.html" title="User:HailFire">HailFire</a> 06:59, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it would certainly make a difference in an edit war between a registered user (like you) and an anon IP address - just invoke the bot, and don't worry about <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> violations. It might also be rather frustrating to an anonymous IP editor who actually did have something useful to add to the article, added it, say the change take place, and then saw a bot mindlessly revert it (with what edit summary - "Sorry, we didn't tell you, but I'm here to revert all anonymous IP edits, no matter how good or bad"?).</dd>

The spammer owned a dozen+ domains and was replacing references with references to his sites, he created a dozen or so articles with the only citation being to his site and he added his address to many External Link sections. Because of the way he obfuscated it took 8 months to notice this activity.</p>
<p>So... I thought up a dream bot that would be able to track this crap down.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Collect every external link in article space on wikipedia. (I think mediawiki already does that?)
<ul>
<li>Step 1a: Eliminate links on a white-list (nytimes.com, google.com, etc)</li>
<li>Step 1b: Eliminate links on the meta blacklist (send them to bl_links.txt)</li>
<li>Step 1c: Condense list (combine links to the same subdomain.domain.tld and ++ a counter)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 2: Check each link
<ul>
<li>Step 2a: If link is dead, add it to deadlist.txt</li>
<li>Step 2b: Check to see if the page has advertising (if not, remove it from list)</li>
<li>Step 2c: (<a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEAN_fad7.html" title="WP:BEAN">Check HTML Comment</a>)</li>
<li>Step 2d: Recheck deadlist.txt once, send any that are now responding to step 2B and any not to deadlist2.txt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 3: Analysis
<ul>
<li>Step 3a:(<a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEAN_fad7.html" title="WP:BEAN">Check HTML Comment</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 4: Report
<ul>
<li>Report some simple stats from step 1 &amp; 2 and the list created by 3a.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>I think there is a least one bot working it's way through to approval that addresses the dead link issue. (ShakinBot?) For that bot, I suggested adding a tag directly on the article page immediately after the dead link , so that any editor reading the article is aware of that specific bad link problem. Perhaps a similar approach could be taken with spam:
<ul>
<li>Check the recent changes stream, rather than scanning all 1.5 million articles, and look at each new external link.</li>
<li>Don't bother checking the link if it's on a list of acceptable sites (.gov domain, .edu domain, washingtonpost.com, etc.)</li>
<li>Otherwise, see if the site has advertising</li>
<li>If it does, put a tag on the external link that says "Possible spam". The tag should also have a link to <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>. A 6 or 12 or 24-hour delay in taggig might be good, in order not to interfere with the RC patrol, with the bot rechecking after the delay to see if the link is still there.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This approach has the advantage of enlisted any editor looking at an article as a spam-fighter, so we don't need to try to enlist a separate group of people to do this very mundane chore.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, I suppose, the bot might also throw the suspect links into a database where their continued existence (say, a week later) could be checked, and if they are still there, added to a "top 100 possible problems" list that <i>would</i> be reviewed by editors (say, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam</a>).

<p>I'm back! I'm afraid that I need some help from a bot for <a href="../../../m/m/o/WP%7EMMO_8d0f.html" title="WP:MMO">WikiProject MMO</a>'s banners again. We are starting up an assessment system and I thought a good way to start off would be to take ratings from WikiProject CVG's banners. Most all MMO articles have both {{<a href="../../../w/p/_/Template%7EWP_MMOG_2fd6.html" title="Template:WP MMOG">WP MMOG</a>}} (WikiProject MMO's banner) and {{<a href="../../../c/v/g/Template%7ECvgproj_615d.html" title="Template:Cvgproj">Cvgproj</a>}} (WikiProject CVG's banner) on their talk pages. I was hoping that a bot could take what WikiProject CVG assessed the article as and copy it (being {{WP MMOG|class=?}}). The articles that would be assessed are in <a href="../../../m/a/s/Category%7EMassively_multiplayer_online_games_1192.html" title="Category:Massively multiplayer online games">Category:Massively multiplayer online games</a> as well as it's sub-categories.

<p>It would be rather useful if the description page for images included details of when an image starts and stops being used in articles. Often it's quite hard to identify exactly when an image was added or removed (and by whom) from an article, and this bot would enable people to find out very easily by viewing the image discussion page.

<p>I'm currently creating redirects for all the permutations of the two-hybrid screening title. It covers <i>E. coli</i> and yeast (specifically known as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) two hybrid screening, but the combinations of words I need to put into titles are; (E. coli/Escherichia coli/bacterial/bacteria/yeast/Saccharomyces cerevisiae/S. cerevosoiae) (two hybrid/two-hybrid) (*nothing*/test/screen/screening/method/analysis). In total, that's 7x2x6 = 84 possible permutations! Even with clever use of the back button and copy ans paste, that's going to be a drawn-out laborious task to do by hand. Could someone <i>please</i> write a bot for redirect making where you enter the variables and then it goes to work? It should probably be operated only by the creator as per requests on the bot's talk page, to prevent abuse. Also, it would need to return an error/fail silently when one of the permutations already exists, rather than overwrite, in case that permutation contained a full seperate artcle or a redirect to another article. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeans_Potato_Business_0fbe.html" title="User:Seans Potato Business">Seans</a> <b><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeans_Potato_Business_5895.html" title="User talk:Seans Potato Business">Potato Business</a></b> 22:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Now, how do I get all the permutations using a spreadsheet and then how do I use these to make redirects with AWB? --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeans_Potato_Business_0fbe.html" title="User:Seans Potato Business">Seans</a> <b><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeans_Potato_Business_5895.html" title="User talk:Seans Potato Business">Potato Business</a></b> 05:22, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, if that isn't too much of a problem. (Some of the articles <i>may</i> already have banners on them because of other users. Will that be a problem?) <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 02:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sigh.

<dd>Hmm...How did articles on Hurricane Katrina get into the Georgia category? Hurricane Katrina didn't hit Georgia. Anyway, I'll do a sweep of the subcats and look for strange entries such as the one that triggered this. (Damn, this isn't good.) <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 18:01, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Somebody added <a href="../../../h/u/r/Category%7EHurricane_Katrina_9b67.html" title="Category:Hurricane Katrina">Category:Hurricane Katrina</a> as a subcat of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Category%7EGeorgia_hurricanes_30e5.html" title="Category:Georgia hurricanes">Category:Georgia hurricanes</a>, which probably wasn't too good an idea. It would be a good idea to ignore <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_based_in_Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_6475.html" title="Category:Companies based in Georgia (U.S. state)">Category:Companies based in Georgia (U.S. state)</a> to avoid annoying those who maintain those articles. Those two categories are the only categories that have subcats that stray from the original topic. Please accept my sincerest apologies; I should have checked the categories before I made the request. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 18:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
