<h2><span class="mw-headline">Formatting bot</span></h2>
<p>Looking through the days of the year pages, I have noticed that quite a few contain such ugly things as hyphens instead of dashes, and the use of the "conventional quoting style". I have been going through fixing these, but there are simply too many to do manually. Would anybody mind if I wrote a bot to do this? It should be a straight-forward text replacement (eg. s/ - / &amp;ndash; /). —<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWereon_8361.html" title="User:Wereon">Wereon</a> 15:16, 24 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Japanese author bot</span></h2>
<p>I am planning to put hunderes of stubs for Japanes authors using bots. Any objection? The format should be like <a href="../../../h/o/z/Hozumi_Shigeto_301a.html" title="Hozumi Shigeto">Hozumi Shigeto</a> -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 04:47 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nice format. I like the way you have the Japanese characters in the same parenthesis as the birth/death dates. One minor issue: a space needs to go after the comma in the dates. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't like the way the Japanese characters are in the same parenthesis as the dates. They are different things altogether, so it seems strange to link them in that way. And it doesn't follow the standard "(date - date)" pattern that seems to have been agreed for biographical articles. I prefer the format used at, <i>e.g.</i> <a href="../../../k/o/k/Kokichi_Mikimoto_a25e.html" title="Kokichi Mikimoto">Kokichi Mikimoto</a>. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 16:04 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article contains little more than <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_authors_85ff.html" title="List of Japanese authors">List of Japanese authors</a>, only the Japanese characters. These could be added in the list. It seems better that a separate article about an author is made at the moment that there is more info on him/her. Except when it is probable that soon more info will be added to a large percentage of the stubs. - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_7b47.html" title="User:Patrick">Patrick</a> 10:33 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it makes more sense to do a list, and when someone decides to flesh out a particular author they can create a new page. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 16:34 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>What is the benefit of adding all these authors using a bot? Is it truly contributing to the content of wikipedia, or just cluttering the database? If people feel that they need to add content about a particular topic, then surely to benefit readers, it should have at least a little content. <a href="../../../k/a/b/User%7EKabads_c148.html" title="User:Kabads">Kabads</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think they're just "clutter", since these people are presumably all going to get articles, so pages on them are going to be in the database eventually anyway. These bot contributions are just providing slots into which people can put stuff. We all want more encyclopaedic content to be added, of course, so I think the most important question is: are people more likely to add encyclopaedic content on an author who (a) has no entry at all, or (b) has a very brief entry with almost no content? I suspect that the latter is more likely to spur people on to add information, but it's debatable, of course. (I still don't like the format, though!) -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 16:51 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, stub articles have inadequate information but the purpose of them is to provide a good starting point to write an article. Finding out the birth date and death date is a tedious job and particularly putting Japanese characters are difficult to job for those who can't type Japanese. Secondly, we already have the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_authors_85ff.html" title="List of Japanese authors">List of Japanese authors</a>. It means soon or later we will have articles for all of them. There is no reason to postpone making articles unless we are unsure we need such a article. Yeah, we need a little more at least, where he/she was born and died. I think I can put such information because I have it.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe bots are a little too overwhelming. I will put stubs by hand if we can agree with having stub articles for Japanese authors.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Taku, Have you read <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:Bots</a>? It's a useful page on this issue. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> 16:41 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes. I believe my bot is useful, harmless and not server hog.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess another benefit of using a bot is to guarantee consistent format for the articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomos_701c.html" title="User:Tomos">Tomos</a> 20:30 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Japanese city bot</span></h2>
<p>I would like to use a bot to make a stub of Japanese city. The format should be like <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funabashi.html" title="Funabashi">Funabashi</a>. I will wait to use it until enough dicussion is done. I welcome any sort of comment, really any. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 04:18 Mar 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, that's awfully short. Could you include a little more data? Population would be a start, and such stats are likely widely available. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, it is less than adequate stub. I put population and I will put area. Unfortunately I couldn't find out the complete set of stat data like census in USA. So we have to get each data like population individually. What else do you think we need? -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 22:27 Mar 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yea that's too short. I think you could add information like location (<a href="../../../l/a/t/Latitude.html" title="Latitude">latitude</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longitude.html" title="Longitude">longitude</a>...), climate (max/average/min temperature, rainfall...), geographical features (nearby rivers/mountains...), history (when is the city formed, who formed it, important historical events...), just to name a few. Maybe you could use the US cities articles as reference since they are also added by a bot (AFAIK). --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorenzarius_59a1.html" title="User:Lorenzarius">Lorenzarius</a> 15:30 Mar 18, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course, I wish I could. If someone has good stats in English, I will appreciate. But I doubt there is such. Maybe we need to add history or such by hand later. Anyway we can't expect artciels like US cities articles. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 16:14 Mar 18, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO, Why can't we expect articles of similar quality? We don't necessarily need history, but if we're going to run a bot, then we should be able to find all the information possible. At the very least, Lorenzarius' first few suggestions are very good; population alone is not enough, nor the city designation. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtorpen_d98d.html" title="User:Atorpen">Atorpen</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Taku: for population, how about this? <a href="http://www.glin.org/prefect/cpf/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.glin.org/prefect/cpf/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomos_701c.html" title="User:Tomos">Tomos</a> 20:05 Mar 18, 2003 (UTC)<br />

<p>First of all, thank you for all of those who gave me comments. Particularly pages Toms gave seems quite useful making an city article bot will add decent probably. I am working on a converting Japanese into English and writing the script of bot.

<p>I updated Funaba article. I think it is still short but adequate stub.

<dd>If you have experience with <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl.html" title="Perl">Perl</a>, it's easy. Even if you don't, it's easy as long as you're somewhat good with computer languages. For example, on page 708 of the first edition of the Perl Cookbook (Christiansen &amp; Torkington) it shows how to grab a web page with two lines of code:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>use LWP::Simple;</dd>
<dd>$content = get('<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org'" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org'" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org'</a>);</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>... at which point the variable '$content' contains the HTML of the requested page. More sophisticated robot work requires a little more code, but it's surprisingly easy. Jordan Langelier</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have no experience writing bots <i>please</i> be careful that you don't unleash some kind of terminator onto the servers. Always test your work on a sandbox system (install an HTTP server locally with static copies of some example pages), and don't leave it going for hours and hours without checking what it's up to. <a href="../../../c/g/s/User%7ECgs_ca24.html" title="User:Cgs">CGS</a> 22:40 27 May 2003 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Automated content is generally disliked here: the value of Wikipedia comes from the fact that human beings interested in each subject have written and edited the articles.

<p>For most of the day (19 Jul 2003), it ran much faster: one image per minute <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=The_Anomebot" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=The_Anomebot" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> -- User_Docu</p>

<dd>Even one edit a minute is no faster than a human could go (though admittedly, you'd have to be really committed to keep it up for that long).

<hr />
<p>I couldn't figure out where else to put this question. Is there a client for Wikipedia that allows you to edit articles without a web browser? Specifically, I would want to be able to make edits to an article directly as with a wordprocesser. I think it would be relatively simple to implement. You would use it by clicking exactly where you would like to make a change, and then just type. <a href="../../../e/z/r/User%7EEzra_Wax_0323.html" title="User:Ezra Wax">Ezra Wax</a> 23:16, 11 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There has been some discussion about having some sort of interface, but so far the bots just use the same methods that are used as if you had done the edit manually. I think sometime it will eventually get implemented but it isn't a high priority. Maybe once wikimedia starts taking donations we can purchase the feature. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> 03:01, Aug 12, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

It would be great to implement a better solution, but for now it does what it needs to do fairly quickly and so I leave it at that. I move slow enough as is with a real life to live!

<dd>We might as well use a bot to add an article for each known star in the universe (coordinates, colour, estimated blow-up time, SETI scan results). That would boost our article count. Of course just as a starter, feel free to add all you know about any of those zillion stars&#160;:) Or add articles about every chemical compound known to mankind, or about every McDonalds restaurant in the world. But what is the point? I'd say let us be careful with converting the Wikipedia into a raw data container. Most of these data are covered well in some other place, where experts/afficionado's know to find them. Maybe use a bot only to add such data to exisiting handwritten articles. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_Zachte_33ed.html" title="User:Erik Zachte">Erik Zachte</a> 10:32, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not arguing about Rambot. In effect I'm arguing from Erik Zachte's pov. The articles created are formatted demographic and economic data - nice if you want to do a comparison or create colourful maps but in no way encyclopedia articles. They have value but they do not belong in the main encyclopedia namespace - as evinced by the fact that so few of the machine-created articles have been edited.</dd>
</dl>
<p>They are distorting the value of Wikipedia content, especially article counts and size counts into giving an unwarranted impression of the depth of Wikipedia. I'm not saying delete I'm saying move, like the sep11 material they are specialised and not generally usable. With a separate namespace for the raw articles, as and when they are improved they can be moved back. <a href="../../../t/w/o/User%7ETwoOneTwo_b3fe.html" title="User:TwoOneTwo">TwoOneTwo</a> 14:29, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that it would not be good to start limiting the types of content that appears on wikipedia. Rather, we should look at ways of adding meta-information to certain kinds of pages. It is possible that this can be done in a non-labor intensive manner. Then searches can be done with some of the meta-data attached. For instance, I like the random page feature. Yet, I do not kike getting back so many town/city entries. But I would rather be given a "random search with no town/city entries" than remove the town and city entries from wikipedia, which are useful for other reasons. Also, putting domain name qualifiers in front of wikipedi.org (eg gazetter.wikipedia.org) only gives us a single dimnsion of meta-data. The human mind is able to process much more complex types of meta-data and we should not deliberately dumb down wikipedia by imposing a rigid meta-data structure. We should put in a flexible meta-data structure and use that. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayKiddy_a3b3.html" title="User:RayKiddy">RayKiddy</a> 18:43, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An encyclopedia is not an almanac! I think we should take a stand on this. An encyclopedia article is human-written and gives context, weighs relevance, etc. Bot-entries are not articles, they're data. If I want raw data on every county in the US for example, I go to an almanac; if I want context, filtered by a knowledgable human, I go to an encyclopedia. In an encyclopedia, I can rely on the fact that someone has taken the time to include the important facts and leave out the cruft. That's why I went there, and not to the almanac. I'd like to see <b>Wikipedia is not an almanac</b> added to the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">basic tenets</a> of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlrosen_282c.html" title="User:Axlrosen">Axlrosen</a> 22:37, 24 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm attempting to include the coats of arms of a very large number of towns, cities, boroughs, districts and counties in England and Wales on the towns' Wikipedia pages. (See <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnanel_CivicHeraldry_pages_7330.html" title="User:Marnanel/CivicHeraldry pages">User:Marnanel/CivicHeraldry_pages</a> for more information, background, and what has been done so far.) I've done all the entries for one county by hand: there were about 17 images to upload and describe, and around the same number of pages to include the images on. It was a pretty mechanistic process and took a couple of hours. Since this is only about 5% of the full corpus, I'd like to request permission to use a bot to do the uploading and renaming of the pictures automatically, and <i>possibly</i> then the inclusion of those pictures on the relevant pages semi-automatically (though this would perhaps be easier done by hand anyway). I'm a pretty competent programmer, and it shouldn't be too hard for me to do while keeping within the rules. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnanel_b5e3.html" title="User:Marnanel">Marnanel</a> 03:58, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for a bot?</span></h2>
<p>It is, perhaps, pointless to do so, but I would like to request a bot. The amount I know about computer programming could be written in large letters on the back of a stamp, so I can't write it myself. The pointers to WikiProjects on the talk pages of articles (see, for example, <a href="../../../u/r/b/Talk%7EUrban_Hymns_3f51.html" title="Talk:Urban Hymns">Talk:Urban Hymns</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChimpanzee_ecca.html" title="Talk:Chimpanzee">Talk:Chimpanzee</a>, Talk:Mount Airy, Maryland) could be created using Template:Msg tags by adding it to the talk pages of everything linked to from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_albums.html" title="List of albums">list of albums</a>, list of primates, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Maryland_c961.html" title="List of cities in Maryland">list of cities in Maryland</a>, etc, updated perhaps every month. There seems to be much support for these messages, and using Template:Msg means they could be easily changed as needed, also providing much more visibility for the WikiProject as well as for the very idea that the article itself can be changed by any casual user. It also strikes me as being very likely simple to program -- anybody willing to do it? Anybody object to it being done? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 04:56, Apr 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently, Mt. Airy, Maryland doesn't have a talk notice for some reason, and the Wiki is being too slow for me to go find one that does, and there is no list of primates, but this bot would provide an incentive to keep such lists updated... More important for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_albums.html" title="List of albums">list of albums</a> than list of primates, since primate speciation occurs significantly more slowly than the release of new albums. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 05:05, Apr 8, 2004 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request to use human-assisted spelling bot</span></h2>
<p>I made a script that downloads pages from my list of <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_Articles_with_common_misspellings_c82a.html" title="User:Wmahan/Articles with common misspellings">articles with common misspellings</a>, fixes any of the common misspellings, and then lists other potentially misspelled words, which I can correct with the click of a button. I review every change before it is submitted, but the script allows me to correct pages faster and more accurately as compared to changing articles by hand.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I need permission for this, but I thought I'd ask to be safe. My script should be:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>harmless</b> because I review and discard any incorrect fixes</li>
<li><b>useful</b> because I can easily correct not only misspellings on the list, but any misspellings I notice</li>
<li><b>not a server hog</b> because it is limited by how fast I can approve changes. It should use less overall bandwidth than fixing every article by hand because I only request the edit page for the article, rather than loading the article and then following the "edit" link.</li>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I don't think that the primary objection to spelling bots, namely that they perform erroneous changes, applies here because every change is reviewed by a human before being submitted. So this method shouldn't make any changes that I wouldn't make by hand; it only speeds the process up. I've emailed WikiEN-l as you suggested for confirmation. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 03:34, 2004 Apr 9 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Angela's point is that for example, sometimes valid foreign words happen to be misspelled English words. Human knows the article is talking about completely non-English stuff but bots cannot be aware of contexts. I am pretty sure it happens extremely unlikely but it might happen. And it is really tedious and hard to spot errors made by bots because people assume they don't make mistake. So I object to spelling bots. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 06:17, Apr 9, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm claiming that my bot will be different from others that might run amok in that I <i>will</i> be aware of context when I review each change. I agree that it is easy to make a mistake in approving a bot's changes; that's why I must explicitly request any correction that doesn't appear on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_common_misspellings_7716.html" title="Wikipedia:List of common misspellings">list of common misspellings</a>, which has been reviewed for potential pitfalls. If this bot is approved, I will be conservative and not make changes that I'm unsure about.</p>
<p>I admit that there is a possibility, though small, that the bot will make an incorrect change, and then I approve it. My points here are that there are that 1) because I am responsible for the changes, anyone who notices the mistake is free to yell at me on my <a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">talk page</a>; and 2) one can interpret the maxim <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold in updating pages</a> as an argument that even if I make a few mistakes in making many corrections, I'm justified by the overall benefit to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>To summarize, I share your concern about assuming that bots are perfect, but I won't make such an assumption. Thus I think that your blanket rejection of spelling bots is a little too cautious. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 15:14, 2004 Apr 9 (UTC)</p>

<p>I haven't been paying much attention to the approval of bots, but to me this statement looks wrong: "You must get permission from an administrator before using a bot." What is the relevance of administrator status here? As I understand it, administrators have extra technical capabilities, but no extra decision-making authority.

<dd>I see your reasoning, but I was questioning the wisdom of renaming the article in the first place. I wanted to suggest that it might be creating unnecessary work to rename the article when the title seems well established, and then go to the point of using a bot to change all the links. It does make sense to have <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobart.html" title="Hobart">Hobart</a> redirect to <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobart%2C_Australia_34d9.html" title="Hobart, Australia">Hobart, Australia</a> because it is by far the largest. I just think that the fact that you need a bot to rename the page is a warning that it may be overkill, especially since the benefit is debatable. But I'm not strongly opposed to your idea, and am willing to defer to the judgment of the others if there is a consensus in favor of your bot. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 02:38, 2004 Apr 25 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we all agree that <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobart.html" title="Hobart">Hobart</a> should lead the user to a page about the city in Australia, rather than a disambiguation page. To me the the question was when an article's title (without redirects) should be just <i>City</i> rather than <i>City, Country</i>. I was probably biased by the <i>City, State</i> notation used for cities in the US.

<dd>Even if in this case, it's a good idea to move the page about <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobart%2C_Australia_34d9.html" title="Hobart, Australia">Hobart, Australia</a> to <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobart.html" title="Hobart">Hobart</a> and update the links (I wonder why it wasn't placed there in the beginning), in general, it's not necessarily a good idea to up eliminate all redirects, as the redirect may be more precise than just the direct link to the (current) page title. -- User:Docu</dd>

<dd>I don't intend to delete the re-directs - just correct links so they go direct to the article --<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 10:46, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A better sample may be <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a> as there are too many possible/probable choices, it's generally preferable to link to the article through <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Munster_fe91.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Munster">a redirect</a>. -- User:Docu</dd>
