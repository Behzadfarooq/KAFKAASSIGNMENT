<dd>Yes, I agree, hence my stated objections to such a bot running <tt>:)</tt>. I think that the best way for something like this to work would be to output a list of pages which appear to contain typos, and leave a human to fix them (or report to IRC?), hence my interest in getting a list of pages potentially affected. Of course, for this to work there would need to be a communtiy proposal and peole willing to work on the output&#160;:) <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 12:25, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps part of the reason behind it is this request, <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_Requests_for_approval_VixDaemon_4_77e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/VixDaemon 4">Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/VixDaemon_4</a>, where Betacommand speedily approved a clone bot of Betcommandbot.

<dd>I'm inclined to agree with Betacommand here. I just posted the example without comment, but since someone else approved the bot, it is pretty standard to speedily approve these sorts of things. I don't think we've ever had a situation where a bot operator speedily approved a clone of their own bot, so at worst this is uncharted territory. Perhaps in future situations like these the BAG member should recuse themselves, just in case. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 17:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

Add to this some prior history of being blocked for misbehaving in the area of bots and it's not the prettiest of pictures I'm very sorry to have to say. Approving a clone might have been OK if it had happened some time after his Bot 3 had been approved and shown to work, but unless I'm mistaken that wasn't the case. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:01, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just a note yes I was running task three without trial approval, BUT it was only editing subpages of <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WP:WPSPAM</a> and thus had no real impact on anything else. the there were no real questions about whether or not to approve task three, but only when It would be approved.

<p>Throughout his bot-related history, I (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a>) can see the following issues with Betacommand and his bot. In no particular order:</p>

<p>My findings are as follows (I'll post my full opinion below):</p>
<ul>
<li>In the WikiProject vs. Infoboxneeded template issue, I find no merit in the complaint. The two tasks are similar enough to be justified.</li>
<li>While <s>CSD</s>CFD and Subst were approved tasks without discussion of the specifics (despite some people requiring this), it is not Betacommand's fault that procedure was not so neatly followed, so there is no fault here. However, many of Betacommand's bot applications have been vague on details and hard to follow. The approvals pages do not help explain what is being suggested. This is not ideal for a role model.</li>
<li>An interwiki bot did run unapproved but not for long.</li>
<li>One the issue of the bot updating <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_Log_405c.html" title="User:Betacommand/Log">User:Betacommand/Log</a>, I find no merit in this complaint. This usage is fine.</li>
<li>I agree with everything under #3 in Mets501's list. Betacommand was in the wrong in all of these cases.</li>
<li>Looking at the block logs, nothing jumps out immediately as a problem, other than the problems listed in these findings.</li>
<li>He speedily approved a bot clone before his own was approved, and then claimed above that it did not happen. Even if the bot would have been approved anyway, it was clearly a conflict of interest because <i>it was not yet approved</i>.</li>
<li>I'm not convinced one way or another whether other unapproved tasks were performed. A scary number of edits have at least the appearance of being unauthorized.</li>

<dd>Thanks.

<p>Let me state my opinion. I took a look at the type of problems I found. Most of them amount to running an unauthorized bot on the main user account. The fact that it wasn't on the bot account or possibly with different software doesn't matter to me. A bot is a bot. Betacommand has a history of bot misuse: interwiki, admin script, and the current spam link issue. While it is true that he has a number of useful bots, he has not shown responsibility in using *all* of his bots. The latest conflict of interest is the only BAG action that I know of that has been questioned. There are serious concerns about his inappropriatenss of being a role model as a member of BAG. Afterall, it wasn't that he ran tasks unapproved, but that all of the real serious bot offenses were <i>direct violations of bot policy</i>. I'm particularly concerned about the admin action. I was one of the BAG members who got involved in that dispute, but for some reason I didn't realize it was a <i>automatically saving</i> script and not being run <i>manually</i>. All he did was click a link, and bam it was gone, or so I understand it to be. So here I am faced with two questions: 1) Should he be able to run bots at all? and 2) Is he responsible enough to be a BAG member. His misuse of bots clearly indicates that he is not responsible, regardless of how successful his other bot work has been. I would be in favor of revoking all bot permissions, but that is not likely to gain consensus. I also personally feel that he should be removed as a member of BAG because he has fallen below the standards for bot membership. He has done a lot of positive work, for sure, but that does not permit us to ignore the negatives. I'm probably going to come out here with the strongest words, but the offenses are serious and Betacommand does not seem to understand that. Still, I support the less severe solution with the addendum that any future offenses will be dealt with without as much leniency. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 23:30, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As it happens, and as I hinted in my response to Mets' proposal, I would also support removing the bot flag and approvals, and having him reapply. If you wish to propose that as alternative remedies 1 and 2 I would support. Also, I think I've made it clear that by asking for resignation I'm politely saying "jump before you are pushed". Certainly you are right that Betacommand doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 23:35, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let's see if we can get more BAG member input, but I will consider another proposal. The proposed solution works if he agrees to step down. If he does not agree to step down, forcing the issue may be appropriate. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 23:41, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One question - <i>where</i> was the CSD work approved? Yesterday I had to undelete about 300 categories used by <a href="../../../1/2E/0/WP%7E1.0_I_e12b.html" title="WP:1.0/I">WP:1.0/I</a>, which were incorrectly listed in <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_Datadump_Categories_that_were_empty_735d.html" title="User:Betacommand/Datadump/Categories that were empty">User:Betacommand/Datadump/Categories that were empty</a>, and I cannot find anywhere where the bot is authorized to generate those links. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">cool stuff</a>)</sup> 03:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I generate those list via unused categories. there is no need for approval for that. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 03:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>His first approval can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approvals/Archive2#BetacommandBot" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approvals/Archive2#BetacommandBot" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Basically, Betacommand asked for a broad approval of general tasks and then ran a manual trial to show everyone what he was doing. The person approving the bot must have looked at the work (which was Subst and CFD work) and thought it was fine and approved it without any additional discussion. During that approvals process, however, a number of people said that they opposed because the request was too vague. There is some question as to whether that task should have even been approved at all, but in good faith Betacommand did receive approval for the work and any fault is not with him but with the approval process. Now, if there are problems with the task he does, then that should be taken into account as well. As for CSD work, simply generating a list and posting it to a userspace page is not something that generally requires permission, since it does not affect anyone else. If it was a bot that was not already approved for something else, then we might have a problem. But an <i>established</i> bot can edit within their own userspace without issue, assuming that they follow bot policy, such as throttling, etc. If I am misunderstanding this issue, let me know. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 12:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, I feel free to weigh in as well; to provide a non-BAG-member point of view: <small>&lt;POV&gt;</small> As I see it, BAG-members ought to act as role models. This is important for the acceptance of the group and the approval process. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a>, I think you failed here when approving a clone of your own bot before yours was approved and when running unapproved bot tasks. The proposals of <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> are very fair, I think. 1. and 3. are a matter of course for any bot operator. This is not a punishment. 2. is a reasonable suggestion to make Wikipedia benefit from your bot again and I cannot imagine it isn't in your very own interest. So this is not a punishment either. Finally, 4.: You are not banned or blocked or thrown out. You can demonstrate that you understand and acknowledge your faults by resigning yourself, without force. This would be a noble and honest gesture. It would help a lot to rebuild your role model function and restore your acceptance. Take a tiny break, sleep over it, and I can imagine your reapplication will find support very soon. Everyone makes mistakes. The group needs experienced, qualified contributers like you. <small>&lt;/POV&gt;</small> — <a href="../../../o/c/o/User%7EOcolon_d9b7.html" title="User:Ocolon">Ocolon</a> 22:31, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Besides just agreeing I'd like to say this: I've noticed that Betacommand sometimes writes with confusing language, misses proper punctuation, spells incorrectly, etc. I've also noticed that on talk pages that he sometimes gives very sharp responses to people in an almost uncivil manner. Nevertheless, his BAG activities seem to be mostly clean of these issues, and it's curious. That said, it is important to note that nowhere in the above has anyone posted any problems with his membership with the BAG. But being a role model is important, and thus the reason for the request for #4 (as I see it). The Essjay controversy is interesting. He did a lot of good bot work incidentally, but in the end his other activities were his undoing. Consistency is important. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 22:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if it's not clear I will say outright that reluctantly I do have problems with his membership of BAG at this time. I believe I'm not the only one who is trying to be delicate but who holds this opinion, either. I think if a driving examiner was caught going at 100mph in a 70 zone and already had a history of traffic offences he would be fired because he's not following the standards expected of his examinees. An admin who wheel warred would be desysopped, perhaps only temporarily. It's my opinion that Beta should resign, and it's up to him when he stands again if at all, but I do wish to emphasise that I hold this opinion because he has fallen below the standard required and not as a punishment. Beta has done some great technical work but at this time he's not imho somebody who should be deciding on other people's applications to run bots. I don't think any less of him as a technician or as an editor, and I admire the way he cleaned up the mess so efficiently and quickly, but I believe he's lost my trust for approving bots just now. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 23:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(ec) There is, unfortunately, another aspect of this: trust. (In the interests of full disclosure, I should mention that I commented on Betacommand's RFC as well, though I do not have any negative feelings about Betacommand. I had one comment about a brief interaction that troubled me, and I listed it there. It is not relevant to this, but for full disclosure I wanted to mention that I commented there.) As a user - not an admin, not a bot owner or operator, just a user - I'm not sure that I trust Betacommand's judgement, and that's a hard thing to say about an admin and a user who's contributed so much to the project. Right now, so many of us are reeling over a different hard hit to the project, and we're really (as users, again) looking for admins, bot operators, and people in positions of leadership (as surely both of those are) to be totally above reproach. I do not, unfortunately, have that level of confidence in Betacommand at the moment, and I hate saying that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not, for a single moment, believe that Betacommand acted in bad faith. Unfortunately, I do believe that he exercised extremely bad judgement. When someone has shown bad judgement, it is in their best interest to divest themselves of positions of leadership and immediately begin to rebuild the community's trust in them. I have, unfortunately, been in that situation off-wiki, followed someone's advice to do exactly that, and am a better person for it (and in fact have had many people tell me that the situation actually strengthened their respect for me).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I am not advocating that Betacommand should resign as an administrator - at this point, no one has enough information to recommend that and it seems premature - I do believe that the best thing to do for Betacommand to rebuild trust is to resign from the BAG, come 100% clean about any and all tasks that his bots were doing (which, in fairness, I totally believe he has already done) and commit himself to allowing his bots to run approved tasks and rebuild his strength in the community for a few months. During that time, I would strongly encourage him to focus on moderating his tone, and focus on strengthening his personal interactions. I do not believe that he's intentionally short with people, but I do believe that he thinks quickly and writes that way, and the end result is interpreted as rude. Slow down, take your time, and be polite. This too, shall pass. No one has suggested punitive actions, and I don't believe anyone should. If they do, I would not support them, now would most of the community. Trust can be rebuilt. In this case, I don't think it will take all that long, or be all that uncomfortable. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippe_dffa.html" title="User:Philippe">Philippe Beaudette</a> 23:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The flagging request (the second link shown) explicitly appears to be approval for substing and CfD, but still makes it unclear whether the edits are automatic or semi-automatic. To unconfuse matters, I'd prefer it if the BAG explicitly make a statement concerning these approvals.

<dd>Seeking re-election will never be approved no mater what I do or say, I tend to take a lot of crap for what I do fighting vandals, spammers, and NN groups. and as such even though I am correct in those actions It makes too many people angry. stepping aside will accomplish the same goal, while allowing BAG to determine when I become active again. that cuts down on the anti-beta crowd's ability to reek havoc. and yes I have come to a greater understanding but this is not the place to expound on that (sorry I missed the original post) <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 03:29, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are a number of different issues raised by this (counter-)proposal, none of which seem especially vexacious to deal with individually, but which I reckon would be better "unbundled", and dealt with separately, rather than having any appearance of a "package deal" of some sort. The most pressing issue seems to be the BAG membership/activity question, on which the two proposals each suggest a resolution, and where the two differ. However, this difference is I think, one more of appearance than of practical effect: if Betacommand steps down from the BAG, he won't be able to act to approve or disapprove bot requests, until the rest of the BAG agree to reinstate him; if he becomes inactive from the BAG pending agreement of the rest of the BAG to resume... then essentially the same result. On the difference in <i>appearances</i>, I'd have to say my personal preference, and my judgement as to what's to the long-term good of the project, is for the "cleaner break" resolution. A "weaker-seeming" step (while as I say, functionally equivalent) would appear much less clear-cut, and accordingly do less to maintain general confidence that the BAG membership is "like Caesar's wife" in bot-related matters: as near to being beyond reproach as can reasonably be managed. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 03:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reading Betacommand's proposal above, I'm left with the impression that he still doesn't take the concerns expressed seriously. This is in part demonstrated by his assertion that he'll "step aside" temporarily instead of stepping down, and that he will be inactive until "the objections have been solved". This doesn't sound like a mea culpa, his language suggests that the objections are the real problem, not his actions. This is further bolstered by his assertion that it "cuts down on the anti-beta crowd's ability to reek havoc". The "anti-beta crowd"? This language is very inflammatory and suggests that a larger problem exists. If the BAG is comfortable with this, then I trust their judgment, but I'm not confident that BC has responded to their concerns in the manner they believe he has. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 09:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll be the first BAG member to make a statement on the proposal. To summarize: I agree with Chairboy and Alai. I have a problem. One one hand Betacommand could be a user who is hoodwinking all of us in the same way that Essjay did by claiming to be someone he was not. On the other hand, Betacommand's proposal could be extremely sincere and represent his understanding that he could lose some of his ability to help out and he is showing remorse and trying to save himself. The problem is that I have no way to determine where on the line he is. So what I am left with are his actions, which speak for themselves. This is why I agree strongly with Chairboy, particularly about the "anti-beta crowd". During this entire process there has been nothing but civility by all those involved. He was not blocked because people tried to <i>talk</i> instead of take drastic actions. I've also read his talk page with comments from people genuinely concerned about his massive link removal. And here at this discussion everyone has been trying to give him as much dignity as possible, while not denying what has been shown to be various problems. Just as adminship is supposed to be "not a big deal", I think the same should be for BAG membership which provides some limited additional rights. When it ceases to be in the best interest of Wikipedia, it should be removed. Both Mets and I have had some not-so-unveiled-threats about forcing his removal from BAG and stripping his rights to run bots. We didn't want to go that drastic because we hoped that he would agree to the proposal and voluntarily resign.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The proposal was more than fair, even with the modification that resigning be essentially forced, since he would still be permitted to run bots and scripts <i>despite previous abuse</i>. The fact that Betacommand assumes that he has no chance in reapplying is misguided and shows that at best his emotions are clouding his understanding of this situation. His work with BAG has only <i>one</i> black mark as far as we know in terms of this discussion. He has a chance to use his main account and his bot to act appropriately and if he does that he stands a good chance of success when reapplying to join BAG. There is a lot of goodwill here, possibly deserved, possibly not. I've been one of Betacommand's staunch supporters on BAG, despite some of the other issues, because despite those issues he doesn't seem to make (many) mistakes on BAG. He should be able to see these differences and realize that we are not out to get him, but that we can't ignore the issues either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I myself have <i>often</i> been a pioneer on testing uncharted waters. I once had my bot running on my main user account acting essentially as a spam bot which in the end included having the bot blocked for a time (spam and bot policies were not as well-defined at the time). I learned a lesson from that, and I was granted what amounts to forgiveness, so I appreciate the desire for leniency. If we followed the strict letter of (some of) the law, both myself and Betacommand could have been justifiably banned from Wikipedia, at least for a time. But we <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> and that is why we don't do such drastic actions if we don't have to. Let there be no doubt: Betacommand has violated bot policy, which is in violation of his membership in BAG and in his approval to run bots. His proposal is not acceptable to me for the stated reasons. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 12:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not trying to hoodwink anyone. what I am attempting to do is maintain BCbot's status, handle the concerns that have been raised, and avoid a big mess later when I seek to become an active BAG member again. When BAG thinks its ok to come back I am trying to avoid having to re-hash this discussion in full again. By stepping aside I achieve everyone's goal of BAG membership, and when the time is right I can ask BAG to become active once all the issues raised have been addressed, and it would be appropriate for me to become an active BAG member again, while avoiding the politics of an "election". In reference to the crowd I was trying to avoid politics of the election, because by the nature of what I do I tend to make enemies of users, even though my actions are appropriate. (I delete their pet article have spam sites removed to the users own site or favorite website even though the link is inappropriate). I was seeking a review by BAG for BAG membership while avoiding politics. I hope that makes my position clear. if not feel free to ask more questions. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 13:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The main problem I have with that is that most of the abuse has been at the expense of the community in general. By itself you approving a clone of your own bot was a <i>relatively</i> minor offense, and thus the offenses against BAG are relatively minor. I'm ignoring the fact that violating bot policy looks bad on one's appearance as a BAG member, however, that is also a community issue. Your desire to avoid input from the community is misguided here, although I understand this. The point is that opinions from "kooks" will not be taken seriously, but serious comments from the community will <i>and should be</i>. This is indicated by the fact that more non-BAG members have commented on the precedings than have BAG members. Some may be under the false assumption that this is a BAG-only issue, when it is not. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 14:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>With regards to points 7-9, BetacommandBot shall remain deflagged and all approvals withdrawn with immediate effect.

<dd>Well, we've all had a night to sleep on this issue now (at various intervals around the world). Once again, I have no comment on the technical merits of this proposal, because I'm not qualified to comment. I do, however, think that Kingboy's proposal addresses my concerns as a community member more clearly than anthing thing else I've seen written on this page. I think it spells out clearly what I think and feel. I hope that Betacommand will seriously consider what Kingboy has written; I know it's hard to watch this stuff play out on a wiki in front of you - and in front of the whole world - but I do believe that in the end BC will come out of this as a stronger person and contributor. I don't think this one is likely to dog him for the rest of his life, as I think he fears. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippe_dffa.html" title="User:Philippe">Philippe Beaudette</a> 15:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This may or may not apply, but Betacommand has continued making controversial edits even though they are clearly controversial and there is no pressing rush to make them.

This concerns me greatly because Betacommand appears to be under the impression that because of the various policies he cites that he can continue to enforce them even after being requested to stop by multiple people. This is clearly wrong: When someone asks you to stop, you must do so even if you are in the right. We <i>must</i> work together when there is a conflict.

<dd>I don't really think this is a negotiation any more&#160;:) That said, certainly you would be welcome and entitled to comment on bot approval applications whether a BAG member or not, as is any other Wikipedian. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 05:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(ec)I'm not sure if I should even comment on the "personal insult" point, but I suppose I will. I suggested a community block as a possible correct action if the adminstrators collectively determined it necessary to stop <i>future</i> on-going abuse, and my point clearly had support of those on AN/I. I also clearly stated that it was an option that they should take <i>independent</i> of this discussion here. I never said that they <i>should</i>. I was not suggesting any sort of immediate or punitive block, and I stated as such. If Betacommand started a third deletion spree, he would most definitely be blocked to prevent more damage. Personal insult or no, damage or vandalism to the encyclopedia is not cool and I will not support it, even if people don't like me. For the record, I'm not in favor of a community ban unless it is <i>absolutely necessary</i> to stop further damage to the encyclopedia, however I am too close to this case to make that kind of determination unilaterally. I'll say it again: Betacommand has been very helpful to Wikipedia and I really appreciate that, but that doesn't mean we can just ignore anything bad that happens. After much discussion, removal from BAG for a fair amount of time is great idea because it provides time to see whether or not BC has truely learned from this experience. Perhaps he'll be surprised at my support later, although I wouldn't know why that would be shocking, considering all the good work that he has done so far. And I encourage him to stay active on BRFA, as he is very valuable. Nevertheless, the time for negotiation is over. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 14:53, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm pleased to see Betacommand accepting, clearly, some responsibility for his actions. I think it might be a nice gesture were he to make a similar statement (on AN/I) that he understands the gravity of his actions and personally apologizes for the difficulty it has caused, but that's clearly his own decision - it's not for me to request or demand (this was just a general observation and suggestion). Personally, I think that BC's sixty day suggested "lapse" period is sufficient, if minimal, but I also think that's not a debate I choose to enter. However, I want to be sure that neither he nor anyone else thinks that's a punitive action - I think that it could be an incredible opportunity for him to take that time to learn how to handle similar situations in the future. I encourage Betacommand to discuss any large batch edits that he makes with someone he trusts who can evaluate the situation both technically and politically.</dd>

<dd>I would also like to say that I hope that this is settled very quickly (I would personally like to see this all closed up in the next 24 hours). One of the things that I love about wiki is the incredible warmth and caring for other people that is often demonstrated, and I can't imagine how difficult all of this must be, emotionally, for Betacommand. I think, then, that the proper action is to begin to wrap this up so that he can stop worrying about it and we can all put this energy into other things. For the record, I think the idea of a community sanction/block/ban, which some have nervously brought up is well outside the scope of reasonable response to these actions. Blocking/banning is our most radical steps and although I don't want to minimize the actions, I do not believe they rise to the necessary level for invoking that "nuclear option."</dd>

<dd>I also think that if Betacommand takes this time to work on rebuilding the community's trust, I think it behooves all involved to consider that when he reapplies (obviously, "applies" isn't the correct word, but I can't think of the right one at the moment) for BAG. And one final thought: I want to reinforce, as have so many before me, that Betacommand's work on wiki has been 95% brilliant and 5% challenging. It would be a terrible shame if people did not continue to recognize the good work he does, as well as comment on areas that need development. This community "forgives and forgets" more than any other I have ever seen (I am not including "trolls" in my definition of community, only those reliable and stable editors) and I know that if Betacommand works as hard at rebuilding the community's trust as he does building tools, he will be forgiven and all will be forgotten. I wish him nothing but the very best, and I trust that's true for all of you as well. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippe_dffa.html" title="User:Philippe">Philippe Beaudette</a> 07:00, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, a very thought out and great response from Philippe. I agree with the proposal and response above except for one point. I think that BetacommandBot's approvals should all be withdrawn and Betacommand should be encouraged to reapply immediately. This is solely so that all the approved tasks are clearly documented in the case of any future controversy. —<span style="color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M<small>ETS</small>501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 14:41, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Mets that all should be withdrawn so we can have a permanent record of exactly what the approvals are used for. I also second the motion to close this. Before the above section was closed, I did make another comment regarding the "personal insult" feeling that BC had for me, and I encourage him to read it. That said, since BC feels personally insulted by me (for unjustified reasons I think), I ask that another BAG member execute the proposal so that it doesn't look like I harbor any resentment or bad feelings. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">RM</a> 14:56, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have closed the discussion on the above debate. Here are my findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Betacommand has ceased to be a BAG member but he is free to help out here. He cannot approve of any bot.</li>
<li>Betacommandbot will remain unflagged for now. To regain the flag, Betacommand needs to put in a new request which needs to be approved.</li>
<li>After 60 days, Betacommand can reapply for BAG membership.</li>

<dd>They are a little ambiguous, it really depends on how much traffic it is going to be using for the other tasks in my opinion.

<p>I've been in quite a long discussion that with <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> at <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html#High_speed_editing" title="User talk:Calton">User_talk:Calton#High_speed_editing</a>, regarding high-speedy editing (&gt;6-8/min) sustained. This is mostly in regard to mass tagging talk-pages that they think should be speedy deleted as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-talk_ab3f.html" title="Template:Db-talk">db-talk</a>}}. These are mostly in the Image_talk: namespace, and are causing log flooding of the Image_talk recent changes log. (consuming &gt;75% of the filtered log). I've suggested to them that they register another accont for this, so that we can bot flag it. They seem pretty adamant about not doing this. Most of their edits are valid nominations, and are being deleted, so history and recent chagnes log will be hard to review.

<dd>I thaught of that at first, but we do flag bots that are manually assisted, and basically all this editor is doing is mass-tagging based on a list that they are generating in preview mode.

<dd>I'd have thought it better to avoid CAT:CSD altogether, they are usually a lower priority than the article pages. Why not batch up a set of links onto a page and include a reference on the CAT:CSD page. Deleting those is usually a no-brainer, look at the article tab, see it's red, delete. A list page would enable however many need to be added in a single edit, and a small amount of maintenance to remove the red-links once deleted. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 08:25, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with pgk, and with the suggestions offered by xaosflux on Calton's talk page - a single list shuld be created with a custion speedy deletion tag on it, explaining that admins should check and delete items on the list. If he won't do this, then we have the unattractive option of a bot flag and a flooded <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>, or, failing that, we may need to consider a block. This all depends on Calton becoming more open to suggestions, which could take a while to start happenning.

<p>As is often the way on Wikipedia, nobody bothered to inform BAG and there's hardly any mention of the fact that the bot issues have to an extent been dealt with. Betacommand has already been sanctioned by being removed from the approvals group. (However, the issues being raised at the RFAR go beyond what we dealt with, and the arbitrators have voted to accept the case).</p>
<p>Anyway, I think one of us should post a link to the discussion which was held here and perhaps a synopsis. A draft could perhaps be written on this page first.</p>
