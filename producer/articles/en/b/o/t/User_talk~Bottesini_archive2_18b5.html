<p>Dear Bottesini,</p>
<p>Thanks for the welcome message. I am on a steep learning curve, but hope I can contribute to this excellent internet resource. <a href="../../../g/s/t/User%7EGSTQ21C_3b91.html" title="User:GSTQ21C">GSTQ21C</a> 22:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the welcome message, and since you said not to be afraid to ask... How am I doing so far? (my new articles are: LView, CoolMoon_Corp, AutoFreeCell, and Leonardo_H_Loureiro)?

<p>Bottesini, Thanks for the page of useful links. I hope that fellow wikipedians find my edits and additions useful and informative, and the helpful links you provided should help me create better content on wikipedia as a whole. I still have a lot to learn if I'm going to become a regular contributor. If you have any helpful suggestions, gripes, constructive (or non-constructive) criticism, please add it to my talk page. (BTW, how do I customize my signature to create a link to my talk page?)

<p>Thanks, I've added the copyright tags. I would like to remove tags, though, and discuss/justify their removal in the talk page. I want to remove the tag that questions the importance of the LView article, by showing other comparable WikipediA articles. Is that, pretty much, the way to do it? Thanks!

<dd>Bottesini, I am sorry that you feel that way about your very useful tools. However, the idea of wikipedia is spreading knowledge, and upon posting your tools to your user page you have agreed to license them under the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>. That being said, as you have requested the removal nicely, I will remove the majority of the copied tools. I hope you do not mind if I leave the create new message tool until such time as I can come up with my own method of accomplishing the same task. <a href="../../../a/g/o/User%7EAgonizing_Fury_c7d3.html" title="User:Agonizing Fury">Agonizing Fury</a> 23:54, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I certainly don't disagree with other people using my creations for ideas, and the leave message gizmo box, I could really care less about, but my suggestions are not a tool, but something I personally came up with that applies to my own views. — <i><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_7f4b.html" title="User:Bottesini"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkgreen; font-weight:bold">ßottesiηi</span></a></i> <sup><a href="../../../b/o/t/User_talk%7EBottesini_40af.html" title="User talk:Bottesini">Tell me what's up</a></sup> 00:13, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case, I misunderstood the tone of your message as hostile and appologize if the tone of my message seemed hostile as well. It was only ever my intent to keep the Leave me a message link, however due to the fact that the code you used was a little beyond my wiki knowledge, I had to play with it a little to not have the rest of your work in there. Again I apoligize for misunderstading the tone of your message. Like I said I have a lot to learn on wiki. <a href="../../../a/g/o/User%7EAgonizing_Fury_c7d3.html" title="User:Agonizing Fury">Agonizing Fury</a> 00:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unnecessary edits and personal attacks are being made by <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> and we feel that this person should no longer edit this topic. This person was even told once by an administrator named <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">Mark Gallagher</a> to not revert the page until he spoke with him in private. (Refer to edit history.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference:</li>
</ul>
<p>Purported romantic interests</p>
<p>1) Robert de Niro—the "source" for this is an unsourced claim in a gossip column that they had dinner once; <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGODDESSY_7d8b.html" title="User:GODDESSY">User:GODDESSY</a> uses this to verify that Adams and de Niro were "involved." 2) Joan Jett and Marga Gomez—the "source" for the claim that Adams dated these women was once again a gossip column, which didn't substantiate anything more than the writer "heard" that Adams was seen out with them.</p>
<p>I don't consider either of these to be verified (at least not beyond rumors, or the fact that Adams claims to have had those relationships), and I think GODDESSY's insistence on including them smacks of name-dropping, serving Adams' PR interests by linking her to more famous people, rather than providing relevant and substantive information. Hence, I believe the references should be removed. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 20:29, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Again, it was proven that the notable people mentioned in the article were associated with Adams and even though the newspaper clippings should probably remain removed, the fact that the comments were proven to be correct should be enough to allow them to remain.</p>
<p>Rather than reverting them, we made recent edits according to online publications and would like for them to remain.</p>

It seems as if the people removing these comments are taking this way too personal, refusing to acknowledge the fact that the facts were provided and it is not uncommon for celebrities to often date other celebrities.</p>
<p>As most people know, it is important to add comments if they are facts, but it is equally important not to remove comments previously proven to be facts as well.</p>
<p>Also, personal comments made on the discussion page by a banned user are consistently added back again after we remove them. This is disrespectful and we would like for them to be removed permanently.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, one thing about all of those sources listed is that it is very debatable if any of them are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> as defined for the purpose of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>.

<p>The opposing users regarding the article about Stephanie Adams are repeatedly making personal attacks about us, the people who work for GODDESSY, as well as the person the article is about (Stephanie Adams).</p>
<p>This alone is reason for them to no longer be able to edit this article, as their personal opinions and growing hatred is preventing them from being able to provide the facts to the article accordingly and justly.</p>
<p>Thay have been warned, yet their attacks (on us as well as the person in the article) are getting increasingly worse and should they be able to edit this topic, they will slaughter it.</p>

<p>Hi! Good luck on the RfA - it's a tough process, so don't get too perturbed if people are very stringent in their comments. To that effect, you may want to proofread your replies to the questions, as there are a couple of spelling/grammar mistakes that are likely to irritate the anal-retentive types like myself! Specifically, 'a lot' is always two words, never one, and 'it's' only ever has an apostrophe when it is used as an abbreviation of "it is", which isn't this case here.

<p>I've looked over your past edits, and you seem to be replacing several valid links with piped links. You may not realize that links like [[talk]]ing work the same exact way as [[talk|talking]], and are actually preferred. Both will produce a link with the text "talking" linking to the page "talk" (<a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk.html" title="Talk">talking</a>). Note that this works for any suffix, not only -ing. —<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">M</a><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_Esperanza_c07a.html" title="User:Mets501/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">ts501</a><small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501"><span style="cursor:help;">talk</span></a></sup></small> 22:16, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about taking awhile to get back to you. The reason I didn't approve you is that the <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> requires 500 <i>article</i> edits to use. While you have 1516 edits, only 373 of them were to articles, putting you under the limit. My apologies for not replying sooner, I was busy deleting some personal info from a page's history. Please do re-apply for the AWB as soon as you get 500 article edits. Good luck, and happy editing! <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 01:53, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bottesini, thanks for the cordial welcome message! I'm working on expanding the WKCR stub into a full article and while I'm doing my best to make it adhere to the highest standards possible, I feel as though it's noticeably un-wiki-like in comparision to other pages. Might you be willing to take a look at it and give me a few suggestions as to how I might clean it up and expand it?</p>

<dd>Posting a message is not vandalism. The revert you were referring to was a removal of "Chipseh sucks." from user:chipseh's (an extant user) page. Your talk page is designed to have messages posted on it by other users. — <i><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_7f4b.html" title="User:Bottesini"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkgreen; font-weight:bold">ßottesiηi</span></a></i> <sup><a href="../../../b/o/t/User_talk%7EBottesini_40af.html" title="User talk:Bottesini">Tell me what's up</a></sup> 21:18, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
