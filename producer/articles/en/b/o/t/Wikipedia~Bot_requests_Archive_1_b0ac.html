<p>I've just discovered that the page <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_of_Brescia_cc03.html" title="Province of Brescia">Province of Brescia</a> lists about 200 communes in this Italian province. Each of those communes has its own page, and on each of them is a handy-dandy table (not a template, sadly), listing region, province, location, etc etc. In each case, "province" links to the page [[Provinces of Italy], but region links to <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_Germany_8f7a.html" title="Regions of Germany">Regions of <i>Germany</i></a> rather than <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_Italy_8e3b.html" title="Regions of Italy">Regions of Italy</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Read-only random-page getter for statistical stuff</span></h2>
<p>Hello. I don't know if this is the right place but here we are. I'm thinking about running a read-only robot to get random pages for the purpose of doing statistical analysis on them. Probably the edit history will be just as interesting as the page text. I don't think I could ever get more than 1 page per second, which iirc is below the limit placed on spiders (can't find the rules governing spiders at the moment). Does that seem OK in general?

<li>I extremely discourage the mass-moving of stuff to Wiktionary. Many entries are more than definitions and some of them are poorly written. I've spent some time at Wiktionary, and unlike Wikipedia, they don't seem to accept just any kind of crap. This kind of action would create a lot of work for them. Personally, I would not create an entry (in Wiktionary) for <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balloon_modelling.html" title="Balloon modelling">Balloon modelling</a> because it's just modelling with balloons. There's no need to define <a href="../../../4/4/_/44_gallon_drum.html" title="44 gallon drum">44 gallon drum</a> as a drum that can hold 44 gallons, it's obviously implied in the name. Besides, that entry should stay on Wikipedia, because it's more than a definition. Sadly, <a href="../../../c/o/p/Category%7ECopy_to_Wiktionary_3d71.html" title="Category:Copy to Wiktionary">Category:Copy to Wiktionary</a> is not being used correctly, I think, because it's a lot easier to take care of inappropriate stuff by tagging it as a move, removing it from a category and forgetting about it than having to deal with VfDs, merging it, or expanding it. But that's Wikipedia's problem and moving it all elsewhere is not a solution. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJag123_5e35.html" title="User:Jag123">jag123</a> 18:11, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

The question we need to deal with is not should we send them over, but what to do with them in our system once they've been sent over. I would recommend creating a new category (and template) named something like <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETranswikied_to_Wiktionary_8320.html" title="Category:Transwikied to Wiktionary">Category: Transwikied to Wiktionary</a>.

<p>Is it possible that a bot could be created that would put punctuation inside the quotation marks and replace short dashes (-) with long dashs (—)? <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a> 20:12, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Moving punctuation inside quotes is a bad idea. Punctuation inside quotes is appropriate for some types of quotation, such as spoken dialogue. ("I say!" he said.) But it's often wrong in technical articles. (To get a directory listing, you type "ls", not "ls,".)</dd>
<dd>For dashes you need to be careful. Em-dashes are inappropriate for ranges of numbers or dates or for minus signs. And hyphens appear in so many contexts (<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">ISO 8601</a> dates, hyphenated words and names, prefixes and suffixes, chemical formulae) that a naive bot could wreak havoc... <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 20:30, 2004 Jul 2 (UTC)

<dd>You believe correctly.

He said, "British English is this way". She replied, "Americans do it thus." This is also true with similar punctuation marks (such as brackets). That's how it's done in Britain (though in America they're more commonly known as parentheses, and punctuated thus.) Note that <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Quotation_marks" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Quotation_marks</a> recommends British usage in this matter for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnanel_b5e3.html" title="User:Marnanel">Marnanel</a> 22:18, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<dd>That's not right. In quoted dialogue in British English, punctuation goes inside the quotes, the same as in American English. "British English is this way too," he said.

<p>I strongly oppose any bot whose purpose is to fix punctuation, grammar, or spelling in an automated way. There are just too many instances where automated changes are wrong due to context. (There are some very funny jokes out there where someone allowed a spell checker to respell things wrong.) Not only that, I strongly oppose any even semi-automated changes to standardize spelling or punctuation based on a single country's standard. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 04:58, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. I think an interactive bot, using an international English dictionary including jargon, understanding Wikipedia markup, looking for correctly-spelled words that are improbable in their context, and giving the user context and consent over every request like the disambiguation bot does, would be a highly effective and safe means of spell-checking articles. Admittedly, no one has written such a thing, but someone very well could. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Derrick Coetzee</a> 16:48, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Do it in conjunction with other edits if you want to, but not just for its own sake.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Duplicate content in articles</span></h2>
<p>Per <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28technical%29_e812.html#duplicate_content_in_articles" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)#duplicate_content_in_articles</a>, there seem to be not altogether infrequent occurrences of wholesale duplication of article text (not currently known whether this is due to a sofware bug or user error). Automatically identifying articles that have duplicated content would help in both fixing the affected articles and (perhaps) figuring out how this is actually occurring. One approach might be to scan articles for multiple, identical, headers. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> 15:00, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed for a process like this which will use the bulk of wikipedia text you should download the cur dump and process it locally.

After it's fixed, it would be swell if someone who gets an offline copy of the database would write a script to look for articles with duplicate content. With over 600,000 articles I'd be willing to bet there are at least a few with as yet undetected content duplication. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> July 6, 2005 01:24 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So Rick says <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:275">Bugzilla:275</a> was apparently causing this, and it's fixed. Bugzilla is down right now, so I have no idea about that. In any case, he asked if I could run an analysis on an offline copy of the database to look for these duplicated sections. I thought that was an interesting problem and that a solution should be easy enough to whip up. (Plus I'm really procrastinating on my job hunt.) Well, for the benefit of posterity, let me say that just looking for duplicate headers (which was my first thought, as well), does not work well. It produces a huge number of false positives. The next most obvious thing to do is to do a brute-force check for duplicated text. As a cheap approximation to doing this, I tried chopping page text into three-word chunks, and seeing how many of those chunks occur more than once. I spent several minutes watching it analyze a single article. I phoomped my code, and I got it running fast enough to cover the whole database in maybe 5 hours or so. But this was also producing a very long list. So, I decided to chain these filters, and only look for duplicated triplets in pages that have duplicated headers. This completed in about 20 minutes and seems to have produced a relatively useful listing. I have posted it at <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicated_sections_5e7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicated sections">Wikipedia:Duplicated sections</a>.
