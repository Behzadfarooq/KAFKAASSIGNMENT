<p>Jon Bon Jovi began to play piano and guitar at thirteen, taking lessons from his neighbour, Al Perinello. At that same age, Bon Jovi founded his first band, called Raze. Jon enrolled in an all-boys Catholic school <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Joseph_High_School_00a9.html" title="St. Joseph High School">St. Joseph High School</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metuchen%2C_New_Jersey_8ecf.html" title="Metuchen, New Jersey">Metuchen, New Jersey</a> but left after pleading his case to his parents; he wanted to attend public school. He went on to attend Sayreville War Memorial High School. At sixteen, Bon Jovi met <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bryan_aff4.html" title="David Bryan">David Bryan</a> (born David Bryan Rashbaum) and founded a 12-piece cover band with him named <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_City_Expressway_6f90.html" title="Atlantic City Expressway">Atlantic City Expressway</a>. They played at New Jersey clubs, even though they were minors. Still in his teens, Bon Jovi played in the band John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones, playing New Jersey clubs like "The Fast Lane" and opening for known acts in the area.</p>
<p>By the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, out of school and working part-time, one of his jobs being in a shoestore, Jon took a job at the <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar_Studios_8f9b.html" title="Avatar Studios">Power Station Studios</a>, a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> recording facility where his cousin, Tony Bongiovi(the authentic spelling), was the co-owner.Jon made several <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_%28music%29.html" title="Demo (music)">demos</a> (including one produced by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Squier_1c09.html" title="Billy Squier">Billy Squier</a>) and sent them out to many record companies, but failed to make an impact.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Bon Jovi visited the local radio station WAPP 103.5FM "The Apple" in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Success%2C_New_York_216a.html" title="Lake Success, New York">Lake Success, New York</a>. He spoke directly to the D.J., Chip Hobart, who suggested Bon Jovi let WAPP include the song "Runaway" on a compilation album of local homegrown talent. Bon Jovi was reluctant but eventually gave them the song on which Bon Jovi had used studio musicians to play on the track "Runaway" (which was written in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>). The studio musicians who helped record "Runaway" were known as "The All Star Review." They were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Sabo_30da.html" title="Dave Sabo">Dave Sabo</a> (guitar)</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Pierce_%28musician%29_91ca.html" title="Tim Pierce (musician)">Tim Pierce</a> (guitar)</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Bittan_c0d0.html" title="Roy Bittan">Roy Bittan</a> (keyboards)</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_LaRocka_a9ce.html" title="Frankie LaRocka">Frankie LaRocka</a> (drums)</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_McDonald_%28musician%29_5958.html" title="Hugh McDonald (musician)">Hugh McDonald</a> (bass)</li>
</ul>
<p>The song began to get airplay in the New York metro area, and then other sister stations in major markets began to play the song. Suddenly, all the record label A&amp;R execs who had passed on the demo they had heard were scrambling to find out who this unsigned artist was. WAPP was doing showcases -- Bon Jovi now desperately needed a band. The soon-to-be-members of the band had crossed paths in their earlier days, but the current lineup didn't come together until March of 1983. Bon Jovi gave David Bryan a call, who in turn called bassist <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_John_Such_ed2e.html" title="Alec John Such">Alec John Such</a> and experienced drummer <a href="../../../t/i/c/Tico_Torres_0407.html" title="Tico Torres">Tico Torres</a>.</p>
<p>Tapped to play lead guitar was Bon Jovi's neighbor, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Sabo_30da.html" title="Dave Sabo">Dave Sabo</a> (a.k.a. The Snake), who would later form the group Skid Row. One night after a show, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Sambora_8079.html" title="Richie Sambora">Richie Sambora</a> found Bon Jovi backstage and told him that he should be the guitarist. Bon Jovi wrote him off and didn't think much of it but told him to learn the material and show up for rehearsal. Sambora was early and knew the material and Bon Jovi was impressed; in that moment, Sambora became the band's lead guitarist and a musical dynamic duo was born.</p>
<p>Before joining the group, Sambora had toured with <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Cocker_d4bb.html" title="Joe Cocker">Joe Cocker</a>, played with a group called Mercy and had just been called up to audition for <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss_%28band%29.html" title="Kiss (band)">Kiss</a>. He also played on the album <i>Lessons</i> with the band Message, which was re-released on <a href="../../../c/d/_/CD_4170.html" title="CD">CD</a> through Long Island Records in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. Message was originally signed to <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swan_Song_Records_4e44.html" title="Swan Song Records">Swan Song Records</a> label, although the album was never released.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/i/c/Tico_Torres_0407.html" title="Tico Torres">Tico Torres</a> was also an experienced musician, having recorded with <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Davis_4d69.html" title="Miles Davis">Miles Davis</a> and playing live with Phantom's Opera, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Marvelettes_55b3.html" title="The Marvelettes">The Marvelettes</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a>. He had played on 26 records and had recently recorded with Franke and the Knockouts (a Jersey band with hit singles in the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>).</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bryan_aff4.html" title="David Bryan">David Bryan</a> was a natural recruit. He had quit the band he and Bon Jovi founded and went to college for pre-med studies. While in college, he realized he wanted to pursue music full-time, eventually being accepted to <a href="../../../j/u/i/Juilliard_School_8547.html" title="Juilliard School">Juilliard School</a>, the prestigious New York music school. When Bon Jovi called his friend and said he was putting together a band and a record deal looked like it was about to become a reality, Bryan followed Bon Jovi's lead.</p>
<p>The Bon Jovi lineup, which would not change for a decade, was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jon Bon Jovi (lead vocals, rhythm guitar)</li>
<li>Richie Sambora (lead guitar, backing vocals)</li>
<li>David Bryan (keyboard, backing vocals)</li>
<li>Tico Torres (drums, percussion)</li>

<p>Atlantic and Mercury came calling. Once Bon Jovi had put together his band and began playing showcases and opening for local talent, they caught the attention of record executive <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Shulman_509e.html" title="Derek Shulman">Derek Shulman</a>, who signed John to Mercury Records, part of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/PolyGram_2ed5.html" title="PolyGram">PolyGram</a> company. John Bongiovi then de-ethnicized his last name, changing the gi in Bongiovi to a j to make it Bon Jovi, and then removed the h in his first name to make it Jon. He re-emerged as Jon Bon Jovi.</p>
<p>With the help of their new manager <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc_McGhee_83a2.html" title="Doc McGhee">Doc McGhee</a>, the band's debut album, <i><a href="../../../b/o/n/Bon_Jovi_%28album%29_12fe.html" title="Bon Jovi (album)">Bon Jovi</a></i>, was released on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_21.html" title="January 21">January 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. The album went <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_certification_8715.html" title="RIAA certification">gold</a> in the US (sales of over 500,000) and was also released in the UK. The group found themselves opening for <a href="../../../z/z/_/ZZ_Top_cd63.html" title="ZZ Top">ZZ Top</a> at the Madison Square Garden (before their first album had been released), and for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scorpions_fa79.html" title="The Scorpions">Scorpions</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss_%28band%29.html" title="Kiss (band)">Kiss</a> in Europe. They also made an appearance on <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bandstand_91e6.html" title="American Bandstand">American Bandstand</a></i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, Bon Jovi's second album <i><a href="../../../7/8/0/7800%C2%B0_Fahrenheit_4293.html" title="7800° Fahrenheit">7800° Fahrenheit</a></i> was released, but the response was poor. The leading British metal magazine <i><a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerrang%21.html" title="Kerrang!">Kerrang!</a></i>, who had been very positive about the debut record, called the album "a pale imitation of the Bon Jovi we have got to know and learned to love." Jon Bon Jovi himself later said it could have and should have been better. The band members, in interviews, have said they will not perform live any song off that album anymore.</p>

<p>The turning point came when they brought in songwriter <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Child_1dc6.html" title="Desmond Child">Desmond Child</a> for their third album, <i><a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_When_Wet_6398.html" title="Slippery When Wet">Slippery When Wet</a></i>. With Child co-writing many of their hits on this and future albums the band shot to super-stardom around the world with songs such as "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You_Give_Love_a_Bad_Name_%28song%29_8211.html" title="You Give Love a Bad Name (song)">You Give Love a Bad Name</a>", "<a href="../../../l/i/v/Livin%27_On_A_Prayer_1010.html" title="Livin' On A Prayer">Livin' On A Prayer</a>", and "<a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanted_Dead_or_Alive_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_92ed.html" title="Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)">Wanted Dead or Alive</a>". Bon Jovi has said the album was named after the ubiquitous highway warning signs, but Bryan has said the following about the album's title: "During the recording of the record we frequently wound up in a striptease club where incredibly good looking girls were putting water and soap on each other. They became so slippery because of that, that you couldn't hold on to them even if you wanted to really bad. 'Slippery when wet!' one of us yelled out and the rest of us immediately knew: that had to be the title of the new album! Originally we were going to put a picture of some huge breasts, the really big ones, on the cover; but when the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parents_Music_Resource_Center_4dac.html" title="Parents Music Resource Center">PMRC</a> (a moral board under command of <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipper_Gore_41b2.html" title="Tipper Gore">Tipper Gore</a>, wife of former <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_of_the_United_States_d4a8.html" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President of the United States</a> <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>) found out we were in big trouble. So we made it into a very decent cover."</p>
<p>The album has sold in excess of 26 million copies worldwide since its release in late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. On the tour that followed, singer Bon Jovi began having vocal difficulties. The extremely high notes and unrelenting schedule threatened to damage his voice permanently. With the help of a <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocal_coach.html" title="Vocal coach">vocal coach</a>, he made it through the tour. Bon Jovi has tended to sing slightly lower pitches since then.</p>

<p>The next album from Bon Jovi was <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_%28album%29_16a6.html" title="New Jersey (album)">New Jersey</a></i> released in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. The album was recorded very shortly after the tour for <i>Slippery</i>, because the band wanted to prove that they were not just a one hit wonder. The resulting album is a fan favorite, a pop-rock masterpiece, and a mammoth commercial success, with hit songs such as "<a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Medicine_%28song%29_2595.html" title="Bad Medicine (song)">Bad Medicine</a>", "<a href="../../../l/a/y/Lay_Your_Hands_On_Me_8d94.html" title="Lay Your Hands On Me">Lay Your Hands On Me</a>" and "<a href="../../../i/27/l/I%27ll_Be_There_for_You_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_e8b8.html" title="I'll Be There for You (Bon Jovi song)">I'll Be There For You</a>", which are still nightly stalwarts in their live repertoire. <i>New Jersey</i> was a commercial smash and became the first hard rock album to spawn five Top Ten singles. "<a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Medicine_%28song%29_2595.html" title="Bad Medicine (song)">Bad Medicine</a>" and "<a href="../../../i/27/l/I%27ll_Be_There_for_You_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_e8b8.html" title="I'll Be There for You (Bon Jovi song)">I'll Be There For You</a>" both hit number one, and "<a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_to_Be_My_Baby_8e30.html" title="Born to Be My Baby">Born to Be My Baby</a>" (#3), "<a href="../../../l/a/y/Lay_Your_Hands_On_Me_8d94.html" title="Lay Your Hands On Me">Lay Your Hands On Me</a> (#7), and "<a href="../../../l/i/v/Living_in_Sin_%28song%29_7b55.html" title="Living in Sin (song)">Living in Sin</a>" (#9) rounded out the list. "Blood on Blood" was also popular among fans. <i>New Jersey</i> was supported by video releases such as <i>New Jersey: The Videos</i> and <i>Access All Areas</i>, as well as a massive 18-month tour, originally billed "The Jersey Syndicate Tour". In 1989, the band headlined the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow_Music_Peace_Festival_9a79.html" title="Moscow Music Peace Festival">Moscow Music Peace Festival</a>. Despite the band achieving massive success, <i>New Jersey</i> almost led to the end of the band as they went straight back out on the road so soon after the heavy touring for their previous album. This constant living on the road almost destroyed the strong bond between Jon Bon Jovi and Sambora. As mentioned in <i>Behind the Music</i>, the band members note that at the end of the tour, each band member went their separate way and departed in separate jets. It was during this time that Sambora offered the lead singer position to Billy Rogers, known for his hit single with Ike Turner, I'm Blue. However, the band made it through and took a healthy break before their next studio effort. To date, the album has sold 18 million copies worldwide.</p>

<p>Between <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, the band members went their separate ways for a while to refocus before writing and recording their next album. This time off also helped them determine where Bon Jovi would fit within the rapidly changing music scene upon their return. Jon Bon Jovi recorded a solo album, a soundtrack to the movie "<a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Guns_II_6154.html" title="Young Guns II">Young Guns II</a>" (in which he also appeared for less than a second), more commonly known as <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaze_of_Glory_0bd5.html" title="Blaze of Glory">Blaze of Glory</a></i>. Released in 1990, the album featured high profile guests such as: <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldo_Nova_cb52.html" title="Aldo Nova">Aldo Nova</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Richard_892a.html" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Beck_5473.html" title="Jeff Beck">Jeff Beck</a>, among others. The album fared well commercially and received very positive reviews and quickly achieved platinum status. The title track, "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaze_of_Glory_%28song%29_2ab2.html" title="Blaze of Glory (song)">Blaze of Glory</a>", hit number one on the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_Hot_100_a584.html" title="Billboard Hot 100">Billboard Hot 100</a> and earned Jon an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for Best Song, but he did not win the award. That same year, however, "Blaze of Glory" was awarded a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Globe_486e.html" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a>.</p>
<p>Sambora, with the help of Tico Torres and David Bryan, also released a solo album entitled <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Stranger_In_This_Town_001e.html" title="Stranger In This Town">Stranger In This Town</a></i>, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>. The album had a predominant blues influence to it and featured a performance by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Clapton_2d16.html" title="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> on the song "Mr. Bluesman". David Bryan also recorded a soundtrack for the horror movie <i>The Netherworld</i>, which was the brighter part of that year after he was hospitalized with an illness due to a South American parasite. Such took a fall off of his motorcycle which injured his bass-playing hand, forcing him to develop a whole new way to hold and play his instrument.</p>

<p>The band returned with the album <i><a href="../../../k/e/e/Keep_the_Faith_af8e.html" title="Keep the Faith">Keep the Faith</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. The album, which was produced by <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Rock_6998.html" title="Bob Rock">Bob Rock</a>, featured a more mature sound and lyrical content than any of their previous efforts. Their fans were pleasantly surprised and the album became a moderate hit amidst the rise of <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge.html" title="Grunge">grunge</a>. Its most recognizable tunes were the hit singles "<a href="../../../b/e/d/Bed_of_Roses_%28song%29_5f43.html" title="Bed of Roses (song)">Bed of Roses</a>", "<a href="../../../k/e/e/Keep_the_Faith_%28song%29_6dd2.html" title="Keep the Faith (song)">Keep the Faith</a>" and "<a href="../../../i/n/_/In_These_Arms_4ff9.html" title="In These Arms">In These Arms</a>", which all hit the <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a> in the U.S. Some other songs on the album were released as singles in other parts of the world, mainly the fan favorite epic, "<a href="../../../d/r/y/Dry_County_%28song%29_0404.html" title="Dry County (song)">Dry County</a>" the hooky "I Believe", and the crowd favorite "<a href="../../../i/27/l/I%27ll_Sleep_When_I%27m_Dead_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_4f7d.html" title="I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (Bon Jovi song)">I'll Sleep When I'm Dead</a>." This album is also notable for being the first in a string of subsequent albums for Bon Jovi which proved more popular worldwide than in the U.S. The album went double platinum in the U.S., but has sold much more worldwide.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Bon Jovi released a "greatest hits" album entitled <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_Road_a731.html" title="Cross Road">Cross Road</a></i>, which also contained two new tracks: the hit singles "<a href="../../../a/l/w/Always_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_659e.html" title="Always (Bon Jovi song)">Always</a>" and "Someday I'll Be Saturday Night", as well as a new, updated rendition of "Livin' on a Prayer" entitled "Prayer '94" available only on the U.S. version. The diction of 'prayer' in the new version was altered due to a mixing error, and is heard as "'rayer" on some pressings. The song "Always" was originally written for a soundtrack to the film <i><a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeo_Is_Bleeding_6dc0.html" title="Romeo Is Bleeding">Romeo Is Bleeding</a></i>, but after seeing (and disliking) the movie, the band decided not to lend the song to the producers, and instead released it on "Cross Road". The video for "Always" featured <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carla_Gugino_cabd.html" title="Carla Gugino">Carla Gugino</a>, an actress known for her roles in several TV shows' and films such as <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_In_Law_5779.html" title="Son In Law">Son In Law</a></i> and actor <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Noseworthy_ace0.html" title="Jack Noseworthy">Jack Noseworthy</a>, best known for his role in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> film <i><a href="../../../u/-/5/U-571.html" title="U-571">U-571</a></i>."Always," spent thirty-two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 and became one of Bon Jovi's all-time hugest hits.The song peaked at #4 on the US charts and at #1 in countries across <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> and in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The single sold very well, going platinum in the U.S.</p>
<p>That same year, bassist Alec John Such left the band, causing the first and only lineup change since Bon Jovi began. Hugh McDonald, who was the bassist on "Runaway", unofficially replaced Such as bassist. Although, to this day, there is still speculation on if Alec was fired or left on his own accord. Jon has claimed that due to being intoxicated on stage, too many mistakes were being made by the bass player. Mistakes could be covered up whilst in the studio, but were harder to cover live on stage. Such denied many of these claims in an interview soon after his departure, but later admitted there was some truth to them. Jon has made it public that there has been contact between him and other band members recently. Alec even rejoined the band on stage for one song ("Wanted Dead or Alive") during their "homecoming" show at <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giants_Stadium_3dd9.html" title="Giants Stadium">Giants Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. While he has not been officially replaced, Hugh McDonald has handled studio and live bass duties since then, with rumours he recorded bass on previous albums. Jon Bon Jovi said, regarding the departure of Such: "Of course it hurts. But I learned to accept and respect it. The fact that I'm a workaholic, studio in, studio out, stage on, stage off, want to be dealing with music day and night, doesn't mean everyone else has to adjust to that pace. Alec wanted to quit for a while now so it didn't come as a complete surprise."</p>

<p>With the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> album <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/These_Days_%28Bon_Jovi_album%29_321d.html" title="These Days (Bon Jovi album)">These Days</a></i>, Bon Jovi took the mature rock sound they had developed on <i>Keep the Faith</i> further. The record as a whole was darker and more downbeat than the usual Bon Jovi fare, with some songs showing R&amp;B influences. As a result,These Days went Platinum in US and topped the British charts.Despite critical kudos<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>,it spun off only one hit single in the US, "This Ain't A Love Song".Nevertheless, the other tracks proved sufficiently popular to garner various successful European singles, including "Hey God", "Something for the Pain", "Lie to Me", and the title track "These Days".In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Bon Jovi claimed in an interview with the German Bravo magazine that, due to the overwhelming success of the These Days Tour, the album had sold in excess of 20 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>It was on the These Days Tour, that Bon Jovi played at <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> in 1995 on a sell-out three night running concert. It is widely considered to be their best rock concert, featuring such hits as "Livin' On A Prayer", "Keep the Faith", "Bad Medicine", an excellent, heart-felt rendition of "Always", and showcasing new songs from <i>These Days</i>. It is particularly memorable because it is the same weekend that the album climbed to #1 on the UK charts. This tour date can be viewed on video, and has been re-issued on DVD, both titled <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_From_London_6310.html" title="Live From London">Live From London</a></i>. Jon Bon Jovi makes note of this achievement in the video, thanking their fans saying "It was just announced today that <i>These Days</i> kicked <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> off the top of the charts." Jon also says in the video that the concerts in London in 1995 were not only some of the best days of their careers, but quite possibly the best days of their lives.</p>
<p>By 1996, Bon Jovi had established themselves as a "force" in the music industry, proving much more durable (and successful) than most of their 80s glam peers. At the end of the These Days Tour, the band once again decided to take a break and pursue other interests. Tico used the opportunity further pursue his passion for painting while David started writing and composing various musicals. In 1998, Richie released his second solo outing called <i><a href="../../../u/n/d/Undiscovered_Soul_6182.html" title="Undiscovered Soul">Undiscovered Soul</a></i>.</p>
<p>Jon had also been bitten by the acting bug. He landed lead roles in movies <i>Little City</i> and <i>The Leading Man</i>, and supporting roles in <i>Moonlight and Valentino</i>, <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Homegrown.html" title="Homegrown">Homegrown</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../u/-/5/U-571.html" title="U-571">U-571</a></i>, among others. While he was free between filming different movies, Jon wrote what would become his second solo album, 1997's <i><a href="../../../d/e/s/Destination_Anywhere_21f2.html" title="Destination Anywhere">Destination Anywhere</a></i>. The album received very positive reviews and was a success across Europe. It was rumored that the record company was pursuing Jon to name the record "These Days, Part 2", since the album was somewhat of a moody progression from <i>These Days</i>. However, most fans will agree that "Destination Anywhere" was a departure from the signature Bon Jovi brand of rock music. A short movie of the same name was recorded right around the record's release, based entirely on the songs from the record and starring Jon Bon Jovi, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demi_Moore_19cf.html" title="Demi Moore">Demi Moore</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Bacon_2862.html" title="Kevin Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whoopi_Goldberg_25bb.html" title="Whoopi Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Stewart_1798.html" title="Dave Stewart">Dave Stewart</a> of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurythmics.html" title="Eurythmics">Eurythmics</a> played guitar on the record, as well as producing some of the tracks.</p>
<p>Bon Jovi reunited in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> to record the song "Real Life" for the movie <i><a href="../../../e/d/t/EdTV_a8d1.html" title="EdTV">EdTV</a></i>. David Bryan didn't make it to the filming of the video for the song due to a recent hand injury sustained in a home improvement mishap, so the band used a cardboard cutout of him for the shoot.</p>
<p>Bon Jovi also starred in a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lampoon_2239.html" title="National Lampoon">National Lampoon</a> film titled "Pucked" (a.k.a. "The Trouble with Frank") playing a down-on-his-luck lawyer who falsifies his <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_score.html" title="Credit score">credit score</a> to qualify for large loans in order to fund an all-female ice hokcey league, in which he then finds charges prepared against him and the target of careerist lawyers who sees his conviction as a way to further advance their carreers.</p>

<p>After a nearly three-year hiatus, during which several band members worked on independent projects, Bon Jovi regrouped in 1999 to begin work on their next studio album. Their 2000 release, <i><a href="../../../c/r/u/Crush_%28album%29.html" title="Crush (album)">Crush</a></i>, enjoyed overwhelming success both in the US and overseas, thanks in part to the smash-hit single "<a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_My_Life_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_85f7.html" title="It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)">It's My Life</a>", co-written by famous Swedish producer <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Martin_b724.html" title="Max Martin">Max Martin</a>. <i>Crush</i>, which also produced such hits as "Say It Isn't So" and "Thank You for Loving Me", soon became the band's most successful studio album since <i>Keep the Faith</i>, and helped introduce Bon Jovi to a new, younger fan base. The Crush Tour, which began that summer, originally encompassed only 60 or so shows and was extended due to Bon Jovi's newfound popularity, with the band remaining on tour through mid-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. While on tour, Bon Jovi released a collection of live performances from throughout their career in an album entitled, <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/One_Wild_Night%7E_Live_1985-2001_e65f.html" title="One Wild Night: Live 1985-2001">One Wild Night: Live 1985-2001</a></i>. The crush tour was notable in that the European 2000 leg included the band headlining two nights at <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, these would be the final shows ever at the venue before it was demolished.</p>
<p>Shortly after the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">terrorist attacks</a> of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, the band performed as part of the historic star-studded <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Concert_for_New_York_City_89ca.html" title="The Concert for New York City">The Concert for New York City</a> benefit concert for victims and their families. They performed an acoustic medley of "<a href="../../../l/i/v/Livin%27_on_a_Prayer_d4f2.html" title="Livin' on a Prayer">Livin' on a Prayer</a>" and "<a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanted_Dead_or_Alive_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_92ed.html" title="Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)">Wanted Dead or Alive</a>" with a stirring finale of "<a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_My_Life_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_85f7.html" title="It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)">It's My Life</a>".</p>

<p>In late <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, <i><a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounce_%28album%29.html" title="Bounce (album)">Bounce</a></i>, the band's follow-up to <i>Crush</i>, hit stores. Though <i>Bounce</i> did not enjoy quite the level of success of its predecessor, the album did produce the hit singles, "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everyday_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_b45a.html" title="Everyday (Bon Jovi song)">Everyday</a>" and "Misunderstood". The band went on a U.S. tour for this album, during which they made history as the last band to play <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterans_Stadium_4b72.html" title="Veterans Stadium">Veterans Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> before it was torn down. The band also released a promotional album through <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_Corporation_8dc1.html" title="Target Corporation">Target</a>. The album featured eight demo and live tracks.</p>
<p>Following the Bounce Tour, which wrapped up in August <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Bon Jovi embarked on what would become a unique and ambitious project. Originally intending to produce an album consisting of live acoustic performances of various songs, the band ended up rewriting, re-recording and reinventing 12 of their biggest hits in a new and much different light. <i><a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Left_Feels_Right_c3c4.html" title="This Left Feels Right">This Left Feels Right</a></i> was released in November 2003, with the title referring to the "left turn" of sorts that the band took in redoing the songs heard on this record.</p>
<p>The following year the band released a box set entitled <i><a href="../../../1/0/0/100%2C000%2C000_Bon_Jovi_Fans_Can%27t_Be_Wrong_b917.html" title="100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong">100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong</a></i>, the title an homage to Elvis Presley's <i><a href="../../../5/0/%2C/50%2C000%2C000_Elvis_Fans_Can%27t_Be_Wrong_d0fd.html" title="50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong">50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong</a></i>. The set consisted of four CDs packed with 38 unreleased and 12 rare tracks, as well as a <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a>. The box set marked the sales of 100 million Bon Jovi albums and also commemorated the 20th anniversary of the release of the band's first record in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>.</p>
<p>In November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Bon Jovi was honored with the award for Merit at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Music_Awards_e82d.html" title="American Music Awards">American Music Awards</a>, where they performed a sneak preview of an unfinished song, "<a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_a_Nice_Day_%28Bon_Jovi_song%29_f01d.html" title="Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi song)">Have a Nice Day</a>". Bon Jovi also participated in <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_8.html" title="Live 8">Live 8</a> on July 2, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, where they debuted the full, final version of "Have a Nice Day", alongside the classics, "Livin' on a Prayer" and "It's My Life". On August 20th, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the band headlined Miller Brewing Co.'s Big Brew-Ha, celebrating its 150th anniversary.

<p>On September 7, 2006, Bon Jovi, along with other top recording artists, participated in Fashion Rocks. The red carpet event, held at Radio City Music Hall, kicked off New York's Fashion Week. The concert, curated by Elton John, raised money for the Elton John AIDS Foundation.</p>

<p>With the end of the <a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_A_Nice_Day_Tour_90e8.html" title="Have A Nice Day Tour">Have A Nice Day Tour</a>, Bon Jovi began to throw around ideas for their next project. Among the potential offerings were going to Nashville to record with country stars (following the success of "<a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Says_You_Can%27t_Go_Home_7d54.html" title="Who Says You Can't Go Home">Who Says You Can't Go Home</a>"), a second greatest hits CD, a new studio album, and even new movies. In November 2006, Jon Bon Jovi revealed that the band were back in the studio working on a new album, and will be touring again. This confirmed rumors that Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora had been spotted in Nashville throughout the fall months of 2006. They were seen recording at country superstar <a href="../../../r/e/b/Reba_McEntire_43ed.html" title="Reba McEntire">Reba McEntire</a>'s Starstruck Studios on <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_Row_148d.html" title="Music Row">Music Row</a>.</p>
<p>Bon Jovi have confirmed that there will be no world tour to promote the new album, making it the first studio album of original material not to be followed by a promotional tour since 7800° Fahrenheit released over twenty years ago. Rumours speculated that this is due to another album due to be released later in the year (either a studio album or greatest hits) - but this is only speculation. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Sambora_8079.html" title="Richie Sambora">Richie Sambora</a> has said in an interview that the group are planning a greatest hits tour in the autumn, however it is still unknown if this will accompany a new greatest hits album.</p>
