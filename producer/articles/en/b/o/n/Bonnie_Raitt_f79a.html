<p>Raitt began playing guitar at an early age, something not a lot of her high school girlfriends did. Later she would become famous for her bottleneck-style guitar playing. "I had played a little at school and at camp," she later recalled in a July 2002 interview. "My parents would drag me out to perform for my family, like all parents do, but it was a hobby—nothing more... I think people must wonder how a white girl like me became a blues guitarist. The truth is, I never intended to do this for a living. I grew up... in a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker.html" title="Quaker">Quaker</a> family, and for me being Quaker was a political calling rather than a religious one."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Raitt_f79a.html" title="Edit section: Pre-recording career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-recording career</span></h3>
<p>In 1967, Raitt entered <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>'s <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radcliffe_College_572f.html" title="Radcliffe College">Radcliffe College</a> as a freshman, majoring in African Studies. "My plan was to travel to <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, where President <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Nyerere_4873.html" title="Julius Nyerere">Julius Nyerere</a> was creating a government based on <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a>," Raitt recalled. "I wanted to help undo the damage that Western colonialism had done to native cultures around the world. Cambridge was a hotbed of this kind of thinking, and I was thrilled."</p>
<p>One day, Raitt was notified by a friend that blues promoter Dick Waterman was giving an interview at WHRB, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>'s college radio station. An important figure in the blues revival of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, Waterman was also a resident of Cambridge. Raitt went to see Waterman, and the two soon became friends, "much to the chagrin of my parents, who didn't expect their freshman daughter to be running around with 65-year-old bluesmen," recalled Raitt. "I was amazed by his passion for the music and the integrity with which he managed the musicians."</p>
<p>During Raitt's sophomore year, Waterman relocated to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and a number of local musicians he counted among his friends went with him. Raitt had become a strong part of that community, recalling that "these people had become my friends, my mentors, and though I had every intention of graduating, I decided to take the semester off and move to Philadelphia...It was an opportunity that young white girls just don't get, and as it turns out, an opportunity that changed everything."</p>
<p>By now, Raitt was also playing <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk</a> and <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm_and_blues.html" title="Rhythm and blues">rhythm and blues</a> clubs in the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> area, performing alongside established blues legends like <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howlin%27_Wolf_c3c5.html" title="Howlin' Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/p/Sippie_Wallace_d0d8.html" title="Sippie Wallace">Sippie Wallace</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_Fred_McDowell_8a93.html" title="Mississippi Fred McDowell">Mississippi Fred McDowell</a>, all of whom she met through Waterman.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Raitt_f79a.html" title="Edit section: Signing with Warner Bros.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Signing with Warner Bros.</span></h3>
<p>In the fall of 1970, while opening for <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_McDowell_6db3.html" title="Fred McDowell">Fred McDowell</a> at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gaslight_Cafe_e840.html" title="The Gaslight Cafe">the Gaslight Cafe</a> in New York, a reporter from <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> Magazine saw her and began to spread word of her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer with <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> who soon released her eponymously titled debut, <i><a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Raitt_%28album%29_8230.html" title="Bonnie Raitt (album)">Bonnie Raitt</a></i>, in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, many of whom praised her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, very few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.</p>
<p>While admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, <i><a href="../../../g/i/v/Give_It_Up_479d.html" title="Give It Up">Give It Up</a></i>, was released in 1972 to universal acclaim, and though many critics still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's <i><a href="../../../t/a/k/Takin%27_My_Time_a035.html" title="Takin' My Time">Takin' My Time</a></i> was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.</p>
<p>Raitt was beginning to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for <i><a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_Magazine_5d7b.html" title="Rolling Stone Magazine">Rolling Stone Magazine</a></i>, but with <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974_in_music.html" title="1974 in music">1974's</a> <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetlights_%28album%29.html" title="Streetlights (album)">Streetlights</a></i>, reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By now, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Plate_95e5.html" title="Home Plate">Home Plate</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Zevon_baa8.html" title="Warren Zevon">Warren Zevon</a>'s <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Zevon_%28album%29_e417.html" title="Warren Zevon (album)">self-titled album</a> with Warren Zevon's friend <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Browne_9250.html" title="Jackson Browne">Jackson Browne</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleetwood_Mac_e8b5.html" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindsey_Buckingham_9021.html" title="Lindsey Buckingham">Lindsey Buckingham</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Nicks_f63b.html" title="Stevie Nicks">Stevie Nicks</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Raitt_f79a.html" title="Edit section: Achieving commercial success">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Achieving commercial success</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_in_music.html" title="1977 in music">1977's</a> <i><a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_Forgiveness_addf.html" title="Sweet Forgiveness">Sweet Forgiveness</a></i> gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough when it yielded a hit single in her cover of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Del_Shannon_9619.html" title="Del Shannon">Del Shannon</a>'s "Runaway." Recast as a heavy R&amp;B recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Green_39d0.html" title="Al Green">Al Green</a>, Raitt's version of "Runaway" was disparaged by many critics, but its commercial success prompted a bidding war between <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia Records</a>. "There was this big Columbia – Warner war going on at the time," recalled Raitt in a <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> interview. "<a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Taylor_04a3.html" title="James Taylor">James Taylor</a> had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia...And then, Warners signed <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Simon_8aab.html" title="Paul Simon">Paul Simon</a> away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia — no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal."</p>
<p>Warner Bros. held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_in_music.html" title="1979 in music">1979's</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Glow_c974.html" title="The Glow">The Glow</a></i>, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales. Raitt would have one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five MUSE (Musicians United for Safe Energy) concerts at <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Square_Garden_6f37.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>. The shows spawned a three-record gold album as well as a Warner Bros. feature film, <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Nukes_9256.html" title="No Nukes">No Nukes</a></i>. The shows featured co-founders <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Browne_9250.html" title="Jackson Browne">Jackson Browne</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Nash_4c1f.html" title="Graham Nash">Graham Nash</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hall_%28New_York%29_c098.html" title="John Hall (New York)">John Hall</a>, and Raitt as well as <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Springsteen_4811.html" title="Bruce Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Petty_and_the_Heartbreakers_363b.html" title="Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers">Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Doobie_Brothers_09f4.html" title="The Doobie Brothers">The Doobie Brothers</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Taylor_04a3.html" title="James Taylor">James Taylor</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gil_Scott-Heron_dfe8.html" title="Gil Scott-Heron">Gil Scott-Heron</a>, and numerous others.</p>
<p>For her next record, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_in_music.html" title="1982 in music">1982's</a> <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Light_%28album%29_8080.html" title="Green Light (album)">Green Light</a></i>, Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records, but to her surprise, many of her peers and members of the press would compare her new sound to the burgeoning <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">New Wave</a> movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this would have a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Bros.</p>
<p><a name="Drop_from_Warner_Bros." id="Drop_from_Warner_Bros."></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Raitt_f79a.html" title="Edit section: Drop from Warner Bros.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drop from Warner Bros.</span></h3>
<p>In 1983, as Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, titled <i>Tongue &amp; Groove</i>, Warner Bros. cleaned house, dropping a number of major artists from their roster. <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Morrison_45dc.html" title="Van Morrison">Van Morrison</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlo_Guthrie_8856.html" title="Arlo Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a> were two of the most high-profile cases, and the day after mastering was completed on <i>Tongue &amp; Groove</i>, Raitt was notified that she was to be dropped too. The album was shelved indefinitely, and Raitt was left without a label. By now, Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
<p>Despite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of "<a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_City_%28song%29_16a2.html" title="Sun City (song)">Sun City</a>", the anti-<a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> record written and produced by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Van_Zandt_6ec1.html" title="Steven Van Zandt">Steven Van Zandt</a>.

<p>Two years after dropping her from their label, Warner Bros. notified Raitt of their plans to release <i>Tongue &amp; Groove</i>. "I said it wasn't really fair," recalled Raitt. "I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Lives_77fc.html" title="Nine Lives">Nine Lives</a></i>."

By now, Raitt was clean and sober, having broken her substance abuse — for which she would credit <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan_c7aa.html" title="Stevie Ray Vaughan">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a> in a Minnesota State Fair concert<small><sup><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:2y7pRANK_ogJ:www.startribune.com/stories/611/3169325-2.html+minnesota+%22state+fair%22+1990+%22bonnie+raitt%22&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:2y7pRANK_ogJ:www.startribune.com/stories/611/3169325-2.html+minnesota+%22state+fair%22+1990+%22bonnie+raitt%22&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">ref</a></sup></small> the night after Vaughan's 1990 death. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, she began working on new material. During this time, Raitt considered signing with <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_%28musician%29.html" title="Prince (musician)">Prince</a>'s own label, <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paisley_Park_00e0.html" title="Paisley Park">Paisley Park</a>, but negotiations would ultimately fall through.

<p>Raitt had met Was through Hal Wilner, who was putting together <i>Stay Awake</i>, a tribute album to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Walt_Disney_Company_cac2.html" title="The Walt Disney Company">Disney music</a> for <a href="../../../a/%26/m/A%26M_Records_7966.html" title="A&amp;M Records">A&amp;M</a>.

Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Don to produce her next album.</p>

<p>After more than twenty years of singing and recording popular music, Bonnie Raitt achieved immense success with her 10th album. Released in 1989, <i><a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_of_Time_%28album%29_c15d.html" title="Nick of Time (album)">Nick of Time</a></i> went to the top of the U.S. charts and won three <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_0dda.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Awards</a>. At the same time, she walked away with a fourth Grammy Award for her duet "In the Mood" with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lee_Hooker_e754.html" title="John Lee Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> on his album <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Healer_%28album%29_8d90.html" title="The Healer (album)">The Healer</a></i>.</p>
<p>She followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her 1991 album, <i><a href="../../../l/u/c/Luck_of_the_Draw_%28album%29_06f3.html" title="Luck of the Draw (album)">Luck of the Draw</a></i>, which contains the hit single "<a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Can%27t_Make_You_Love_Me_781e.html" title="I Can't Make You Love Me">I Can't Make You Love Me</a>", often considered to be one of the best ballads of all time. "I Can't Make You Love Me" is notoriously difficult to sing, as many who have attempted it have discovered. Three years later, in 1994, she added two more Grammy's with her album <i><a href="../../../l/o/n/Longing_in_Their_Hearts_b7dc.html" title="Longing in Their Hearts">Longing in Their Hearts</a></i>. Both of these albums were multi-platinum successes. Raitt's collaboration with Was would amicably come to an end with <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_music.html" title="1995 in music">1995's</a> live release, <i><a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_Tested_3cf5.html" title="Road Tested">Road Tested</a></i>. Released to solid reviews, it sold well enough to be certified gold.</p>
<p>For her next studio album, Raitt hired <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitchell_Froom_cd6c.html" title="Mitchell Froom">Mitchell Froom</a> and <a href="../../../t/c/h/Tchad_Blake_aa69.html" title="Tchad Blake">Tchad Blake</a> as her producers. "I loved working with <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Was_3a73.html" title="Don Was">Don Was</a> but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different," Raitt said. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on <i><a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_%28album%29.html" title="Fundamental (album)">Fundamental</a></i> in 1998.</p>
