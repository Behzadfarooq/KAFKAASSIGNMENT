<p>Launched in October 1999, "Bongga"'s format was musical variety. Its shows were previously taped-as-live alternately from SM City Iloilo and Robinson's Place-Bacolod. The original hosts were <b>Hector Gloria</b>, <b>Lara Alba</b>, <b>Debbie Pelor</b> and <b>Ansab Urpiana</b>, with Campus Radio DJs <b>Jigo Mambo</b> and <b>Billy d' Kid</b> acting as on-air video jocks (VJs). However after the show's first season, "Bongga" was reformatted as a gay-oriented variety program, with Jigo Mambo and Billy d' Kid joining Hector as main hosts. It started dishing out portions like "<i>Palarong Pambakla</i>", "<i>Pok Gi Pok</i>" and "<i>Binibining Bonggay</i>" that generated a lot of controversy among the conservative groups in Western Visayas. Despite the criticism, "Bongga" got high ratings basing on these segments alone and it helped them overcome the more established "<b>Barkadahan sa S na S</b>" of ABS-CBN TV 4 Bacolod.</p>

<p>"Bongga" also produced other segments like "Bikini Car Wash Babes", a contest where sexy women don bikinis and gyrate to the music while washing a car (this was later copied by "Masayang Tanghali Bayan" of ABS-CBN), "Hataw sa Bongga", where it showcased various Ilonggo dance groups, and "Bonggastruck", a reality-based artista search for Western Visayas, inspired by GMA 7's <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starstruck.html" title="Starstruck">Starstruck</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2005.html" title="October 2005">October 2005</a>, "Bongga" was relaunched with a new logo banner unveiled by two gay impersonators who jumped from the top of the Iloilo Business Hotel, the tallest structure in Iloilo City. Prior to the relaunch, the show reformatted back to its original musical variety format in 2003, while retaining the gay-oriented portions it was famous for. Original host Jigo Mambo was joined by new hosts <b>John Arceo</b> (who came from "Bongga"'s defunct rival show <b>"Barkadahan sa S na S"</b> of ABS-CBN Bacolod), <b>Gilbert "Onal" Golez</b> (who was born in Iloilo and had a short stint in Manila as a singer), and Ilonggo talents <b>Joan Jalandoni</b>, <b>Apol Arro</b> and <b>Leez Quimpo</b>. The show also had a grand anniversary show held at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand with Kapuso stars Nadine Samonte, Ara Mina and Alfred Vargas as special guests.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bongga%21.html" title="Edit section: The Dinagyang Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Dinagyang Controversy</span></h2>
<p>In January 28, 2007 "Bongga" hosts Jigo Mambo and Joan Jalandoni joined forces with some talents of ABS-CBN to host the Dinagyang awarding ceremonies. As part of the ceremonies, both ABS-CBN and GMA Network provided their talents to entertain the crowd while waiting for the results. The show was suppose to start at around 5 pm Philippine time. However because of some delays in the preparation, the Dinagyang Foundation organizers decided to start the program proper at 6 pm. At the same time, the organizers gave 30 minutes each for both networks to provide entertainment. GMA Network was allowed to go first, and brought in Gabby Eigenmann and Sunshine Dizon to perform. Each talents were allowed to perform 2 songs. Gabby was able to perform while Sunshine's performance was abruptly cut.</p>
<p>Video footages from GMA Iloilo's newscast "Ratsada" showed two instances that Sunshine Dizon's performance was sabotaged. The first came after Sunshine's first song, Jigo Mambo approached her for a short interview but their microphone audio went off and instead an audio from Sky Cable's talent came in. The second incident came after Sunshine's supposed 2nd song when in the middle of her performance, a lady host from ABS-CBN came up the stage and hyped the crowd with the arrival of ABS-CBN talent Matt Evans of "Pedro Penduko" fame. With her was "Bongga"'s Joan Jalandoni who was there to control the situation but her microphone went off.</p>
<p>The apparent sabotage earned the ire of Sunshine Dizon and her mother Dorothy Laforteza. Also the management of ABS-CBN Iloilo was hands off after the incident, denying any involvement on their part. The Dinagyang incident gave 15 minutes of nationwide fame for the two "Bongga" hosts Jigo and Joan, since the whole incident was aired over GMA's "24 Oras". Joan was also among those interviewed about the incident together with Sunshine Dizon, Gabby Eigenmann and ABS-CBN Iloilo Station Manager Charie Ginete-Ilon.</p>
