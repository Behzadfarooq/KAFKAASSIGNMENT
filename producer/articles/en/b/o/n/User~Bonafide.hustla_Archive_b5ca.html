<p>Thanks for experimenting with the page <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese.html" title="Chinese">Chinese</a> on Wikipedia. Your test worked, and has been reverted or removed. Please use <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">the sandbox</a> for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">welcome page</a> if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. Thanks. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 03:42, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please stop distorting information about Taiwanese opinion towards Chinese reunification. How "Chinese" Taiwan is is a delicate topic, and we are trying to apprach it with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Also, your edits on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese.html" title="Chinese">Chinese</a> can be understood as <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>, so please stop. Thank you, <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 04:56, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please do not remove large chunks of text without explanation, in the edit summary and on the relevant talk page. Otherwise, your edits are automatically reverted as they are construed as vandalism, which can easily get you blocked.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 06:43, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not endorse the views presented by the man depicted on my user and talk pages. The NPOV rule only applies to articles, not user pages.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 07:11, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(I was too slow in typing this, so my answer comes a bit late) I can understand your edits on <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a> and am also not completely happy with the sentence you removed that basically said Powell was right and all Taiwanese parties miss the point, but I can also see why <a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> reverted them since you didn't really say why you removed them. It might be a good idea to discuss this issue on <a href="../../../t/a/i/Talk%7ETaiwan_independence_8b13.html" title="Talk:Taiwan independence">Talk:Taiwan independence</a>. However, you should restore the image on Jiang's user page - it is not very polite to edit other people's userpages, and he is only displaying a well-known San Francisco Chinatown figure whose ultra-nationalism is so silly it is almost funny. You should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and not believe that these are Jiang's personal opinions. By the way, Jiang is an administrator and I am not. Happy editing, <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 07:18, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know about the factual accuracy of the section that you keep deleting (I am not an expert in international law; it would be a good thing to try to find <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources on this matter). However, there are other ways to remove <i>bias</i> than outright deletion (I have just tried to remove bias by simply changing "unfortunately" to "however"). The article in general seems to be more or less balanced to me, giving all different views on the matter without favoring one over the other (that is what or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy is about). <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 14:44, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Administrators are human; we are bound to be biased in <i>something</i> in all our lives. The question is whether if our actions as editors and as administrators cause Wikipedia to be biased. I don't see any evidence that Jiang has done that. For example, I state on my own user page that I am against George W. Bush, but I don't think I've made any edits that caused Wikipedia to slant against Bush. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 07:50, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am forced to write my response on my talk page 'cause this is the only page I am allow to edit at the moment. First I want to deny that I have any connection with GrandCru. I do not know the guy and never have any interactions with him whatsoever. I got an account on wikipedia last month when I was using the website for a school project. I noticed some of the info in the articles are outdated or biased. Some users, including <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kusma.html" title="Kusma">Kusma</a>, admits there are flaws in some articles such as Taiwanese Independence and China. Anyway, I was able to reach compromise in those articles (see history in these articles for more details). However, I was extremely concerned with user <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiang.html" title="Jiang">Jiang</a> (who was also very active in Taiwan-China articles) images on both his userpage and talkpage that says Taiwan=shame and writings that attack Taiwanese president. I was told by admin Nlu and admin Jiang that you can put any images you like on your user page and talk page as long as you don't personally endorse it. This rule troubles me greatly, for we are not allow to edit others' talk page and userpage according to Nlu. In response, I created an image title "jiang=shame" which was later removed by another user (see my talk page for more details). As some of you might know, other users also voiced their concerns regarding the images on Jiang's talk page (see Jiang's talk page for more details under the heading are you a administrator?) I questioned Nlu if i can upload a image disrespecting Muhammad or praising the Nazi party or Japanese soldiers during the Nanjing Massacre. Are they acceptable? Nlu interprets this as a personal attack and I was blocked. Due to this incident, I was both mad and disappointed toward wikipedia andd the actions of the admins, who sometimes can't adhere to NPOV. I announced on my talk page that I was leaving the site. I'm man enough to admit that when I first began to edit on wiki, some edits are biased and irrelevant. I sincerely apologized to those whom I offended. However, there is always a learning curve, as I began to learn the rules, I gradually know how to make useful edits (see contributions). Recently, I noticed a lot of articles about sports and NBA are outdated and player names' are misspelled. While I was editing, I noticed Nlu was once again disrespecting other user "PoolGuy" and I also read "Silensor" userpage which I found clearly reflects the thoughts of many wikipedians, so I put it on my userpage as well. When I told Nlu to treat PoolGuy, who apparently made his comments in good faith, with respect and dignity. He responds by removing by userpage, which he called trolling. Like I said, the userpage is not mine. I copied it from Silensor and it is more or less true. Nlu is the very person that told me I am not allow to edit others userpage and talkpage when I removed the image from Jiang's userpage but he is violating the rule himself. And he blocked me before I can send this case to arbitration and therefore shut down my voice in every pages except my talk page. I can't even revert my userpage. This block clearly is not justified. Throughout my time here, I was brutalized, discriminated against, and totally lost faith in the authority of wikipedia. Like i said, I am man enough to admit my errors at the very beginning and as you can see in my contributions, I been focusing my time on articles regarding sports and basketball. Hopefully, someone will look into this situation. And I did not attack Nlu so I don't know why I was blocked. Since I do make useful edits, I do not know why they want to block me indefinitely.--<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestyle.king_4eb8.html" title="User:Freestyle.king">Freestyle.king</a> 21:46, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:6 p.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>sorry. I wish I could help you about Nlu, but I've given up on fighting against users (especially if they're admins). There's not much you can do, even if you get the support of a few. He may not be the perfect admin (actually, he's the opposite), but what can you do. Stop filing complaints, make a bunch of neutral edits, become an admin, and then deal with it. Right now, you have no power, and neither do I, so, my "help" wouldn't really do much. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>Boris Malagurski</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>₪</b></font></a> 04:51, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Due to severe wiki-stress and the pressure of being a high school student. I decided to take a wiki-break. after reading through wikipedia regulations and learn more about this great project, i think wiki break is the chance for me to calm myself down and rethink my direction. I hope someone will unblock my account when i come back though because i am NOT a vandal. I will come back sometime and make occasional edits (hopefully someone will punish me more lightly than blocking me forever) but possibly not anything big in like a couple of months. But you guys can continue to discuss my request for unblock on my talk page. I would definitely love to listen to different opinions and feedbacks. 2 big things i learned on wikipedia 1. assume good faith 2. Neutral point of view, accepting others opinion There are also others more difficult encounters that occured during my experience on wikipedia. Well, for the time being, this is good-bye. I strongly hope that together we can make this project works. Keep up the good work, fellow wikipedians.

<p>Just a brief note during the middle of my wiki-break. I found the following statement by user:Guanaco in the administrator noticeboard and provide a brief explanation for each of his accusations.</p>
<p>I have blocked Freestyle.king (talk • contribs • page moves • block user • block log) indefinitely for disruption, personal attacks, and vandalism. —Guanaco 02:57, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Happy_Happy_Happy.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47896565" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Happy_Happy_Happy.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47896565" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Happy_Happy_Happy.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47896565</a> (vandalism)</p>
<p>Reply: Like I have said million times before, Jiang's "Happy happy happy image" is a violation of wikipedia's NPOV regulation. It needs to be removed permanently from his userpage and talkpage because it provokes racial hatred toward a specific ethnic group. Note the caption on the image said "Taiwan=shame".</p>
<p>2.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jiang&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47624627" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jiang&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47624627" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jiang&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47624627</a> (personal attacks)</p>
<p>Reply: The above edit was unsigned and based on user:Jiang's talkpage history. The above edit was made by User: Thousandsons. The personal attacks has no relation to me and therefore the accusation is not justified. Please do not make false accusation unless you got proof.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NickBush24&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47367486" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NickBush24&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47367486" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NickBush24&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47367486</a> (general nonsense)</p>
<p>Reply: A clear racism display by User: Guanaco. Just because I talk in hip-hop slang related style, it is considered general nonsense? I simply warn user: Nick Bush not to delete and vandalize on my user talk page.</p>
<p>4.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taiwan_independence&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43839012" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taiwan_independence&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43839012" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taiwan_independence&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43839012</a> (POV pushing)</p>
<p>Reply: Based on the history of the above article. I did not edit the article "Taiwan Independence". All I did was revert it to the orginal version of User:Tw4unga, whose previous edit was apparently made in good faith. Therefore, it was definitely not POV pushing of any kind since I did not personally change anything in the article.</p>
<p>A week had passed since my initial indefinite block. User: Guanaco also accused me of being a vandal "for a while", which was something without evidence. Based on my history, I do make useful edits and involve in wiki projects. One must assume good faith for this project to succeed. An unblock is respectfully requested on the ground that there is no clear violation of wikipedia regulations. And an indefinite block is a clearly not justified. I sincerely hope more users and admins can look into this situation.

<dd>I unblocked you since there's no real reason to put down an indef block just because the admin thinks he violates WP:NPA or WP:NPOV too much. If he feels it's such a problem, lsend him an RfC or let the ArbCom handle it. It's not like he's a straght vandal, as a brief look through his contribs shows. --<a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">LBMixPro</a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>&lt;Sp</sup></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><sup>e</sup></font></a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>ak|on|it!&gt;</sup></a> 03:24, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jiang was reverting his user page and talk page to a state that, in my opinion, called disruption of Wikipedia. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jiang" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jiang" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.) I am tempted to revert it, but I might very likely be block by either Jiang or Nlu. However, I would like opinions on this. Should his preferred version be allowed to stand? Is it a personal attack (albeit against a group (specifically an ethic group, not an individual), deserving consequences?

<p>Thank you for the clarification for the first two. However, a citation can't be present in every single sentences for every single articles on wikipedia. IF people argue about every minor sentences on every article on wikipedia, it is impossible for the project to work or else creating 2000 zillions citations needed signs on the same article. One can argue that kuomintang is still the gov. in china or put a question mark beside the death date of Adolf Hitler claiming that his body wasn't found. Some of the information are purely common sense or information that is public knowledge but couldn't be cited easily. If we were to pursue this kind of lawyering, it would be disastrous and could ultimately destroy this great project.

<dd>I understand that not everything needs citation, but the claim made in the Taiwanese American article is neither common sense nor public knowledge. When something is in dispute, it needs to be backed up. Can you at least provide evidence of someone using "Chinese American" as being exclusive of Taiwanese Americans?</dd>

<p>After a short wikibreak, I am furious to learn that I had been blocked from editing on the issue of removing warnings from my talkpage, 3RR, and lack of communication. Listed below is a concise and brief explanation.</p>
<p>1. Removing warnings:</p>
<p>A. One is perfectly entitled to remove such warnings from his/her talkpage. An admin support my claim.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51310558" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51310558" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] Another user removed my warning from his talkpage.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Henry_Flower&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50938446" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Henry_Flower&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50938446" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>]. To add to that the warnings is justified. An admin support my case. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60587087" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60587087" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60586139" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60586139" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] support from another user. Read the full length discussion on <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">User:Bishonen</a> talkpage under the heading User:RevolverOcelotX.</p>
<p>B. Even if I am not allowed to remove such warnings, the warning clearly isn't justified. According to the history of List of Chinese Americans and Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China articles, you would see Bonafide.hustla and RevolverOcelotX had both made 3 reverts in the past 24 hours 2 days ago. However, when the initial warning was placed by RevolverOcelotX I made only 1 edit to the article, making the warning totally irrelevant. He placed the warning on the ground that I BROKEN the 3RR on my user talk page after the final warning. As evident in the above discussion, an admin states that 3RR does not apply to a user's personal talkpage. The accusation is groundless.</p>
<p>2. 3RR Again, the 3RR clearly states that a block should only occur if I have made MORE than 3 reverts in the last 24 hrs for an article. I did not unless you count my personal talkpage, but we already established the 3RR does not apply to personal talkpages. See A. and B. above for further details.</p>
<p>3. Lack of communication</p>
<p>A. A series of POV pushing by RevolverOcelotX occured when he first arrived at wikipedia, when I revert his edits as an effort to preserve NPOV (never violating 3RR), he started to engage himself in edit warring with me and many other users [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Chinese_Americans&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Chinese_Americans&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>] While I have also posted relevant reasons for reverts in both edit summary and relevant talkpages, he failed to do so. When I attempted to communicate in order to end edit warring, he angrily responded and continue to make POV edits specifically in Taiwanese-Chinese relation. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60572691&amp;oldid=60555868" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60572691&amp;oldid=60555868" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>]</p>
<p>4. Conduct of User:RevolverOcelotX</p>
<p>A. Ever since this user's initial arrival, he has been on a crusade to distort information about Taiwan, China articles. see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RevolverOcelotX" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RevolverOcelotX" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>].</p>
<p>B. His behavior is similar to <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">User:PoolGuy</a> and often commits wikilawyering. He is in the process of wasting the community's patience. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>]</p>
<p>C. This user went as far as harassing admin to support my case in order to prove his point. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60587999&amp;oldid=60587087" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60587999&amp;oldid=60587087" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>] (Sorry this is my mistake see below)</p>
<p>D. This user even edit the naming convention: Chinese in order to justify his edits. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>]</p>
<p>E. Spamming [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66308328" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66308328" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>]</p>
<p>Conclusion: It is obvious that the block on me is not justified. Thanks and I hope someone will restore this unfair treatment.--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 23:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, BH. I just noticed that you write above, and on abakharev's page, too, that RevolverOcelotX harassed an admin, with a link to my talkpage. No, he didn't (actually nobody did, but that's another story). I'm afraid you've misunderstood the diff. They're pretty confusing, and I can see that it was an honest mistake. RevolverOcelotX didn't have anything to do with the section that you can read in the diff, the one I removed with an impatient edit summary—it was written by somebody else. You should strike that out, or remove it or someting.

<p>Wikipedia is a factual, NPOV encyclopedia. I edited the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chao_Chien-ming_2846.html" title="Chao Chien-ming">Chao Chien-ming</a> article to reflect this and you reverted.

<p>This is a groundless accusation and invalid warning. Please do not make groundless accusations such as that I "deliberate pushing of your biased pov". Whether or not you support any side is irrevelant. Wikipedia is a great project and I take pride to be part of the community.

<dd>Thanks for taking the time to point out to me the fact about your second block. However it was not the blocks that were the only reason for my objection. From looking at your talk page there are numerous warnings for a number of different offecnes. On top of that you do not have the necessary experience I would like to see for a member of the MedCom.

<p>Just to let you know, when I changed his nationality from Tawainese to Chinese I was trying to make it consistant. Someone had changed the category back and forth and put in statements that called him both Tawianese and Chinese. For consistancy I though changing it to one or the other would be better, maybe I should just change it all to Tawianese and then leave it and see if someone changes it again. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 22:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd appreciate it if you could leave me a message concerning this article. I saw you changed it back citing POV guidelines. My question is that the article calls him both Chinese and Taiwanese. Given the fact that the country is one, can't we stick to one or the other (I personally don't care which one). Using two makes the article confusing and more bias in my opinion.</dd>

<p>I'm glad we figured out were on the same side of the argument. Maybe when I was first trying to explain my opinion I wasn't clear enough. I just left additonal comments on the talk page.

<p>Thanks for your additional comments, especially seeing that your on vacation. The sign you mentioned, is that the one that is in Chinese? I can't read Chinese, so I'm not sure if that's what you were referring to or not.

<p>Ok, I see it now, it's on his talk page. That is pretty blatent in terms of his POV and bias, maybe that <b>should</b> be brought up in the discussion.</p>
<p>At this point I'm going to wait and see how the RFC goes, but I will see this out until there is some kind of a resolution.

<p>I will pass that along to him that you would rather have nothing in terms of nationality or ethnicity. Would you be ok with both of those being there like it is now?</p>

<dd>Did you mean Jiang is a admin? If he is and he gets into an edit war, certainly I'll file a complaint about abuse of power. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 06:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm messaging you to let you know I'm removing the current edits. At this point, I don't think the parties involved are agreeing to the changes. It is very possible that if left as is, someone will end up changing it and start an edit war. I'm asking everyone to respect the fact that the information has been removed, until the dispute can be settled. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 07:11, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In terms of the conflict, I have stated I'm willing to go along with the last version put up by Alec, if Jiang promises to leave the David Wu article alone. I know this isn't going to sit well with you, but personally I am willing to leave it alone if he does. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 07:52, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be fair to all parties involved in the dispute, I reverted the page to a version which predates the current edit war between yourself and <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a>. The version you are referring to occured in the middle of the edit war. I'd appreciate it if you and the other parties involved could come to a consensus using the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_0623.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)">talk page</a> before making any further changes. Edit wars are disruptive, and while it may be satisfying to repeatedly revert the edits of someone you don't agree with, they don't work out for anyone in the long run. Thanks. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 06:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that you recently removed a <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> warning from your talk page. Look, I know that Taiwan/China/ROC/PRC relations are an emotionally charged subject and it's often very tempting to immediately dismiss anything coming from people that we disagree with. However, continuous edit warring does nothing to help the issue and often serves only to exasterbate an already tense situation. If you find yourself engaged in a continuous dispute with another editor, please make use of the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution</a> process. It may not be as satisfying as reverting in the short term, but is better for everyone and Wikipedia as a whole in the long run. We need people from all backgrounds and opinions here and I'd really prefer not to have to resort to blocks or page protection in situations like this. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 07:20, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification, however please note that the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html#Intent_of_the_policy" title="WP:3RR">intent of the 3-Revert Rule</a> is to stop edit wars. Period. It is not an entitlement to revert three times in a 24 hour period, rather it is ment to encourage editors to try to work out a consensus through dialouge once it is clear that a dispute exists. I may have missed it but it doesn't appear that either you or <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a> have attempted to make use of the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Talk%7ETaiwan_independence_8b13.html" title="Talk:Taiwan independence">talk page</a> of the article in dispute. Again, I'd rather not take drastic action due to a content dispute (though I will if absolutely necessary). Please try to resolve this through dialouge on talk pages of the relevant articles. You don't have to see eye to eye, you just have to be willing to talk. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 07:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I've gone over the entire exchange at <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDavid_Wu_8bea.html" title="Talk:David Wu">Talk:David Wu</a>, clearly, the dispute on that particular article has been going on for sometime and is probably ripe for mediation. Nontheless, I strongly suggest that the two of you try to address each disputed article on a case by case basis. Clearly the dispute on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wu_3540.html" title="David Wu">David Wu</a> is still unresolved despite much debate, however you should at least try in good faith to address the disputes on the other articles on the relevant talk pages. Who knows? You may actually be able to come to some sort of consensus, or at least get opinions from other editors. Or as a last resort, to show mediators or arbitrators that you have made every effort possible. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanglc_c543.html" title="User:Changlc">Loren</a> 08:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
