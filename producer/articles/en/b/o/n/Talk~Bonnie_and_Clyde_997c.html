<p><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> Put anything anywhere you want. The bottom line is exquisitely simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>wikipedia has firm rules for editing</b>;</li>
<li><b>these rules are the 27 rules of engagement, enumerated at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a></b></li>
<li>these rules <b>require</b> as <b>merely four of the 27, 1)that you post facts or language in dispute, or language you intend to change, 2)await a reply, 3)discuss the proposed chanage if opposed by other editors, 4) and seek agreement. If agreement is against you, you may seek a peer review. It is the peer review which is final and absolute in arbitrating factual or language matters which cannot be resolved by consensus.</b></li>
<li><b>You have broken each of these rules, twice in the last 24 hours, by deleting massive portions of the article, in direct opposition to 4 other editors, plus a peer review which specifically approved the deleted sections.</b>*<b>You were asked nicely to stop, then told to stop, by 4 different editors, all of whom asked you to post proposed changes, wait for reply, discuss, and seek agreement, as per the rules - and you replied "I will edit the Bonnie and Clyde page as I see fit."</b> My changes have nothing to do with any editor, they are to make the page more NPOV. NPOV trumps consensus," in direct defiance of the rules as laid out at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> which make clear <b>no single editor may determine NPOV where controversy exists, and agreement can not be reached, a peer review is the remedy. Your proposed changes have been rejected by massive consensus, and the peer review, but you disregarded those results,and openly defy wikipedia's most basic rules, over and over.</b></li>
<li>You have abandoned any pretense of following the 27 rules and told us you would do what you wanted, when you wanted. (see your edits on this page, stating you would ignore consensus, or the other rules "I will edit...as I see fit") <b>"Work toward agreement" is the most basic of wikipedia editing rules - and you absolutely refuse to acknowledge or make even the tiniest effort to follow it. This is by definition, clear vandalism.</b></li>
<li>I reverted your edits as vandalism, violative of the work towards agreement rules and against consensus, <b>twice in 24 hours you have deleted large amounts of the article without posting, waiting, discussing, or seeking agreement in complete defiance of the 27 rules as stipulated at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> A third time will trigger the three edits in 24 hours rule,</b> which I pray will bring admins into this to finally deal with your own defiance of the rules and vandalism.</li>
<li>You are the only editor to openly defy consensus and a peer review I have had the unfortunate experience to have to deal with other than SaltyPig, who is now permanently banned. Everyone else except yourself is willing to accept the 27 rules, and abides by them, as laid out at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> .</li>
<li>I welcome admins to review all this, and believe you should be permanently banned for your absolute refusal to abide by the warnings you repeatedly received from at least 4 editors - and the 27 rules as plainly laid out at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> Ewulp also advised you against deletion without discussion, as did myself, <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a>. You are a real vandal in the truest sense, and need to be banned, because of your absolute refusal to edit by the 27 rules as strictly laid out at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> which are mandatory, not discretionary. <b>Putting it in the simpliest terms, you stated above when noticed that there are rules, and your changes disputed, by the majority, you stated "I will edit the Bonnie and Clyde page as I see fit" and then act openly and clearly in defiance of wikipedia rules.</b> You have now deleted sections without following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> twice in 24 hours, if you do it a third, the three edit in 24 hours rule kicks in, and admins will act.

<dd>Just a note about the above comment, eventhough I am not involved, you should review the policies at <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 18:45, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> Believe me, I reviewed the policies to great length before posting the above. Good faith cannot be assumed when someone repeatedly deletes sections without following the most basic of the 27 rules of editor engagement, 1)that you post facts or language in dispute, or language you intend to change, 2)await a reply, 3)discuss the proposed chanage if opposed by other editors, 4) and seek agreement. Civility is not implicated when you point out that an editor has repeatedly deleted sections and facts in open defiance of a peer review and against 7 other editors agreeing they stay - and refuses to even discuss it, saying "I will edit the Bonnie and Clyde page as I see fit." <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> you are one of the good folks, and I appreciate the concern - please believe I read ALL policies carefully before posting the foregoing. Repeated deletions in violation of the basic rules, and open defiance of consensus unfortunately negates good faith, and pointing it out is not a violation of civility, it exists where you have no alternative to stop vandalism. But thank you. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:37, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My interpretation would apply to all, yes but you have to respect that right to other as well. You simply cannot expect editors to wait for concensus before making an edit to an article. That would be beuracratic and time consuming. Keep in mind, however, that I'm not an admin so I really have no authority over what admins would do in a banning situation. I'm just calling it as I see it since I took some interest in this discussion. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 21:29, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We, the rest of us who have worked so hard on this article for half a year, were hopelessly handicapped in defending it because the other editor, without attacking him personally, was not following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> in any way, while we had to lurch along, as I noted, as the fighter I once was, with one hand tied behind our backs. Your note makes clear that ALL are able to exercise the right to <a href="../../../d/i/a/WP%7EDIAR_7049.html" title="WP:DIAR">interpret all the rules</a> and if necessary to improve or protect a good article, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all the rules</a> if necessity requires us, to improve the article, and <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> , and if admins do come in, ALL will be held, I believe, to the same standard. I do believe your interpretation both correct and fair. I would not presume to predict what an admin would do, but I have found Kate, Essjay, Woohookitty, for instance, to be unfailingly fair, and I feel ALL will be held to the same standard of accountibility, which I believe is what you were saying, (I would certainly expect if one person is banned for ignoring the rules, then ALL would be, or none at all) and we do honestly thank you for caring enough to inject a valued opinion. Certainly ALL should play by the rules, or NONE must play by the rules. I am certainly curious as to the admins take on this when they come in, but knowing several pretty well, I am certain what, if any, punishment is meted out will be uniform for the offense. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 21:37, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would humbly offer you the thought on your nominations that controversy is inevitable, and you cannot please everyone. I think you try, and are a respected editor. Here, you made an invaluable contribution: Either EVERYONE must play by the rules, or NO ONE should have to. I am certainly curious as to the admins take on this when they come in, <b>but knowing several pretty well, I am certain what, if any, punishment is meted out will be uniform for the offense</b>. I would offer as two thoughts that everyone might wish to consider whether that is a path we really wish to take, and ask whether or not each person is willing to accept the possible consequences. I understand your points, and agree, that we are not a system of laws. Nonetheless, we are treading a narrow and winding road when we dispense with wikipedia editing rules. But frankly, I am glad a respected editor such as yourself, and I mean that seriously, sees that if one party dispenses with the rules of engagement, all are free to do the same. I also believe that will have consequences for everyone involved. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 03:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mytwocents has asked me to come to this page to keep an eye on the discussion. I am an administrator. I've had a quick glance at the discussion above and I can see a great deal of talk about "rules". One of the rules is 27 rules of engagement - where on Earth did that one come from? I've been here from the first year and I've never hears of it! You don't need rules of engagement, because editing shouldn't be war, it's cooperative.</p>
<p>I suggest the best way forwards is to start discussing the article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 07:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I struck my comments above, to you, and some to another editor, (if you are wondering where they went, I deleted them, since they were mine) in the interests of removing a lot of needless stuff that has nothing to do with the article. I am trying, and I believe he is, to work together, which, is the wikipedia way.

I prefer to think of it as monitoring your errant but will meaning brothers! Actually, as an admin, you have the authority, which I do not, to remove the entire discussion above on rules, which I would prefer. I did not know until tonight when I reread the page that Katefan0 - a really super admin and human being was drive away by personal attacks. As I wrote Mytwocents below, I refuse to be part of an atmosphere that contributes to that sort of thing, and in reflecting, regret ever quarreling over something that in a few years won't even be remembered. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 23:45, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with the above (the Theresa Knott post)--In the last few hours I have just read the article from beginning to end, to identify any remaining hint of POV or overemphasis that I can spot, &amp; made some changes -- in other words this is my dream edit, leaving an article that I believe meets stringent standards for NPOV. It mostly involves adopting a more clinical tone, and there aren't that many changes. It may solve some of the remaining problems. Here are the main changes--</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1 or 2 places phrases like "very respected" describing writers &amp; historians were removed, only because repeated too often they sound defensive.</li>
<li>Likewise I think the line starting "Bonnie herself..." in the Buck Joins the Gang section is better left out. This is a close call, but since the opening section says 4x she never shot anybody, and there is language elsewhere about the lack of any warrant, etc. this line seems one repetition too many. The reader will notice in any case that the list of gang members known to have murdered does not include Bonnie.</li>
<li>the word "very" should have been removed, you are dead on on that.</li>
<li>In the Death section, I cut the line containing "but this is contradicted" only because I can't identify the contradiction-- there's a lack of clarity there. If this is an important detail it could be rewritten, let's discuss this one.</li>
<li>I agree somewhat with <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">MyTwoCents</a> about redundancy in the final section, although I don't agree that the excellent last paragraph should be cut -- I think the problem is solved with some tinkering at the beginning of the section. Sentences are rearranged and I've removed one quote from Geringer which repeats material already covered in Final Run. This quote always bothered me, it seemed out of place in the Popular Culture section because it's not about B&amp;C's appeal to the public, it's about Clyde's grudge against the Texas Dept. of Corrections. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 09:39, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> I agree with your work, as I almost always do, and find</p>
<ul>
<li>the edits appropriate, remove any hint of POV, and</li>
<li>leave in the place the incredibly powerful closing paragraph, an attempt by one of the three most respected historians on Bonnie and Clyde to explain their enduring popular appeal, then and today, which the peer review loved, and so did the rest of us on 5 separate occasions when Mytwocents tried repeatedly, alone, to remove it.</li>
<li>leaves the Jimmy Fowler quote in - okay, he is a literary writer, but it is an incredibly accurate and powerful quote, summing up the Bonnie section perfectly, introducing her mysterious descent into darkness perfectly, and 5 of us want it in - as you konw, I was willing to discuss replacing it with another sumnation - but Mytwocents wants no replacement, just deletion, and that is a no-go.</li>
<li>I think the Geringer quote on corrections should go to the final run section, but will wait on your thoughts before restoring that quote to that section - it really is only appropriate there, but I want discussion before restoring it to that section - as you noted, it really applies to Bonnie and Clyde's joint vision, originated by Clyde, that corrections was a monstor they should strike at, it should not be in the closing. I think your tinkering with the closing solves any issues there. People not familiar with the duo historically come to the article wondering why Bonnie and Clyde, a minor league crime duo, her not a real "gangster" at all, have seized and held the public eye for over 70 years, and we tried in the opening to tell why, and closed by explaining why. Nice job! And the quotes are necessary because as AndyZ said in the peer review, with controversial material, quotes are always best, because they remove any hint of subjective interpretation. The quotes in the opening introduce the duo, explain why the presence of a beautiful girl elevated their acts, then and today, and the closing explained why that happened so powerfully that it has reverbrated in the national consciousness for nearly 3/4 of a century, and probably will for centuries more. Rightly or wrongly, they are the "Robin Hood and Maid Marion of America," to much of the public, then and now. (and the article makes clear by listing Clyde's killings, that he was really a psychopath who led a devoted girl to her death)</li>
<li>looking back at the contradicting line, originally, that was in because someone had a version where Clyde drove off. That was removed in the peer review, because the best source is direct quotes when subjective interpretations are possible - and Ted Hinton's direct account of the ambush, plus the official report, makes absolutely clear there is no contradiction - they blew Clyde's head off as he drove up, then opened fire with automatic weapons on Bonnie, and most of the fire came with her, and the car, directly accross, and continued after emptying the automatic rifles, a number of magazines, with shotguns and pistols, as it drifted burning, Your removal of that word was very appropriate, since there is no contradiction to what happened historically.</li>
<li>I can agree with you on the Bonnie herself...line, I would have left it in, but I can live with it being out, because it clearly says in the introduction she never fired a shot, and there were no warrants, she is not listed on the list of gang members known to have killed, so people certainly have the information necessary to see what her actual role was. I will trust you on this one, given the excellence of your work, and how well we have worked together, lol.</li>

<dd>I feel given that you are one of our most respected editors for language and editing, this should resolve the issues in this article. This is now the 7th time it has been reviewed, including the peer review. You will have consensus to keep the article as you have edited it. GOOD JOB, AS ALWAYS, AND THANKS. As I just explained to the nice lady from London, who seems quite bright, up above, (welcome to the Bonnie and Clyde wars, Theresa!) if there are any FACTS in dispute, anyone is welcome to list them. Language? 7 other people have already approved everything you left in, and you trimmed and worded to remove any hint of POV. The blunt fact is that this article is very much about Bonnie and Clyde's unique place in the culture of America, and to some extent, other places. They have a unique place in the american popular mythos, and we had to explain why. You did so, beautifully. BUT, I say as always, FACTS, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY FACTS IN DISPUTE? <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 10:28, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oldwindybear, thanks for accepting the edits! I urge MyTwoCents to discuss changes, not because it's mandatory (it isn't) but because it defuses pointless edit wars and advances the cause. On the subject of the Geringer quote, I went back &amp; studied the Final Run section, and the quote, and frankly I advise leaving it out--it's not a bad quote but it starts to tip the balance again-- there's a certain amount of material in the article that makes Clyde a vicious maniac, up against several quotes that put him in the role of Romeo, Robin Hood or a fighter for the working class. It's all part of the picture (dealing with B&amp;C's mythic status documented here) but it's a delicate balance. The article needs to convince the skeptical that it's not in any way a whitewash--meaning an excess of caution is in order to avoid POV. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 12:39, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> I accept your judgement on the Geringer quote - I really believe you are the most impartial editor we have, and one of the flat plain best at language and editing, period. I also absolutely agree on the excess of caution to avoid POV. (though I must say, it always baffled me how people viewed listing the horrors of the aftermath of the ambush, in particular, as whitewashing Clyde's murders, or by listing that no one ever even made a police complaint on Bonnie shooting anyone was a whitewash! The truth is we went out of our way to avoid claims of a whitewash by keeping out the most explosive quotes on the ambush, as you know. My own favorite not in is: "Today Hamer and the posse would be tried, and convicted, for murder, and Hamer probably executed or at the minimum given life in prison." That quote was left out precisely to avoid POV, though frankly, any human that justifies cutting the bloody clothes and hair off a dead girl and selling them for souveners, or allowing it to be done, as Hamer did, deserves life in prison)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, I cheerfully accept your decision on the Geringer quote. You have absolutely hit the nail on the head that we have to balance this article extremely carefully to explain the mythic Bonnie and Clyde that so incredibly powerfully hit the nation's consciouness during the depression, and even today dominate american popular myth, against what he, really was, a vicious psychopath, and even more importantly, what she, in particular, really was, a foolish (but sadly, quite gifted - one of the quotes deleted during peer review hit that on the head, "if she had not met Clyde Barrow, Bonnie's intelligence and talent might well have taken her far from Texas and poverty") girl who followed him to her death. (the quote was deemed too far in the balance as pro-Bonnie, I accepted it's deletion. I try to work towards agreement, as I hope you know - you and I have always worked well together) You have balanced reality and myth, explaining how the former led to the later.</li>
<li>I accept your advise because I trust you, you are impartial, and one hell of a writer. I would have left it in, but we operate here as a team, and I trust your judgement, period.</li>
<li>I also urge Mytwocents to discuss changes, because otherwise I, or randazzo, or stillstudying, will merely revert them. I think you know I am perfectly willing to listen, and discuss, and accept consensus - even when I feel otherwise - because my goal is the best possible article, AND I CANNOT DO THAT ALONE. I hope Mytwocents sees the same thing - that neither he, nor I, should decide things, but we should seek cooperative editing, and consensus. Where that does not occur, there are edit wars.</li>

<ul>
<li>Hamer unquestionably, and I can give you any cite you wish, ordered the ambush posse to fire full power NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED prior to Bonnie and Clyde's arrival. That is a vital fact, I restored it.</li>
<li>You eliminated the word "respected" from the historians cited in this article, which is not acceptable. I allowed you to remove that particular adjective, in the spirit of attempting to work towards consensus, and placed the words "recognized as experts on Bonnie and Clyde," or do you wish to dispute factually that John Phillips, John Treherne, and E. R. Milner are not nationally recognized experts? I can prove that one also.</li>
<li>Finally, the entire paragraph on the grisly and horrible aftermath of the ambush was deleted, and restored. That paragraph stays in, it has been voted in 7 times now, it was in <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 's edit, and it contains vital facts and information on the ambush and the absolutely horrific aftermath where a supposed law endorcement officer allowed people to cut blood hair and clothes off a dead girl not wanted for any violent crime. In fact, he would not stop the defacing of the dead until the coroner ordered him to secure the crime scene! Do you dispute that those incidents did not occur?

</ul>
<p>As an editor who has quietly watched these edits go back and forth over the past week, I'll add <i>my</i> two cents worth: the paragraph on the grisly aftermath should remain in but the other changes that old windy bear added back are, well, a bit windy. I don't think they change either the substance or tenor of the sentences and therefore are just excess verbiage. That the historians and writers are respected or experts, for example, does nothing (in my opinion) to further drive home the point that that <i>no</i> historian or writer has found such items (unless you are telling me that disrespected historians have turned evidence that the respected historians missed). -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 17:58, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you, <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> that the grisly aftermath paragraph must stay, it simply contains too much vital information to delete, and I thought your point on the respected/disrespected historians was hysterical. And true of course, but funny as hell, nonetheless. But evidently, oldwindybear and Mytwocents are working together, and the changes oldwindybear put back in he voluntarily removed. Nor evidently did Mytwocents remove the grisly aftermath paragraph. I must say, the spirit of cooperation is a nice change, and everyone seems honestly determined to work without nastiness. I did have to note that your comments were not only on point, but hilarious. It helps to have humor sometimes, and I am still laughing over the disrespected historians. (Actually, I suppose there really are some, who plagerize, or committ other academic no nos, but in this context, it was genuinely funny while making a good point) <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> Max 15:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That she was driven away by personal attacks horrified me. I went up and removed as many of the comments made after you posted a new start offer (including all those to Theresa when she came, and the last of those to Strothra) - Theresa has my blessing as an admin to remove the whole line (I didn't feel I could, since he was responding to me, I had to leave the uppermost in or I would be leaving him looking like he was talking to himself!). The personal attacks must stop. I hope my removal of all the edits I could shows my own disgust at an atmosphere that can drive someone away, and more importantly, my desire to not be part of such acts in any way. (I like to think I am the person who works with Ewulp so well here, or randazzo, or with Srnec on the Carolingian Empire projects) I was absolutely horrified that Kate was gone. She was an extremely nice and fair person. I wish to be remembered, when I am gone, as someone who honestly tried to donate time, a lot of it actually, to work on articles because I truly believe in wikipedia. I don't want to be part of forcing anyone out, or contributing to an atmosphere that fosters such events. I thank you for letting me know about Kate, but I am sickened that she was driven away. I refuse to be part of negative postings after this minute. Never again will I post one. If I cannot say something without it carrying a negative connotation for the editor, I won't post it. At some point, all of us who are decent people have to say enough is enough, and I am sorry to say I was guilty of quarreling over things that in 5 years won't even be remembered. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 23:57, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> Thank you - I wrote Kate, as soon as I finished here. I was really horrified after I investigated a bit into what was happening. I truly did not know she was the victim of really vicious personal attacks. I am ashamed I ever made a personal comment, because when I reflected on what has occurred with her, it is obvious to me that all of us, all decent people, have to stand up and decline to contribute in any way to the hate filled personal attacks. I believe you, and I offer, as a further sign of good faith, to invite you to look at the article on Frank Hamer. We had once agreed to taking out the controversy section there, since it was in this article. I put it back in that article, I am sorry to say, after we began arguing here. I have honored our original agreement, and just removed it. I also removed other language which could have been POV, and invite you to edit away on it. I thank you for your kind words on my work in wikipedia. I think Srnec and I did the work I am proudest of on the articles on the Carolingians, and the rewrite Kirill asked me to do on the Mongol Invasion of Central Asia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Central_Asia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Central_Asia" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but thank you again for the kind words. This incident with Kate really shocked me. I do NOT wish to be remembered as a person who encouraged an atmosphere of hate and anger, of personal attacks. I believe you will honor your pledge, as I will mine, and we will work together on this article, and who knows, if I last, maybe on the Luther article - I happen to have read his treatsies in Latin, and agree with your stance, (while his early writings do reflect loathing for Jews, that was typical for the times, I am sorry to say, and it was far less virulant than it became in his later writings...) I hope you stay on wikipedia also, and you will realistically be here when i am gone, and I hope we forge a better memory than what we had. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 02:40, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, kudos to <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> for essentially resolving the language issues remaining on this article, and generally fostering good will. I left for the memorial day weekend and it was Mars on this page, and returned today to Venus. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> I won't lie and say you and I did not get off to a poor start, as the sock puppet charge enraged me. You can study my edit history, which is beginning to build since that time, and I am obviously not oldwindybear. But I have to say, with reluctant admiration, that you deserve credit for proposing a new start here, and <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> your horror at whatever happened to Katefan0, (I gather this was a popular admin who was driven away by personal attacks, but did not know her other than a posting or two she put up, which seemed quite fair), inspired you to accept Mytwocents offer, and reject negative postings. I am going to join you both. This is the only talk page I have actually, to the best of my memory, written on, (except my own), all my other edits are as Mytwocents are, if I have the information, and it is a brief edit, which most are, I merely put it in. This seemed an especially vipurative page, and I am glad you both decided to change that. I would note I would post any major changes, but most of mine are such as my edit to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_New_Market_7fd9.html" title="Battle of New Market">Battle of New Market</a> where I noted the actual ages of the cadets involved, and where they are buried, and sourced those facts. I pledge to stand with you both and abhor negative postings on talk pages or anywhere else. I think we all should. The negative energy on wikipedia has been growing, and it needs to stop. This is a fine place to start, congratulations to all here who are trying, and I join you. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> Max 12:43, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven’t read more than a handful of words on this talk page, but they were enough to see that a certain amount of pain has been suffered (and inflicted) in getting this article to the state it is in. I found it informative and well-written. So, for what it’s worth, you all have my thanks. (The footnotes are royally screwed up, as they usually are on Wikipedia—and no, I haven’t found the magic bullet for that problem—but absolute kudos for citing sources.)

It stays unless a majority vote to move it, and no offense, but we have gone through this argument repeatedly. It is a solid commentary on their popular appeal, as you noted, and thus fits perfectly in popular culture. We who participated in the peer review agreed this should stay as the ending of the article, for precisely these reasons. However, if you have a better idea for it, I am certainly open to it - you are a good editor, and I am always willing to listen.

<dd>(after edit conflict) I moved it here for discussion and rephrasing, which apparently has not met with any response other than to undo my action.

<p><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a> I thought I explained my reasons for restoring it and showed you respect by going and explaining: first, this sums up the pair's place in the American popular lexicon of heroes, whether one admires them or not. Secondly, it perfectly sums up the popular culture article, and would merely clog the beginning, which has other comments to open the section. It was placed where it is by a peer review, which discussed these issues at length, and I believe it should stay there.

Moving the Milner paragraph to the talk page allows everyone to discuss it. To me it is so much POV fluff, and doesn't have a place in an encyclopedia article.

<dd>Greetings! Hi everyone. I still think the piece is not fluff, but the comment of a first rate historian, an acknowledged expert on the time frame in question, and the duo here, analyzing why they remain so enduring in the national consciousness 7 decades after their death. I don't have any problem with <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a>'s editing of the opening to that paragraph, but now, as then, I really feel it should stay, it is a perfect secondary source sumnation of their place in our culture - perfect for wikipedia and an encyclopedia article. I believe, and vote that it stay to close the article. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> did the edit that put it to close the article, and I think it is perfect for that purpose, good solid history, from a very first rate source. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 22:51, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Historyman1978I would have to dispute that. I think people legitimately disagree on this article, and the purpose of this talk page is to discuss those differences. Please assume good faith. I think the article is pretty good as is, but nothing is perfect in this universe but God, and the purpose of these talk pages is to talk about the disagreements. I personally think that paragraph should stay, but I don't think someone wanting to move it is "right wing." I see you are a new user, you will find that nastiness and getting personal on these issues has driven many good people off wikipedia, and done no one a bit of good. I am glad you like the article as it is, but again, please do not assume bad faith just because someone wants to change it. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:49, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
