In the early part of her career, Langford was associated with fellow child star <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lena_Zavaroni_6653.html" title="Lena Zavaroni">Lena Zavaroni</a>.</p>
<p>Her stage work includes <i><a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Pan_7c41.html" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a>: The Musical</i>, <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Cats_%28musical%29.html" title="Cats (musical)">Cats</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pirates_of_Penzance_f456.html" title="The Pirates of Penzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a></i>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Langford_3213.html" title="Edit section: Doctor Who">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Doctor Who</i></span></h2>
<p>Langford later appeared in the classic <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> series <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>, playing the role of the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_%28Doctor_Who%29_bbc7.html" title="Doctor (Doctor Who)">Doctor</a>'s companion <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Bush_6005.html" title="Melanie Bush">Mel</a>. She appeared in the cult show from 1986 to 1987, where she accompanied both the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_Doctor_2c5e.html" title="Sixth Doctor">Sixth</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh_Doctor_a8f7.html" title="Seventh Doctor">Seventh Doctor</a> on their adventures. In 1993, as part of the BBC's annual charity spectacular <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_In_Need_8ab5.html" title="Children In Need">Children In Need</a>, Langford returned as Mel in <i><a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimensions_in_Time_d1ff.html" title="Dimensions in Time">Dimensions in Time</a></i>, a special one-off crossover episode with the soap opera <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i>.

Langford's first outing was in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fires_of_Vulcan_5e40.html" title="The Fires of Vulcan">The Fires of Vulcan</a></i>, another strong performer coming second in the DWM poll in 2000. Big Finish producer <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Russell_9626.html" title="Gary Russell">Gary Russell</a> was surprised and delighted that Langford wanted to take part in the audio range as Russell thought that Langford would not want to recreate the role of Mel. So far Langford has recorded 11 audio plays and Mel, one of the least popular companions on television, is considered to have been rehabilitated.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Langford_3213.html" title="Edit section: Dancing On Ice show and tour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Dancing On Ice</i> show and tour</span></h2>
<p>In 2006, Langford was a <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity.html" title="Celebrity">celebrity</a> contestant on the first series of <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV1_cc0b.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a>'s hit show <i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_on_Ice_4ace.html" title="Dancing on Ice">Dancing on Ice</a></i>. Langford's partner in the series was American pair skater and member of the US skating team <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Evers_62c2.html" title="Matt Evers">Matt Evers</a>. The pair were consistenly voted highly by the judging panel, achieving the highest total score given (28.5 out of a possible 30) and were the only act to be awarded a maximum score of six by an individual judge - a feat they recorded twice. However, the viewing public were less favourable than the judges and on two occasions when Langford was voted top by the judging panel she was placed in the bottom two when the viewers' votes were also taken into account. (The bottom two contestants each week faced an additional skate and final choice from the judges; Langford was kept in the competition by the judges on both occasions.) Langford and Evers went out of the contest in third place in the final show when the viewers alone voted for the final three acts.</p>
<p>Langford's skating routines were characterised by the dramatic lifts and tricks she and Evers performed, including the helicopter rotation, the neck spin and the whilee bird. Langford notably banged her head on the ice whilst performing the death spin in training.</p>
<p>Langford appeared again on the programme on the Champion of Champions show which followed series two. It featured the three finalists from each series of the show and she again skated with Matt Evers. She suffered a fall during her performance but was scored second overall by the judging panel. Again the public vote was less favourable and she was amongst the four teams eliminated in the first round of the competition.</p>
<p>Langford is currently on tour with <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Torvill_and_Dean_8e0f.html" title="Torvill and Dean">Torvill and Dean</a>'s <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_on_Ice_4ace.html" title="Dancing on Ice">Dancing on Ice</a> Live</i> which runs until 6 May.</p>

<p>Whilst competing on <i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_on_Ice_4ace.html" title="Dancing on Ice">Dancing on Ice</a></i>, Langford appeared in one episode of ITV1's popular murder mystery series starring <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geraldine_McEwan_44de.html" title="Geraldine McEwan">Geraldine McEwan</a> in <i><a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV%27s_7b3d.html" title="ITV's">ITV's</a></i> new adaption of <i><a href="../../../a/g/a/Agatha_Christie%27s_Miss_Marple_24dc.html" title="Agatha Christie's Miss Marple">Agatha Christie's Miss Marple</a></i>. Langford starred in the episode <i>By the Pricking of my Thumbs</i> playing Betty Johnson alongside <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Conley_c0ae.html" title="Brian Conley">Brian Conley</a> who played Eric Johnson.</p>
<p>Langford returned to the West End theatre in April 2006 for the first time since 1998 on the back of her performances on <i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_on_Ice_4ace.html" title="Dancing on Ice">Dancing on Ice</a></i>. Langford went on to play the murderess Roxie Hart in the long-running West End musical <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_%28musical%29.html" title="Chicago (musical)">Chicago</a></i>, a role for which she received much acclaim.</p>
<p>Langford also took part in a touring two-woman theatrical show called <i>Short and Curly</i> alongside <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandi_Toksvig_3b29.html" title="Sandi Toksvig">Sandi Toksvig</a>. From 2003 to 2005, Langford was a regular guest on Toksvig's weekday lunchtime show on <a href="../../../l/b/c/LBC_2e83.html" title="LBC">LBC</a> radio, sometimes hosting the programme if Toksvig was ill or on holiday. After a successful tour in 2006 performing at several festival venues <i>Short and Curly</i> will be doing a summer tour across the country in May and June of 2007. Dates released so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday 23 May 2007 Perth Festival</li>

<li>Saturday 3 June Wyvern Theatre</li>
<li>Friday 8 June 2007 Bloomsbury Theatre London</li>

</ul>
<p>Currently Langford has enjoyed a successful run in <i><a href="../../../g/u/y/Guys_and_Dolls_da75.html" title="Guys and Dolls">Guys and Dolls</a></i> in the Birmingham tour at the Alexandra theatre, alongside <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Harman_ecc9.html" title="Nigel Harman">Nigel Harman</a> as Sky Masterson. Langford is playing Miss Adelaide Adams, a dance hall hostess. The run ended on January 6 2007. Langford's reviews have been so good that the producers have asked Langford to rejoin the show in Plymouth from 23 January until 3 February, and later in the year Langford will join the West End cast.</p>
<p>Langford also appeared in the comedy series: <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Catherine_Tate_Show_af9a.html" title="The Catherine Tate Show">The Catherine Tate Show</a></i> in a sketch with the fictional character <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Catherine_Tate_Show_characters_161a.html#Derek_Faye" title="The Catherine Tate Show characters">Derek Faye</a>. Derek always becomes very offended when people assume he is gay, and consequently he was highly offended when Langford made that assumption.</p>
<p>Over Christmas of December 2006 Langford appeared on <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_To_Be_A_Millionaire_9746.html" title="Who Wants To Be A Millionaire">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</a></i> raising money for Childline. Langford raised £16,000 for <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Childline.html" title="Childline">Childline</a></i> with celebrity partner <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Du_Beke_d9d3.html" title="Anton Du Beke">Anton Du Beke</a>.</p>

Langford won the show after being the strongest link for 6 rounds, but decided to split the prize money with another competitor, <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_Tyler_f54c.html" title="Zoe Tyler">Zoe Tyler</a>.
