<p><b>Kizuna: Bonds of Love</b> is a <a href="../../../y/a/o/Yaoi.html" title="Yaoi">yaoi</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, authored by <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazuma_Kodaka_22e7.html" title="Kazuma Kodaka">Kazuma Kodaka</a>. Released in 1994, and still ongoing, it was one of the first and most popular manga to feature a homosexual relationship.</p>
<p>The story follows Ranmaru Samejima, a star <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendo.html" title="Kendo">kendo</a> athlete, and Kei Enjouji, the illegitimate son of a <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakuza.html" title="Yakuza">yakuza</a> boss, in their attempt to preserve their relationship through hardships, such as a car accident which cripples Ranmaru, barring him from ever achieving his dreams of being a kendo star. The two must work together through their respective hardships in order to heal their relationship and discover why they loved each other in the first place.</p>
<p>It also includes a side story, in the form of a love triangle involving Enjouji's half-brother Kai Sagano, who is intent on winning Ranmaru's affections at all cost. In one scene, Ranmaru is invited by a professor to accompany him to a gay club. Upon arrival, the professor slips Ranmaru the drug ecstasy, but before he can rape him, Kai intrudes, incapacitating the professor and having sex with Ranmaru first. Kai also eventually ends up involved with one of his bodyguards, Masanori Araki, who rescues Kai from a mob kidnapping. As the story develops, feelings between Masa and Kai also begin to emerge.</p>
<p>From the fourth volume of Kizuna, we are introduced to the character, Tashiro, also a bodyguard of the yakuza and one of Masa's associates. Although he says that he had "sexual relations" with Masa it is not yet determined whether this is true or not. Tashiro also has a lover called JB.</p>
<p>The manga, currently 10 volumes long, is released in English by Be Beautiful (volumes 1-7 are on sale as of 2007)many fans prefer to also purchase the Japanese editions and read them by way of fan translations, because of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> and translation issues in the official English version. An example of the latter is the use of the use of Enjouji's first name; in the Japanese version, everyone, even his lover Ranmaru, refers to him by his surname, but the English translation uses his first name "Kei". Some fans say this alters the depiction of their relationship and Enjouji's personality.</p>
<p>In regards to censorship, the target in this regard has been certain scenes depicting memories of Kai and Masa's early relationship. Two pages from the first volume of the English translation were excised because they contained images of a very young Kai kissing Masa on the lips. While an innocent reason is given on Kai's part for this action, and Masa's reaction is one of shock and embarrassment, it was deemed suitably inappropriate by the editors and removed. A flashback to this memory in the second volume was edited so that a thought bubble obscures the image of young Kai, only showing Masa's face.</p>
<p>Kizuna is also available as an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>, in the form of three OAVs. The first two have been released in the US on DVD, most recently in a new "Special Signature Edition" with Kazuma Kodaka. A third OAV, "Much Ado About Nothing", is harder to find.</p>

<p><b>Enjouji Kei</b></p>
<p>The illegitimate son of a yakuza boss in Osaka, Kei knew nothing of the yakuza while growing up in Tokyo. His mother Hotaru, a former geisha, had not wanted her son involved in the yakuza life and ran away before he was born. When she died of lung complications she revealed to him his origins in a letter.</p>
<p>Kei met Ranmaru on their first day of middle school and fell in love with him at first sight. Much to Ranmaru's annoyance Kei pursued him that whole day showing open attraction to him. After showing off some skills during kendo practice Ranmaru invited Kei to his home to practice kendo in his family's dojo. Though Kei showed no interest in kendo they sparred anyway and later shared their first kiss with one another.</p>
<p>While he attended high school, Kei was part of the tea ceremony club. It thoroughly annoyed Ranmaru that Kei showed no interest in joining the kendo club though he had the skills for it. And it was during high school that Kei and Ranmaru took their relationship to the next level. After Hotaru died Ranmaru vowed to take care of Kei. That very same afternoon Ranmaru nearly died saving Kei from an attempted hit on Kei and ended up nearly crippled. The tables now turned, Kei took care of Ranmaru all throughout his recovery while blaming himself for what happened.</p>
<p>Kei is not at all shy about his feelings for Ranmaru. He openly confesses his feelings for him all the time, much to Ranmaru's embarrassment. But he would do anything to be with him and even gives him a wedding ring to marry him. Even though Hotaru shielded him from the yakuza life the yakuza life forced its way into Kei's life anyway, though Kei vehemently keeps his distance from it. For a long while he was in a big conflict with Kai, his half younger brother for Ranmaru's affections. He sees Kai not only as a spoiled brat trying to steal his lover but an extension of the yakuza life he wants no part of. Nevertheless he does care about his little brother in his own way and tries to keep an eye on him.</p>
<p><b>Samejima Ranmaru</b></p>
<p>A kendo whiz and the "White Devil" of kendo. Kendo has always run in his family and he's been practicing it for a long time. He ranked at the top of every national game he took part in, thus earning his title for his speed and his strength.</p>
<p>However, up to middle school he didn't really have any friends. All his time and energy was put into kendo. That all changed when he met Kei, who fell immediately in love with him. At first he was taken aback at Kei's straight-forwardness and thoroughly annoyed and disgusted with him. But he was also impressed with him and his rusty kendo skills. He invited Kei back to his house to practice and afterwards they shared a kiss. Though he didn't admit it at first it left quite an impression on him.</p>
<p>In high school he was captain of the kendo team. Kei and him ended up confessing their feelings for one another and took a physical level to their relationship. However, not too long later when he entered the kendo championships Kei learned his mother died. Seeing his lover's distress he vowed to always protect him. He ended up keeping his promise in a big way whena a yakuza hit man tried to run over Kei with a car and Ranmaru pushed him out of the way. The assault left Ranmaru paralyzed on his right side and believing he could never do his beloved kendo again. But after undergoing extensive physical therapy with Kei at his side, he managed to get his limbs moving again with a promising outlook on kendo again.</p>
<p>Ranmaru is completely shy with his feelings, but there is no denying he loves Kei. He's only been able to say the words 'I love you' to Kei once, but luckily Kei understands Ranmaru enough to know how he feels. Like Kei, Ranmaru wants no part of the yakuza life that nearly killed him, though as with Kei the yakuza life forces its way into Ranmaru's. However he takes kindly to Kai though he tries to draw the line when it comes to the younger man's affections. He wants Kei and Kai to have a brotherly relationship without the two of them having such strong animosity towards one another.</p>
<p><b>Sagano Kai</b></p>
<p>The son of a yakuza boss in Osaka and Kei's half younger brother. Though he was raised in the yakuza environment (known as 'Bon' by his father's cohorts) he has no active role in his father's business. Even Masanori has been assigned as Kai's father's successor when he retires. But Kai doesn't seem to mind this; his dealings with his father are extremely limited and they often fight with each other.</p>
<p>Kai's fighting with his father is linked to the fact that on the day of his mother's funeral when he was a child his father told him all about Hotaru and Kei. Kai saw this other family as the biggest betrayal in the world and has translated this into hatred against Kei. He ends up blaming Kei for a lot of things; he blames Kei for any unease his mother might've felt in death, he blames him for what happened to Ranmaru, etc. Because of so much pent-up anger he seems doomed to always fight with his father and half-brother.</p>
<p>He's very talented in kendo, though his passion for it isn't too high, and it's through kendo that he finds out about Ranmaru. He becomes fixated on him and eventually develops feelings for him. Such feelings end up having him temporarily disowned by his father (who also can't see that Kei and Ranmaru are a couple). But despite his best efforts Kai cannot divert Ranmaru's love from Kei and <i>eventually</i> resigns to having an unrequited love. Later on in the manga he focuses on kendo again and challenges Ranmaru to a huge match and he's able to topple his idol.</p>
<p>Kai's relationship with Masanori is extremely complex. Before Masanori rose in the ranks of the yakuza he was Kai's caretaker, often going with him on outings that parents usually do with children. Kai has always loved the much older man and Masanori has been afraid of his feelings for Kai, not just because of their age difference and their positions but also because of the feelings Masanori once held for Kai's mother. Kai then turned his attention to Ranmaru and scorned Masanori on several occasions, though it was apparent there was something going on between them. However when Kai was ready to put his feelings for Ranmaru behind him and focus on Masanori, he had to practically beat the older man's head in to get his point across. Their relationship is sent into even bigger turmoil when Kai is raped by one of Masanori's scorned lovers and the trauma rears its head when they become intimate with one another. Kai feels very guilty he can't put it behind him but Masanori understands and is willing to take it slow.</p>
<p><b>Araki Masanori</b></p>
<p>One of the big wig's in one of Osaka's largest yakuza syndicates, he was selected by Sagano himself to take over the business when he retired. The Araki family themselves seem to be situated inside the yakuza lifestyle; Masanori's older brother Hitoshi was a member of the Kazama syndicate in Hana to Ryu. Despite his position Masanori is very protective of his syndicate and everyone who works in it and will not hesitate to deal out punishments when seen fit.</p>
<p>Even with his brother's position he started out at the low ranks as Kai's caretaker. When he started out he fell in love with Kai's mother and was always ashamed of his feelings. He was also very upset by the affair Sagano had with Hotaru, though supposedly Kai's mother never got upset about it publicly. He's always been very protective of Kai but somewhat afraid of the affection Kai held for him. When Kai was a child he brushed it off the feelings as sort of a child love but when Kai still showed those feelings in his early teens it unnerved him and pushed him away. Kai ended up falling in love with Ranmaru and Masanori ended up bedding a few people to forget whatever feelings he might've held for Kai and his mother.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it was one of these bedfellows who ended up causing Kai a lot of hurt as he kidnapped and raped him. Despite their past Masanori wasted no time in killing him in revenge, though Kai pleaded with him not to. This incident seemed to further drive a wedge between them; Masanori felt guilty because the attack was his fault and Kai felt guilty because he felt the scorned lover genuinely loved Masanori. Their relationship was nearly permanently damage until Kai managed to put his feelings for Ranmaru behind him and aggressively pursue a reluctant Masanori.</p>
<p>Though he did not approve of the affair he shows Kei and Ranmaru the highest amount of respect and his loyalty to Sagano is unwavering. He tries to keep his growing relationship with Kai a secret but both of their zealous natures is let known in the presence of Masanori's cohorts (mainly Kyousuke). Despite this he takes their relationship very slowly in light of the trauma Kai suffered.</p>
<p><b>Tashiro</b></p>
<p>On the surface he's an extremely easy-going Eurasian who makes light of any situation. But in fact he's a well-trained hit man trusted by the Sagano syndicate.</p>
<p>He wasn't always a hit man, though. He use to work at a church/orphanage on land that once belonged to his father, going by his first name Roy. But when one of the girls gets gang-raped and the caretaker won't allow police intervention, he swears revenge. It's around this time Tashiro meets J.B., a trained hit man visiting the church. After a long while he convinces the man to train him to kill the men, in return he'll teach him Japanese...and give him his body. J.B. complies, but Tashiro ends up nearly dead himself when he hesitates in killing the rapists and J.B. does it for him. After sharing the night together J.B. disappears from Tashiro's life with the message for him to find another way to live.</p>
<p>But Tashiro decides to live as a hit man anyway in hopes of finding J.B. again. His job ends up taking him to Japan where the Sagano syndicate hires him out to kill the man who tried to mow down Kei with a car. Tashiro does the deed, but this further incites the wrath of the organization who sought Kei's death. Years later the Sagano syndicate hires him out again, this time to guard Kai from the same organization sending out a copy to do dirty deeds and sully the Sagano name. His upbeat personality annoys the hell out of Kai, who's trying to come to grips with his feelings for Ranmaru and Masanori. But he proves to be a very effective bodyguard while tracking Kai and eventually taking out the leader of the opposing organization.</p>
<p>It's during this job that Tashiro runs into J.B. again for the first time in 8 years. Unfortunately J.B. has been putting the Japanese he learned from Tashiro to good use and was hired by the opposing organization. In the end J.B. refuses to follow an order based on his own set of code and the two are reunited in the aftermath. Recognizing that Tashiro willfully chose the life of a hit man and he'd been looking for him all that time, the two hook up as a double team and do jobs together, while rekindling the flame they once had.</p>
<p><b>J.B.</b></p>
<p>One of the best hit men in the world. He's very calculating in his jobs and he makes sure to follow through with them. But he's not a bloodthirsty killer; he's constantly ashamed of his profession and he has a strict code as to never harm any children. He had been the one originally hired out to kill Kei, but he refused because of Kei's age.</p>
<p>On one occasion he frequented a church/orphanage after carrying out a job. Here he meets a very overeager Tashiro and becomes quite fond of him. When one of the girls at the orphanage is gang-raped and Tashiro is rearing to kill the men responsible, J.B. hopes to diffuse that notion. But Tashiro won't be silenced and J.B. relents and teaches him. Truthfully it was suppose to be a diversionary tactic, but Tashiro rushed in to kill the rapists anyway and it was only J.B.'s interference that saved him. J.B. didn't want Tashiro getting involved in such a dark life and even as he took the younger man to bed he was revulsed with himself for corrupting what he considered to be an angel. He ended up leaving Tashiro, hoping the younger man chose a different way of life.</p>
<p>He continues his life as a hit man until he gets a job in Japan to kill Sagano, Masanori, and Tashiro (the one who killed Kei's would-be hit man). Though he accepts the job he's not wiled about killing Tashiro and seeks the younger man out several times to try and get him to leave Japan. But Tashiro won't be deterred either and each attempt to carry out their jobs, though they're on opposing sides. But Tashiro is the only one who does his job, as J.B. can't follow through with an order since Kai (whom he considers a kid) threw himself in front of Masanori.</p>
<p>In the aftermath J.B. confronts Tashiro at the airport and they reunite as lovers again. He seems to have come to terms with the fact that Tashiro chose to be a hit man and they work together as a double team in carrying out jobs.</p>
