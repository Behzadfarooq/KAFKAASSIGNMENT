<p>Conclusion: I'm sick and tired of his pOV pushing and I"m not gonna edit war with him. His action has evolves from POV pushing on Taiwanese article by claiming Taiwanese are Chinese to reverting all of my contributions for example "wigger". His campaign seems to be out of personal vendetta rather than good faith in the project. His constant stalking and harassment causes me to both tired and disappointed. If he is not blocked, then I don't think I will edit anymore since he will revert all of my good faith edits anyway. He seems to be pursuing me so anyway I hope you'll take a look at this and hopefully block him or file a Rfa. I don't know.

It is important to know give a wider community a chance to evaluate his behavior.

<p>User:Thousandsons Thousandsons (talk • contribs • page moves • block user • block log) received an indef. block plus talkpage protection, so he is unable to request an unblock. The block seem highly dubious, especially without the intervention of ArbCom and/or Jimbo Wales. From his contributions, he simply committed petty vandalism. A block such as this shouldn't be enforce by one individual admin without consensus. P.S. My userpage and his userpage is a little bit similar, but I am NOT his sockpuppet. A groundless, privacy-invading checkuser was previously filed and proved my innocence. Thanks--Bonafide.hustla 08:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will look into it. - A Man In Bl♟ck (conspire | past ops) 08:39, 2 August 2006 (UTC) User posted personal details of other people, threatened to "fuck up all ya pages and shyt," vandalized user pages, and personally threatened admins who intervened to prevent vandalism. He's staying blocked, and the page is staying protected. - A Man In Bl♟ck (conspire | past ops) 08:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC) I thought talkpage and userpage do not follow wikipedia regulations.--Bonafide.hustla 10:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's pretty clear this user should not be unblocked, he has made threats acted inappropriatley and childishly. Matthew Fenton (contribs) 10:58, 2 August 2006 (UTC) No that's incorrect - "# Community policies, including Wikipedia:No personal attacks, apply to your user space just as they do elsewhere. # In some cases, material that does not somehow further the goals of the project may be removed (see below), as well as edits from banned users."</p>

<p>Do you really think userpages should be a safe haven for comments such as</p>
<p>"Oh just fuck you! when I get unblocked your ganna see some shyt, cuz I'm commin' foe you, and don't lye this is cuz I'm black, I'd get the police involved if I wasn't a nigger, you better unblock me now If you whant me ta stop being so black, I'm ganna give ya a day ta think about weather or not ya wanna deal wit me, and believe you me homie I know all bout harassment and I ain't ganna stop on this mutha fuckin syte, if i'm not unblocked at 3:00 I'm ganna hack your shyt, harras you and basicly just fuck you around, so think about it ok NiggeR?"</p>
<p>--Charlesknight 10:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Making threats charles is just going to get you blocked. Matthew Fenton (contribs) 10:56, 2 August 2006 (UTC) Well then I urge you to take a look at User:Jiang's userpage and talkpage. It seems to be a personal attack (albeit against a group).--Bonafide.hustla 12:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What, precisely, are you hoping to accomplish here? The guy has vandalized, the guy has made threats, the guy is NOT here to do the encyclopedia any good whatsoever: NOBODY is going to unblock him, it's clear, but more to the point, why would you think it's a good idea to do so? No phony comparatives with other cases or users, please: what is it about THIS guy -- User:Thousandsons -- that exempts him from the ordinary expected standards of behavior? --Calton | Talk 12:42, 2 August 2006 (UTC) It looks as if the whole point of this report is to be one more devious round in the endless attempt to get User:Jiang to remove an image from his user page, as featured on AN/I and elsewhere, ad infinitum. Frankly, this looks like borderline WP:POINT to me, and User:Bonafide.hustla is still edit-warring all over the place with User:RevolverOcelotX over Taiwain China Taiwan China Taiwan, instead of going through the dispute resolution process as advised. Time to community-ban both of them? --ajn (talk) 13:01, 2 August 2006 (UTC) Neither does Bonafide.hustla have clean hands regarding "groundless, privacy-invading checkuser" requests. Thatcher131 (talk) 14:08, 2 August 2006 (UTC) My response on my talkpage--Bonafide.hustla 05:18, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sigh. The "response" on the talk page was to copy and paste -- twice -- the above section. So it looks like the answer to the question, "What, precisely, are you hoping to accomplish here?" is "nothing whatsoever". --Calton | Talk 06:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC) Sorry there was an editing conflict when I tried to add my point. I'll summarize it on my talkpage now.--Bonafide.hustla 07:55, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience. I don't know why it shows up twice but anyway I just gotta summarize what I planned to write. It's not very well-written, but basically what I recall from my experience with RevolverOcelotX and my reasoning for Thousandsons and Jiang.</p>
<p>The reason I brought up Thousandson's case was becasue I felt the block was a somewhat out of process especially with the use of talkpage protection. (he does contribute to hip-hop related article however). <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">User:PoolGuy</a> issue needs to go ArbCom. But anyway forget about it 'cause it's really not that important. If I were an admin, I prolly would've blocked him too. By calling my comparion phony is pretty uncivil on Calton's part. I actually have a question for <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">User:Calton</a>, why did you revert article <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> to RevolverOcelotX's version without attempt to communicate or post in the talkpage despite Yuje's explanaiton in the edit summary. (I have posted my reason for reverting the article in the talkpage instead of edit war, no one is responding).</p>
<p>Andrew Normal claims I continue to revert war with RevolverOcelotX, this is wrong. My contribution in the last several days speak for themselves. Anyway, ever since I pledged to cease the edit war on my talkpage (see above). I am NOT involved in any Taiwan-China related articles whatsoever. I stated on my own talkpage. The reason being that since not a single admins/wikipedians seem to KNOW or CARE about that user's constant "borderline" POV pushing, gaming the rule (carefully following 3RR and constantly post 3RR warning on others talkpage even though only "1" edit was made at that time), and other violations (PA, spamming, etc), then I'm not gonna undo his borderline edits doing it. It's the project own loss by allowing editors as such. He basically went as far as changing the Naming Conventions so he can appear to be abiding the rules. So I said a few days ago that I'm outta the dispute, you know, he won. He can do what he wants to do 'cause no one seems to give a sh*t. Excuse my language. The only stuff he does is adding tags (which is prolly a good thing) and making those seemingly okay edits but doesn't present anything new in the article. One example was when he distorts the level of support for Chinese re-unification in Taiwan. see below. I'm not gonna look for the diff. now, prolly do it later if you guys want proof.</p>
<p>I resent Andrew's accusation of blocking us both. We are in fact, 2 different users. If you look further into the contributions of me and him. It is evident that I edit in a way broader scale. I Hate edit warring, I already stated that before. That's basically the reason I half-quit editing. An attempt to compromise was made in June. The communication became fierce and the user vandalize my talkpage without unjustified tags and then accuses me of committing "3RR" on my own talkpage. Despite <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBish_962c.html" title="User:Bish">User:Bish</a> effort to explain to him that the rule doesn't apply to talkpages, he reported me and I got an unjustified block from admin Alex. (he later apologized, see my block log for the 1 second technical block). RevolverOcelotX basically STALKED me. He reverted everything I edit, NOT only Taiwan-China related articles. One example is <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigger.html" title="Wigger">wigger</a>. His motive seems to be strictly out of personal vendetta. While attempts of communication made in late June was turned down. He refused to compromise. If I file a complaint, a checkuser (more detailed below against him), to other admins, he'll instantly spam their talkpages and copy all my arugments against him then use it on me. (more examples below)</p>
<p>Andrew Norman claims my "endless" attempt to remove Jiang's picture. I must say, other users has expressed similar concerns for the images. An AN/I discussion was opened by me like couple of months ago, receiving minimal feedbacks (no one understanding the Chinese writing on it except Taiwan=shame, Dalai Lama owns slave, among others, which are written in English). It was nominated for deletion by User:QuizQuick and many other users also express concern about the racial hatred and political propaganda on the images. see <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDavid_Wu_8bea.html" title="Talk:David Wu">Talk:David Wu</a>. It is already bad enough that the controversial, offensive images are on there, but what's even worse is many of his edits push for the propaganda on the image. Jiang is a self-proclaimed Chinese nationalist who believe is very anti-Taiwanese. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKoavf&amp;diff=66450780&amp;oldid=66449516" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKoavf&amp;diff=66450780&amp;oldid=66449516" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 08:41, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After a short wikibreak, I am furious to learn that I had been blocked from editing on the issue of removing warnings from my talkpage, 3RR, and lack of communication. Listed below is a concise and brief explanation.</p>
<p>1. Removing warnings:</p>
<p>A. One is perfectly entitled to remove such warnings from his/her talkpage. An admin support my claim.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51310558" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=51310558" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>] Another user removed my warning from his talkpage.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Henry_Flower&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50938446" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Henry_Flower&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50938446" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>]. To add to that the warnings is justified. An admin support my case. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60587087" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60587087" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60586139" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60586139" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>] support from another user. Read the full length discussion on <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">User:Bishonen</a> talkpage under the heading User:RevolverOcelotX.</p>
<p>B. Even if I am not allowed to remove such warnings, the warning clearly isn't justified. According to the history of List of Chinese Americans and Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China articles, you would see Bonafide.hustla and RevolverOcelotX had both made 3 reverts in the past 24 hours 2 days ago. However, when the initial warning was placed by RevolverOcelotX I made only 1 edit to the article, making the warning totally irrelevant. He placed the warning on the ground that I BROKEN the 3RR on my user talk page after the final warning. As evident in the above discussion, an admin states that 3RR does not apply to a user's personal talkpage. The accusation is groundless.</p>
<p>2. 3RR Again, the 3RR clearly states that a block should only occur if I have made MORE than 3 reverts in the last 24 hrs for an article. I did not unless you count my personal talkpage, but we already established the 3RR does not apply to personal talkpages. See A. and B. above for further details.</p>
<p>3. Lack of communication</p>
<p>A. A series of POV pushing by RevolverOcelotX occured when he first arrived at wikipedia, when I revert his edits as an effort to preserve NPOV (never violating 3RR), he started to engage himself in edit warring with me and many other users [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Chinese_Americans&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Chinese_Americans&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>] While I have also posted relevant reasons for reverts in both edit summary and relevant talkpages, he failed to do so. When I attempted to communicate in order to end edit warring, he angrily responded and continue to make POV edits specifically in Taiwanese-Chinese relation. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60572691&amp;oldid=60555868" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARevolverOcelotX&amp;diff=60572691&amp;oldid=60555868" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>]</p>
<p>4. Conduct of User:RevolverOcelotX</p>
<p>A. Ever since this user's initial arrival, he has been on a crusade to distort information about Taiwan, China articles. see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RevolverOcelotX" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RevolverOcelotX" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>].</p>
<p>B. His behavior is similar to <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">User:PoolGuy</a> and often commits wikilawyering. He is in the process of wasting the community's patience. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60596743&amp;oldid=60595857" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>]</p>
<p>C. This user went as far as harassing admin to support my case in order to prove his point. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60587999&amp;oldid=60587087" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=60587999&amp;oldid=60587087" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>] (Sorry this is my mistake see below)</p>
<p>D. This user even edit the naming convention: Chinese in order to justify his edits. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>]</p>
<p>E. Spamming [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66308328" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66308328" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>]</p>
<p>Conclusion: It is obvious that the block on me is not justified. Thanks and I hope someone will restore this unfair treatment.--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 23:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After summarizing the other admins accusation and criticism, I think I can summarize them into 3 major points: <a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">User:Jiang</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">User:RevolverOcelotX</a>, and my suspicion of their connections. I don't have time to look at each individual articles (Revolver added Chinese American tag to every single Taiwanese American) but a good way to start is the article <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_unification.html" title="Chinese unification">Chinese unification</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wu_3540.html" title="David Wu">David Wu</a>.</p>
<p>1. Checkuser was requested based on the evidence provided in here. Also in point 2[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/RevolverOcelotX" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/RevolverOcelotX" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>]. I have no idea how both Jiang and Revolver found out about my request (I didn't found out Nlu's request on me until 4 months later), miraculously in a span of 4 minutes. They each post comments and scoff at my request. Something that is extremely rare and disruptive to a checkuser request.</p>
<p>2. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_unification.html" title="Chinese unification">Chinese unification</a>: Massive POV pushing in this particular article by Revolver (prollly 1 out of 150ish articles he's been crusading). I resent these forms of POV edits. Most other editors do NOT know the political situation to revert or recognize how offensive/biased it is. One example occurs when [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58459720" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58459720" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58460273" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58460273" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>] this user claims Chinese (re)unification is wrong. It is obvious POV. From a Taiwanese perspective, Chinese (re)unification can be seen as either annexation by China, Chinese expansioniam or Chinese unification, but NOT "re"unification since Taiwan is never part of PRC. After I found out about it, I reverted back to the version by admin <a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">User:Nlu</a>, which this user promptly revert it back to his obvious POV version [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=58908773&amp;oldid=58905305" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=58908773&amp;oldid=58905305" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>] [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=58995510&amp;oldid=58972747" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=58995510&amp;oldid=58972747" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>](2nd time). That was when Jiang stepped in and preserve the POV edits by Revolver although it is violation of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_0623.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)</a> (another article Revolver distorts).

That was when I realize I can't edit war with both of them, so I stopped. Then found an incredibly POV sentence in the article which claims there are MANY mainlander taiwanese (came over after the communist rebellion, who supports unification and some who oppose it. Without citation, without proof and factually incorrect. It also serves as a way to divide Taiwanese population. So what I did was change "many" to "some", [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=59893571&amp;oldid=59504744" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=59893571&amp;oldid=59504744" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>].

Then I arrive back to Wikipedia, noticing "some" was changed to "many" by Revolver, so I changed the wording to make it neutral.

That was when I gave up reverting since Jiang's an admin.

Jiang reverted back again, in his edit summary he stated "some &lt; majority; avoid obviously false assertion". Openly distorting Taiwanese opinions on the issue. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60759724" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60759724" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>]. Then someone else reverted back to "some" since Jiang's positio is clearly POV.

Throughout this dispute, I have closely monitored the progress while not getting involve. I thought the issue is solved but then Revolver revert back to many [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61175931" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61175931" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>] claiming some is "false" assertion. A clear display of bias. Someone later reverted back to "some' [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61176550" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_reunification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61176550" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>]. Throughout this conflict, it is evident that Jiang and Revolver are either socks OR there Jiang is tacitly agreeing Revolver's POV edits, in the process, abuse his admin power. Jiang helped Revolver's cause not once, but THREE times. In this article, we could see the obvious connection between the two as well as RevolverOcelotX obvious bias. Such user should definitely be ban. It also shows "I" am trying to maintain NPOV on here, so andrew's comment was really hurtful to me, like classifying me and Revolver as the same deed. I'm defeated however, so I don't think there's gonna be anyone who will maintain NPOV on these articles in the future. Okay this is my bedtime, I'll talk about the other 2 topics tomorrow or whenever I logged in next time.

<p>Please explain how my edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wigger&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68322003" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wigger&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68322003" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> was vandalism. Perhaps you misunderstand the word <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro.html" title="Negro">negro</a>, it's not derogatory word, nor was it intended in a derogatory manner. Personally, I consider the term "Black people" derogatory since people of African origin don't actually have "black" skin, it's a dark shade of brown.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your threat that I will be banned was completely unjustified and incorrect. Firstly, Wikipedia does not usually ban people for first time offences. Secondly, you're not an administrator, so you wouldn't be the one making that judgement. Thirdly, my edit was not even vandalism, and you are supposed to assume good faith (see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). If it weren't for that policy I'd assume you are a troll and contact an administrator about this.</p>
<p>I think I deserve an appology for your threatening and libelous comments on my talk page, and I think you should spend more time thinking about edits before you jump to the conclusion that they are vandalism.</p>

<dd>Fair enough. I do emphatically dispute I was "edit warring" inasmuch as I was merely protecting the integrity of the articles from inappropriate injections of POV without a dog in the fight, which in my mind makes me impartial to the situation and therefore able to block to repeated instances. (I've taken the liberty to remove another user's inappropriate comment in my defense, and ask that no such irrelevant comment be posted by anyone in the future. I don't need an advocate. Feel free to opine at my second RfA if one is forthcoming.) - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_Userpage_0087.html" title="User:Crzrussian/Userpage">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 09:50, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I endorse Dmcdevit's request because of your self-unblock (I have no opinion of the other matters he raises). See the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">Administrators' reading list</a>: "Admins are expected to have an intimate understanding of Wikipedia policy.

<p>I endorse the request too. Both the self-unblocking and the edit-war w/ blocking pointed out by Dmcdevit (I don't know if you had a dog in the fight, but judging "innapropriate injections of POV" is never without a subjective aspect and so policy demands that you don't do the blocks yourself in a case like that) cast doubt on your understanding of when it is appropriate to use the extra tools. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:31, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to emphasize that I am not calling for Crzrussian's de-adminning based on what has occurred, but rather for a re-test of consensus regarding whether he should be an admin. I am also in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category%7EAdministrators_open_to_recall_309a.html" title="Category:Administrators open to recall">Category:Administrators open to recall</a>, and my personal take on listing myself there is that I do not feel it should be a big deal to have that consensus, that once existed, re-checked. Simply unblocking yourself may well be enough to merit the re-check, in my opinion -- and with the other issues, it seems more than reasonable. Personally I hope Crzrussian desn't step down, and doesn't remain a non-admin for two months or more, should the recall petition succeed. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 20:41, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When I put my name in the recall cat, I promised to surrender the use of the sysop tools upon request. Now, it's obvious to me that if I stand for RfA2 right now, I will splendidly fail, because as many will tell you, the process is broken. Nor is it an attractive option for me go through that week-long ordeal again. If six users really do believe that my continuing as a sysop will be a worse for this project than my desysopping, then I will stand down immediately. I just hope that the pro-recall people have thought about the consequences in the same way. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_Userpage_0087.html" title="User:Crzrussian/Userpage">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 21:43, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Remember... recall is a voluntary process. IMHO it is up to Crzrussian to declare/decide what exactly are the qualifications, numbers and so forth he wants to see (remember, if he is not reasonable, there's always RfC or ArbCom, so it's a good reason to be reasonable) before deeming the request valid I would like to offer my services (if this makes any sense) to help work through the process.... i will take no position on whether he should or should not accept the request, or what the outcome should be, but offer to help moderate, clerk, etc if the help is desired. My goal here is that this be a process that all see as fair, civil and collegial, and not excessively burdened with formality but that nevertheless ends up with a result that has consensus. If this meets with agreement let me know.</p>
<p>For the record, my own take on the process the way I'd execute it is that if 6 editors ask for recall, I'd start a discussion process (or a re RfA, or an RfC, whatever I chose) to see what the right outcome ought to be... 6 people so certifying would not mean I'd ask for desysopping, merely that a discussion be carried out... That discussion might end up with an offer to be mentored or a decision that there wasn't a big issue, or a resignation. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:40, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I haven't been following the blow-by-blow here in strict chronological order, so I don't know what you last word so far has been, but in at least a few places you seem to have written you'll step down if nominated for recall. Please don't. That's not what a nomination is; just like someone nominated for adminship doesn't automatically become an admin, someone nominated for recall shouldn't automatically get recalled. I can appreciate that being the first actually nomiated for recall might not be a "first" you'd be proud of ... but if you think about it, I suspect you'd regret standing down without going through the process more. You're a member of <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category%7EAdministrators_open_to_recall_309a.html" title="Category:Administrators open to recall">Category:Administrators open to recall</a>, and that's admirable; that should not be the same as Category:Administrators without a spine, however. Don't hand in your <a href="../../../r/o/u/Category%7ERouge_admins_daa4.html" title="Category:Rouge admins">rouge</a> yet, please.</p>
<p>By the way, you probably aren't in the reminiscing mood now, but I'll risk remembering my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Crzrussian_2d80.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Crzrussian"><i>suppose</i> or <i>opport</i> here</a>. "...he is sometimes <i>wrong</i>, ... but ... doing the right thing eventually is enough". Yes, I do kind of wish I wasn't right in my statement there, but I don't regret my vote or the outcome one bit.</p>
<p>I won't say I'm proud of you for that comment, it was an insensitive and offensive thing to write; blocking someone you were possibly debating with was ... debatable ...; and unblocking yourself was an unnecessary violation of process, not <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. Bad move triple combo, you screwed up.

<p>My concern is that recall in general, and this case in particular, will weed out the admins that are actually responsive to community correction, leaving the intransigent admins behind. I have hesitated to name names, but I am thinking specifically of <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:Dbiv</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">User:Marudubshinki</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">user:Everyking</a>. Dbiv is before <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Irishpunktom_Proposed_decision_3aca.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Irishpunktom/Proposed decision">Arbcom</a> for misusing admin tools in an edit war, while on Fred's talk page, the Arbcom talk pages, and his own talk page he refuses to acknowledge he ever did anything wrong. Even so the committee was divided 4-3 on whether to de-sysop him. Maru, on the other hand, repeatedly used an unauthorized bot, first on a bot account, then his own account, and even gave the bot admin functions; and unblocked himself to continue to run the bot. And yet there was never any discussion here of desysopping him, just that he shouldn't unblock himself and should not run the bot again without authorization. And of course Everyking has been before arbitration at least 4 times, often for harassing other admins. If we force the issue and put Crzrussian through recall, won't we be saying to other admins, if you offer yourself up for recall, we will hold you to a much higher standard than admins who ignore community pressure after passing their RFA? Maybe raising the bar is a good thing, but there is no way Crzrussian should be the first guy thrown overboard. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thatcher131_e41f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thatcher131">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I think the idea behind the recall procedure <i>is</i> to hold oneself to higher standards than those enforced by the ArbCom. I think Crzrussian is doing the right thing by taking the complaints seriously. If he does hand in his bit I expect it will go a long way towards restoring trust in him for those who have lost it. With the huge amount of useful work he's done as an admin he'll have a landslide of support votes if he decides to stand again. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 22:05, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to keep you informed, the recent edits on the David Wu page that I reverted had nothing to do with nationality or ethnic questions, but instead over an alledged incident while he was in college. Several people have tried to insert inflamatory statements about Wu being a rapist. While he did confess to an incident and apologized for it, he was never charged or convicted of anything. Given the fact that there was a different dispute recently, I thought I'd let everyone know what was going on. If you have an questions, don't hesitate to leave me a message. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 03:29, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just wanted to disagree with your ANI complaint about children or people using the site for social interaction. It is a strongly held belief of mine that we need to bring in more and more people and keep them here—if they think the site doubles as a blog or MySpace, well, good, if that draws them here or helps keep them around. Participation translates into constructive work one way or another, at least on a broad scale, even if some individuals aren't showing it. I'm happy with encouraging participation with an openness to utilizing the site for social interaction. I can only see the potential for harm by cracking down on this; what good could come of it? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:24, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
