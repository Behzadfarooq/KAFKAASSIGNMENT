<p>This article probably needs fact-checking.</p>
<p>response: it's current as of the most recent National Geographic specials, "Social Climbers". As bonobo numbers are down 50% in the past 5 years, it seems unwise to wait for the researchers profiled to return from the woods to write papers.</p>
<p>Fact Checking Needed, %s Off...</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I recall correctly, Frans de Waal is highly supportive of figures greater than 95% DNA match between humans and Bonobos. Infact, the latest tests show that Bonobos are 99-99.6% identical to humans. The "originally 98.5%" figure refers to common *Chimpanzees*, not Bonobos. And it isn't "originally", it's been recently verified. I'm not sure why my edit that suggested this potentiality was so quickly dismissed...I left the 95% (however wrong it is, I felt it was up to original author to remove it).</dd>

<dd>Those numbers don't make sense. <i>Pan</i> and <i>Homo</i> split before any of the three extant species came into existence. <i>P. troglodytes</i> and <i>P. paniscus</i> are more closely related to each other than either is to <i>H. sapiens</i>. Why would the numbers show otherwise? Perhaps the difference is in what those numbers represent. If I understand things correctly, the bigger numbers often quoted (98.5, 99, 99.6) represent percentage of useful genomic information is the same, while the smaller number (95, 96) represent percentage of total genomic information that is the same. Other differences I believe come from other different ways the numbers are calculated.</dd>

<dd>If Bonobos are more closely related to Humans than either is to the Common Chimpanzee, then I think we'd see a much bigger push to put all three species into the same genus. While there is somewhat of a movement to do so (and has been for many generations now!) there isn't the strong evidence to support it. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 17:15, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You obviously know little about primatology.&#160;:) One of the most interesting concepts is that non-human primates are more genetically diverse than the most genetically similar primates are from humans, if that makes any sense. Read up on it, it's fascinating stuff. Your argument for the debunked 95% is both completely true and completely wrong because of this vast genetic drift that occurs within the same species. The 99.6% represents the MOST SIMILAR to Homo sapiens, not the average. The widely accepted numbers are as follows: 99-99.6 Bonobos, 98.4-98.5 chimps, 94.7 gibbons (that's off the top of my head so they might be slightly off, but I'm pretty sure that's how it goes). And those numbers are from karyotype, amino acid sequencing, DNA hybridization (DNA comparison, for the layman).</dd>
<dd>Etherealstrife 18:41, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>BTW: The recent genome study would probably be a better estimate of the "average" (since as I understand it it compares the 'average' chimp and human, showing 2.7% variance) - Etherealstrife 19:05, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I stand (or sit) corrected. I know much about primate taxonomy, but little about DNA hybridization and genomic comparison. But I ask, if there's a 99-99.6% similarity between us and Bonobos, and a 98.4-98.5% similarity between us and Common Chimpanzees, what's the similarity % between Bonobos and Common Chimpanzees? Also, is this just nuclear genetic material comparison, or is this including mitochondrial? - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 19:58, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AFAIK there's no information on how similar bonobos and common chimpanzees are, as we've been using ourselves as reference points (if there is, I've never seen/heard anything on it). As you mentioned previously the research dealing with bonobos is fairly limited (despite their importance), and we've only just recently been able to compare chimpanzee and human genomes (heck, we've only had our own for 2-3 years...). As for the hybridization, it does use mitochondrial. Just heat it up to ~200F (to separate bonds), and swap one half with 'donor'.</dd>

<p>On the name 'bonobo': I "read somewhere" (a respectable popular science book but I'm blowed if I can remember what) that the reason for the name 'bonobo' is unclear, and might have been an error from the name of a town on a packing crate used to export a specimen. The writer suggested that the correct name in a local Bantu language was <i>elya</i>, plural <i>bilya</i>. This is fascinating to me as a linguist (I'd love to import some Bantu plurals into English), and <i>elya</i> reminds me of <a href="../../../e/l/o/Eloi.html" title="Eloi">Eloi</a> -- but I can't justify putting it into the article without finding that book again. No confirmation on Web search.

<p>The percentage of DNA in common between humans and bonobos now says "98.6%" because it can be CITED: "More than 98% of bonobo DNA is like that of human's and it is a fraction of a percent closer to human DNA than that of the common chimpanzee." The source is popular but reliable: (<a href="http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html" class="external free" title="http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html</a>).

<p>I've heard that adult bonobos have sex with child ones as well. Could somebody talk about age in sex? Things like several kinds of sex relations are limited to certain types of partners,...

<dd>In my college anthropology course, I was told that there are all varieties of sexual behaviors between all of the members of the species.

<dd>I remember seeing a BBC documentary about bonobos where it was stated that their only taboo was sex between a mother and a son below a certain age (4 years?)

<dd>I just got my books for a physical anthropology class and one of them has an article on bonobos and their sexual practices. It says that the young engage in sex play (sounded similar to Brave New World), and that the young rub their genitals against adults, but that the males probably don't insert their penis into young females. I don't see anything about sex within families, but it seems quite feasable.</dd>

<dd>A proposal that's been around for a few years, boosted this month by new research showing that functional genes are something like 99.5% identical (as opposed to non-coding DNA, which has mutated more freely). This is said to be enough to justify calling humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos members of the same <i>genus</i> (what they meant by 'family' there). As the name <i>Homo</i> has date priority over <i>Pan</i>, they'd become <i>Homo troglodytes</i> and <i>Homo paniscus</i>. It also throws out all the hominid names: genera <i>Australopithecus, Ardipithecus, Paranthropus</i> necessarily become part of the same genus <i>Homo</i>. But others argue that the differences between humans and the rest justify such a division, humans forming one <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clade.html" title="Clade">clade</a> and the rest forming a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraphyletic.html" title="Paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> grade. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a> 16:38 29 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is close to what I remember - the definition of the same species is being able to have a child together and for that child to be fertile. There are lots of examples in nature where different species have children, but because they are different species the child is infertile - for example horses and donkeys produce mules which are infertile. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.146.12.239_bf06.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.146.12.239">83.146.12.239</a> (<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User_talk%7E83.146.12.239.html" title="User talk:83.146.12.239">talk</a>) 22:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Estimates suggest there are 10 000 to 100 000 bonobos left in the wild - numbers are pretty uncertain; but the occasionally quoted estimate of 5 000 derives from a miscalculation. 50 000 seems possible Reference: Thompson, J., Hohmann, G., Furuichi, T.

<p>Bonobos are <b>NOT</b> the only non-human apes to have been observed engaging in oral sex. Orangutan males routinely perform oral sex on females before engaging in sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>I forget the exact chapter, but this was noted in Carl Sagan's (coauthor: Ann Druyan) <i>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0345384725</a>), in one of the middle chapters...

<p>In <i>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors</i>, page 281 (Chapter 15: Mortifying Reflections): <i>...cunnilingus is an almost invariable part of foreplay among the orangs...</i> Sagan provides the following reference: B.M.F.

<dd>I believe you are correct.

Bagemihl notes Orangs, Common Chimps and Gorillas generally doing about the same kinds of things, but in various degrees and variations, although Bonobos do a bit more and a bit more often, and in more variety. I'm trying to find a way to edit all of the species articles here that BE covers without overwhelming the articles. Also, I'm not sure the article was saying the Bonobos are the only apes other than humans to perform cunnilingus. I believe the point was that they are the only ones besides us to do all of the listed activities. However, I'm not sre how accurate that is. I might go through BE and make a spreadsheet documenting the sexual activities of the great apes. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 21:07, Dec 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Around 10,000 Bonobos are found only in the humid forests south of the Zaire River, in the Democratic Republic of Congo of central Africa. They are an endangered species, due to both habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat, the latter activity having waxed dramatically during the current civil war due to the presence of heavily armed militias even in remote "protected" areas such as Salonga National Park. Today, at most several thousand Bonobos remain. This is part of a more general trend of ape extinction.</i></p>

<p>What's the deal?</p>
<p>- The statement, "Recent DNA evidence suggests the Bonobo and Common Chimpanzee species separated from each other less than one million years ago." is not in concurrence with other sources which state that DNA evidence indicates that common chimpanzees separated from our family tree somewhere around 5 mya, while bonobos went their separate way about half a million years after that. - - That timeline and order of descent places bonobos as having derived from common chimps several million years <b>after</b> said common chimps separated from our last common ancestor, and thus makes common chimps our closest living relative. Whereas other sources place the bonobo as being our closest living relative over common chimps by about half a million years. - - This is an important distinction. Because, if bonobos are the closest thing to our last common ancestor, the fact that they are more upright and bipedal than common chimps makes perfect sense and may explain a lot about the origins of bipedalism. But, if bonobos are merely a relatively recent branch from the common chimp line, you then have to explain why they, for some unknown reason(s) became more upright and bipedal than common chimps. And, more important, you also have to explain how our ancestors might have become more upright and bipedal, if in fact that last common ancestor was a qradupedal, knuckle-walking, common chimp-like ape...</p>
<p>- To date, there is a paucity of DNA studies that might clarify this distinction. The reason for the current confusion is that, depending on which source you read, and which genes were studied, and what type of DNA was studied, and the fact that our ancestors survived at least one "genetic bottleneck", whereas chimps and bonobos possess a much greater variety in their genetic codes, you can conclude that bonobos are much more closely related to common chimps than to us, or even that, in some ways, they are more closely related to us.</p>
<p>- Common sense should tell us that bonobos are, in fact, more closely related to common chimps. But, even if they are <b>very</b> closely related to common chimps, that does not mean that they must have separated as recently as only a million years ago. According to the punctuated equilibrium evolutionary model, just because two species exhibit only small differences, that does not mean that they must have separated only recently. Because if there was little opportunity or <b>need</b> for change over a long period of time, very little change would have been selected for. In other words, unlike our ancestors, who underwent enormous change, if chimps and bonobos were already well-adapted for their lifestyles, then, like crocodiles, there would have been no need for them to adapt and become something else.</p>
<p>- In order to determine the timeline of speciation, you must have some sort of "genetic clock". And we in fact have such a clock in the form of mitochondrial DNA. Because mitochondrial DNA changes only slowly over time due to the more or less constant rate of mutation. Thus, unlike merely looking at the overall amount of genetic variation to try to interpolate when two species might have separated, mitochondrial DNA can tell you when that separation must have taken place regardless of the overall degree of variation.</p>
<p>- And, if you read the various sources carefully, at least one states that the evidence so far would seem to indicate that bonobos are, indeed, our closest relative over common chimps by about a half million years. And, if you look at bonobo physiology vs. common chimp physiology vs. proto-human physiology, common sense will tell you that the bonobo must be very close to what that last common ancestor - the forerunner to Au. afarensis, must have been like. Because, if that last progression of common ancestor was an upright, semi-bipedal ape very much like a bonobo, you can easily explain why our ancestors might have become fully bipedal. But if that last common ancestor was a quadrupedal common chimp-like ape, you then have to not only explain why we became bipedal, you also have to explain why bonobos become more bipedal than common chimps. And none of those theories about having to see over tall grass, or needing to carry tools, or carry babies explains in the least why bonobos might have become more bipedal.</p>

<dd>You misunderstand the science. There are many different ways of viewing and interpretting the data, but the one you are proposing. The line that became <i>Pan</i> split off about 5 million years ago, with that line splitting into two species about a half million years after that. Neither of those two lines gave rise to humanity - only the line that <i>Pan</i> split off from did. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 19:54, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that. I don't claim to understand the science, but I did not say that either of the Pan lines gave rise to humanity. And, it may be 'splitting hairs'. But, <b>IF</b> the mitochondrial DNA evidence indicates for instance that, we share a common ancestor with bonobos about 4.5 mya, and we share a common link with common chimps around 5 mya, then that means that proto-chimps separated from common ancestor 'A1' about 5mya, then proto-bonobos and proto-humans separated from ancestor 'A2' about 4.5 mya. It does not mean that proto-chimp separated from proto-human, then proto-bonobo separated from chimps sometime after that...

The mitochondrial clock is a rough estimate. Perhaps the Bonobo was under less genetic pressure to change, and so their clock was slowed down, in comparison to the Common Chimpanzee's mitochondrial clock. This would give a difference in the relative times when compared to our own DNA. But there is no doubt that the two <i>Pan</i> species are more closely related to each other than either is the <i>H. sapiens</i>. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 05:23, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok. I have just checked some sources. One gives bonobo &amp; C. chimp divergence as around 2.3-2.5 mya. Another gives apx .9 mya. I recently read something that put human &amp; C. chimp divergence at apx 5 mya, and bonobo divergence around half a million years after that, but I cannot find any such source now.

<p>This should be easy to clarify and / or correct. The name of the Bonobo mentions a town on the Congo. Later, the Bonobos are said to be separated by the "great rivers" from the Chimpanzees, and then in population, they are said to reside on the Zaire river. So, is the Congo river adjacent to an existing or future population of Bonobo's, if the great rivers is supposed to a defined term, define it here or reference another article.</p>
<p>Is the population named the only population in the wild. Is there any captive or preserved population of any significant size any where in the world?</p>

<p>Please remove the line "Moreover, while chimpanzees and H. sapiens obviously evolved from the same DNA, they are distinct." This line makes no sense, and does not logically follow the discussion on chromosomes. All life on earth appears to have evolved by common descent, not just chimps and humans (we can debate viruses elsewhere).</p>
<p>Also, the statement about chromosomes did not connect well with taxonomy. I would suggest a more formal "genetic variation" section.</p>
<p>The statements, "The Bonobo remains a slightly closer relative. Bonobo DNA has preserved more in common with Human DNA, whereas that of the Common Chimpanzee has drifted slightly further away" are misguided. Bonobo's are not a closer relative. This is a misconception frequently stated by some primatologists and anthropologists, but is clarified by phylogenetics. Chimps and Bonobos have a common ancestor with eachother long before they have a common ancestor with humans. Thus, neither the bonobo nor the chimp can be a "closer relative" to humans. In phylogenetics, one might observe a shorter branch length (genetic distance) between humans and bonobos than humans and chimps. This may indicated that humans and bonobos have retained greater homology. But for these species, this shorter genetic distance is not robust; it is highly dependant on the genetic loci examined and methods used, and no analyses has yet to determine whether there is greater homology, and more importantly, whether that homology is significant. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Anthdna (<a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAnthdna_46de.html" title="User talk:Anthdna">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anthdna_07eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anthdna">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Thanks for replying. I read the reference you gave, and I understand the rationale. It still irritates my sensibilities, but that's my own problem. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleta_51a2.html" title="User:Aleta">Aleta</a> 18:29, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The genetic closeness of Bonobos, their relative rarity, and their self-awareness compel a moral and scientific imperative to preserve them and protect them from both abuse and extinction.</p>

<p>Please elaborate on how *anything* compels a moral imperative to do anything! A sentence like the above does not belong in an encyclopedia, and in fact the entire paragraph to which it belongs is very far from having a neutral point of view.

<p>I don't know if anyone has noticed, especially since probably very few people know about bonobos or care enough to study them, but there are several lines describing the writer's sexucal orientation. Which of course would only need mention if the writer was gay. Some lines describing what the writer likes to do to express this gayness. It's kind of funny, but it's probably a prank that needs fixing.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_143.69.65.54_5f20.html" title="Special:Contributions/143.69.65.54">143.69.65.54</a> (talk)</small></p>

<p>The second paragraph of this article states that Bonobos are <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matriarchal.html" title="Matriarchal">matriarchal</a> and <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarian.html" title="Egalitarian">egalitarian</a>. Since matriarchies are ruled by the females (or at least the older females) and egalitarianism is equality, I'm curious if anyone can explain how they can be both. - <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComradeAF_9778.html" title="User:ComradeAF">ComradeAF</a> 07:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think in this case, ComradeAF, matriarchal is being used to describe the societal structure, not a state of "rulership" or, perhaps more to the point, oppression. People like to consider many human societies egalitarian--and in some ways they are----but the many are simultaneously <i>patriarchal</i>--men are traditionally considered the heads of households, the family name of children is that of the father, etc. However, suggest to someone in the U.S. (for example) that these traditional "values" mean our society isn't "egalitarian"--well, okay, the education system being what it is, they probably wouldn't know what the hell you were even saying. But that's beside the point&#160;;) Wysdom 22:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Both species are chimpanzees, and the term "chimpanzee" can be used both to refer <b>only</b> to the larger of the two species,</i> Pan troglodytes<i>, <b>and</b> to both species together.</i></p>
<p>I believe the meaning is the same in both cases, but the first version shown here (either/or) is a bit clearer/more correct, grammatically. When one reads the word "only" it signals an absolute--there should, logically, be no 'and' following an 'only'. Wysdom 20:51, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
