<p>The article seems unsure of this; one section says that aluminum foil is toxic when used as a bowl and should not be used, another section says that the vaporization temperature of aluminum is above that of a bic lighter flame, hence it is not toxic.</p>
<p>I think a definitive answer on this is important. Is foil, or an aluminum can safe, or is it not?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I highly recommend not to use foil. It tastes gross. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverendG_f606.html" title="User:ReverendG">ReverendG</a> 20:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One can observe the reaction when a piece of aluminum foil is placed under the lighter's or match's flame. It does catch fire, and I'm pretty certain there is very good reason to believe that this releases REMARKABLY harmful chemicals, such as poisonous oxides. In my opinion, this should certainly be noted in the article. -Anonymous <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.233.243.229_28d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.233.243.229">130.233.243.229</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/0/User_talk%7E130.233.243.229.html" title="User talk:130.233.243.229">talk</a>) 02:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>i would just like to point out that it is possible to make a type of bong/pipe called a steamroller (ive heard it lovingly named a bamboozie before) out of bamboo by taking a length of bamboo, making it a hollow cylinder, and placing a bowl in the side of one end. you simple place your mouth over the end farthest from the bowl and your hand over the other, you light the bowl, draw smoke into the bamboo cylinder, and then remove your hand from the end and inhale. Exactly like a shotgun, but for one person. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMad_Gouki_d711.html" title="User:Mad Gouki">Mad Gouki</a> 06:46, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Surely this is a form of pipe, not a bong. Bongs are water filtered.</p>

<p>I've been dealing a with the terms Bong, water pipe and Hookah in recent edits, but I can't really understand what the difference is. Are bongs and hookah's both waterpipes, if so, what are the differences? Please can someone try to clear this up for me (and please do so in the lead intro of each article!) <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 21:30, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Their mechanism is slightly different, although they are both water pipes. I'm sure there's a diagram somewhere showing, idk though. In a hookah, the bowl is at the top and the smoke travels down an inner pipe, bubbles out of the water into the chamber, and then out of the chamber through a hose into the user's mouth. In a bong, the bowl is near the bottom so that it is close to the water, and the smoke doesn't have to travel though a long pipe to get to it. It bubbles directly into the chamber, which is often directly connected to where the user places their mouth. Also the bowls are typically different shapes, and a bong has a carb, and a hookah either doesn't, or it isn't intended to be covered. Also a hookah can have more than one hose, although it doesn't have to. (Don't take my word 100% though, this is just what I've gathered from the articles and my experience.) --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 04:38, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>never heard of a solar bong, however, solar hits can be taken by replacing a lighter or traditional heat source with a sizeable magnifying glass and the sun. this is rarely done outside of california</p>

<p>I'm the original writer of the principles and motivations sections some years ago (especially proud that my principles section got illustrated) and I think I know how to improve this article's structure greatly. Some of the restructuring's drastic, which is why I'm explaining it in advance. It is not my stated intention to remove anything at this point, but I do intend to isolate a number of things that aren't actually bong-related in a section that will ultimately be splintered into a new article (named "Other drug smoking methodologies" or whatever). Below is my proposal, with my signature interspersed to facilitate chaotic expansion.<a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENamfFohyr_4f40.html" title="User:NamfFohyr">rmbh</a> 02:21, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The introduction needs a lot of work. I think it's POV to call this drug paraphernalia, but not hookahs or cigarettes or tea kettles. Am I wrong, people? The legality of cannibus is clearly a peripheral issue.

<p>The overall structure should be changed so that 1.1, parts of 2,2.1,3,4.1, are grouped into a major section (2') named Description of bong technologies.

<p>Someone keeps changing <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bong.html" title="Bong">Bong</a> to indicate that bongs are used primarily to smoke <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>. It seems to me that while it might be possible to smoke tobacco in a bong, and this is a reason one might give for owning a bong, it is far more common for bongs to be used in the process of smoking <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis.html" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a>.

<dd>The user who keeps changing it claims that shops that sell bongs must claim that they are tobacco. I can imagine this being true, but unless he/she finds a verifiable source, then we can't include that information because of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. In any case, we already have sources that refer to bongs being primarily used for cannabis, so there is no basis for changing that at all. I would be ok, with "A bong is used for smoking cannabis or ..list of other things.., but they must be sold as if they will be used for tobacco according to the laws in many jurisdictions (cite source)." Or something. We should discuss it further here before adding that though. --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 03:49, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The apparatus used in Morocco is more accurately described as a <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hookah.html" title="Hookah">Hookah</a>; this article is clearly about a device that is most commonly used to smoke Cannabis. I don't think it's necessary to provide citations for what a bong is used for; it's common knowledge.

<p>Seriously. The US Government is not an authority on bongs. In any way, shape, or form. Tobacco can be used in a bong... but so can parsley and sage.

<p>|Regarding the above mention of the steamroller: yes, it's quite legitimate, though it usually gave me some pretty intense headaches, for whatever reason; in absence of a some kind of coolant, however, it is a pipe, not a bong.</p>
<p>Regarding ice: IMHO, this facet receives insufficient attention, particularly since HS level physics alone reveals many advantages (and a few potential drawbacks for the unwary. ) In short, ices latent heat requires 80 calories/gram to overcome; this will NOT change temperature, merely create 0° C water. Another 80 calories will raise that gram of 0° water to 80°, or roughly 177° F. That's more than it takes to raise room temperature water to boiling temperature (though waters latent heat must be overcome before steam is produced.)</p>
<p>One advantages is immediately obvious, and arguably greater with ice in the BASE instead of/in addition to the CHAMBER. In addition, in a base with even a little ice water temperature CANNOT rise until ALL ice is melted. Simple experimentation will quickly confirm what I verified by experience: ice water stays very cold as long as even a little ice remains; once the last ice melts, the water is at or above room temperature in just a few hits. A similar effect is familiar to those familiar with heavy snow fall: temperatures won't fall much below freezing until the first snow sticks, but once lasting snow arrives it will be at or below freezing until it's all gone.</p>
<p>Another (comparatively rare) physical property of water is a potential trouble spot, particularly with LOTS of ice in the base (hence that isn't normally done:) water takes more space just before freezing than just after, (if you place a full glass of water in the freezer it will crack when it freezes. ) For the bong, this means if the water level is at or near the bowl (running the risk of soaking the cannabis/tobacco) melting ice WILL soak the cannabis/tobacco. So if you put ice in the base, don't overfill, leave a little room for the ice to expand as it melts. Ice in the chamber as well requires special care, since it will run down to the base when melted. Often one can simply tip the bong the after some ice melts, letting the excess water out the carb, or with a slide remove the bowl and pour it out the stem.</p>
<p>Last but not least is another benefit--IF you're not greedy. Otherwise, it's a deteriment: gas volume and/or pressure rise as temperature, per the Ideal Gas Law. An icy base is near 0°; body temperature is 27°: hits expand as the lungs warm them, literally pressing the smoke into the lungs, a potential benefit for concentration/speed. However, much as with the base, YOU CAN'T OVERFILL! Overfilling the base is annoying, but wee-er, cannabis/tobacco will dry; overfilling your lungs with low temperature gas is dangerous, because if volume can't increase, pressure MUST!</p>
<p>Good news: You can take smaller hits that are force fed into your lungs at (initially) near freezing (technically, they're NOT smaller hits, they just take up less space and get gravity bonged.)</p>
<p>Bad news: If you're greedy and try to monster hit you'll cough it up in a matter of seconds, and possibly burst a blood vessel if you try to hold it (you CAN'T;) continuing the gravity bong analogy, it's like if you had a trash can gravity bong and tried to shove it into your lungs: it's not gonna work, and trying could hurt.</p>
<p>The bottom line is if you're not greedy ice, preferably in the base, makes the experience more efficient in both resources and intensity; I won't smoke without ice in the base.</p>
<p>Regarding alcohol: while there is risk of some chemical bonding, THC and nicotine are both covalently bonded, like ethanol; they won't bond with the alcohol, but they WILL dissolve in it (but not water. ) On the other hand, ethanol is a gas at room temperature, meaning it can be inhaled WITH the THC or nicotine, and as with most drugs will produce a "multiplier effect." However, as already noted in the article, ethanol IS flammable, and it IS a gas at room temperature; just as there will be alcohol vapor in the chamber there will be in the stem, and if it reaches the flash point nasty things can happen. Ice, placed in the base (to cool the ethanol rather than the smoke alone) is probably a good idea here. Bad news: you'll get less of the ethanol vapors in the hits; good news: the bong's much less likely to ignite and/or explode.</p>
<p>I think that covers it; the best part is it can be verified in any HS chem lab.|</p>
