<p>I'm very skeptical that a bong is used to smoke "usually tobacco (and less frequently Cannabis or other substances)."</p>
<p>I don't doubt that somewhere, in some parts of the world, people frequently smoke some types of tobacco out of bongs, but to me it's quite clear that their primary purpose is marijuana smoke. My local head shop puts plastic flowers in them and calls them "german acrylic vases"</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Don't smoke tobacco bongs. cigarette tobacco through a bong is just a painful and very harsh hit which puts you out and makes you feel fairly sick for 5 minutes.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well the bong is closely related to the Arabic <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hookah.html" title="Hookah">Hookah</a> pipe, which is strictly for the smoking of flavoured tobacco, that could be where the confusion comes from. The bong, however, is clearly a distinct object with a distinct cultural heritage and is mostly used to smoke cannabis. Having said that, I'm very surprised that neither article mentiones the other device, as they are both common facilitators of water filtered smoke inhalation.</dd>

<p>Here's a question for the ages. Is a gravity bong really a bong if the smoke is never filtered through water? Go ahead and marinate on that for a little while. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 04:42 Dec 5, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good point. I once saw a guy make a gravity bong out of one of those 5-gallon (or whatever) water jugs that you put on top of a water cooler... It was a sight to see. Needless to say, he wasn't that bright. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> 00:14 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe, to avoid the issue of if a gravity bong is still a bong, this article should be moved to <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bong.html" title="Bong">bong</a> -- it's the most commonly used term in the US, anyway.

<p>"A water pipe or bong is a device used for smoking cannabis,"</p>
<p>Cannabis is a genus (and so should be capitalized). The equivalent would be to say Philip Morris makes Nicotiana cigarettes. How about we just saw marijuana, or is there some political/advocacy reason for this euphemism? <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">orthogonal</a> 09:50, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are three species of <i>cannabis</i> that I'm aware of: <i>sativa</i>, <i>indica</i>, and <i>ruderalis</i>. While the last is known as hemp and is seldom, if ever, smoked; the former two are smoked and as such it can't be referred to as one species. Marijuana does generically mean one or both species, but the word has non-NPOV connotations as far as a lot of people are concerned. Calling the plant by its genus is an elegant solution to the neutrality issue. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_gies_c3f8.html" title="User:Matt gies">Matt gies</a> 10:42, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Throughout most of the world, <i>cannabis</i> (lower-case c) is the common name that also happens to be identical to the scientific name for the genus. We should no more capitalize the <i>c</i> in <i>cannabis</i> than the <i>p</i> in <i>primates</i> just because it is also the Latin name for an order of mammals. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 17:54, Feb 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

And genus names, according to <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binomial_nomenclature.html" title="Binomial nomenclature">biological usage</a> are <i>always</i> capitalized. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">orthogonal</a> 18:31, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Marijuana was a word adopted by the US the early twentieth century from Spannish American/Native American roots. It was a deliberate tactic by media moguls, in a country split by race, to add add to the mystique and fear of the substance in society. There is therefore, intrinisically, slightly racist overtones in widely applying the term marijuana, as well as it being POV. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDainamo_f808.html" title="User:Dainamo">Dainamo</a> 10:20, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This may be a nitpick.. but I don't consider the glass pipe in the picture to be a "bong". I've always heard such pieces referred to either as simply a "pipe" or a "bubbler", if it uses water filtration, which this particular piece may or may not. Maybe I'm just looking at it wrong, though, it does look kind of weird&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmiddy_e427.html" title="User:Schmiddy">Schmiddy</a> 07:22, Jul 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This piece does use water filtration; the maker has called this kind of pipe a bubbler as well as a bong (he's my roommate). I think "bubbler" is just a colloquial name for a bong (although maybe it's only used for some kinds of bong?)</dd>
<dd>You're right, though, that you can't really see what's going on inside - I haven't got a picture of any of the mostly-clear ones he's made. In any case, inside the can (the big part on the bottom) there's a downstem from the bowl designed to reach under water and allow the smoke to bubble through. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 05:28, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Around my way, a bubbler is a kind of bong. It is smaller and generally shaped like a pipe, but uses water like an upright bong. The picture does not appear to be of a bubbler by this definition, since it stands upright. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 20:06, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think it is a bong. After all the principles involved are exactly the same ones described here. I updated the caption on the image to reflect this fact and I think it really helps bring it to light. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 05:57, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey triddle, you look to be running this page, so can you (or anyone else) explain. In <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, we don't use the word <b>Bowl</b>. I'm guessing it is the equvalent to a <b>Conepiece</b>, the part where the weed is packed and ignited and sits at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>I wanted to add this to your <a href="../../../b/o/n/Talk%7EBong_5d3c.html#Terminology" title="Talk:Bong">Talk:Bong#Terminology</a> section, but maybe it should be labelled Bowl/Conepiece:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Conepiece</b>
<ul>
<li>A usually removable metal piece of the bong where the chopped Marijuana is placed and ignited. Varying amounts are placed or 'packed in' the conepiece, which sits at the top of the stem. Over time it collects a (soft) resin on the bottom, and encrusted resin within the conepiece</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you put the picture of the labelled red bong back onto the main page, it could be referenced as part (4).</p>

<dd>Hi Ballchef, I had no idea terms could be so diverse. I've got a good idea of what you are referring to (nice description btw).

<p>Sorry about that, a bowl is indeed the part where the material is placed for smoking. We have many styles of bowls here and some of them could easily be described as a conepiece but not all of them are. We also have some bowls that are more similar to a blown glass pipe than a metal or glass piece manipulated into a cone shape. <a href="http://image.www.rakuten.co.jp/syounan/img10241192295.jpeg" class="external text" title="http://image.www.rakuten.co.jp/syounan/img10241192295.jpeg" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a good example. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 05:21, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

A RED Bong</div>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dd>1. A <b>Mouthpiece</b>, where the user's mouth is placed over, sealing out air through that hole. Thus the Bong is "Airtight" (Providing there is also an airtight seal around the stem. If a "carb" is present, it must also be covered). When "airtight" it has but one small source of air, which comes into effect when the user inhales through the mouth piece.
<dl>
<dd>If all the smoke isn't removed from the bong in a single hit, the user can place their mouth again over the bong to again inhale, or hover their mouth closely over the bong to slowly inhale the smoke
<dl>
<dd><i>Editing Note: Do you use any of these terms in the USA? Instead of carb I would rather write "Shottie" which is the only term we use for the hole covered by a finger. And we say "hose" instead of "stem", mainly because we often use a few inches of the backyard hose. A perfect fit, but get easily filled with resin.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Shottie is not unknown to me but the term is rarely used in conversation. Is shottie also used to refer to a pull-out style system (where a part is removed to clear the chamber instead of a finger over a hole)? <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 05:15, August 18, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, <b>carb</b> it is. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallchef_4000.html" title="User:Ballchef">Ballchef</a> 07:31, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. A <b>Chamber</b>, where smoke collects upon inhilation, after being "filtered" through the water. When enough smoke has been built up or the user has finished burning the cone, the chamber then releases the smoke through the mouth piece. This is accelerated by using a "Carb" which allows smoke to be emptied much faster from the chamber when uncovered. The height (and width) of the chamber can vary, from a few inches to some of ridiculous length. See World's Longest Bong</dd>
<dd>3. A <b>Base</b>, which holds the water, is usually wider than the chamber so it can stand-alone without tipping (see the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bong.html#Bong_Water" title="Bong">consequences</a> of a spillage.) The bottom of the "stem" sits in the water, on an angle as shown. The opening at the bottom of the stem must be underwater to bubble the water. The water temperature will affect the temperature of the smoke inhaled (e.g. a bong with water and crushed ice as a filter will allow the user to inhale cooler smoke, providing a less harsh experience). Some bongs also have a removable, water-tight base, for easy changing of the bong water.
<dl>
<dd>I think it may be better to make a note in this article about how some bongs are constructed to hold ice rather than create an entirely separate article. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 22:10,</dd>

<dd>4. A <b>Stem</b> sits in the base and pokes out of the chamber at a degree higher than the water level. It holds the Conepiece/Bowl and enables smoke to pass through the water when in use. The stem collects "resin" over time which can clog the stem, and reduce the air flow through the water.</dd>
<dd>5. A <b>Bowl</b> (aka. Conepiece) is basically a (usually) removable bowl or cone shaped container, where the cannabis is packed and ignited. Made of metal or glass, a bowl can be joined to the stem, or can just sit in the stem. The bowl forms a seal around the stem so that the only inlet of air is through the bowl. Over time, it collects a soft, wet resin on the bottom, and encrusted resin within the bowl.
<dl>
<dd>I checked out <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoking_pipe.html" title="Smoking pipe">smoking pipe</a> and they call the spot that the material is placed a <i>bowl</i> there; would that be considered a bowl as well in Oz (am I allowed to call it that if I'm an American? =)? If so, I think some consistency is in order. It seems to me that the term <b>bowl</b> is more easily understood than conepiece.

<p>A <b>Carb</b> allows for an accelerated withdrawl of smoke from the chamber. It can be either a hole in the chamber(covered by a finger or removable seal), or the hole revealed when a removable bowl is taken out of the stem. When smoke is inhaled through the mouthpiece and the carb is uncovered, air enters through the carb and pushes the present smoke out through the mouthpiece.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would consider the carb to be more of an action part than a specific part of the bong. For instance a hole in the bong a finger is placed over or a removable bowl/conepiece both act as the carb. In fact, could you have a bong with out a carb? It seems to me that with out the quick clearing action one has something closer to a <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hookah.html" title="Hookah">hookah</a> than a bong. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 22:10, August 18, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The removable bowls all include a part which provide distance from the location the combustion takes place in; there are a couple ways this takes place. On the larger and more ornate glass bowls there are usually large bumps. The bowl itself is large enough that the outside edges don't get so hot that you can't hold it. On smaller glass bowls (the style I would easily call a conepiece) there is a thin handle attached at the very top. Most metal conepieces include a piece of medium gauge wire wrapped around the stem to provide the handle. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 19:18, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is on the right track but I don't think its a good idea to introduce too much <i>slang</i> (for lack of a better word) when trying to describe the components. The term <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stem.html" title="Stem">stem</a> is actually quite appropriate as a technical term, for instance. The fact that slang exists should be described but to attempt to describe the parts in slang only will lead to more problems in the future. I think the solution is to use the technical terms for the parts and have another section (or article) that deals specifically with the slang component.

<dd>You are correct that fruit rots; I don't recall the article saying its a good idea to leave an apple on your desk for a month. Regardless, it works, even if it is not permanent, and to call it stupid is pretty short sided. Have you never had an occasion where you needed a pipe and didn't have one? When you are done, you throw the apple away. Feel free to make your pipe out of permanent materials but good luck doing it in a pinch, for 40 some cents, from a grocery store, but please don't refer to something as stupid because you do not understand it. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 04:50, August 19, 2005 (UTC)

<p>The venerable apple pipe isn't really a bong. Bongs have a water filtration stage. To make an apple pipe, carve out a ~10mm bowl on one side of the apple and punch a hole through from the other side with a gutted plastic ball-point pen barrel. A cone is formed out of aluminum foil, formed over the tip of the thumb. Perforate the base of the cone with a straight pin and fit into the carved bowl.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend eating an apple that has been used as a pipe. I'd sooner drink bongwater. bongoloid 07:18, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct. The recent edits to the page are extremely unfortunate; an anonymous editor has been changing all cannabis references to tobacco. Wikipedia is not a resource to propagate <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionist.html" title="Revisionist">revisionist</a> history and I have rolled back the article to a known good point in time to clean up the excess of cannabis to tobacco conversions. It looks like an edit war also took place.

<p>because it is simply not true. If one uses a blow tube stuffed with dryer sheets it causes the area to smell like the inside of a dryer for quite a while and this smell is pretty strong. It is also possible to still see the smoke for some time.

<p>Does anyone else find the Gravity bongs subsection to be in violation of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NPOV" class="extiw" title="wiki:NPOV">Wiki:NPOV</a>? It seems overly critical and offers a personal opinion of the efficacy of gravity bongs.

<dd><i>This offers the same benefit of delivering a concentrated charge of smoke to the user but are much more effective at making the smoke denser, hence, more chemicals can be absorbed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe the verbiage refers specifically to the efficacy of making denser smoke. The smoke in a gravity bong is thick, yellow, and extremely dense. I'm not sure it would be possible to achieve this level of smoke density in a standard bong. This would require the operator to use their diaphragm to maintain a constant and slow draw. Who can hold their breath that long and who has such fine motor control over their diaphragm? Perhaps <i>effective</i> is not the right term, but I believe that undoubtedly the reason that gravity bongs exist is because they can generate this coughing-fit-inducing dense smoke cloud. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 02:50, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added a bit about smoke resins being highly soluble in ethanol. There remains a comment about use of epsom salts (MgSO4) for cleaning. MgSO4 is not a good solvent for smoke resins (or anything else). The reference should be deleted, but I thought I'd discuss it here first before cutting it. bongoloid 07:30, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No one complained, so I've removed the references to Epsom salts and also to rubbing alcohol. Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) is not a good solvent. Rubbing alcohol is isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) normally sold in a roughly 75% alcohol aqueous solution. Isopropanol is not as good a solvent as ethanol. The ~25% water content of rubbing alcohol makes it much less effective at dissolving smoke resins. bongoloid 06:42, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "Coke Can bong" is <b>not</b> a bong, but rather a <b>pipe</b>. Therefore I request it be removed from the article and/or placed in the Smoking Pipe article.</p>
<p>Agreed. In an improvised Coke (or beer) can pipe, the smoke is not drawn through water for filtration. The water filtration is a defining characteristic of a bong or hookah. bongoloid 06:53, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
