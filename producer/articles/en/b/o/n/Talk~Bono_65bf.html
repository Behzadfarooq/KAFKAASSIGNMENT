<dd>It shouldn't be after his name. Bono has got numerous awards and honours, none of which are placed after his name. Why do <i>some</i> British people believe that their particular honours merit being placed immediately after the guy's name?

<dd>The formal "post-nominals" of the British honours system are recognised by most governments (see below). There is even an "order of post-nominals" which is recognised globally in diplomatic circles and, yes, includes certain awards from other states.

<p>Well, it's because KBE, and any other form of British knighting or peerage, can actually be considered part of one's title. He can be thusly addressed "Sir." It's like earning a PhD grants one the title of "Doctor." Might not seem right. But that's how it works...<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.192.10.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.192.10.247_f482.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.192.10.247">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Key word there is "can" only if you are making it up as you go along. And it has nothing to do with "parochialism". There are strict rules that govern the British honours system which are recognised by most governments - including the Irish Republic. "KBE" is a formal state award and a proper, diplomatically- and internationally-recognised "post-nominal" and so (formally at least) should appear after one's name/title. I don't believe awards such as a Grammy are considered post-nominals and formal state awards...... (Interestingly, and as a related side note, if one has a knighthood one is banned from using nicknames with the title: for instance it is "Jimmy Goldsmith" or "Sir James Goldsmith" but categorically <b>not</b> "Sir Jimmy Goldsmith".) <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.17.247.135.html" title="User:86.17.247.135">86.17.247.135</a> 02:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the KBE does go after his name, but since it is an honarary knighthood as he is not a british citizen he is not called Sir Paul Hewson, he is to be identified as Paul David Hewson, KBE. there is no other award which becomes part of the title. however if you wanted you could say he is a grammy and MTV award ect. winning musician. <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZepher25_3f48.html" title="User:Zepher25">Zepher25</a> 15:27, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<i>"In 2006 Bono was named in the annual honours list as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire."</i></p>
<p>In fact he was named in the 2007 <i>New Years</i> Honours List. The list is semi-annual - there is also a Birthday Honours List, the birthday being Her Majesty's, of course (a third in the event of a Prime Minister resigning or being voted out of office; a fourth after a big military campaign!): please correct the article accordingly. <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.17.247.135.html" title="User:86.17.247.135">86.17.247.135</a> 01:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The original statement is partly true. The public <i>announcement</i> was indeed made in December 2006, two weeks before the general announcement of the New Years Day Honours, but I understand the date of effect of the award was still 1 January 2007. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 05:14, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Understood, but the dispute was not about the year named, but really the name of the list. There is no "annual" honours list, Bono was named in the <i>New Years</i> list. It would of course be a bit verbose to say <i>"In 2006 he was named in the 2007...."</i>.

<p>On the whole honour thing - he can't be addressed as "Sir" as he isn't afaik a British Citizen. That's why he has KBE after his name. It is an honourary award. Bob Geldof shouldn't referred to as "Sir Bob" for the same reason. Ronald Reagan was never "Sir Ronnie" even though he got an honourary knighthood some time ago.

<ul>
<li>Your point about the use of "Sir" has already been pointed out and accepted for some time. And your claim that because he is an honorary recipient he has the post nominals KBE after his name <i>instead</i> of the prefix "Sir" is incorrect. Any award of this type - honorary or not - carries the post nominals, whether "Sir" can be used or not. It's just that those who use "Sir" often leave out the post nominals incorrectly. For instance, if Bono was British he would formally be called "Sir Paul Hewson, KBE". -- <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelsource_37c7.html" title="User:Delsource">Delsource</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelsource_81b4.html" title="User talk:Delsource">(talk)</a></small> 15:06, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am amazed that my putting three simple letters at the end of the name has caused so much debate and controversy! Just to make sure everyone understands, as they probably do, a non-British citizen awarded the honour of Knight Commander of the British Empire is not entitled to use the title "Sir", but still uses the pot nominal letters.

<p>There is always room for improvement in any article. The Bono article will benefit from some tighter, more precise wording that is less fanzine and more encyclopedic.</p>
<p>1) He is almost universally known as Bono. It's not just an alternate name.</p>
<p>2) It is not just a nickname. It was originally - and the section on that makes that clear. But it has become a professional <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_name.html" title="Stage name">stage name</a>. Which is different to a nickname.</p>
<p>3) His role as principal lyricist is far more significant than his role as an occasional guitarist/harmonica player - info that is mentioned later in the article.</p>
<p>4) He is known for a lot of humanitarian work - including his support for Amnesty International. So the reference should indicate there are more areas than just the two mentioned.</p>
<p>5) His work for Africa is NOT just IN Africa - but campaigning worldwide for the benefit OF Africa. An important distinction.</p>
<p>6) The text about his wife was ungrammatical (who/whom) and clumsy. "Dated since 1975" - First dated in 1975. And perhaps we can find a less fanzine word than "dated" - an American term which is certainly not the terminology that Bono and Ali would have used 1975-1982 to describe their pre-marriage relationship.</p>

<dd>Hi Davidpatrick! Thanks for all your edits here and getting this article better.</dd>

<dd>1&amp;2) I think the problem that others &amp; I were having is that the phrase "universally known by his stage name Bono" is really long and puts readers off right as they get into the article. Thanks for pointing out the difference between a nickname and stage name. I didn't know about that. Anyway, though, I think we are going to have to shorten that beginning sentence either way. Maybe we can mention he is universally known as Bono in the nickname section? How does this sound for the first sentence "Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), stage name Bono,[1] is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2."?</dd>

<dd>Maybe it should be added in a very clear fashion that his stage name has been Bono for X(?) years now, and NOT "Bono Vox". I, for one, am not sure when he "officially / publicly" changed it, but it HAS happened and it's part of his history as U2's frontman - and therefore important. I just wanted to know better, came here, and the info wasn't available.

<p>This section of the article really needs to be expanded. We've got a tag on the section and have it as a #1 priority on the to do list. It would be great if we could all contribute a little bit. I was thinking, as a start, if we could spend a few sentences per each 'album era' of U2 dealing with Bono. Then add in significant events such as his f*** the revolution speech, maybe other singers he collobrated with, things he says &amp; does at tours. Maybe as an introduction we can discuss how Bono has directed the band in different ways such as stages, lyrics, type of music they record, etc. Any other ideas? Let's get started! Don't feel a need to discuss before you post (but you are free to do so, of course). Just make sure its referenced, and then throw it in there in some organized fashion.

Hmm, ok, Bono's role in Live AId is notable as an individual act, as is the Fuck the Revolution. I guess all i am saying is try to pick and seperate the notable "bono" events and the "band" events. There will of course be some overlap. We don't need to discuss in detail the tracks and development of the Joshua Tree album for example, but Bono's trip to Nicaragua and its influence on the Joshua Tree should be mentioned, for example. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 01:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be some <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit wars</a> going on regarding the introduction of Bono. They seem to be a fight for something of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul David Hewson, KBE (born 10 May 1960), almost universally known by his stage name Bono, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2.</li>
<li>Paul David Hewson, KBE (born 10 May 1960), stage name Bono, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2.</li>
<li>Paul David Hewson, KBE (born 10 May 1960), nickname Bono, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2.</li>
<li>Paul David Hewson, KBE (born 10 May 1960), almost universally known as Bono, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>I propose we use "Paul David Hewson, KBE (born 10 May 1960), stage name Bono, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2."</b></p>
<p>Here is why:</p>
<ol>
<li>This introduction is <b>brief</b>.</li>
<li>The "almost universally known by his stage name Bono" is long, confusing, distracting and may dissuade readers from reading the rest of the article.</li>
<li>More information on who calls him that and what it is has been added to the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bono.html#Stage_name" title="Bono">stage name section</a>. We have a <i>whole section</i> dedicated to his name. Why not put this information there?</li>

<p>Possible <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">compromise</a>:</p>
<p>If no one likes my proposal (above) we could also add in another complete sentence regarding this almost universally known as thing. But instead of extending an already long introduction, we could generate a new sentence to follow after it with this information.</p>

<dd>well, the basic problem with that is it is not simply a stage name. From what I can tell, only his old man called him Paul. Even his wife calls him bono. "stage name" implies for artistic purposes and off the stage he uses his other name. In fact, I'd suggest putting "bono" first and then P Hewson. i agree that "almost" universally known is clumsy but it conveys the facts much better which i think is more important - but maybe there is another way. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 05:51, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like your idea of putting Bono first. That way we can avoid all this nonsense and simply say that Paul Hewson is his legal name. Something to the effect of <b>"Bono, (born 10 May 1960), legal name Paul David Hewson, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2."</b> The only issue to contend with then is how do we add in KBE because his legal name doesn't end in KBE. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 05:58, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is an unusual case, because despite his entitlement to be addressed as "Mr Paul Hewson KBE", there is virtually no circumstance in practice under which he would be so addressed. If he became a member of the Irish Parliament, or held some important public office such as UN Secretary-General, I suppose he would then be generally known as Paul Hewson rather than Bono, and then he'd be "Paul Hewson KBE" - but that hasn't happpened and may never happen. If he were a witness at a trial and asked to state his full name, it would be simply "Paul David Hewson". Maybe in the Honours section we could say that he is entitled to add the postnominal KBE to his legal name in some contexts, and leave it at that, ie. without specifying what those contexts might be. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 06:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I like Chupper's most recent suggestion (ie, <b>"Bono, (born 10 May 1960), legal name Paul David Hewson, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2."</b>, and Jack's suggestion about the KBE make sense to me too. I'd say go with that unless on the off chance someone comes up with a better brainwave. The only suggestion is to <b>maybe</b> say something like "original" (or "birth name") with or without "legal", but you've already suggested is a million times better. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 07:51, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ya, Merbabu keeps coming up with all the good ideas. I agree that "<i>legal</i>" may not be the best way to introduce his legal name. I looked all over Wikipedia for articles that have already done what we are trying to do. I found that the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wayne_22ff.html" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> article may set a good precedent here. So based upon everyone's ideas how does "<b>Bono, born 10 May 1960 as Paul David Hewson, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2.</b>" sound? Why don't we have a minivote here and see what everyone thinks. If this were the sentence to be used I also think we should expand the stage name section to include information on how this is his nickname, everyone calls him that, etc. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 17:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Being a traditionalist, I believe that an encyclopaedic entry or formal address must use one's real and full name and title. <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Who_%28UK%29_8749.html" title="Who's Who (UK)">Who's Who (UK)</a> lists him as Hewson, P.D.

In my opinion the opening paragraph must name him as <b>Paul David Hewson, <a href="../../../k/b/e/KBE_8e83.html" title="KBE">KBE</a></b> (he has accepted the award of KBE so has agreed to use the post-nominals in formal address) with an immediate mention of his chosen moniker.

<p>I have to rush out to a meeting - but I will post back with some thoughts on this later.

<p>The standard WP format is "<b>Legal Name</b> (born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>), known as <b>Nickname</b>, is...". As far as I can see, there's no reason why this should be different. (Obviously slightly different wording is possible, and perhaps here "known by his stage name as" rather than simply "known as" would be appropriate, but generally the legal name goes first in any event.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 21:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for pointing out the standard WP format. I couldn't find that. Anyway, there are a few reasons here "why this should be different." People argue that his stage name is more than a stage name. It is a nick name (since he was a kid), a stage name (as well all know uses it all the time in the band), and is known almost universally by it today. So how do we get all this information in there? Or how do we handle all that? That's part of the problem and that is why we need a resolution. Other editors here are expressing concern with using the word nickname while others are concerned that we are using the word stage name. I know I'm concerned because "almost universally known by his stage name" is becoming a really long introduction.</dd>
<dd>Basically the difference here is that it's three things, and it is not just a stage name. If his wife calls him Bono it's different then Prince making up a new stage name every week.

<p>Two things. I was in favor of the qualifier "almost universally" (which only adds 2 words) for the sake of strict accuracy. Thinking that there might be some family members who still call him "Paul". Much as <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sting.html" title="Sting">Sting</a>'s wife calls Sting "Gordon". But if people think that that is too pedantic or unnecessary (or that two words is just too much!) then - forgo that part.</p>
<p>But the other part "known by his <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_name.html" title="Stage name">stage name</a>" I think IS important. How he ACQUIRED the name - and the fact that it STARTED as a nickname is neither here nor there in the intro paragraph - and is ably dealt with in the article. But in an encyclopedia which has to serve people who might not have heard of him as well as those who do - where a name is not visibly remotely an adaptation of the original birth name (such as "James Paul McCartney - known as Paul McCartney) I think it IS incumbent to state that the "known by" is a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_name.html" title="Stage name">stage name</a>. I accept that it STARTED as a nickname. But since about 1979 it has been a professional stage name - which he uses in all parts of his daily life. But it is a stage name. Unless he changes his name by deed poll (which is what <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> have done - I think it is necessary to state that.</p>
<p>So I think it should read:</p>
<p><b>Paul David Hewson, KBE (born 10 May 1960), known by his <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_name.html" title="Stage name">stage name</a> Bono, is the lead singer...</b> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 14:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>hmmm - you allude to the fact that it is indeed more than simply a stage name, it's not that narrow. And the article is not just about Bono 'professionally' - it's what people know him as (professionally and personally) - including his wife. I'm not sure how a broader term, every day nickname becomes subservient to the narrower, professiona context 'stagename'. If we agree (as you seem to) that 'stagename' is too narrow a definition, why use it? Bono is not even a nickname, it's become, long ago, his name. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 14:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How ever his name and moniker are represented, I absolutely disagree with dropping 'KBE' from his full name.

<dd>But what is the alternative? Do we insist on two sources for every single person with a state award: one for acceptance of the award; a second for acknowledgement of the title or post-nominal? Individuals may choose not to use titles and post-nominals in every day or informal life (such on mail, bank documents, domestic bills etc) but that doesn't mean that they are not still formally a Knight (including honorary), or have a CBE, CMG etc. I think it would be correct for an enyclopaedia to give a formal name and title as recognised "at Court". -- <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelsource_37c7.html" title="User:Delsource">Delsource</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelsource_81b4.html" title="User talk:Delsource">(talk)</a></small> 15:17, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"At court" doesn't mean "the British". Anyway, Bono has accepted an award from the British Crown so please leave the tired old politics out of this matter. When I say "at court" clearly I mean in formal circles - including diplomatically and by sovereign governments, international institutions etc. Most countries recognise the state awards of others (including the British system by the Republic of Ireland). The likes of Who's Who and any traditional encyclopaedia will list honours and use them correctly.

<dd>OK guys. This is getting out of hand! It is getting hard to count the colons!!! I'm just joking&#160;:). This is actually a really important discussion/argument we are having here. Those just joining in here will notice we are discussing the use of "KBE" and how we should introduce's Bono's nick/stage almost universally known as name&#160;:). Personally I've never understood using "KBE" on Wikipedia to introduce someone, <b>but</b> for some reason, I always leave it in. My logic for doing so probably has something to do with how stupid I am when it comes to this stuff and the fact that others are smarter than me. Either way I won't really address this topic, but I will address the nick name, stage name, known as stuff. I feel like we should still change the sentence to <b>"Paul David Hewson, KBE (born 10 May 1960), known as Bono, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2."</b> I also feel <b>we should change the stage name section to "Stage and nickname"</b> and we should also elaborate on this information in the first sentence of that section. I guess I'm sticking with the "keep it simple stupid" ideaology here. I just feel like the intro or 0 section summarizes the rest of the article, and we can adequately do that by simply saying "known as Bono" in the introduction and elaborating on it in the appropriate section. It seems as if everyone is sticking semi-close to this idea... What do we think? Are we a go or is there more to discuss? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 21:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One more thing. <b>I do not support using the irish spelling of his name in the introductory sentence</b>. Bono speaks in English. He sings in English. I think I read somewhere he doesn't even really speak Irish. Even if he knew Irish I've never heard of him being addressed under that name. I'll be removing it. If someone disagrees on this point, let me know and we'll throw it into the things to discuss in this growing discussion. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 21:27, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi, I added the Irish version of Bono's name becasue here in Ireland Irish is constitutionally our first language and it is very common to address people in their Irish name, even if their name is in fact in the English language.

<dd>I think it comes under Wikipedia's rules about "Original Reasearch" - i.e. it's just something you made up. If someone was born in England and given an Irish name, you wouldn't make up an English version of their name for either the Irish or English wikipedia. Note that the Irish wikipedia's entry for Bono starts "Is é Paul David Hewson príomhamhránaí an bhanna ceoil raic, U2". Even on that Wikipedia, an entry for a translation of his name would be original research, which isn't allowed.</dd>

<p>Personally I still favor the reference to stage name in the first line - but I'll abide by consensus. Keep KBE. We are an encyclopedia. And he didn't decline the award. He announced that he was pleased to have been awarded. So he accepted it. However - one thing I'm stronger on is that the section about his informal name should be called just <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_name.html" title="Stage name">Stage name</a> not Stage and Nick Name. He is a professional entertainer/artist - who would never heard of were it not for his being an entertainer/artist. He GOT the stage name because it had been a nickname. But when it became his stage name - and then supplanted his given name in practically all circumstances - it went way beyond being a nickname. If he was still Paul a lot of the time - and sometimes people called him Bono - then "Bono" would be a nickname. But (like Sting, and like Elton John before he changed his name by deed poll) Bono has now become his virtual name. And the best description of that for an entertainer/artist is stage name. (We could call it his "showbiz name" if anyone prefers! &#160;;) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 00:06, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support Chupper's suggestion of changing the lead to <b>"Paul David Hewson, KBE (born 10 May 1960), known as Bono, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2."</b>. "Almost universally" sounds way too awkward, and the "stage name" reference isn't really needed (BTW, Bono got the nickname prior to his carreer in U2 - and, if I'm not mistaken, he's credited on <i><a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_%28album%29.html" title="Boy (album)">Boy</a></i> as "Paul 'Bono' Hewson"). We could change he section name, but I don't think it's necessary. The Irish name seems a little too much indeed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the KBE, I agree it should stay. A quick look at other articles on people with similiar titles (like <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_May_ae5a.html" title="Brian May">Brian May</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>) show that it's already common usage in Wikipedia. Besides, people's titles are usually included in the lead section (see <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>). --<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKristbg_52e5.html" title="User:Kristbg">Kristbg</a> 12:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks as if we may have all come to a decent compromise. Hopefully everyone is partially happy. I know this wasn't what I was originally looking for, but I feel it should work perfectly. It also appears that we should keep the KBE in. Whether or not it should be hyperlinked is another story. Also <b>Derry Boi proposed</b> putting in the irish version of his name. I know I did not support it, but we have yet to get other opinions. If we did put it in the sentence would read <b>"Paul David Hewson, KBE (Irish): Pól Mac Aodha) (born 10 May 1960), known as Bono, is the lead singer and principal lyricist of the Irish rock band U2."</b> What are our thoughts? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 21:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not Irish (I'm from the other side of the planet), but after a 22-year obsession with U2 I have never seen this. My understanding is this is simply a translation?

<dl>
<dd>Nor me. Without a reference showing that he actually uses this name in some contexts (which would be odd since he hardly ever even uses Paul Hewson), this would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> on our part (and particularly dopey OR at that). <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 09:07, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll go with the compromise. Don't put in the Irish translation. At most that would go in Trivia - IF there's any evidence of it being used in Ireland.

<dd>An editor has deleted "KBE" from the opener. Looking at this string I cannot see that such an edit is supported by the general comments. Is there a point to these exercises when someone comes along and decides to delete something for no apparent reason and in contravention of a hard-worked consensus? 86.17.211.191 00:54, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It was not. Squeakbox for some reason (as you can see above) put in his own consensus midway through the discussion and changed the structure to what he wanted.

Maybe if he were <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> I wouldn't complain, but he isn't&#160;:).

<p>Your comment is somewhat misplaced as I left my comment here on the 30th. I removed KBE because it was in bold, implyiong all sorts of pov stuff but now it isnt in bold I left it.

<dd>Squeakbox there is nothing wrong with you wanting to change something. The problem here is that we had an edit war and a discussion regarding the topic. <i>See: <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a></i> I did note that you left your comment here. The problem was that you left a vague comment and then ignored the current discussion and changed it to what you wanted. If our goal is to resolve an edit war through discussion, and there is no problem for someone to ignore the discussion and put in what they want, then why have a discussion in the first place??? Due to the volatility of the introductory sentence I, and I'm sure others, would consider it to be in bad taste to ignore a consensus. Remember, there is <b>nothing wrong</b> with wanting to change or disagree with something. But in these types of situations, following an edit war and a successful discussion from several editors, the best way to make changes is to discuss them first. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 21:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are we sure that the article is best served by the "Personal life' paragraph being so high up? Looking at many other articles I think it might make more sense lower down the article.

<dd>Yea I kind of agree. It seems Biographies which are chronological for entertainers are listed first. I've seen a few articles with "Early life" first and "Personal life" near the end. I'd say do that. Change "Biography" to "Early life" and convert their current subsections regular sections. Then move "Personal life" to the end, inbetween Humanitarian work &amp; Praise &amp; criticism.

<dd>Many would actually suggest that not disclosing charitable donations is a good thing. I know i don't (not that I'm comparing my ability to donate with Bono's). If he did "disclose" he'd be crucified and then we'd really have something to put in. I don't see why anyone is obliged to say what they donate.

<p>Ah, i understand, but disagree. I personally don't care either way if he discloses or donates, but we're not supposed to criticise or not criticise according to our own opinions. the newspaper, as far as i am aware, is covering a criticism (something that i've heard often said), not initiating one. And news-sources are used all the time as one of the few current sources of coverage of current debate on a subject. I've thouroughly read through your unwarranted criticism section, chupper, and while i see your point and concern about such criticism, i'm curious as to <i>whose</i> world you mean when you talk about representation above? and if you remember, what i'm suggesting here is either removing the word "humitarian" from the criticism section to include the venzeulan government's criticism and also to address the fact that the tax move is not just criticised for humanitarian reasons. Bono will survive the criticism, don't worry, it just seems rather dishonest not to include well-covered criticism of the <s>follow</s> fellow, no matter how much we like him. There's also the matter of der spiegal's criticism of his support for the ethiopian head while dissidents were being imprisoned. not covering the criticism might look biased itself. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalyres_3267.html" title="User:Chalyres">Chalyres</a> 21:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Anyway though, what I consider notable enough to be mentioned, or as I said above "representative enough of our world to put in an encyclopedia" is basically this, taken from my unwarranted criticism policy - Criticism sections should only include feelings of people if they were big enough to make an impact on the topic at hand or were a major reason for the topic's becoming noticed. I basically mean if a criticism point was notable enough to influence the subject, here Bono, in some way (either his reputation, actions, etc.) OR if the criticism brought on more attention the subject (like a scandal), it should be mentioned. This philosophy pretty much deals with any topic on Wikipedia positive or negative. However, the main reason I created this criticism essay was in response to people who throw in their own original research and use weasel words like there is no tomorrow (or in other words, they use Wikipedia to voice their opinions).</dd>

<p>I'm aware, and appreciate that that is not you, Chalyres, so let me go into some more detail about my stance. First let me say I'm usually incorrect&#160;:). Second, let me say that I really don't know much about this topic. For these reasons, please don't give me any type of authoritative position - I don't deserve it. If you find say - 2, 3, or 4 sources covering a specific issue criticising Bono, I say add &amp; reference it (and maybe include up to two or three inline cites for the added sentence, so people like me don't attack it right away). I also agree about renaming the section. But how about just "criticism" and split up the paragraphs - one dealing with humanitarian, the other dealing with whatever else. I still say keep it brief, and well referenced, though.</p>

<p>Now I hope my next comment won't offend anyone here, I really don't mean to do that. But, you'll notice the bulk of the conversation of this page here is talking about how to introduce Bono and how to deal with criticism stuff. I always appreciate ANY contributions made and I think it really helps Wikipedia progress, however a lot of people (not just on this article) seem to always want to add in criticism instead of contributing stuff to the core of the article. Sometimes I just wish we'd all be discussing what information to put into Bono's musical career section or something like that. You'll notice a lot of Wikipedia article's content is like 50% in the criticism section - and these will be big starts like Madonna, Bono, etc. That to me is embarrassing to Wikipedia. It reflects that Wikipedia, to some, is a soapbox and not an encyclopedia. Often times I find myself writing content for articles I don't have very much interest in (i.e. <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_32ce.html" title="Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>). I only do it to get rid of NPOV content, use references, add in the information that everyone knows is important but is too lazy to put in, and keep Wikipedia somewhat reputable. Again, I don't mean to attack you Chalyres, you're actually a cool headed guy making a reputable argument. I guess you just got me started on a rant&#160;:). So I say go for it, keep it brief.

<dd>With people like Chalyres around, I no longer worry so much about the criticism section getting out of control.&#160;:) He also brought up a good point that criticism sections on Wikipedia are probably the only place you can find a unified source on the subject. I really won't object to his or anyone else's changes or additions to the criticism sections as long as they are referenced and it doesn't grow too long. Even if you are worried, as Wikipedia says "Be BOLD!" To everyone else out there - feel free to add whatever you like to criticism. At <u>worst</u> what would happen is someone would remove it. I don't mean to scare people away from editing. Happy editing - <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 23:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey guys, I need your help answering something. I reverted his edit once, but he restored it again, so I thought I would get some consensus from the group before changing it again.</p>
<p>Billthekid77 insists on adding, after "KBE", the footnote stating "As an Irishman, Bono is ineligible for a full honour and so holds an honorary KBE." I don't feel this is relevant, and if it is we should place it elsewhere in the article. Every other footnote is citing a source, except for this one, and that may confuse readers. Your thoughts? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 15:41, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is it just me or do other wikipedians believe that it's just a tad anglocentric that a parochial British title like "KBE" is being placed after the name of an international figure as if, in the finely tuned nationalism of the species, he must have some British connection imposed upon him simply because he is successful? 89.100.195.42 16:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't agree with Chupper..the KBE link needs to have a quick reference after it to clearly explain that Bono's award was honarary...readers shouldn't need to go scrolling and searching for this.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Billthekid77 (<a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillthekid77_20e7.html" title="User talk:Billthekid77">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Billthekid77_898e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Billthekid77">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>The footnote reference is not quite right. Please note first the following info about knighthoods for non-Brits</p>
<p><b>Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights and Dames Commander who are not subjects of the Queen (i.e. not citizens of the United Kingdom or another country ruled by the Queen) are not entitled to the prefix "Sir" or "Dame", but may still use the post-nominal abbreviations. For example, American Bill Gates was made a Knight Commander of the British Empire is not entitled "Sir William" or "Sir William Gates III", but may use "William Henry Gates III, KBE". Honorary knights do not receive the accolade. If recipients later become subjects of the Queen then they are entitled to begin using the Sir prefix as well.</b></p>
<p>The footnote currently says:</p>
<p><b>As an Irishman, Bono is ineligible for a full honour and so holds an honorary KBE.</b></p>
<p>I think it should read something like this. (It's a bit long - but it's a complex point. And this is in the reference section):</p>
<p><b>KBE is the official suffix for the award Bono received from Her Majesty The Queen in 2007. (Honorary Knight Commander Of The British Empire). Recipients who are not British subjects are entitled to use the suffix "KBE" - but not the prefix "Sir"</b></p>

<dd>Part of the trouble is that the British honors system is complex. The "KBE" article is NOT very clear. Esp. for non-Brits. The part about honorary titles and usage of prefixes and suffixes is buried in the article. And written in formal language eg <i>but may still use the post-nominal abbreviations</i>. Also - tabloid media (even in UK) further confuse matters by using the "Sir" prefix in headlines about Bono and Bob Geldof. So people see "Sir Bob" and "Sir Bono" in headlines - and don't realize that it is an incorrect, colloquial headline writer's usage. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 14:15, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No i'm not getting confused with that because Bono probably supports them, aswell as Larry Mullen, as he was born in the Republic of Ireland. Plus Celtic FC is a Scottish team.

<p>I know the lead sentence is often a touchy subject, for good reasons, so I'm posting this change here. I'm changing the words "lead singer" to "frontman" and adding a link. Using "frontman" indicates he is the lead singer and implies the most famous member out of the group as well as the one who "[communicates] with the audience between songs".</p>

<p>The definition of "frontman" does apply to Bono in a strict literal way - but I must say that as a word it's just a bit tabloid-ese rather than encyclopedic. A bit casual. It's like the way a 60's British fanzine writes things like "the boys haven't enjoyed much success States-side" (meaning America). Or describing a girl singer as a "songstress". Or referring to a drummer as someone who "rattles the traps". It's just too faux-showbiz familiar. While Bono IS the most prominent member - the band do regard themselves as a quartet of equals (as the Beatles did). So I think the word is not the ideal choice. Just my 2 cents. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 15:32, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although i take Chupper's point about being the leader and most famous, I agree that 'frontman' is a bit tabloidy and unencyclopedic, and thus not a good change. But, keep up your (otherwise) good work Chupper. is there another way to get that leader concept into the article? Does it have to be in the first sentence? It can be expanded on later in the article or even lead (if it is not already).<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 15:57, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
