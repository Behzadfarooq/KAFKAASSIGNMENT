<p>Does anyone have information on whether or not book titles and plotlines by James Bond authors other than Ian Fleming, (i.e. John Gardner) have been considered for future bond films? <a href="../../../f/l/i/User%7EFlibirigit_3d7f.html" title="User:Flibirigit">Flibirigit</a> 07:12, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>EON/Danjaq only has the rights to the Ian Fleming books. To adapt a Gardner or Benson book, they would have obtain it from Ian Fleming Publications. I doubt this will ever happen, honestly. It would take a pretty successful book from a continuation author to get them to pick it up (at least now - you could argue Colonel Sun, but then there's the whole Per Fine Ounce / Harry Saltzman tangle). According to Cubby Broccoli they'd never do it because it's cheaper to just write their own. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 22:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Speaking of titles, although it's good to be thorough, there is no way that "007 in New York" will ever be considered as a title for this film, so I removed it from the list of possibilities. Personally I doubt we'll ever see "Quantum of Solace" used either because Joe Moviegoer would have no idea what it meant. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said in the edit summary, it may be unconventional and while the likelihood of "007 in New York" ever being used is very small, it is still a possibility and to remove it would clearly be POV. I disagree with your statement about "Quantum of Solace", although your explanation for it is perhaps apt. If I was a betting man I'd say Bond 22 will be "Risico" (titles only, although I can see variations of the source material being used kind of akin to Licence to Kill and Live and Let Die) followed by Bond 23 being "The Property of a Lady" perhaps followed by Quantum. I have a feeling they're going to use up the remaining 'good' Fleming titles with Craig and the fate of Quantum will, just a guess, share the same fate as Craig (i.e., if he does 4, then we'll see it, but if only 3 thar be then probably not for a long while). <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 05:00, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think "The Property of a Lady" is the more likely title IMO because it's the easiest one for them to write a theme song for, which is another reason why I don't think Quantum of Solace, Risco, Hildebrand Rarity or 007 in New York stand much of a chance. The producers want to maximize marketing potential. Granted Casino Royale isn't particularly good for this, and whoever does the theme will have the spectre (pun intended) of Herb Alpert over them, but unless there's been an announcement to the contrary my money is on CR using the James Bond Theme, period. And CR has other marketing hooks such as being the first book, and MGM/Sony will probably rake in extra dough from sales of the 1967 film on DVD (I expect there to be a special edition reissue but don't quote me on that). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:38, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe EON/Danjaq have got the right to adapt <i>any</i> Bond book, because the literary rights for all the books belong to Ian Fleming Publications and I remember reading an interview with Wilson where he said they had all the books, including the continuation novels, in the EON offices "in case we run out of ideas". 86.138.125.156 16:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe not the next movie, but I think the Benson novels featuring 'The Union' should be adapted to film. Of course they would have to be adapted for the Daniel Craig Bond, as these books were set later in Bond's career. One of the books mentions Bond's dead wife Tracy, but since they rebooted the series, this won't work. Perhap's they should change it to where he gets married during the trilogy? One of the many changes they would have to make, but the main plot of the movies being about 'The Union'.</p>

<p>Herein lies the danger of believing rumor. I can't find anything to suggest Uwe Boll is even up for consideration as director of Bond 22, so have removed all referernces to this. I've also blocked the anon who was adding this material on the grounds that there is evidence these were bad faith and possibly vandalistic (real word?) edits. Similarly, I can find no indication that Judi Dench will return as M or that John Cleese will return as Q -- I don't think it's even been announced that Q will even be in Bond 22. I imagine more details will emerge as the year goes on, but I personally don't expect any real confirmations until CR is out. If anyone can prove that Boll is going to be the director of the next Bond, then I will revert my edits with apologies... <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:38, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dude, vandalism. There's no way they'd hire Uwe Boll. Even if he wasn't one of the worse directors his schedule is lined up through pretty much this decade. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 03:04, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had difficulty finding any confirmation regarding this putative title (<i>Risico</i>). None of the links provided had any mention of the new title.

<li>It looks like vandalism to me, the link just goes to the official Casino Royale page. I'm reverting for now. <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclone49_674c.html" title="User:Cyclone49">Cyclone49</a> 07:36, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not true (at this point). It's unlikely we will find out the title before November when they start doing press junkets and whatever for the release of Casino Royale (not to mention the possibility of it being attached to CR: 'James Bond will return in..'). That would be the soonest and that's really only taking into account Bond 22 being released in 2007. If it's a 2 year gap then expect a much longer delay in knowing - officially. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 18:57, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>RISICO is not an official name, but it appears (<a href="http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=3892" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=3892" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) that it is the likely contender. A few more scholarly researchings, though, before this can be put en article. <a href="../../../a/s/u/User%7EAsukaSeagull_5e46.html" title="User:AsukaSeagull">User:AsukaSeagull</a></li>
<li>Typically in a Bond movie, an announcement of the next movie's title would follow the end of the credits. I haven't yet seen Casino Royale, but I think it is safe to assume that no announcement occurred. Is this another break in tradition for the rebooted Bond-franchise? <a href="../../../e/m/-/User%7EEm-jay-es_9812.html" title="User:Em-jay-es"><span style="background:#006400; size:2; color:#DCDCDC;"><i>Em-jay-es</i></span></a> 18:49, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm probably asking for trouble by starting a Cast section, but since we do have one confirmed cast member -- Daniel Craig -- I figured we may as well start it.

<p>Ian Meadows (fans of the tv show Home And Away would know him as Rocco Cooper who sadly passed away but then again shit happens) has scored his first role in hollywood playing algerian agent Dia De Razza boyfriend of Vesper Lynd (played wonderfully by Eva Green in Casino Royale) where Bond is sent to rescue him at the start of the film Daniel Craig reported that at least something interesting has so far been added in the script he did say what it was a i'm not going to spoil the movie for you Evagfan 05:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is Bond 23 redirected to <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bond_22.html" title="Bond 22">Bond 22</a>, we know <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Craig_f5e7.html" title="Daniel Craig">Daniel Craig</a> is <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a>, thats it. I know there isn't enough info to start this article but why does it redirect to Bond 22. In my opininon it should redirect to James Bond or have no article at all</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your comments. The redirect was put in place to discourage anyone from creating a Bond 23 article at this stage. I believe there was an attempt to do so, but the fact is aside from the fact Craig may or may not play Bond (there are differing reports as to whether he is in fact signed for a third film), anything else would be simply crystal-balling or speculation. A redirect was also created as a "place holder". If history repeats itself and verifiable information about Bond 23 begins to emerge before Bond 22 even starts filming, then a bonifide article could begin to take shape at that point. Redirects are cheap. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:13, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>it seems that Home And Away star has signed on to play Vesper Lind's algerien boyfriend Dia de Razza in bond 22 it will be not really a small but yet not really a large he will do alot of action sequences Daniel Craig (who have to had to have his own aprooval of the script before any go ahead) says it the best death seene in bond movie history (EVAPORATION) Dodger206 04:42, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted it because the article used as a source isn't credible. The details are wrong and we shouldn't make entire changes to this page based on a rumor. It said Bond 22 will be based on the short story Risico, but this is already false as Risico's story was used as the main plot for the 81 film For Your Eyes Only. They're not going to reuse it. They could do something similar like LTK reusing LALD's story, but the rumor doesn't say that. It also said the villain was Colombo. This is false. Had they even bothered to read the story or see FYEO they would have seen that Colombo was actually a good guy, not the villain and regardless the character was already used. The title may very well end up being used (I hope so) and Campbell may end up returning, but this is just speculation. Hardly credible at all. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 21:11, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's still worth noting as The Sun is a major publication and it's also been reported on sites such as Commander Bond. Just like the rumors surrounding who was going to play Bond, Vesper, etc. I think it's interesting to track some of these rumors -- provided, of course, that they are identified as rumors and come from reputable sources. A major national newspaper -- even a tabloid -- does fit that bill. A news group or blog, however, does not, so we need to be careful on this. Anticipating someone will add it anyway, I went ahead and added this rumor to the For Your Eyes Only book page, before someone else came along and posted that it was official, or something like that. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:02, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, the Sun is a major tabloid. There's a difference. Just because someone else runs an article based on the Sun's speculation doesn't make the information any more true. The Sun started the crap about The Killers being offered the job for the next theme song and guess what? It was BS. Confirmed by the band itself. The Sun cannot be trusted and should not be used as a "credible source" on Wikipedia especially this far out from the actual production of the film. You would think Wikipedia learned it's lesson last time. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 22:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I only just found out that Kevin McClory died a few months ago. Wouldn't that render the whol SPECTRE litigation issue moot, opening the door for Bond 22 to use them? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:02, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. If McClory still had the rights then he probably passed them on to his family or whatever. If EON/UA/Sony/MGM do not own the rights, 100%, and without question then they won't use them. That said, SPECTRE was always lumped into the Thunderball lawsuits, but never once to my knowledge did the courts ever conclude that SPECTRE was McClory's so it's kind of a gray area. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 22:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>McClory also at times laid claim to Blofeld's cat (although I can't how as the cat only appears in the movies) and "Bond movies with sequences set in the Bahamas" amongst many other things, some of them as bizarre (I recall reading he claimed copyright on the plot line of "steal some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage" - I wonder how the Austin Powers movies got away with that!). And where was part of Casino Royale set? But hadn't McClory lost the rights through failure to renew them at a crucial juncture or something? I've seen a lot of speculation that EON could now use Blofeld and/or SPECTRE.</dd>

<dd>Also from recollection SPECTRE isn't mentioned at all in Diamonds Are Forever and the only mention in On Her Majestey's Secret Service leaves it unclear as to whether Blofeld is still working with SPECTRE or has gone freelance.

<p>10 to one says McClory probably left the rights to spectre to someone in his family, although it would be really ammusing if someone from the Fleming family got it. I really don't want Spectre or Blofeld to come back, especially after they got spoofed to death in those damned austin powers movies...</p>

<p>Daniel Craig did not request a gay scene in Bond 22, this was simply a tabloid rumor that was taken out of context about his new film, "Infamous"' started by the idiots at DCINB.Com. Daniel Craig was simply stating that Bond fans should accept him for no matter which role he takes, which is true.</p>
