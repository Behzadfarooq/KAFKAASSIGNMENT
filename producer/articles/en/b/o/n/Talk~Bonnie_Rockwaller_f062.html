<p>How does Bonnie saying her older siblings won the talent contest four years in a row imply that she has more than two?

<p>I heavily edited the rivalry section on Bonnie to more accurately reflect Bonnie's POV. Before, it made it seem like it was all Bonnie's fault that she's a jerk-- I added some things to provoke more thought on whose fault it really is. Here are the edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kim's type A personality really does feed off of Bonnie's anger issues.</li>
<li>Kim enjoys humiliating Bonnie almost as much as Bonnie likes humiliating Kim.</li>
<li>B really does feel like K overachieves "on purpose" and...</li>
<li>...there is something to be said for that, as K enjoys showing off. Also,
<ul>
<li>in <i>truth hurts</i> K admits that she liked a boy because he liked B,</li>
<li>in <i>hidden talent</i> K doesn't drop out of the competition only because Bonnie was in it</li>
<li>in <i>queen bebe</i> K only stays in those extracurriculars because B is in them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kim's relationship with Bonnie is much more damaging personally than her relationship with Shego.</li>
<li>Bonnie is one of the very few Disney child characters to be actually abused on screen by elder members of her family-- which really should mean something. Who else? like, Cinderella?</li>
<li>I uploaded a new picture of bonnie (and 2 of shego)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Just to clarify, while Bonnie and Kim's type A personalities playing off of one another is the cause of much of the antagonism between the two character, Bonnie actually <i>is</i> a jerk (it is part of her character, as written by Disney), and while it might seem obvious that Bonnie being picked on by her sisters is the cause of this, a 1 minute cameo by Connie and Lonnie (the only mention of their bullying anywhere in the series) isn't quite enough to confirm that they are actually the cause, so the page has to be a little more circumspect about it.</dd>

<p><small>trackfan had a point, so I uploaded 2 pics. I really like the main pic, tho, we just need a background on it. What ep is that from? <a href="../../../3D/c/j/User%7E%3DCJK%3D_edaf.html" title="User:=CJK=">=CJK=</a> 05:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
<p><small>Hey, this is a community effort, I'm not doing everything myself. between the two of you, you should be able to come up with something. Try avoid anything that's been put up on deviant art and places like that though, because most of them are not copyrighted to Disney and you will probably need the individual authors permission to use them.</small></p>
<p><small>If possible, try to avoid ones with the Disney channel branding, so we can use the DisneyCharacter template and not the TV screen shot template. There's plenty out there.</small></p>

<dd><small>I prefer having the backgrounds taken out when the character is the focus, and having them in when the scene or event is the focus, but that's just my opinion. It is also a good way of getting the Disney Channel logo out of the corner.</small></dd>

<p><small>"Kim almost always retaliates directly to Bonnie's attacks"</small></p>
<p><small>I add all of where Kim never even responds to Bonnie (Kimitation Nation, Job Unfair, The Full Monkey, The Truth Hurts, A Sitch in Time - Past, etc) to the episodes like Number One where she responds by giving bonnie what she want's as a form of retaliation (doesn't count as actual retaliation), and then compared it to all of the episodes where she goes tit-for-tat or similar (return to Camp Wannaweep, Bonding, etc) I came up with the opposite conclusion.</small></p>
<p><small>"most of the time", Kim either pretends that she isn't tweaked, or she goes off in a huff and complains to Ron about it later on, but does nothing to Bonnie. <b>not true, see below</b></small></p>
<p><small>I might be wrong, but could you please go through the episodes yourself name the scenes and the retaliations for me to validate the above assertion. <b>see below</b></small></p>

<hr />
<p><small>Okay, jeez. First, some ground rules. What counts as retaliation?</small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>Name calling, to the face or behind the back, no matter what the circumstance.</small></li>
<li><small>Doing something else to annoy the other person, no matter what the circumstance.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>Feel free to edit this list directly. What does Kim usually do after Bonnie attacks her?<br /></small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>LEVEL 1: Tries to reason with Bonnie:</small>
<ul>
<li><small><i>Number One</i> at the end, I guess.</small></li>
<li><small><i>Sink or Swim</i> reasons with B to save their lives, I think.</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><small><br /></small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>LEVEL 2: "Goes off in a huff" and doesn't say/do anything bad in retaliation to Bonnie:</small>
<ul>
<li><small><b>DOESN'T COUNT</b>: <i>Royal Pain</i> but only because Brick wasn't doing very well in the election -- B just entered her boyfriend in, not herself.</small></li>
<li><small><b>DOESN'T COUNT</b>:<i>Ron Millionaire</i>: B doesn't do anything to KP or Ron</small></li>
<li><small><b>DOESN'T COUNT</b>: <i>Tick Tick Tick</i> KP gets detention, and just walks away -- B didn't do anything here</small></li>
<li><small><i>So the Drama</i> B talks about the "food chain" of boyfriends</small></li>
<li><small><i>Trading Faces</i> B hurts KP with brothers, KP doesn't retaliate</small></li>
<li><small><i>Down Hill</i> most of the time in this ep. KP just worries about B.</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><small><br /></small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>LEVEL 3: Goes off in a huff and talks smack about Bonnie but doesn't think about hurting her: <b>(counts as retaliation)</b></small>
<ul>
<li><small><i>Ill Suited</i> after B tells KP to "trade up"</small></li>
<li><small><i>Kimitation Nation</i> I think</small></li>
<li><small><i>Number One</i></small></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><small><br /></small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>LEVEL 4: Is happy with B's failures or when B is hurt by KP or anything else: <b>(counts as retaliation)</b></small>
<ul>
<li><small><i>Car Alarm</i> when B's car is destroyed by the jetcar</small></li>
<li><small><i>Car Alarm</i> when she rewards her brothers for destroying B's car</small></li>
<li><small><i>Hidden Talent</i> when KP stays in talent show because "she won't allow B to show her up"</small></li>
<li><small><i>Number One</i> at the very end ("I give her 2 weeks.")</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><small><br /></small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>LEVEL 5: Actually turns right around and hurts B: <b>(counts as retaliation)</b></small>
<ul>
<li><small><i>Down Hill</i></small></li>
<li><small><i>Ill Suited</i> when KP insults B ("Jealous?") when even she's suspicious of Ron.</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><small><br /></small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>LEVEL 6: Trying to hurt B when B didn't do anything- Kim being bad guy: <b>(counts as retaliation)</b></small>
<ul>
<li><small><i>Return to Camp Wannaweep</i> B claimed the top bunk. She didn't start the fight, and it probably could have ended right there if KP kept her cool. - (Note: Bonnie collapsed the cheer pyramid, made the "food chain" speech in the cabin, and made nasty comments about the bags under Kim's eyes during the opening event. All before Kim's first retaliation. That's three acts of provocation).</small></li>
<li><small><i>Queen Bebe</i> KP will do anything to keep B from becoming chair of any school thing, even though B didn't do anything. (Note: Bonnie showed no interest in most of these things).</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><small><b>So the score is: Kim retaliates 14/18 times in these 17 seperate episodes (out of a total of 70+ episodes), or 78% of the time that she interacts with Bonnie.</b><br />
<br />
<a href="../../../3D/c/j/User%7E%3DCJK%3D_edaf.html" title="User:=CJK=">=CJK=</a> 16:09, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
<p><small>Sorry, but I think that we are also coming up against the language barrier again just as before.</small></p>
<p><small>In English. retaliation is a very very strong and specific word, it means "to strike back at somebody who has struck at you". In the context that you are using it, retaliation literally means "revenge" (venganza), but most of the actions that you are citing are not retaliation. I think that the word which we are looking for is "respond" (responder). This means that Bonnie does something to Kim and Kim reacts to it.</small></p>
<p><small>Linguistically speaking, doing things like moaning to Ron about Bonnie, or being happy when somebody else does something to Bonnie can't ever be counted as "retaliation" because she isn't actually doing anything to hurt or upset Bonnie, HOWEVER they can both be counted as being a "response" (respuesta).</small></p>
<p><small>For example, if Bonnie trips Kim in the corridor and Kim smashes Bonnie's cell phone, that is "retaliation", but if Bonnie trips Kim in the corridor and Kim complains to Ron about it, that is a "response" (respuesta), but because she didn't actually try to do anything bad to Bonnie it can't be counted as "retaliation". Do you see?</small></p>
<p><small><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfectblue97_ef11.html" title="User:Perfectblue97">perfectblue</a> 08:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
<p><small>Retaliate is a somewhat loaded word...so how about "getting even"? There's no language barrier that I can see, only different opinions regarding diction choice. <a href="../../../j/u/m/User%7EJumping_cheese_1a25.html" title="User:Jumping cheese"><font style="font-family:Cooper Black;"><font color="green">Jumping</font> <font color="blue">cheese</font></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/m/User_talk%7EJumping_cheese_9a6d.html" title="User talk:Jumping cheese"><font color="black">Cont</font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jumping_cheese_0f8e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jumping cheese"><font color="black">@ct</font></a></sup> 10:18, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
<p><small>I'm not so much as concerned about the word being loaded, but more about the way that it was applied to such a broad area, and the way that makes it sound like Kim actively takes revenge on Bonnie. For example, during seasons 1-3 Kim (65 episodes + comics + cinimanga + games) Kim only actually "does" something nasty to Bonnie in a handful of episodes, such as in "Return to Camp Wannaweep" when she goes tit-for-tat and the in "Hidden Talent" when she stays in the show just to spite Bonnie. Most of the Time, though, Kim either goes off in a huff and says/does nothing to Bonnie (for example, Job unfair, when she never even responds to Bonnie's teasing), or she complains to Ron. None of which can be counted as "retaliation", or as "getting even", because she doesn't actually do anything more than bend Ron's ear about Bonnie being bossy etc.</small></p>
<p><small>Equally, I'm concerned that things done by other people shouldn't be attributed to Kim, even if she benefits from them. For example, Kim had no part in her mother calling Bonnie's mom in "Downhill" (she only found out after the fact). So it can't be counted as "getting even" or "retaliation" unless it's put on her mom's page.</small></p>
