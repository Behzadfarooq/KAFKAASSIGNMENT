<dd>I absolutely agree - when a new film comes out and does well, most of the time it sets a new box-office record. No one sits down and starts calculating that it cost $2 to go to a movie in 1975 but $12 now, so it isn't a record. It took in what it took in, and that is the most dollars to date. If you want to argue numbers then pull up a number of tickets sold/butts in seats statistic. It still grossed the most money and that's what the statement was. It also COST 21st century dollars to make and distribute - what did Porky's cost, $16.78US? --<a href="../../../c/o/k/User%7ECokeBear_4362.html" title="User:CokeBear">CokeBear</a> 13:21, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe a reference can be made to the change of subtitles depending on the version. For example, when David was talking about Toronto, he said "Peu-etre Toronto n'est pas si plat (Toronto may not be so boring/dull after all)", however the subtitled said "Toronto may be ok after all". <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanking_bca5.html" title="User:Canking">Canking</a> 07:53, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Subtitles typically simplify the dialogue a little bit, since generally people don't read as fast as the actors speak. That translation certainly seems within acceptable limits. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 14:27, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is the definition of acceptable limits? I agree that the translation otherwise is fine but can criticisms not be mentioned? I don't mean to attack the movie needlessly however I believe some points deserve mention. I originally put that there are over 4 times as many francophones in Ontario as in New Brunswick and I cited this according to statcan.ca... Could there be a section even in regards to inaccuracies? The Hotel Rwanda page as an example of this about how the movie differs from the current state of things. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanking_bca5.html" title="User:Canking">Canking</a> 21:00, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From a social-and cultural point of view, I found this movie to be a complete reversal of the reality of way it actually is with French guys vs. Anglo guys. The movie promotes the useless stereotype of the uptight, unsexy, boring Anglo, versus the cool, laid-back streetwise Frenchman. For any of you that have ever spent significant time in Quebec, you'll be well aware that the opposite is actually true. The sad reality is that French guys of the age group shown are neurotic, and are dependent on their parents still, as well as blissfully unware of matters outside of Quebec, and completely out of touch. Contrary to popular media, women do not find them irresistable. The "<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian.html" title="Bohemian">Bohemian</a>" lifestyle? Uh..we call that "lazy" down in Southern Ontario. The popularity of this film outside of Quebec shows you exactly what English Canada thinks of such stereotypes. My two cents on behalf of Anglo-Canadians. 74.101.223.160 04:29, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am an Anglo-Canadian (and Ontarian, although I have lived in a lot of places including Toronto) and I find your comments (both above and below) to be a little offensive, and somewhat sheltered (ironically). First of all, a lot of "Toronto"-type people look at much of the rest of Canada as lazy, and usually without justification. That's why so many Canadians HATE Toronto (I know, amazing, but it isn't because they are all just jealous). Putting aside the very obvious aspect that the movie was intended to have a farce aspect... the most obvious thing that you missed was that the Anglo women found the Franco cop exotic and attractive, and the same situation reversed applied to the French women - both the barmaid and the ex-wife were interested in the "exotic" OPP detective. The movie intends to play on stereotypes, that is the whole point, and if you can't remove the stick long enough to laugh a little at yourself you're missing a huge part of the film's charm. There is a line where Ward says something like, "He works 75 hours a week, which for Quebec I take it is a lot" poking fun at EXACTLY the kind of attitude you are showing here. Looks like your own insecurities ruined your grasp of that aspect of the film. --<a href="../../../c/o/k/User%7ECokeBear_4362.html" title="User:CokeBear">CokeBear</a> 13:16, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I realize that, but a comedy should play on stereotypes or twsiting of stereotypes. Getting it completely backwards from the real stereotype ends up being not funny, and a strict no-sell outside of Quebec. Please someone find me a streetwise Quebecquois man ~30 yo. 74.101.223.160 20:12, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The movie had its weaknesses, but it wasn't <i>trying</i> to be realistic; the whole premise was contrived and artificial. The story is not simply stereotypes, and Bouchard is not a random Quebec francophone, he is a professional detective (compare him with his boss). Now, it's actually a very interesting question why the movie had a difference in popularity between anglophone and francophone audiences, but I don't see realism being the main factor. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 21:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I believe the most erroneous stereotype comes from the director himself. A Southern Ontarian was selected to represent English Canada but there are massive cultural differences within English Canada that could have been at least mentioned. A Torontonian is far more like a Montrealer than a Newfie for example. How about a Cape Brettoner to a Calgarian? So in essence, the false belief in Quebec that Canada constitues essentially two cultures; that of French Canada (primarily Quebec) and that of English Canada is clearly evident. The cover picture of the movie would have been better with the Trillium and fleur-de-lys instead of the Maple Leaf and Fleur-de-lys. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanking_bca5.html" title="User:Canking">Canking</a> 02:44, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, the idea of " 'dem versus us " Quebequois mentality is a bit played out. The realism in the movie is lacking. Even a comedy must have a plausible premise to be successful. To be honest, this movie is a film representation of Quebec bigotry, as I see it. No wonder nobody "gets it". The Torontonian similar to Montrealer vs. Newfie you mentioned is preposterous, though. There are scarce similarities TO'er vs. MTL'er, other than they are city-dwellers. 74.101.223.160 23:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well city dwellers do have many commonalities no matter what city they live in. City Dwellers don't rely on cars as much, they weigh less and their views towards world issues are different because cities are more multicultural. I can show you articles outlining these distinctions if you like but I imagine you agree with me to some extent though. Anyways, I do agree with you completely that there are large differences between Torontonians and Montrealers and people from St. John's and I was only using this example to show how rediculous any sort of prejudice like this is. Do you believe this biased view of the director or something along those lines should be included in the article? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanking_bca5.html" title="User:Canking">Canking</a> 03:00, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cut the bickering. Look at you guys: arguing about the <i>accuracy of a stereotype</i>. Do I have to repeat that one more time? <i>Accuracy of a stereotype</i>. I believe the term oxymoron applies here. Stereotypes are just empty labels for quick audience recognition. Who's talking about any type of correlation between one stereotype to one cultural faction? They could have been switched just as easily and the movie would have been no different. And comon, I think it's obvious that the success of this <b>bilingual</b> movie has more to do with the fact that quebec has a much stronger english-french bilingual population than the rest of Canada than the fact that Quebecois are portrayed as being "more hip".<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDMZ_00f7.html" title="User:DMZ">DMZ</a> 05:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
