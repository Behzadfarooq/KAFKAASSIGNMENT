<p>It would be interesting to have information on the linguistic history of the Bonins.</p>
<p>As you might know, the lingua franca used to be an English pidgin (creole?), but I have no idea what the situation is today. If the English pidgin/creole has survived into the present day, I would suspect it is being replaced rapidly by Hyozyungo (Standard Japanese). --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 01:22, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Because of that, the operation by the large-sized helicopter by way of operation and the Self Defense Force sulphur island base by the private boat seaplane from the Haneda airport, similarly, method such as sea mail from the sulphur island is examined, but if these actualize, as for airport construction conclusion has not come out of the fear of becoming unnecessary. In addition, the long-time inhabitant falls in love is packed although airport construction is eagerly desired, Ogasawara naturally and and the new inhabitant who immigrates seems the unexplored region in order for us to like to leave being passive in airport construction, either opinion of the islander is not been settled.</p>
