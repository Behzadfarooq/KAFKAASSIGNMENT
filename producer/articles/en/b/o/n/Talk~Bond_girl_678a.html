<p>This list basically features all the female character with whom Bond had some sort of romantic/sexual encounter. Should Jenny Flex from A View to a Kill and Naomi from Spy Who Loved Me be listed? I don't recall them being any more than eye candy (and minor villains), as opposed to romantic conquests. The same could be said for Peaceful Fountains of Desire in "Die Another Day" although Bond did, at least, have a couple of moments with her.

<dd>OK, that covers Naomi sufficiently, but IIRC Jenny Flex only met Bond for about 2 seconds in AVTAK. But I haven't seen the movie for ages so I may be wrong. Wasn't there also an Oriental girl alongside Jenny? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:57, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Naomi is definitely a "Bond girl" as Caroline Munro actually starred in the movie. Jenny Flex is not a Bond girl per se, neither is Pan Ho, nor Della Chruchill from Licence to Kill.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Talk%7EBond_girl_678a.html" title="Edit section: Criteria suggestion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criteria suggestion</span></h2>
<p>Further to K1Bond007's comment during a recent edit, there does seem to be a popular misconception as to what a Bond girl is. I have seen women with walk-on roles given the title Bond girl and promoted as such, for example. K1Bond007 suggests scaling back. My suggestion is since the term "eye candy Bond girl" has already been established, maybe the key is to break the listing down into major Bond girls, minor Bond girls, and then eye candy. For example, in OHMSS Tracy would be the only major Bond girl, while the two Piz Gloria patients Bond sleeps with would be listed as minor Bond girls, and the remaining girls (including the one played by Joanna Lumley) would be listed as Eye-candy Bond girls. Similarly we could list female characters who don't really interact with Bond as eye-candy such as Jenny Flex from AVTAK, and maybe Madonna from DAD as well since except for flirting with Bond she just stands in the background and watches him swordfight. Thoughts? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 02:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd rather not do Major vs Minor. Perhaps just leave as is and create an "eye-candy" section. Otherwise you gotta define what makes one minor, while the term "eye-candy" is already loaded with a definition. My problem with the list was that I didn't see a reason to list "The Australian girl" and and so on in OHMSS when total they had about 3 minutes on screen. I wouldn't consider them Bond girls.<a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 02:34, September 7, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. I think they fit the eye candy criteria, however, so I agree that at least an Eye Candy section should be created. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:08, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know this is covered elsewhere also, but I think it would be a good idea to make reference to the fact a number of Bond film actresses (with the exception of Lois Maxwell, Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg, and one or two others) were overdubbed by the same voice actress. This is particularly the case in <i>Dr. No</i>; if you listen carefully you'll hear Sylvia talk with Honey's voice and vice versa. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:50, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That's a bit prejudicial isn't it?

<dd><i>It was initially planned that her death would actually occur in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), but this idea was dropped during filming of On Her Majesty's Secret Service when current-Bond George Lazenby announced he would step down from the role.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This doesn't make sense, as first of all, she dies in the book, and second, Lazenby didn't seem to break with EON until the infamous premiere, not "during filming". It doesn't jibe with accounts e.g. <a href="http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/ohmss_production.php3" class="external text" title="http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/ohmss_production.php3" rel="nofollow">here</a>.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:20, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It may not make sense but I believe it's mentioned in the John Cork book James Bond: The Legacy. I need to get ahold of a copy to doublecheck. I have seen several sources on TV and in print that stated that EON didn't want OHMSS to end on a downbeat note, so OHMSS was going to end with the wedding and DAF was going to open with the killing, thereby setting up Bond going after Blofeld. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:53, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First off, count how many times EON Productions has done something that was different in the book (just look at <i>Diamonds Are Forever</i>). Second, it is correct; Lazenby made it known before filming was complete that he wasn't returning. 2 endings were indeed devised, one, as 23skidoo alludes to, was Bond and Tracy riding off into the sunset in Bond's car with the idea that DAF would start with her death (in the PTS) followed by Bond getting revenge. There is enough proof of this outside of the original OHMSS script. They actually had a couple DAF drafts to cover it, one of which was Auric Goldfinger's twin brother (which he doesn't have or never spoke of in the novel nor the film) killing Tracy. There are tons of interesting drafts for DAF (one was more faithful to the novel and had the Spangled Mob). <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 02:25, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm hoping someday these alternate drafts will be published somewhere. I'd love to see the Blofeld version of Spy Who Loved Me, or the version of Moonraker that was planned (and possibly written?) to follow one of the 1960s Bonds - I forget which one). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 02:40, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Heh.. incidentally Goldfinger's twin from that DAF draft I was talking about was a Swedish shipping magnate who had a super tanker. Gee.. I wonder where that idea went. The SPECTRE draft was written by Cary Bates (writes comics and was apparently recommended by Roald Dahl) and was more of an adaptation of Moonraker that involved Hugo Drax as an (I think) Emilio Largo type for SPECTRE. Apparently he was HQ'd under Loch Ness. You can see the similarities with the finished product except for whatever reason, the Bond girl was Tatiana Romanova from FRWL. Interesting anyway. There were 10 drafts of TSWLM and I'd like to get my hands on at least one of them just for grins. I've seen excerpts and John Cork I think has mentioned them in one of his books, I believe. Unfortunately I don't think it's ever going to happen because those ideas they throw out tend to eventually be used in some manner down the road (e.g., the Acrostar Jet scene in Octopussy was written for Moonraker). <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 04:40, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just so we are complete, do any Bond girls appear in the first Moneypenny Diaries book? Also, it probably wouldn't hurt to include Bond girls within the John Pearson biography of 007 since it's considered a Bond novel by some authorities. If I have time I'll thumb through my copy and add the list.

<p>I removed the statement saying that Xenia is the only major female character Bond does not bed as this is an incorrect statement. Although you can't really call them "Bond girls", nonetheless Rosa Klebb and Irma Bunt are major female characters. In addition, Bond does not bed Bibi Dahl (for good reason) in For Your Eyes Only, nor does he bed Plenty O'Toole in Diamonds (though he tries to). I can also think of other examples: Tilly Masterson in Goldfinger and Paula Caplan in Thunderball. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 03:26, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The start of the article mentions "Other female characters such as Judi Dench's M and Miss Moneypenny are not thought of as Bond girls". However, the documentary also mentioned, "Bond Girls are Forever", presents both of them as Bond girls... just wondered if anyone else had any thoughts?? Mjsp rn 20:46, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Given the generally held view of what defines a bond girl, it's tough to include M for starters, as there is no romance or sexual tension with Judi Dench. Not to mention the fact that M wasn't always female. Personally I don't include Moneypenny either, as the "Bond Girl" stereotype always includes at least one of glamour, "sexual encounter" or "femme fatale", and none of these can be levelled against Moneypenny really (yes I know Samantha Bond got a bit dressed up) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndymarczak_410b.html" title="User:Andymarczak">Andymarczak</a> 11:39, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>According to the featurette <i>Bond Girls Are Forever</i> (which is on the Casino Royale DVD), M and Money Penny are both considered Bond Girls. Judi's interview and thoughts on the subject are included in the featurette. I think they are Bond Girls because they play prominent roles (not just background eye candy), and they interact with Bond in a personal way, whether or not sexual nuances are present. As for M's "sex change," I believe the lines become blurred between the actress and the character. Could it be that Judi is a Bond Girl while M is not? <a href="../../../w/j/c/User%7EWjcolion_548d.html" title="User:Wjcolion">Wjcolion</a> 21:00, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
