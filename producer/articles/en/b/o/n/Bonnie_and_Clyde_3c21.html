Their exploits were known nationwide. They captivated the attention of the American press and its readership during what is sometimes referred to as the "<a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_enemy_%28term%29.html" title="Public enemy (term)">public enemy era</a>" between <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>. Although these robbers were notorious for their bank heists, Clyde Barrow preferred to rob small stores or gas stations.</p>
<p>Though the public at the time believed Bonnie to be a full partner in the gang, the role of Bonnie Parker in the Barrow Gang crimes has long been a source of controversy. Gang members <a href="../../../w/2E/d/W.D._Jones_6abe.html" title="W.D. Jones">W.D. Jones</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Fults_5be7.html" title="Ralph Fults">Ralph Fults</a> testified that they never saw Bonnie fire a gun, and described her role as logistical.<sup id="_ref-Phillips_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phillips" title="">[1]</a></sup> Jones' sworn statement was that "Bonnie never packed a gun, out of the five major gun battles I was with them she never fired a gun." Writing with Phillip Steele in <i>The Family Story of Bonnie and Clyde</i>, Marie Barrow, Clyde's youngest sister, made the same claim: "Bonnie never fired a shot. She just followed my brother no matter where he went."<sup id="_ref-Barrow_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow" title="">[2]</a></sup> In his interview with Playboy magazine, W.D. Jones said of Bonnie: "As far as I know, Bonnie never packed a gun. Maybe she'd help carry what we had in the car into a tourist-court room. But during the five big gun battles I was with them, she never fired a gun. But I'll say she was a hell of a loader." <a href="http://www.cinetropic.com/janeloisemorris/commentary/bonn%26clyde/wdjones.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cinetropic.com/janeloisemorris/commentary/bonn%26clyde/wdjones.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>In his article "Bonnie and Clyde: <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeo_and_Juliet_141f.html" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a> in a Getaway Car", the noted writer Joseph Geringer explained part of their appeal to the public then, and their enduring legend now, by saying "Americans thrilled to their '<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_a190.html" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a>' adventures. The presence of a female, Bonnie, escalated the sincerity of their intentions to make them something unique and individual — even at times heroic."<sup id="_ref-Geringer_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Geringer" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Bonnie Parker then met Clyde Barrow while she was working as a waitress, and the two immediately became enamoured with one another. From then on she would remain a loyal companion to him as they carried out their crime spree and awaited the violent deaths they viewed as inevitable.

<p><b>Clyde "Champion" Chestnut Barrow</b> was born on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> in <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellis_County%2C_Texas_ff3a.html" title="Ellis County, Texas">Ellis County, Texas</a>, near <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telico%2C_Texas_ced0.html" title="Telico, Texas">Telico</a> just south of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a> (some sources<sup id="_ref-Barrow_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow" title="">[2]</a></sup> claim he was born in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>). He was the fifth child of seven or eight children (the census is not clear, since some of the children were not living at home) in a poor farming family. Clyde was first arrested in late 1926, after running when police confronted him over a rental car he had failed to return on time. His second arrest, with brother <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Barrow_3a0a.html" title="Buck Barrow">Buck Barrow</a>, came soon after — this time for possession of stolen goods (<a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey_%28bird%29.html" title="Turkey (bird)">turkeys</a>). In both of these instances there is the remote possibility that Clyde acted without criminal intent. Despite holding down "square" jobs during the period <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> through 1929, however, he also cracked safes, burgled stores, and stole cars. Known primarily for robbing banks, he focused on smaller jobs, robbing grocery stores and filling stations at a rate far outpacing the ten to fifteen bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow Gang. According to John Neal Phillips, Clyde's goal in life was not to gain fame and fortune from robbing banks, but to eventually seek revenge against the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> prison system for the abuses he suffered while serving time. Contrary to the image of Warren Beatty as Clyde in the 1967 film, Phillips writes that Clyde actually felt guilty about the people he killed.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_and_Clyde_3c21.html" title="Edit section: Buck joins the gang">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Buck joins the gang</span></h2>
<p>During Bonnie's time in jail, Clyde had been the driver in a store robbery. The wife of the murder victim, when shown photos, picked Clyde as one of the shooters. On August 5, 1932, while Bonnie was visiting her mother, Clyde and two associates were drinking alcohol at a dance in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringtown%2C_Oklahoma_0fcf.html" title="Stringtown, Oklahoma">Stringtown, Oklahoma</a> (illegal under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>). When they were approached by sheriff C. G. Maxwell and his deputy, Clyde opened fire, killing deputy Eugene C. Moore. That was the first killing of a lawman by what was later known as the Barrow Gang, a total which would eventually amount to nine slain officers.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, Clyde's brother Buck was granted a full pardon and released from prison. By April, he and his wife <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blanche_Barrow_41e0.html" title="Blanche Barrow">Blanche</a> were living with W.D. Jones, Clyde, and Bonnie in a temporary hideout in <a href="../../../j/o/p/Joplin%2C_Missouri_0ea9.html" title="Joplin, Missouri">Joplin, Missouri</a>—according to some accounts, merely to visit and attempt to talk Clyde into giving himself up. As was common with Bonnie and Clyde, their next brush with the law arose from their generally suspicious behavior, not because their identities were discovered. Not knowing what awaited them, local lawmen assembled only a two-car force to confront the suspected <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rum-running.html" title="Rum-running">bootleggers</a> living in the rented apartment over a garage. Though caught by surprise, Clyde, noted for remaining cool under fire, was gaining far more experience in gun battles than most lawmen. He and W.D. Jones quickly killed one lawman and fatally wounded another.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[7]</a></sup> The survivors later testified that their side had fired only fourteen rounds in the conflict.</p>
<p>Between 1932 and 1934, there were several incidents in which the Barrow Gang kidnapped lawmen or robbery victims, usually releasing them far from home, sometimes with money to help them get back.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[8]</a></sup> Stories of these encounters may have contributed to the <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythic</a> <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aura.html" title="Aura">aura</a> of Bonnie and Clyde; a couple both reviled and adored by the public. Notoriously, the Barrow Gang would not hesitate to shoot anybody, civilian or lawman, if they got in the way of their escape. Clyde was a probable shooter in approximately ten murders. Other members of the Barrow Gang known or thought to have murdered are Raymond Hamilton, W.D. Jones, Buck Barrow, Joe Palmer, and Henry Methvin.</p>
<p>The Barrow Gang escaped the police at Joplin, but W.D. Jones was wounded, and they had left most of their possessions at the rented apartment — including a camera with an exposed roll of pictures. The film was developed by the Joplin <i>Globe</i>, and yielded many now famous photos, two of which are shown above. Afterward, Bonnie and Clyde used coats and hats to cover the license plates of their stolen vehicles when taking pictures.</p>
<p>Despite the glamorous image often associated with the Barrow Gang, they were desperate and discontent. A recently published manuscript provides Blanche Barrow's account of life on the run.<sup id="_ref-Barrow_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow" title="">[2]</a></sup> Clyde was a machine behind the wheel, driving dangerous roads and searching for places where they might sleep or have a meal without being discovered. One member was always assigned watch. Short tempers led to regular arguments. Even with thousands of dollars from a bank robbery, sleeping in a bed was a luxury for a member of the Barrow Gang. Sleeping peacefully was nearly impossible.</p>

<p>In June 1933, while driving with W.D. Jones and Bonnie, Clyde missed some construction signs, dropping the car into a ravine. It rolled, and Bonnie was trapped beneath the burning car, suffering <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_degree_burn.html#Classification" title="Third degree burn">third degree burns</a> to her left leg. After making their escape, Clyde insisted that Bonnie be allowed to convalesce. After meeting up with Blanche and Buck Barrow again, they stayed put until Buck bungled a local robbery with W.D. Jones, and killed a city <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshal.html" title="Marshal">marshal</a>. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_18.html" title="July 18">July 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, the gang checked into the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Crown_Tourist_Court_7233.html" title="Red Crown Tourist Court">Red Crown Tourist Court</a> south of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platte_City%2C_Missouri_83ae.html" title="Platte City, Missouri">Platte City, Missouri</a> (now within the city limits of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a> across <a href="../../../i/-/2/I-29.html" title="I-29">I-29</a> from <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_International_Airport_a6ae.html" title="Kansas City International Airport">Kansas City International Airport</a>). The courts consisted of two brick cabins joined by two single-car garages. The gang rented two cabins near <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platte_City%2C_Missouri_83ae.html" title="Platte City, Missouri">Platte City, Missouri</a> on the evening of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_18.html" title="July 18">July 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>. Several yards to the south stood the Red Crown Tavern, managed by Neal Houser. Houser became interested in the group when Blanche paid for dinners and beer with <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_standard.html" title="Silver standard">silver</a> instead of <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Dollar_1c56.html" title="US Dollar">dollars</a>.</p>
<p>When Blanche went into town to purchase bandages, crackers, cheese, and <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atropine.html" title="Atropine">atropine</a> sulfate to treat Bonnie's leg<sup id="_ref-Barrow_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow" title="">[2]</a></sup> the druggist contacted Sheriff <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holt_Coffee_da14.html" title="Holt Coffee">Holt Coffee</a>, who put the cabins under watch. Coffee had been alerted by Oklahoma, Texas and <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> to be on the lookout for strangers seeking such supplies. The sheriff contacted Captain Baxter of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway_patrol.html" title="Highway patrol">highway patrol</a>, who called for reinforcements from <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a> including an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armoured_car.html" title="Armoured car">armoured car</a>. At 11 <a href="../../../1/2/-/12-hour_clock.html" title="12-hour clock">p.m.</a> that night, Sheriff Coffee led a group of officers armed with <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thompson_submachine_gun.html" title="Thompson submachine gun">Thompson submachine guns</a> toward the cabins. But the submachine guns proved no match for the <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle_e806.html" title="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">Browning Automatic Rifles</a> of the Barrows, who had recently robbed an armoury.<sup id="_ref-Phillips_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phillips" title="">[1]</a></sup> Although the gang escaped once again, Buck Barrow had been shot in the side of the head and Blanche was nearly blinded from glass fragments in her eye.<sup id="_ref-Barrow_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow" title="">[2]</a></sup> The prospects for holding out against the ensuing manhunt dwindled.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, the Barrow Gang was at Dexfield Park, an abandoned amusement park near <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dexter%2C_Iowa_3603.html" title="Dexter, Iowa">Dexter, Iowa</a>. After being noticed by local citizens it was determined that the campers were the Barrows. Surrounded by local lawmen and approximately one hundred spectators, the Barrows once again found themselves under fire. Clyde, Bonnie, and W.D. Jones escaped on foot. Buck was shot in the back and his wife hit again in the face and eyes with flying glass.

<p>In January <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, Clyde finally made his long awaited move against the Texas Department of Corrections. In the famous "Eastham Breakout" of 1934, Clyde's lifetime goal appeared to come true, as he masterminded the escape of Henry Methvin, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Hamilton_015f.html" title="Raymond Hamilton">Raymond Hamilton</a> and several others.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> The Texas Department of Corrections received national negative publicity over the jailbreak, and Clyde appeared to have achieved what Phillips describes as the burning passion in his life — revenge on the Texas Department of Corrections.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was an expensive revenge, for all concerned, as the killing of a <a href="http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=3663" class="external text" title="http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=3663" rel="nofollow">guard</a> (by Joe Palmer) brought the full power of the Texas and federal governments to bear on the manhunt for Bonnie and Clyde, ultimately resulting in their deaths. As the guard, Major Crowson, lay dying, Lee Simmons of the Texas Department of Corrections reportedly promised him every person involved in the breakout would be hunted down and killed.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[11]</a></sup> He kept his word, except for Henry Methvin, whose life was exchanged in return for betraying Bonnie and Clyde. The Texas Department of Corrections then contacted legendary retired manhunter and <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Ranger_Division_b0e2.html" title="Texas Ranger Division">Texas Ranger</a> Captain <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Hamer_ada0.html" title="Frank Hamer">Frank A. Hamer</a>, and convinced him to accept a commission to hunt down the Barrow Gang. Though technically retired,<sup id="_ref-Geringer_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Geringer" title="">[3]</a></sup> Hamer was the only retired Ranger in history to have been allowed to keep an active Ranger commission, as displayed in the state archives in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin%2C_Texas_6b79.html" title="Austin, Texas">Austin</a>, Texas.<a href="http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/law/hamer-warrant.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/law/hamer-warrant.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> He accepted the assignment immediately, though not as a Ranger but as a <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety_bae8.html" title="Texas Department of Public Safety">Texas Highway Patrol</a> officer seconded to the prison system as a special investigator, tasked specifically to hunt down Bonnie and Clyde, and the Barrow Gang.</p>
<p>Clyde and Henry Methvin killed two young highway patrolmen near <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grapevine%2C_Texas_8e69.html" title="Grapevine, Texas">Grapevine, Texas</a>, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a><a href="http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=9770" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=9770" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>; an eyewitness account stated that Methvin fired the lethal shots. John Treherne exhaustively investigated this shooting, and found that Methvin fired the first shot, after assuming Clyde wanted them killed (though Treherne found, and Methvin later admitted Clyde did not intend to kill them, but had been preparing to capture them and take them on one of his famous rides, and that Bonnie approached the dying officers to try to help them).<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[12]</a></sup> Having little choice once Methvin had begun a gun battle with law officers, Clyde then fired at the second officer, but Methvin is believed to have been the primary killer of both. Ted Hinton's son states that Bonnie was actually asleep in the back seat when Methvin started the gun battle and took no part in it. <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/spe/2003/bonnieclyde/story.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/spe/2003/bonnieclyde/story.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> It is notable that in accepting a pardon for these killings, Methvin admitted to both.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[13]</a></sup> These particularly senseless killings shocked and outraged the public, which to this point had tended to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_%28genre%29.html" title="Romance (genre)">romanticize</a> Bonnie and Clyde.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_and_Clyde_3c21.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>Bonnie and Clyde were killed <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, on a desolate road near their <a href="../../../b/i/e/Bienville_Parish%2C_Louisiana_4276.html" title="Bienville Parish, Louisiana">Bienville Parish</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, hideout. They were shot by a posse of four Texas and two Louisiana officers (the Louisiana pair added solely for jurisdictional reasons — see below).</p>
<p>The posse was led by Hamer, who began tracking the pair on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>. Having never before seen Bonnie or Clyde, he immediately arranged a meeting with a representative of Methvin's parents in the hope of gaining a lead. Meanwhile, federal officials —who viewed the Eastham prison break in particular as a national embarrassment to the government— were providing all support that was asked for, such as weapons. When Hamer requested <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle_e806.html" title="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">Browning Automatic Rifles</a> and 20 round magazines with armour piercing rounds, they were given to him at once despite generally being military weapons.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hamer studied Bonnie and Clyde's movements and found they swung in a circle skirting the edges of five <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwestern_United_States_9447.html" title="Midwestern United States">midwest</a> states, exploiting the "state line" rule that prevented officers from one jurisdiction from pursuing a fugitive into another. Bonnie and Clyde were masters of that pre-FBI rule but consistent in their movements, allowing them to see their families and those of their gang members. Unfortunately for them, it also allowed an experienced manhunter like Hamer to chart their path and predict where they would go. They were due next to see Henry Methvin's family, which explains Hamer's meeting with them within a month of beginning the hunt.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">May 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, the four posse members from Texas were in <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shreveport%2C_Louisiana_c251.html" title="Shreveport, Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</a> when they learned that Bonnie and Clyde were to go there that evening with Methvin. Clyde had designated Methvin's parents' Bienville Parish house as a rendezvous in case they were later separated. Methvin was separated from Bonnie and Clyde in Shreveport, and the full posse, consisting of Capt. Hamer, Dallas County Sheriff's Deputies Bob Alcorn and <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Hinton_03ce.html" title="Ted Hinton">Ted Hinton</a> (who had met Clyde in the past), former Texas Ranger B. M. "Manny" Gault, Bienville Parish Sheriff Henderson Jordan, and his deputy Prentiss Oakley, set up an ambush at the rendezvous point along Highway 154, between <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibsland%2C_Louisiana_9347.html" title="Gibsland, Louisiana">Gibsland</a> and Sailes. They were in place by 9:00 p.m. and waited through the next day (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">May 22</a>) but saw no sign of Bonnie and Clyde.</p>

<p>At approximately 10:10 a.m. on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a> the posse, concealed in the bushes and almost ready to concede defeat, heard Clyde's stolen <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Flathead_engine_0607.html" title="Ford Flathead engine">V8</a> approaching. The posse's official report has Clyde stopping to speak with Henry Methvin's father — planted there with his truck that morning to distract Clyde and force him into the lane closest to the posse — the lawmen opened fire, killing Bonnie and Clyde while shooting a combined total of approximately 130 rounds. The posse, under Hamer's direct orders, did not call out a warning,<sup id="_ref-Geringer_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Geringer" title="">[3]</a></sup> or order the duo to surrender. Clyde was killed instantly from Oakley's initial head shot. Bonnie did not die as easily as Clyde. The posse reported her uttering a long, horrified scream as the bullets tore into the car.<sup id="_ref-Hinton_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hinton" title="">[16]</a></sup> The officers emptied the specially-ordered automatic rifle, as well as rifles, shotguns and pistols at the car. According to Ted Hinton's and Bob Alcorn's statement to the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Dispatch_0210.html" title="Dallas Dispatch">Dallas Dispatch</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_24.html" title="May 24">May 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>: "Each of us six officers had a shotgun and an automatic rifle and pistols. We opened fire with the automatic rifles. They were emptied before the car got even with us. Then we used shotguns ... There was smoke coming from the car, and it looked like it was on fire. After shooting the shotguns, we emptied the pistols at the car, which had passed us and ran into a ditch about 50 yards on down the road. It almost turned over. We kept shooting at the car even after it stopped. We weren't taking any chances."<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[17]</a></sup> Following the ambush, officers inspected the vehicle and discovered a small arsenal of weapons including stolen automatic rifles, semi-automatic shotguns, assorted handguns, and several thousand rounds of ammunition, along with fifteen different <a href="../../../l/i/c/License_plates.html" title="License plates">license plates</a> from various states.</p>
<p>When later asked why he killed a woman who was not wanted for any <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital offense</a>, Hamer stated "I hate to bust the cap on a woman, especially when she was sitting down, however if it wouldn't have been her, it would have been us." <a href="http://texashideout.tripod.com/quotes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://texashideout.tripod.com/quotes.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>Both Bonnie and Clyde were shot more than 50 times. <a href="http://www.historynet.com/magazines/american_history/3026211.html?page=3&amp;c=y" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historynet.com/magazines/american_history/3026211.html?page=3&amp;c=y" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> (This number is disputed; other sources claim a total closer to 25 bullet wounds per corpse.<a href="http://www.jeffreysward.com/tributes/bonclyx.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jeffreysward.com/tributes/bonclyx.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>)</p>
<p>Part of the controversy surrounding the death of Bonnie and Clyde centers around the fact that today in the United States even in extremely dangerous situations, unless there is an immediate threat to life, the police are required to give the offenders a chance to surrender peacefully before resorting to deadly force.</p>
<p>Bonnie and Clyde wished to be buried side by side, but the Parker family would not allow it. Bonnie's mother had wanted to grant her daughter's final wish, which was to be brought home, but the mobs surrounding the Parker house made that impossible. Over 20,000 people turned out for Bonnie's funeral, making it difficult for the Parkers to reach the grave site.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[18]</a></sup> Clyde Barrow is buried in the Western Heights Cemetery, and Bonnie Parker in the Crown Hill Memorial Park, both in Dallas, Texas. The following words (from a poem of Bonnie's) are inscribed on Bonnie's stone:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As the flowers are all made sweeter</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_and_Clyde_3c21.html" title="Edit section: Controversy and aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy and aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Controversy lingers over certain aspects of the ambush, and the way Hamer conducted it. Historians and writers, such as E. R. Milner, Phillips, Treherne have turned up no warrants against Bonnie for any violent crimes.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[20]</a></sup> <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> files contain only one warrant against her, for aiding Clyde in the interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[21]</a></sup> The only claim that Bonnie ever fired a weapon during one of the gang's crimes came from Blanche Barrow, and is backed by an article from the Lucerne, Indiana newspaper on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">May 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>. No charges were ever taken out on either woman for the alleged act. By this account, Bonnie would have been firing a "<a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine gun</a>" - the only "machine gun" (fully automatic firing weapon) Clyde or any of the Barrow Gang were ever known to use was the <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle_e806.html" title="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle</a> (B.A.R.). This weapon, stolen from an armory Clyde raided, weighed 18.5 pounds unloaded, and with loaded 20 round magazine it weighed over 25 pounds, <a href="http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/browning.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/browning.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> nearly a third of Bonnie's weight. Firing up to 550 armour piercing rounds a minute, <a href="http://www.ohioordnanceworks.com/articles/06.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ohioordnanceworks.com/articles/06.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> it was a difficult weapon for even soldiers to control.</p>
<p>Historians and writers have questioned whether Hamer should have given the order to fire, without warning, prior to the car's arrival. In the years after, Prentiss Oakley is reported to have been troubled by his actions.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[22]</a></sup> He was the only posse member to publicly express regret for his actions. The posse, including Frank Hamer, took and kept for themselves stolen guns that were found in the death car. Personal items such as Bonnie's clothing and a <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxophone.html" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a> were also taken, and when the Parker family asked for them back, Hamer refused. These items were also later sold as souvenirs.<sup id="_ref-Barrow_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a grisly aftermath, the men who were left to guard the bodies (Gault, Oakley, and Alcorn) allowed people to cut off bloody locks of Bonnie's hair and tear pieces from her dress, which were sold as souvenirs. Hinton returned to find a man trying to cut off Clyde's finger, and was sickened by what was occurring.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[24]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coroner.html" title="Coroner">coroner</a>, arriving on the scene, saw the following: "nearly everyone had begun collecting souvenirs such as shell casings, slivers of glass from the shattered car windows, and bloody pieces of clothing from the garments of Bonnie and Clyde. One eager man had opened his pocket knife, and was reaching into the car to cut off Clyde's left ear."<sup id="_ref-Milner_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner" title="">[25]</a></sup> The coroner enlisted Hamer for help controlling the "circus-like atmosphere," and only then did people move away from the car.<sup id="_ref-Milner_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Ted Hinton's death, his son published an account of the ambush radically different from anything stated before. According to Hinton <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior.html" title="Junior">Jr.</a>, the posse had tied Henry Methvin's father to a tree the night before the ambush, to keep him from possibly warning the duo off. Methvin <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senior.html" title="Senior">Sr.</a>'s cooperation with authorities was a lie, according to Hinton, which Hamer came up with to keep from getting in trouble for kidnapping an unwanted citizen. Hinton Jr. claims Hamer made Methvin Sr. a deal: keep quiet about being tied up, and his son would be pardoned for the murder of the two young highway patrolmen. (Hamer did indeed obtain this pardon for Methvin Jr.) Hinton Jr. claims Hamer then made every member of the posse swear they would never divulge this secret. In his father's autobiography, the younger Hinton claimed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Ivy Methvin was traveling on that road in his old farm truck, when he was stopped by the lawmen, standing in the middle of the road. They took him into the woods and handcuffed him to a tree. They removed one of the old truck's wheels, so that it would appear to have broken down at that spot." <a href="http://www.tmethvin.com/henry/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tmethvin.com/henry/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this version is true, then Frank Hamer's actions were even more blatantly illegal. He kidnapped a man, tied him to a tree, then bought his silence by selling a pardon to his son, who murdered two highway patrolmen, and got away with it thanks to his father's leverage over Hamer.</p>
<p>Blanche Barrow's injuries left her permanently blinded in her left eye. After the 1933 shoot-out that left her husband mortally wounded, she was taken into custody on the charge of "Assault With Intent to Kill." She was sentenced to ten years in prison but was paroled in 1939 for good behavior. She returned to Dallas, leaving her life of crime in the past, and lived with her invalid father as his caregiver. She married Eddie Frasure in 1940, worked as a taxi cab dispatcher, and completed the terms of her parole one year later. She lived in peace with her husband until he died of cancer in 1969. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Beatty_c7a4.html" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> approached her to purchase the rights to her name for use in the film <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>.

<p>Bonnie and Clyde were among the first celebrity criminals of the modern era, and their legend has proven durable. Certainly Bonnie knew how to enhance the pair's popular appeal by manipulating the media, and newspapers were quick to publish her poem "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde". Her other poetry, especially "Suicide Sal", shows her flair for an <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organized_crime.html" title="Organized crime">underworld</a> <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernacular.html" title="Vernacular">vernacular</a> that owes much to the detective magazines she read avidly. According to Geringer, Bonnie appealed to the out of work and generally disenfranchised third of America shattered by the Depression, who saw the duo as a Robin Hood-like couple striking blows at an uncaring government. In an <a href="../../../a/%26/e/A%26E_Network_d385.html" title="A&amp;E Network">A&amp;E Network</a>-produced <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography_%28television_program%29.html" title="Biography (television program)"><i>Biography</i></a> on the two bandits, historian Jonathan Davis expresses a similar thought, pointing out that "Anybody who robbed banks or fought the law were really living out some secret fantasies on a large part of the public."<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The advertising industry took note of the pair's appeal. When a letter signed "Clyde Champion Barrow" was sent to the Ford Motor Company, praising their "dandy car", Ford used it in car advertisements.
