	    <p><b>Bong Mix</b> refers to a mixture of two substances (usually cannabis and tobacco) finely chopped together, which one would then place into a <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bong.html" title="Bong">bong</a> for smoking. Smoking methods and traditions vary greatly between people who enjoy smoking in this fashion.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bong_mix.html" title="Edit section: New Zealand">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New Zealand</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> the common name for this is <b>Chops</b> and is also known as <b>Roppies</b>. Usually a ratio of 2:1 of Cannabis and tobacco is put in a shot glass and chopped with scissors or small shears until fine. The finely chopped mixture, known as <b>Rop</b> is then placed in a small bowl known as a <b>Rop Tray</b>.</p>
<p>The user then collects the mixture from the rop tray straight into the cone (which has no gauze) and smokes the contents through a bong (known as a <b>Chop Bong</b>) in one hit, sucking the ash through into the bong as well, so it is ready to pass to the left for the next person to do the same. This process is called <b>Ropping</b>.</p>
<p>Though a lot of cannabis users in New Zealand like to mix their goods with tobacco, the preferred method of smoking is straight cannabis.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bong_mix.html" title="Edit section: Australia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Australia</span></h2>
<p>I do agree with this fine statement that has been placed here. In Australia we call these "chops" or "roppies" as "mix", "cones" and "sessions". Ratio can very much to the people you are smoking with and also to the skill of the person chopping. Normal ratio varies form 40% tobacco to 60% but it is common to have some one "brown out a mix" by adding to much tobacco which is very unpleasant, this is called "down town brown".</p>
<p>The bong always varies from glass made bongs to springa's to bop chongs. These all work on the aspect of having no gauze but vary in size material and stem and cone set up. Glass bongs brought forma a shop are called galssies and vary very much. Springa’s are plastic PVC hosing of aprox 6cm diameter which seals onto a Spring Valley bottle. this has a slot cut init to slide in the stem and cone piece piece. Bop chongs are home made and can some times be extremely ghetto if not made correctly. Genuine bop chongs are made from 600ml aprox plastic bottle of choice, garden hose, a gasket of wet paper towel held down by laka bands and a cone. Some don’t opt for the gasket to cool down the cone which makes the cone heat up which can burn for fingers when packing up.</p>
<p>This mix is chopped up or "mulled" by some one who is determined by a game of shotgun not with the loser having to chop and the smoking order determined by the person left of the chopper. This person in turn smokes the first cone to start off the round. The weed is mulled in the "Mulley" which is a hand rotated spice chopper 5$ from the local supermarket, chopped by hand or placed in a coffee grinder. This is the process called mulling up. Once mulled it is placed in the bowl ready for smoking.</p>
<p>Mean while the next loser from the game of shotgun not has to clean the bong which is called a service. This is done before any major session while some one is chopping up.</p>
<p>Once the mix is ready and the first cone is smoked it goes round to the left going round the room with each person handing it on to the next. On a new entry to the session they can be granted a bong which is 'called packing up a bong' each person has a lighter Val crowed to the seat, wall, couch that they are sitting on or next to. In the bowl is a thin rod of some description called a stokey which is used to clear the whole in the cone as it has no gauze and needs to be cleared after vigorous use. The bong and mix will go round the room being passed on till everybody pass's on the round or the mix runs out. Then it's time to mull again.</p>

<p>This is a form of bong hitting used in the UK, mainly in the Isle of Man, and more specifically in Ramsey especially around the mooragh park and beach area. After mixing the toasted tobacco and grated/finely chopped Cannabis in a 'mix dish'. A small conepiece (with its wide end slightly wider than the stem being used and its narrow end considerably smaller), is filled with the mixture and is screwed onto the end of the stem. This type of cone has a fairly small hole at one end and does not require a gauze.</p>
<p>Use: Cannabis is chopped until very fine, or grated if hashish, then mixed with toasted tobacco (Tobacco which has been heated usually with a lighter or a microwave till a fine powder) so that the 'mix' will burn rapidly. (Some users also prefer the 'buzz' and/or the 'hit' that the cannabis/tobacco mix brings.) The mix is then placed in the cone and ignited while the user sucks slowly (it is best to keep the ignition source on the mix for as short a time as possible in order to keep the heat of the smoke to a minimum) until the entire surface of the mix is burning. The user will then suck as hard as he/she can, pulling the burning material into the bong below it and thus igniting it, until all the mix has been pulled through the narrow end of the cone. The hithole is then released, allowing user to inhale all the smoke, and to get the massive hit.</p>
