<dd>That's right, he and I had an exchange on the Christianity page and his contributions appear to fit that impression. I'll add him. I've been wondering if it might be a good idea to select a few pairs of user characteristics that could be listed on a user's page. These characteristics would be continually calculated by how other registered users measure the user's contributions to the site. Maybe I'll make a proposal after some more thought. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoNoMoJo_c7e6.html" title="User:BoNoMoJo">B</a></dd>

<p>What's the building behind the Alamo (if you know)? I heard there was development all around it. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">--KQ</a></p>

<dd>I don't recall. The Alamo is right in the middle of downtown San Antonio so there are lots of buidings around. Another interesting feature of San Antonio is the River Walk; the Paseo del Rio winds through San Antonio lined with restaurants, stores, etc and people sitting outside enjoying themselves. It's quite a lively, fun place at night.

<p>Re: LDS. It was not my intention to use "revisionist" as a word of judgement. I meant it as an accurate representation--- In retrospect, the word "corrective" would be more accurate. I have no particular contention with the Church; I do believe there should be an up-front notation that LDS is not a traditional Christian denomination.

<p>Hello, thanks for the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chichen_Itza_787a.html" title="Chichen Itza">Chichen Itza</a> images. A question, though: do they seem dark on your monitor? Some of them are quite dark on mine, and I wondered if that was your intention. Not one to "push" photos unless asked, <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, sorry, I didn't mean to criticize you. First, especially between macs and PCs (in my experience, anyway), what looks great on one screen can look too dark or too light on another. And, second, I take a lot of dark, heavily saturated photos myself, on purpose, and they sometimes get "pushed" when I drop them off at some developer's. Pushing a photo just means that you develop it as if it were a different speed than it is. If you shot some or all of a roll as a stop or more below what it should be to meter correctly, the developer can leave it in longer so the photo is lightened. It weakens color intensity but brings out more detail; it also brings out a lot of film grain. I've had it happen more than once, never when I asked for it. Speaking of which, there's an article! I think I still have the photos for it, even. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a>

<p>Hi BoNoMoJo, thanks for your note. I think you raise a very good point. In fact, it's one that I intended to bring up with the other people who do the aircraft pages, as I think that there is good reason to consider adopting a convention. I can find no evidence that there actually <i>is</i> a convention, however. If there is, then it's a secret one that does not appear in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>, and is largely honoured in the breech.

The proper name to use for the U-2 is a bit of a puzzle: it's just about always called "Lockheed U-2" or just plain "U-2", and the latter seems too short and ambiguous to be practical. Either, however, is superior to the asinine "Dragon Lady" - which in any case is so little used that I don't think I'd ever heard of it until yesterday (and I'm not unfamilar with aircraft names in general or the U-2 in particular).</p>
<p>This leaves a question hanging: should we adopt a convention for aircraft names? And if so, what one? I'll bring this up in a more appropriate place a little later on. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 17:08 Feb 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many special page functions have been disabled for much of each day for performance reasons. Page counters have been eliminated from at least en.wiki due to their very significant performance hit (there is talk about relacing the dumb page counter with something smarter based on access logs). When the performance issues are fixed then the special pages will be available for longer periods (perhaps all day). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 23:19 Feb 7, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re: a recent <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_text.html" title="Sacred text">Sacred text</a> edit</p>
<p>(This is purely my own opinion/conclusion...) Wouldn't it be more accurate to just say LDS believe the Bible or Christian Bible? English speaking members definitely use the KJV, but what about other languages? In French, for example, they use the Louis Second.</p>
<p>If the Church specifically canonized the KJV, then why not translate the KJV into other languages? I think it's more accurate to say that the church believes in an "ideal" Bible that happens to not be on Earth, so it approves versions from among the most faithful versions available. Let me know what you think. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintessent_512b.html" title="User:Quintessent">Q</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm having second thoughts on this because I'm sure the Church has taken a vote to canonize the KJV as part of the "standard works". The members know though that the KJV is far from perfect, and Joseph Smith himself preferred the German version to the KJV. Your point about other translations is still valid, of course. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoNoMoJo_c7e6.html" title="User:BoNoMoJo">B</a> 19:54 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, B. Can we chat a little here about the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_controversies_087d.html" title="Book of Mormon controversies">Book of Mormon controversies</a> page? I have a definitely apologetic bent, and so I am a little mystified by some of your reactions to my attempts to organize the page.</p>
<p>A little history: I'm a way new Wikipedian, but a few months (?) ago the whole BofM thingie was a mess. It was way beneath the dignity of an encyclopedia. So I dived in an made some brave and foolhardy changes, some of which were good, including a massive reorganization of the Book of Mormon controversies page, which had digressed into, quite simply put, a mud-fight. In my mind the Book of Mormon controversies are really quite simple. One of these times I might summarize them in the vernacular on the talk page. The current hierarchy of the Controversies page is my doing, so you can talk with me about the idea.</p>
<p>One of the problems in converting the mud-fight into a respectable article was that some of the arguments seemed way out in left field. For example, what does the current LDS teaching on the Godhead have to do with the BofM? Nothing. Nevertheless, I am only foolhardy and not a masochist or a vandal, so I kept all the arguments and tried to dress them up respectably. One of the Wiki principles I read is that absurdity sometimes is best displayed by treating it respectably in an article. So I tried stating the obviously foolish premise behind the arguments: Some critics claim that the light treatment of BofM by LDS casts doubt on BofM. And so forth with other more tenuous connections on the page.</p>
<p>You might notice and agree that the current page hierarchy also begs the question of why critics have not spent more time developing their preferred explanation for the origin of BofM. The hierarchy makes it clear that the following vernacular argument is at the root of all BofM controversy.</p>

<dd>That Joe Smith and his Gold Bible! You know as well as me that there weren't any angels nor gold plates. Never been such a thing since the Bible. You know old Joe was a gold digger and never could hardly read or write. Who knows where he got that book, but did you ever hear such cockamamie stories? Chariots, horses, Jesus in America, generals and captains. And it isn't even written in correct English. I even heard it says the Indians are lost tribes of Israel. Gufawwww!! In any case, I wouldn't pay any attention to it. Those Mormons have made 561.362 changes since it came out word for word from Old Joe Smith. And they still don't believe in it. Did you know it says in two places God hates polygamy? Har Har Har. I doubt old Joe could have written anything himself. He probably got one of his educated buddies like Cowdery or Rigdon to write it for him, and I'll bet he couldn't even think of an original story--probably stole half from the Bible and half from some other books nobody ever heard of.</dd>

<p>Having said all the above, I would ask you to reconsider the tone you used in calling into question my edits. And would you be interested it exploring this idea further? --Hawstom</p>

<p>Hi. Could you take a look please at some of the recent additions to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israelite.html" title="Israelite">Israelites</a>, particularly regarding the Mormon perspective. I don't know enough about it to comment, but it seems like something you could fix.

<p>B, thanks for reversing the edits on the LDS Church of Christ page, but now the first paragraph has ended up as a hack job again. In trying to accomodate edits, I'm afraid we've ended up with a most un-encyclopedia-like first paragraph/sentence. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Hawstom</a> 23:25, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>B, I saw you added that list of controversial ex-Mormons or Mormon critics, and it reminded me of a book I read years ago. I can't recall her name, but htought I'd ask the question to see if it jogged your memory: who was the woman who fell out (quite publicly) with the LDS Church over feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment? I thought of adding her name to the list, but can't recall it, and yet I seem to remember she even has an appropriately small WP article. Anyway, just thought you might remember where my brain is faulty.&#160;:) Best wishes, <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 23:18, 6 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, B. I'm back for some light editing, as you may guess. RE: "Mormon Church", I think "<a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn?stage=1&amp;word=chagrin" class="external text" title="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn?stage=1&amp;word=chagrin" rel="nofollow">chagrin"</a> is too strong of a word. Also I wonder if readers will just be puzzled about why there are things like "Mormon Tabernacle Choir" but "Mormon Church" is offensive. It's a useful topic, but I'm not sure we can do it justice in the title paragraph without bogging it down. Thoughts? <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintessent_512b.html" title="User:Quintessent">Q</a> 04:41, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
