The Cast of Bonanza</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The cast was very popular with viewers. <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorne_Greene_0fee.html" title="Lorne Greene">Lorne Greene</a>, known as the "Voice of Canada", was a fairly successful announcer, actor and drama coach in his native land. Ben Cartwright, as Green once described him, was "suede leather", as he was both a strong and soft patriarch. Greene recorded several <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_album.html" title="Record album">record albums</a> in character as Ben Cartwright, scoring a #1 hit with his dramatic spoken word performance of "Ringo". Pernell Roberts, considered the best singing voice among the cast, recorded an album "Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies" which contains folk ballads.</p>
<p>Pernell Roberts, was a familiar face in 1959 Hollywood, but preferred the legitimate stage. He left the series in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> after a long running dispute with series writers (Roberts argued that a 33 year old Eastern educated Adam would not call his dad, "Pa") and creator David Dortort. Attempts to replace him were made by introducing Ben's stepson, Clay, (played in one episode by Barry Coe) and a nephew Will (played by <i><a href="../../../z/o/r/Zorro_%28TV_series%29_0bfc.html" title="Zorro (TV series)">Zorro</a></i> star <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Williams_bc19.html" title="Guy Williams">Guy Williams</a>), but neither lasted. In 1967, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Canary_1551.html" title="David Canary">David Canary</a> joined the cast as "Candy" Canaday, a confident army-brat turned cowboy, who became the Cartwrights' foreman. The character vanished in 1970 after Canary himself had a contract dispute with Dortort.</p>
<p>In 1970, 14-year-old Mitch Vogel joined the series as <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Hunter_Cartwright_5e7a.html" title="Jamie Hunter Cartwright">Jamie Hunter</a>, the <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphan.html" title="Orphan">orphaned</a> son of a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainmaker.html" title="Rainmaker">rainmaker</a>. Ben <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adopt.html" title="Adopt">adopted</a> Jamie in a 1971 episode.</p>
<p>In 1972, after the sudden death of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Blocker_f2cb.html" title="Dan Blocker">Dan Blocker</a> from a post-op blood-clot, the show was moved to Tuesday nights against a new <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> sitcom, <i><a href="../../../m/a/u/Maude_%28TV_series%29_8bff.html" title="Maude (TV series)">Maude</a></i>. Both events signaled the end of the program. Canary returned to his former role of Candy (to make up for Blocker's absence), and a new character named Griff King (played by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Matheson_61ce.html" title="Tim Matheson">Tim Matheson</a>) was added. Griff, accused of killing his heavy-handed step-father, was paroled into Ben's custody and got a job as a ranch hand; several episodes were built around his character, one Matheson never had a chance to fully develop before the show's sudden demise in January 1973. Many fans felt that the Hoss character was essential, as he was a nurturing, empathetic soul that brought some balance to the all male cast.</p>
<p>During the later years of the series, Michael Landon began writing and directing episodes of Bonanza.</p>
<p>From the third season on, the Cartwrights and nearly every other recurring character on the show wore the same clothing in almost every episode! This was done to cut the cost of refilming action shots (such as riding clips in-between scenes), as previously-shot stock footage could be reused.</p>

<p><i>Bonanza</i> was brought back as several made-for-television movies featuring Cartwright offspring. These include <i>Bonanza: The Movie</i> (1988), <i>Back to Bonanza</i> (1993), <i>Bonanza: The Return</i> (1993), <i>Bonanza: Under Attack</i> (1995), and <i>Bonanza: The Next Generation</i> (1995).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonanza.html" title="Edit section: The Prequel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Prequel</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, there was an attempt to revive the series' ideas with a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prequel.html" title="Prequel">prequel</a>, <i><a href="../../../p/o/n/Ponderosa_%28TV_series%29_5453.html" title="Ponderosa (TV series)">Ponderosa</a></i>, with a pilot directed by Kevin James Dobson and filmed in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. Covering the time when the Cartwrights first arrived at the Ponderosa, it lasted 20 episodes. The prequel had less gunfire and brawling than the original. Bonanza creator <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Dortort_0494.html" title="David Dortort">David Dortort</a> approved PAX TV's decision to hire Beth Sullivan, a producer from <a href="../../../m/e/d/Dr._Quinn%7E_Medicine_Woman_59cb.html" title="Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman">Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman</a>, which some believe gave the series a softer edge.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonanza.html" title="Edit section: Theme Song">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theme Song</span></h3>
<p><i>Bonanza</i> also featured a memorable <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_music.html" title="Theme music">theme song</a> by <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Livingston_2e92.html" title="Jay Livingston">Jay Livingston</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Evans_51ad.html" title="Ray Evans">Ray Evans</a> that is often <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodied</a>. Lorne Greene and the cast recorded versions of the song with lyrics. Although the Bonanza theme is one of the best known pieces of made-for-television music, it was not used for the entire run of the series. A new theme song was written in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> by episode scorer <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rose_f88b.html" title="David Rose">David Rose</a> and replaced the oft-remembered tune for seasons twelve and thirteen. A new arrangement of the original theme returned for the fourteenth and final season. The <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_House_on_the_Prairie_%28TV_series%29_b73f.html" title="Little House on the Prairie (TV series)">Little House on the Prairie</a></i> theme (also by Rose), can be heard first in a 1971 episode of "Bonanza". The overture for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_High_Chaparral_74bb.html" title="The High Chaparral">The High Chaparral</a></i> composed by Harry Suckman can be heard briefly at the start of the 1966 episode <i>"Four Sisters from Boston"</i>.</p>

<p>A handful of episodes of the series are in the public domain, and some TV showings of these episodes on low-budget stations and networks (and also on low-budget public domain DVDs and VHS tapes) substitute the familiar theme music for generic music.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> licensed the syndication rights to the series to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Telefilm_Associates_c845.html" title="National Telefilm Associates">National Telefilm Associates</a>, which changed its name to Republic Pictures in the 1980s (by then part of the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Spelling_a498.html" title="Aaron Spelling">Spelling Entertainment</a> organization). Select episodes ("The Best of Bonanza") were officially released in North America in 2003 on DVD via then-Republic video licensee <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artisan_Entertainment_6bf1.html" title="Artisan Entertainment">Artisan Entertainment</a> (which was later purchased by <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lions_Gate_Films_defd.html" title="Lions Gate Films">Lionsgate Home Entertainment</a>). Today <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_Paramount_Television_4231.html" title="CBS Paramount Television">CBS Paramount Television</a> handles television distribution, while Paramount Home Video (whose parent company Viacom purchased Republic in 1998) now has home video rights via CBS DVD, though an official DVD reissue has yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Bonanza Ventures, Inc. grants merchandising and licensing rights worldwide. One of its licensees is the magazine, Bonanza Gold, which features detailed information about the show, including interviews with actors and other production personnel, articles about historical events and people depicted in the series, fan clubs and fan fiction.</p>
