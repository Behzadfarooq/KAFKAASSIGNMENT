<p><i>In which we encounter our protagonists, witness a stunning betrayal, &amp;c.</i></p>
<p>The novel begins at 2102 Pine St, Philadelphia. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Fairfield_Osborn_5b3a.html" title="Henry Fairfield Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> is introducing <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_R._Knight_ab3d.html" title="Charles R. Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> to <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Drinker_Cope_7789.html" title="Edward Drinker Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a>, a paleontologist whose entire house is filled with bones and specimens. Cope is commissioning a painting, something to "catch the spirit" of the sea creature <i><a href="../../../e/l/a/Elasmosaurus.html" title="Elasmosaurus">Elasmosaurus</a></i>. Cope then leaves for the West, as the official scientist form the U.S. Geological Survey. On the way, he meets <a href="../../../o/t/h/Othniel_Charles_Marsh_e3bc.html" title="Othniel Charles Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, a fellow paleontolgist, and shows him his dig site at a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marl.html" title="Marl">marl</a> pit in New Jersey; after Cope leaves, Marsh talks to the owner of the land and pays him off to gain exclusive digging rights. At Fort Bridger, <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, Cope meets Sam Smith, a helper to the USGS. During excavations, Cope finds some of the richest bone veins ever. Sending back carloads of dinosaur bones east by train, Cope encounters Marsh, who is also heading out west. Marsh convinces Smith to covertly plant an <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apatosaurus.html" title="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a> skull where Cope will be sure to find it.</p>
<p>Marsh now travels west, lounging in coach while the rest of his team travels third class- Marsh even berates them for playing cards, saying it is “low class” and that Yale graduates should look more presentable. At Fort McPherson, <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, Marsh meets ‘’Buffalo” <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cody_cc6b.html" title="Bill Cody">Bill Cody</a>, who serves as their guide, along with the native American Indian tribe. Marsh discovers many new fossils, and promises to Chief Red Cloud that he will talk to the President about the situation of the Native Americans- they have been given spoiled food in exchange for their land. Red Cloud doubts that the “Bone Medicine Man” will help them, but realizes that there are few others to turn to.</p>
<p>Back East, Knight has finished his reconstruction of <i>Elasmosaurus.</i> He and Knight return to the marl pits of New Jersey, but are forced away. Cope becomes furious and storms away when he learns Marsh has bought the digging rights, and published a paper revealing his interpretation of <i>Elasmosarus</i> flawed.</p>

<p><i>In which we learn of means of acquiring and disposing of fortunes, said means being known to scientists and scoundrels alike.</i></p>
<p>Later and back west, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bell_Hatcher_53d7.html" title="John Bell Hatcher">John Bell Hatcher</a> is leaving a card table, gun drawn. He has taken to gambling, as Marsh, who employs him as a bone hunter, is not providing him with enough funds. Along with Smith, who is continuing to double-cross Cope. Meanwhile Marsh is lobbying to the Bureau of Indian Affairs on behalf of Red Cloud, but also visiting with the Geological Survey and President U.S. Grant, insinuating that he would be a better leader than Cope. After learning about Smith's actions and once again receiving no payment from Marsh, Hatcher leaves the employ of Othniel. Marsh, now representing the survey, heads west with wealthy businessmen, scoffing at the financial misfortunes of Cope, whose investments have failed.</p>
<p>Cope travels with Knight to Europe; Knight with the intention to visit Paris zoos, Cope with the intent of selling off much of his bone collection. Cope has also spent much of his funds buying <i>The American Naturalist</i>, a paper in which he plans to attack Marsh's dealings. Hatcher arrives in New York to talk about the find <i><a href="../../../l/a/e/Laelaps.html" title="Laelaps">Laelaps</a></i>; in his speech, he subtly hints at the folly of both Marsh's elitism and backstabbing as well as Cope's collecting obsession. Cope and James Gordon Bennet, Jr, arrive in Washington later to discuss Marsh; Marsh arrives later, and is chastised for the bad press and expense he is bringing to the survey by pursuing his "birds with teeth" theory. Cope returns to the west for more fossils, at the expense of his health.</p>

<p><i>In which two of our protagonists make a great deal of noise, meet defeat at their own hands, &amp;c.</i></p>
<p>Later, Marsh is attending a conference on telephony hosted by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Graham_Bell_395d.html" title="Alexander Graham Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>; it is here he learns that his USGS expense tab (to which he had been charging drinks) has been withdrawn, his publication has been suspended, and that the fossils he found as part of the USGS are to be returned to the Survey. His colleagues now shun him, and he is forced to go to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phineas_T._Barnum_2472.html" title="Phineas T. Barnum">Phineas T. Barnum</a>, an entertainer, to try and obtain a loan.</p>
<p>At the same time, Osborn and Knight arrive at Cope's residence; Cope has died of illness. The funeral is markedly pitiful, with only a few <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quakers.html" title="Quakers">Quakers</a> and the two friends in attendance. Cope has bequeathed his remains to science, and requested to have his bones considered for the <i>homo sapiens</i> <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lectotype.html" title="Lectotype">lectotype</a>.</p>
<p>Back at Marsh's 'wigwam', Marsh rejoins his guest, Chief Red Cloud, who is examining Marsh's luxuries, including a telephone, a chimney, and various bones and antiquities. Red Cloud's interest is piqued by a long tusk from a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastodon.html" title="Mastodon">Mastodon</a>, which the Shawnee call Yakwawi'ak. The Shawnee have an ancient legend, which Marsh relates. At one time there were giant men proportionate to the mastodons. However, when the great men grew few, the Great Spirit decided to destroy the Yakwawi'ak himself. All but one bull was killed; this last mastodon fled north, where he remains to modern times. In exchange for the loss of the Mastodon, the Great Spirit created the cranberry, a bitter reminder of the blood spilled. Chief Red Cloud remarks that it is a true story, but Marsh rebukes him, saying that science tells modern man that his ancestors were smaller, not larger, than him. Red Cloud, on his way out, responds. "But it is not a story about <i>science</i>. It is about <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>All the characters in the graphic novel are real figues from history; in addition to the prominent paleontologists, <i>Bone Sharps</i> also features other important historical figures from the Gilded Age.</p>

<li><a href="../../../o/t/h/Othniel_Charles_Marsh_e3bc.html" title="Othniel Charles Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> - Rival to Cope, Marsh was a <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale.html" title="Yale">Yale</a>-educated scholar who disdained what he called "the publicization of science." His sizable fortune granted him favor and status in politics and society. By the end of <i>Bone Sharps</i>, Marsh is seen to have lost favor with the science world at large for his excessive means to acquire fossils; nonetheless, he "defeated" Cope by discovering more new species.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_R._Knight_ab3d.html" title="Charles R. Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> - A famous painter of the twentieth century who created numerous paleontological pieces (the dinosaurs on the cover are based on Knight's painting <i>Leaping Laelaps</i>).

<li><a href="../../../p/2E/t/P.T._Barnum_c023.html" title="P.T. Barnum">P.T. Barnum</a> - American showman, famous for his <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoaxes</a> and for founding the <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringling_Brothers_and_Barnum_and_Bailey_Circus_36e0.html" title="Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus">Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus</a> later in life.

<p>While the majority of <i>Bone Sharps</i> is true and all of it is based on history, the author acknowledged several differences between real events, and certain artistic licence taken. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charles Knight did not meet Cope until much later in his career. In addition, his autobiography states that it was reporter William Horsea Ballou who introduced the two, not Osborn.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>There's no evidence of Marsh and Knight ever meeting.</li>
<li>Ottoviani makes up Marsh's lobby to Congress and what happened during his meeting with President Grant.</li>
<li>Cope probably never recognized that Marsh had misidentified <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brontosaurus.html" title="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>.</li>
<li>Editor James Gordon Bennet, Jr. never lobbied with Cope, and never exposed Marsh's will.</li>
<li>P.T. Barnum never told off Marsh the way he did in the comic.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>Ottoviani wove the story Marsh tells about the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastodon.html" title="Mastodon">Mastodon</a> from several different versions of the legend.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>Cope's bones never ended up in New York.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
