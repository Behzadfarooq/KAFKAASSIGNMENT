<p>Each game of <i>Bonkers</i> came with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a gameboard</li>
<li>four pawns</li>
<li>a stack of cardboard track cards</li>
<li>a score card with plastic peg markers</li>
<li>four large "Go to Lose" cards</li>
<li>two <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dice.html" title="Dice">dice</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The board consisted of a 55-space looping track. Most of these spaces had an outline of a track card next to it, the cards being played throughout the game; there were also three "Score" stations (one of which doubled as the starting point), a "Lose" space, two track spaces marked "Go to Lose", and one space marked "Back 15".</p>
<p>As the original <i>Bonkers</i> was produced in the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, the board and game pieces accordingly had a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disco.html" title="Disco">disco</a> styled text and motif. When <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Bradley_Company_3323.html" title="Milton Bradley Company">Milton Bradley</a> revived the game in the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, the board was made to appear as if the entire track and logo were made out of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modeling_clay.html" title="Modeling clay">modeling clay</a>; a few humorous caricatures of human faces (also made from clay) were placed in the logo and on the board as well. The game was also given a fluorescent color scheme, updated <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typeface.html" title="Typeface">fonts</a>, and different styled dice and pawns from the original.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonkers_%28board_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay (Parker Brothers version)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay (Parker Brothers version)</span></h2>
<p>The game started with each player being dealt four track cards and a large "Go to Lose" card, and placing their pawns on the scoring space marked "Start". On a turn, a player rolled the dice, and moved the corresponding number of spaces shown. If the space was empty, the player placed one of his cards in the outline next to that space; if already occupied by a card, the player followed the instructions on that card. A player's turn ended when he landed on a space marked "Score" (scoring 1 point), the space marked "Lose" (deducting one point), or on an unmarked space after he had already played one card. At the end of a turn, the player drew another card, and the next player took his or her turn.</p>
<p>Most of the track cards had a number between 1 and 12, as well as the direction for the player to travel. The track was a loop; as pawns traveled counterclockwise along the loop, "ahead" cards moved the pawn accordingly, and "back" cards moved clockwise. Other cards included "Roll Again", "Go to Nearest 'Score'", "Go to Start", and "Exchange Cards" (in which the player swapped the Exchange card for any other card currently on the track.)</p>
<p>If a space was occupied by another pawn, the player rolled again after drawing a new track card.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonkers_%28board_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Scoring">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scoring</span></h3>
<p>The object of the game was to play track cards in a way that directed one's pawn to a "Score" space, upon which the scorekeeper moved that player's peg ahead one point. A player could also score by rolling a 12, or by means of "Entrapment". If the player's pawn ended in a continual loop (for example, ahead 2/ahead 3/back 5), that player was said to be "trapped", at which point his or her pawn was left on one of the "ahead" spaces, and the player scored one point.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonkers_%28board_game%29.html" title="Edit section: The Lose Space">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Lose Space</span></h3>
<p>There was one space on the board marked "Lose". If a player landed on this space, he or she lost one point, and his or her turn ended immediately (even if the space was already occupied by one or more pawns.) There were two spaces on the back side of the track that also sent the player directly to "Lose". In addition, each player had a large "Go to Lose" card; at any point in a player's turn, an opponent could use this card against that player to force him or her to go to the Lose space immediately. Once a large "Go to Lose" card was played, it was removed from the game. At no time could a player's score drop below zero.</p>

<p>The first player to score 12 points won the game.</p>

<p>When Milton Bradley began producing <i>Bonkers</i>, there were several minor rules changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards marked "Exchange Cards" could now only be switched with a track card directly to the left or to the right of the Exchange card.</li>
<li>Entrapment was now referred to as "Going Bonkers"; if a player got caught in a loop, he moved his pawn ahead to the nearest Score space (instead of the "ahead" card) and scored one point.</li>
<li>The "Go to Nearest Score" card was replaced with a "Go Ahead to Score" card (possibly to reduce ambiguity in the game.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than these small changes, and the cosmetic update to the game, <i>Bonkers</i> remained virtually unchanged from the first version.</p>
