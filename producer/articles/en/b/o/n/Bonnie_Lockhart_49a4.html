<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Lockhart_49a4.html" title="Edit section: Fictional character history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fictional character history</span></h2>
<p>Bonnie Lockhart is an attractive woman, a single mom to Mimi and her siblings since being abandoned by her husband. Bonnie is a smoker who's been trying to quit for years. She wears a nicotine patch, but lights up a few minutes after she puts it on. She is jealous of all the families in Salem whom she perceives as luckier than she is: the Bradys, the Hortons, the DiMeras. She speaks ill of them behind their backs, but lays on the charm when she's in their presence. Her relationship with her daughter Mimi is a loving one, although Mimi sees through her mom's victim act and is disapproving of her schemes.</p>
<p>Bonnie's always had plenty of ambition, but never any luck and she resents the hell out of it. She feels life is unfair to her and her children and she's always searching for a way to improve their lot, as long as it doesn't take a lot of effort on her part. She cleans houses for a living, but is always working on a get rich quick scheme. She will drive miles and miles to play Mega Power Ball, even if she doesn't have the money for gas. She has tried many a self-help seminar in hopes of a way to turn her life around, but never follows through. But this happy-go-lucky schemer never blames herself; she always has an excuse, always feels she's done everything right and it's life that is letting her down.</p>
<p>After pursuing Mickey Horton relentlessly, Bonnie was thrilled when she finally got him to propose. She hurried him to the altar, convinced that if she didn't they would never marry. As they returned back to the house after the wedding, they were greeted by Maggie, Mickey's first wife, back alive from the dead. But rather than feel threatened, Bonnie felt only confident. Because Maggie had been declared legally dead, her marriage to Mickey was null and void, so Bonnie was the only legal Mrs. Mickey Horton. The three live together in the house, but Bonnie is determined to be Mickey's only wife.</p>
<p>When her daughter Mimi came to her telling her she was pregnant, Bonnie encouraged her to get an abortion, telling her that having children too young would ruin her life (like she felt it had ruined hers), but when Mimi developed an infection after the abortion that rendered her infertile, Bonnie was devastated. Things went from bad to worse when Mimi was arrested for assaulting Jan Spears and sentenced to spend years in prison! Luckily Mimi was soon exonerated by a video showing she was nowhere near Jan at the time of the accident, but Bonnie didn't get much chance to enjoy her daughter's freedom before Mickey told her that he had decided to return to Maggie.</p>
<p>Once Mickey ousted her from his life, Bonnie immediately went back to scheming for a new man and found herself very interested in a newly-single Roman Brady. However Roman was never interested in her.</p>
<p>Bonnie Lockhart soon became deeply involved with the revelation of the true paternity of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_Kiriakis_f9f5.html" title="Claire Kiriakis">Claire Kiriakis</a>, the supposed daughter of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belle_Black_e530.html" title="Belle Black">Belle</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Kiriakis_b4b3.html" title="Philip Kiriakis">Philip Kiriakis</a>. In fact, Claire was the daughter of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawn-Douglas_Brady_fc45.html" title="Shawn-Douglas Brady">Shawn Brady</a>. Belle's pregnancy was the result of a chaotic night in which Belle and Shawn were caught in a barn fire and had sex with each other for the first time. Because of the trauma of the night, both forgot about it.</p>
<p>Claire needed a live-saving transplant, but a blood test revealed that Philip was not a match. However, Shawn and his little brother Zack both were. This information was discovered by <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Roberts_%28fiction%29_38a1.html" title="Kate Roberts (fiction)">Kate Roberts</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Kiriakis_2f0f.html" title="Victor Kiriakis">Victor Kiriakis</a>, Bonnie, and her daughter Mimi, who was Shawn's wife at the time. Bonnie pleaded with Mimi to keep the truth of Claire's paternity away from Shawn; she believed that the news would drive Shawn back to his first true love, Belle. Mimi reluctantly agreed and continued the charade for many months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mimi and Shawn agreed to try and have a baby through in vitro fertilization and by using a surrogate. Coincidentally, Belle and Philip were going through the same thing at the same time. In the hospital, a mysterious "gloved hand" switched samples, causing Belle's egg to be fertilized by Shawn, and Mimi's by Philip. Neither Philip nor Mimi wanted their baby and signed away the rights to the surrogate. Without their knowledge, Bonnie approached the surrogate, Lauren, and agreed to pay her off in order to reclaim the baby after she had given birth. Lauren continued to extort massive amounts of money from Bonnie, causing Bonnie to steal much of it from Patrick.</p>
<p>Months later, Mimi and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Brady_d3e1.html" title="Max Brady">Max Brady</a> were kidnapped and locked in the basement of an old church. While there, they discovered a skeleton clad in a Civil War uniform. Surprisingly, the body turned out to be Bonnie's ex-husband, David. Bonnie admitted to killing David in self defense after he attacked her one night in a drunken rage. However, after new evidence was revealed, she revealed to Mimi and Max that Mimi had killed David with a baseball bat blow to the back of the head. Overcome with grief, Mimi woke up the next morning not remembering the episode. Bonnie went along with it, inventing a story that Mimi's father had abandoned them. Hearing this news, a distraught Mimi left town, convinced by Bonnie that she should go to <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, lie low, and watch over Conner.</p>
<p>Currently, Bonnie is still the prime suspect in the death of David Lockhart. She intends to take the blame to protect Mimi from going to prison. Also, the Lockhart/Kiriakis baby Bonnie was trying to reclaim has not yet been born.</p>
