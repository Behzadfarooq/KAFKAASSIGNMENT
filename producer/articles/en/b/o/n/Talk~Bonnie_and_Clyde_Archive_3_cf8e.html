<p><a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> Reasonable enough. I have only two sections that I think there is any significant controversy on, and I stand by the wording and sourcing presently in those sections. Those two sections, and issues, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) <b>the level of participation of Bonnie Parker in the "Barrow Gang" crimes</b>. Everyone has conceded there were no warrants for murder out for Bonnie, and the surviving gang members, with the exception of Blanche, claimed she never fired a shot, and her role was limited strictly to "logistical support." Blanche's claim she fired on a crowd is backed by a newspaper clipping, BUT, no one from that supposed crowd ever filed even a police complaint! Realistically, no one can tell me that two women used automatic rifles on a crowd of people, wounded some, and NOT ONE SOUL ever filed even so much as a complaint, let alone took out a warrant?</li>
<li>2) <b>The order by Hamer to fire on Bonnie Parker without warning is undisputed. Also undisputed is that in recent years historians such as Milner have questioned the legality of that order. (Ted Hinton questioned it, as did other posse members, at the time!) Further, in Milner's book, pages 145-147, describe the aftermath of the ambush, a scene from hell, as people cut off locks of Bonnie's bloody hair and her clothes, and a man tried to cut off Clyde's ear. Hamer was too busy talking to people to stop this until the coroner asked him.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Some folks have implied that putting these facts in an article on Bonnie and Clyde implies sympathy for Bonnie -- not so. They imply only that wikipedia is an encyclopedia with an obligation to recite the facts as best we know them. Bonnie level of actual participation is an important facet of the article on Bonnie and Clyde, and the horror of the ambush is also vital to the article. I think the two sections, on Bonnie and her level of participation in the crimes, and the ambush and it's aftermath are good sections, well sourced, and factually and legally accurate. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 16:18, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>comment</b> Interesting enough wiki is a place for many facts, however I remember reading that there are actually instances that exist where some people will argue that it may not belong in the article. WP:NPOV actually says that "regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not;" an extremely small view should not be in wikipedia. The idea here is to know on whether it belongs in the article or not because of it's predominant status (acceptance) in our society. I think an article that we should evaluate could be the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust#Cruelty" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust#Cruelty" rel="nofollow">Cruelty</a>. I'm not sure if that is the best example but it could be a good start. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Fairness_and_sympathetic_tone" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Fairness and sympathetic tone</a> should be observed. This being said I would avoid using terms such as "a scene from hell." However.... heading down into <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Characterizing_opinions_of_people.27s_work" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Characterizing opinions of people's work</a> you may be able to leave such a comment. It must be well <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> sourced criticism. It is important for the construction of the article and for people understand who is saying this! Summary: determine the importance and see if it is a viewpoint held by a Majority, a minority or an extreme small minority. If it the 2 first then we should include according to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. I would suggest placing it in a section that where it won't be contradicted right away. That means if there is another controversial view then I would put that in its own well sourced section. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 03:32, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> Hi Pat! You are right about the phrase "scene out of hell" which is why it is NOT in the article. I think actually that Kate, and then Kelly, did an excellent job rewriting the article, preserving those issues I thought important, while giving it less of a POV outlook. In short, you are right on that phrase, and i would never add it to the article, it is just my personal opinion, which has NO PLACE in the article. I think most people agree with the current way the article is presented, and the facts are certainly correct. I have stood aside and let others rewrite, and like the result. Pat, even at the time of their deaths, almost half the country did not agree - if you believe the histories - with the way they were ambushed, and the aftermath, especially considering Bonnie was not wanted for murder. But you are right on the wording. "Scene out of hell" should be reserved for Auswitz or Treblenka. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:29, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I restored it, and ask you to look at it, and see whether the section needs removal. He eliminated all the sourcing for the ambush, the scene after the ambush, what the coroner saw, etc. Would you take a look, when you have a chance? THis is complete revision of the article, and needs to be discussed before just eliminating months of work. If it is a majority view - okay, I can live with consensus, but this was just wholesale elimination without mentioning it on the talk page. I asked the user to come here and discuss such wholesale changes, instead of simply eliminating whole sections, when those changes are strongly disputed, as these are. I am sure she meant to improve the article, but i don't honestly believe that happened, instead, large amounts of vital information were simply deleted from the article without discussion. SO, to quote Pat, lets talk about it!</p>
<ul>
<li>He eliminated the entire section on what the coroner saw after the ambush, and the heavy sourcing that went into that, and eliminated the section of controversy in masse. I don't honestly believe this is a majority user or historical view;</li>
<li>He eliminated mention of Hamer's press conference, and all of the sourcing on the ambush itself, again, I don't believe that is the majority user or historical view;</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance for looking at that section...(you and Pat can look at it, and decide!) Would one of you put the page under protection till such wholesale revisions can be discussed? <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 11:29, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I read this article for the first time, last night. It's a good article, except for the POV pushing on the late Bonnie Parker's behalf.</dd>
<dd>To paraphrase:</dd>
<dd>It was a really, really bad thing to shoot Bonnie Parker. Frank Hamer was a mean man. Bonnie never killed any body. The posse didn't give Bonnie and Clyde a chance to give up. It was against the law to shoot Bonnie. Frank Hamer liked to break the law. The posse shot Bonnie and Clyde without fair warning. Today, what the posse did would be against the law. The posse stole guns and did not give them back. It was a really, really bad thing to shoot Bonnie Parker. Bonnie never shot any body.....</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I simply replace what I saw as a long-winded, repetitive, POV push section with a simple, two paragraph statement, at the end of the 'Death' section.</dd>
<dd><i>Controversy lingers over whether Bonnie Parker should have been killed, and whether the first shot, fired into Clyde Barrow's head by <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prentis_Oakley_17c0.html" title="Prentis Oakley">Prentis Oakley</a> with a borrowed Remington Model 8, was too hasty. Oakley is reported to have been haunted for the rest of his life by his actions that day. He was the only posse member to publicly express remorse or regret for his actions.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some of the posse, including Frank Hamer, took and kept for themselves stolen guns that were found in the death car, with the approval of Lee Simmons.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that just about covers it. But I'll let other editors decide on the content of the article. I would recommend; avoid long-winded, redundant, POV pushing statements.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">my response</span></h2>
<p>I appreciated your coming and discussing this semi-rationally. You paraphrased it one way, now here is mine:</p>
<p>Bonnie Parker was not wanted for any capital crime at the time of her death. In fact, a study of the various jurisdictions the Barrow Gang committed crimes in showed no warrants for her at all for any of the major crimes committed. The Posse which staged the ambush protested to Frank Hamer, in charge of the ambush, that it might be legally wrong, and they had serious reservations about shooting a girl from ambush not wanted for any serious crimes. Frank Hamer did indeed have a reputation, one he himself bragged about, for not caring about the nicities of the law, like having a warrant before shooting people. He then allowed people to cut the bloody clothes and hair off of a dead girl before a horrified cororner asked him to control the crowd, and to cap it off, held a news conference and bragged about it.</p>
<p>The Posse took not only guns, but all the personal possessions in the car, many stolen from people, and not only refused to give them back, but sold them.</p>
<ul>
<li>you sarcastically imply it is just sporty to shoot a girl not wanted for a single major crime 130 times and then let people cut off her bloody hair and clothes for souvenirs, which they sold. Golly, let's not talk about that! You are right, let the editors decide. I think your version a whitewash of what was an open disgrace to law enforcement. I also invoke POV on your version, which I believe is just as biased, ignoring sources, and generally wrong. I would avoid deleting what actually happened that day - the ambush - and instead whitewashing it with a POV that wants to hide the truth. Kate and Pat, it is in your hands. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 20:08, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with my <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> I urge Kate and Pat to be bold in editing this, and I know they will be, Kate certainly was in my article on Frank Hamer.</li>
<li>As to whether controversy lingers over the ambush -- read John Treherne's book, or E.R. Milner's, or <i>Ambush</i> by Ted Hinton. <b>ALL question the events surrounding the ambush, especially the horrendous aftermath, Milner, 146-7.</b> Even online, In his article "Romeo and Juliet in a Getaway Car" Joesph Gerringer writes of the ambush: "But, Hamer chose not to call out a warning -- not to Bonnie and Clyde...in a voice audible only to those around him, void of drama, void of malice, Hamer ordered, "Shoot!" Also in Hinton's book, the best source on the ambush, he makes clear Hamer had ordered firing without warning no matter what happened prior to the car's arrival,AND that the posse had great reservations about that!</li>
<li>My2cents would edit this out." <b>I agree with My2cents that the issue is: do we use the books which plainly state the facts about the ambush, the questions the posse had in firing without warning, or do we whitewash and make Hamer a hero, something he was eager enough to do in his lifetime. She would like to eliminate the language that Milner used in describing people cutting bloody locks of the dead girls hair. I think those facts important!</b></li>
<li>I know the editors will be bold and fair. She states one sentence sums up our differences, and she is right, and obviously has not read the horde of books which question shooting down someone with no warrants on them with no warning. This is not making Bonnie into little susie sunshine, this is asking <b>WHETHER OR NOT THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY MEAN SOMETHING, TO EVERYONE, EVEN FOOLS SILLY ENOUGH TO RIDE WITH PSYCHOPATHS - HAVE WE ABOLISHED WARRANTS AND DUE PROCESS OF LAW?</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree long winded statements are to be avoided - but not at the cost of whitewashing the truth away, and deleting facts a user finds unpleasant. It is up to the editors! <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 22:13, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interesting</span></h2>
<p>Another look should be taken at the Ambush party as a whole. I believe it was Ted Hinton In "Ambush" that told of the position of each man, the order in which they stood when they fired. Law enforcement has progressed in the last seventy two years in that if the incident would have happed today, the posse members would have been skilled sharpshooters, a S.W.A.T. team of sorts. After the first shot into the side of the primary suspects head, the others might converge and arrest the hysterical woman suspect. Not so here, after the first shot was fired the others "reared back " and fired. The lead men in the group firing intentionaly at the face of the passenger. Today, this behavior would be seen for what it is/was, an illegal execution. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a></p>
<p>Oakley did indeed kill Clyde with the first shot - and Hamer ordered firing on Bonnie anyway, thogh Ted HInton made clear in his book, as all other accounts of the ambush, much of the posse objected. John Neal Phillips wrote a fascinating piece that makes clear that the death of both Bonnie and Clyde - with no trial, judge, jury, or even warrant on Bonnie - was part of a promise that a Texas prison official had made to the dying guard Joe Palmer had murdered during the famous Eashtam prison break. He literally promised to get them, and had Hamer do so. This story is in article form but is online at <a href="http://historynet.com/ah/bleastham/index2.html" class="external free" title="http://historynet.com/ah/bleastham/index2.html" rel="nofollow">http://historynet.com/ah/bleastham/index2.html</a> from an article written by John Neal Phillips and originally published in October 2000 issue of American History Magazine. This explains, as <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> pointed out above, the cold blooded and illegal execution of Bonnie Parker. Hamer himself bragged of this in the interview he gave the day of the ambush. (see the article for the sources) As <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> pointed out above, this ambush does deserve a long and hard look in the Bonnie and Clyde article. I also point out the aftermath scene as described amply before in Milner's book - again, while this may be long, it is vitally important to the history, which is why wikipedia exists, to enclyclopedia the historical facts. I stress again that this does not make Bonnie some saint, but the fact she was not on any warrant, and we had due process in this country, even during the great depression, should not simply be whitewashed out.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 04:14, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> did not wait for the editors involved in this article, and simply rewrote it his way, eliminating all mention of the aftermath of the ambush, and all discussion fo the role of Bonnie Parker in the gang. I did not revert the changes, but added a section on Bonnie's involvement in the Barrow Gang - which had been eliminated in toto from the Bonnie section, and reinstated enough of the facts about the ambush to give an accurate picture of what happened. I left most of the edits intact, since he did, in fact, cut out a lot of repeat language. By adding the additional section, becuase the role of Bonnie Parker in the gang had just been edited by two other users before my2cents simply decided to eliminate it without discussion, I was able to put this vital information in the article, without a revert war. As to the ambush, I added several paragraphs, including one on Ted Hiinton's afterdeath confession that the posse tied up Henry Methvin's father, and only got him to agree not to press charges by promising to get a pardon for his son for the terrible murder of the two highway patrolmen near <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grapevine%2C_Texas_8e69.html" title="Grapevine, Texas">Grapevine, Texas</a>, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>.

I prefer to try to work with people, when possible, and discuss issues in articles, as Palmdogg or Smec and I have done with the Battle of Tours, for instance. I see it is not possible to discuss things with you, and won't try. It was meant in good faith.

<ul>
<li>the extent of Bonnie Parker's involvement with the Barrow Gang - My2cents wants to eliminate all language and sourcing involving the extent of her involvement with the gang. I do agree some was redundent, but the issue itself is vital to the article, and needs to be incorporated. I don't care whether it is in the Bonnie section - where it was when Ewulp was making some good edits the other day, or in the new section I created, after My2cents unilaterally decided this issue did not need to be in the article. I believe the majority of users, and certainly the majority of historians, in fact, ALL of them, believe her involvement was more limited than publicly thought, and this needs to be in the article. The wording can be anyway you two decide.</li>
<li>the aftermath of the ambush. That is so heavily sourced as to not require defense. As Randazzo56 said the other day, the ambush, and it's aftermath, almost deserve an article of their own, those issues are so important! (especially given the relatively recent uproar over Ted Hinton's posthumous declaration that the posse had tied Henry Methvin's father to a tree, and to placate him, and avoid criminal charges, Hamer agreed to get his son a pardon for the killing of the two highway patrolmen, which he did - this really cannot be ignored, nor can the scene at the ambush site as Milner describes in page 147 of his book)</li>
</ul>
<p>To simply delete both, and whitewash what happened, is POV with a vengence. I trust you both, you have been working on this article, and I believe you will resolve it fairly. I ask <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocentsnot</a> to unilaterally delete whole sections and let the editors decide. I will abide by your decisions, certainly. So far, the only comments on the talk page do indicate these are important issues, which need to be in the article, though perhaps not in the present form.

<p><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> I do assume good faith - and I also judge the page as I find it. I prefer not to make disputes personal, and I appreciate that you have not made this one personal. I simply strongly disagree with your truncated article, not because of any bad faith, but because you are rewriting history. EVERY historian who has written about the Barrow gang has emphasized two things, (especially John Treherne, and E.R. Milner, generally regarded as the best of the group)</p>
<ul>
<li>the limited involvement of Bonnie in real life as opposed to the public perception;</li>
<li>the incredible horror of the ambush scene, particularly well pictured by Milner on page 147 of his book;</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you deleted all mention of the relatively new controversy about Ted Hinton posthumous revelations concerning the bargain Hamer allegedly made with Methvin's father. (and considering Hinton's reputation, such charges have to be taken seriously!). With all respect, I don't believe you cleaned up the article - though I do agree that you eliminated a lot of unnecessary language and statements made repeatedly -- but eliminated history you don't agree with personally. That is POV, and other editors need to examine it, especially since your version flies in the face of EVERY book on the gang. I do believe you cleaned up some unnecessary and repetitive language, but to use a colloquial phrase, you threw the baby out with the bathwater! When such a dispute exists, as here, then the editors who were already working on the article, in this case, Katefan0 and CyclePat, should look at the dispute, and the sourcing, and decide whether the clean up was revisionist history. I do assume you believe you are correct - I also believe that every history of the gang and the ambush proves you wrong. I have to say I find it ironic that you remind me to assume good faith - one of the foremost tenets of good faith is "Consider using talk pages to explain yourself, and give others the opportunity to do the same. This can avoid misunderstandings and prevent problems from escalating." This was what I attempted to do, leaving a courteous message explaining the historical problems of your revisions. They simply delete historical fact.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:17, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">User:Katefan0</a> I Respectfully disagree with my2cents. I state again, the couple of sentences he proposes are themselves POV, ignore all the accepted historians, and sourcing now in the article - even Pig (who is quite mad) agreed with the importance of these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>the limited involvement of Bonnie in real life as opposed to the public perception -- he leaves out all the sourcing, and pretty much eliminates the major controversy historians have been examining the past half century!;</b></li>
<li><b>the incredible horror of the ambush scene, particularly well pictured by Milner on page 147 of his book, which by POV he deletes in toto;</b></li>
<li><b>In addition, he deleted all mention of the relatively new controversy about Ted Hinton posthumous revelations concerning the bargain Hamer allegedly made with Methvin's father. (and considering Hinton's reputation, such charges have to be taken seriously!).</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The couple of sentences proposed by My2cents are themselves heavily POV in that they reduce the vital issues of Parker's involvement - and more importantly, because of the controversy, the sourcing for same! - and the ambush, and again, the sourcing for same, to a about 25 words. That is absurd, and a POV attempt to delete information vital to the article. He leaves out the vast bulk of the information, like 95%, all the sourcing, and doesn't mention the Hinton controversy (his posthumous revelations) at all. <b>His version does NOT make the point without undue weight to a POV, it is a POV by it's rewriting and deleting sourcing and history. His cleanup is not a cleanup, it is a POV rewrite to delete facts - like the ambush aftermath, and the historians view of Parker's role in the gang - he does not like.

<p>Hello all--I've been watching this article from the sidelines for a while &amp; attempted some edits. I claim no expertise on B&amp;C and only tried to reduce POV and redundancy of sources all saying the same thing in the "Bonnie's Role" section. The same information--no warrant for murder for Bonnie--is given again in the highwaymen section, and I think repeating it over &amp; over makes the article sound like a defense attorney working a jury.</p>
<p>The section is still unsatisfactory; the matter of Blanche vs the newspaper story is mush--Where did this incident happen, which newspaper &amp; date? And the book titles could be eliminated in favor of footnotes (I'm working on learning footnoting). I invite those who have the books to check this edit over because in rephrasing I may have introduced factual mistakes--and that newspaper bit needs help.<a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 02:14, 19 March 2006 (UTC) "Only known warrant" is a problem too--Known to whom? This probably needs a footnote if it's going to stay.<a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 02:37, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> Welcome! You are certainly right about the newspaper article section needing rewriting. The incident occurred on May 12, 1933, - Lucerne, Indiana: a Bank robbery in which the town was supposedly shot-up. The town newspaper is the one that carried the story. The problem with it is that no warrants for Bonnie or Blanche, who supposedly did the shooting, were ever issued. I can give you an online confirmation on that article, <a href="http://www.afterthebattle.com/bonnie&amp;c.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.afterthebattle.com/bonnie&amp;c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.afterthebattle.com/bonnie&amp;c.htm</a> The warrant issue is a little more complex: John Treherne and E.R. Milner, among others, trying to ascertain what the actual role Bonnie had in the gang - as opposed to the public personna the media had of her being Clyde's equal in crime, went to the various jursidictions the gang supposedly had crimes in, looking for warrants for Bonnie Parker. The only one known to exist federally as of the date of the ambush, May 23, 1934 - Ambush at Gibsland, Louisiana was one issued federally. (Treherne and Milner don't mention that warrant in their book, because it was federal, it was not a capital offense, and they were looking for murder warrants primarily in that context). For that warrant, the record of it as the only one in the FBI's database is at <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/clyde/clyde.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/clyde/clyde.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/clyde/clyde.htm</a> I agree much of this could be done by footnote. The issue has been what exactly was Bonnie's role in the various murders, robberies, et al - and to the best of the knowledge of historians like Treherne and Milner, plus testimony from gang members like W.D. Jones, was that she was strictly logistical support - like helping him move a stolen car across state lines, as in the federal warrant! I am going to eliminate the second mention of no warrants as soon as I post this, and straighten up the Lucerne issue in the article, and I hope this answered some of your questions, and welcome to the Bonnie and Clyde site, your interest and help are welcome! The two issues primarily remaining to be resolved are what exactly - as best it can be reconstructed through the historians and records -was Bonnie's actual role in the gang's activities, and the aftermath of the ambush, which frankly, was horrible. Your help, or anyone else's, with questions, facts, or sources, is welcome. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 02:56, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> I have requested, as you can see at the bottom of the page, arbitration from several editors who are not involved with this dispute. You did the same wholesale deletions from the Frank Hamer article, which Editor Katefan0 had rewritten. I restored her version, and ask for arbitration on both these articles, since you are, in my opinion, simply POVing the articles with your own positions -- for instance, you do not dispute in any way the information on the aftermath of the ambush of Bonnie and Clyde, or the fascinating claims by Ted Hinton that Hamer traded a murderer a pardon for not being charged for kidnapping a citizen before the ambush, or the numerous sources outlining the specifics of Parker's involvement with this gang. Given that, I have requested arbitration, and ask that you refrain from further deletions, as I will refrain from further editing, on either article, leaving Hamer's as Kate left it, and this article as is, until the other editors review this issue. You have no right to inflict your POV on all users, ignoring history in the process, and deleting wholesale work done by an editor (Kate on Frank Hamer) just because you don't want people reading about the aftermath of the ambush. Equally, I have no right to inflict my POV - so let us wait and let the requested editors examine the EVIDENCE and render a decision. If you simply deep deleting, I will just mark it as disputed, and it will go on and on - this is not wikipedia's way! Since you will not discuss the history - why should the Hinton revelations and the coroner's observations of the ambush scene not be in the articles? Wh should Ralph Fults and W.D. Jones statements on Bonnie's involvement with the actual gunfights be striken? You have never said. What are your sources? In the interim, I propose we wait for arbitration.

I rewrote that section so it was not much bigger to accomadate the suggestion from Ewulp -- a good one -- that the section needed source citing, which i did. As far as condensing the information to two sentences, I will simply slap a POV dispute on your two sentences. ANOTHER EDITOR - not you, who has shown that you don't care or understand the historical issues involved -- needs to check the article. At no point have you disputed the information as being invalid, or historically wrong, you just want to get rid of it. Wikipedia does not work that way. Here things are done by consensus, and where, as here, you have a complete disagreement, editors NOT INVOLVED examine it, and resolve it. Also, you have reverted twice. these are the issues you are ignoring, or attempting to delete out:</p>

<p>mY2CENTS will be in violation of the three revert rule shortly, and again, because he wants to present a particular point of view, not because he has any case that the information is historically wrong. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">User:katefan0</a> help! This person does not dispute the historical accuracy of the information in question, he merely wants to present a particular viewpoint. NOT ONE USER has posted supporting him. I have appealled to Katefan0, an editor who knows this page well, has edited my article on Frank Hamer, which is related, which my2cents also screwed up without any sourcing for his POV changes, and unlike Katefan0, is not interested in historical accuracy, at no point has he disputed the accuracy of the information he seeks to delete. He simply wants to whitewash the ambush, and hide the horror of the aftermath fo that scene, and hide the research done on the extend of the involvment of Bonnie Parker in the Barrow gang crimes. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 12:04, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Oldwindybear is right, there is enough here for a seperate article. One thing to avoid would be to try and "sum-up" these details in one or two sentences, as if to shift attention elsewhere. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> 3-19 2:50 P.M.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> I could not agree with you more. The absolute worst thing we could do to this article is what My2cents is proposing, which is try to sum up the ambush in a couple of sentences. And all that kind of 2 sentence summing would do would be to whitewash the ambush - which as <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> has also pointed out, could not been more of a mess. The sharpshooter, Oakley, killed Clyde with the first shot. The rest of them could have trotted down and arrested Bonnie with ease. Or at least yelled "throw out any gun and get out with your hands up!" What they should not have done, and did, was fire 130 rounds at her! Then let people chop off her bloody hair and clothes. But I could not agree with <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> more that we need to reach consensus on the ambush - which brings me back to what facts does My2cents dispute? Then we can talk about rewriting. The WORST POSSIBLE THING to do would be to try to sum up as My2cents proposes, without ever saying what facts he would delete - and why! <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 20:07, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

We have a situation with this article, and the one on Frank Hamer, that requires arbitration. Katefan0 went to a great deal of work to rewrite my article on Frank Hamer - and did a good job of fairly presnting the evidence on the aftermath of the ambush of Bonnie and Clyde, and teh questions about the extent of Bonnie Parker's involvement with the gang. She also addressed the new questions Ted Hinton has raised with his posthumous publication of the claim concerning the bargain Hamer allegedly made with Methvin's father. (according to Hinton, a man whose word cannot be lightly dismissed) the conventional belief that Methvin betrayed Bonnie and Clyde was not so. According to Hinton, the posse, at Hamer's order, tied the elder Methvin to a tree, and in order to get him not to press charges on them, agreed to get his son a pardon for murdering the two highway patrolmen Henry Methvin and Clyde had killed. My2cents has deleted all this without any discussion, without any sourcing, simply in a POV effort to whitewash Hamer. This article, and the one on Hamer, which I restored to the one Katefan0 wrote, need arbitration, so that in the interim, My2cents cannot unilaterally impose his POV on wikipedia. I request arbirtation, or the two of you, or CyclePat, (Kate, since she wrote teh version My2cents deleted on Frank Hamer) examine the evidence, and not allow wholesale deletion for the sake of POV.

<dd>The <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Hamer_ada0.html" title="Frank Hamer">Frank Hamer</a> page already had parts of it commented out, by another editor ( BTW <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a>, we are <b>all</b> editors).

<dl>
<dd>Mytwocents at no point have you said what is historically inaccurate in the section on the aftermath of the ambush, or in the section on Bonnie's involvement. For a consensus, please start citing FACTS you see which are wrong and need deleting, not just saying "two sentences will do." That won't do, you need to cite FACTS WHICH ARE WRONG, AND NEED DELETING THEREFORE.</dd>

<li>Are you disputing that E.R. Milner wrote of the scene the coroner reported?</li>
<li>Are you disputing people cut off pieces of Parker's clothes and hair, blood soaked, and sold them as souvenirs with Hamer looking on?</li>
<li>Are you disputing that Ted Hinton posthumously claimed that Hamer literally kidnapped Henry Methvin's father, tied him to a tree, and made a deal to avoid kidnapping charges, that he, hamer, would obtain a pardon for Methvin's son for the highway patrolmen murders, in return for the elder Methvin's silence?</li>

</ul>
<p>I also urge all wikipedians to be bold and resist the kind of personal viewpoint that My2cents is trying to force down your throats without even offering one scintilla of evidence that any of the sections he seeks to delete are historically inaccurate! I have asked for arbitration on these two articles because I will boldly resist any person's personal view of history when it is based on a rewrite without citing facts in need of revision. It appears you seek to whitewash the ambush, and eliminate facts from the article. This kind of revisionism must be resisted. Wikipedia is a wonderful repository of FACTS - not opinions! <b>The Bonnie and Clyde page you left was a complete POV mess, and i would have tagged it so, but it already was.</b> I have asked real editors, not just contributers like you and myself to arbitrate this since you offer no history, no sources, no proof, just your desire to delete facts from the articles. I am sorry you cannot see that this is not just wrong, but censorship of the worst kind, because you won't even offer any historical facts or sources to justify your chopping good articles to bits to reflect your own POV. <b>I have asked you over and over, cite facts!</b> <b>Tell us what FACTS are wrong in the paragraphs you would seek to delete. You refuse to do so.</b> You say your versions are solid and good, I respectfully disagree and think they destroy the article and hide the truth. By the way, i agree, we write by consensus - but you make no effort to cite what FACTS are wrong, and not one person has written in support of your chopping the articles to pieces. If you will show me FACTS which are wrong, we can start talking about what needs deleting! Some of your edits I left intact because they eliminated repetitive language. <b>But to delete facts wholesale, you must show those FACTS TO BE WRONG, and you have not done so.</b> old windy bear 19:29, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If the gentlemens facts are correct, which they are, how can one consider deleting these facts? The more in detail and factual the article, the better for Wikipedia. Ive been reading books on this subject since the movie came out, and Ive found more factual information then all scources with the exception of "texashideout.com", right here on Wikipedia.

<dd>The issue isn't deleting facts, but consolidating rambling prose into concise sentences. We can state a fact once, to make a point.

We need to avoid revisionism and POV pushing. BTW, the B&amp;C page <i>survived</i> without much of what has been trimmed out for a long time, so <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">Old windy bear</a> please spare me any histrionics about removing factual statements.

<p><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> Sir, the blunt fact is you just admitted <b>NOT ONE of the facts in the article are wrong.</b> What undue balance can there be to the fact that there were, or were not, warrants for someone? What undue balance can there be in citing what the coroner observed after the ambush, or what Ted HInton said about it? There is none. Respectfully, you use those phrases verbally but not in your writing. I don't object to anyone rewriting if they do a better job, as long as the current facts are kept intact. ALL of the current facts are heavily sourced, as you would know if you had read the books, visited the cited sites, etc. And the reason the language was used on removing facts was that your revisions were removing facts, period, loads of them. There were no histrionics but a genuine demand - shared, you may notice, by other users, that you cease trying to delete facts wholesale. And respectfully, your own revisions show that was precisesly what you were doing. Here is your proposed wonderful revision compared to what is there presently: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&amp;diff=44378752&amp;oldid=44331821" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&amp;diff=44378752&amp;oldid=44331821" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bonnie_and_Clyde&amp;diff=44378752&amp;oldid=44331821</a> These are the facts you delete, period, and anyone can see it:</p>
<ul>
<li>that E.R. Milner wrote of the scene the coroner reported;</li>
<li>that people cut off pieces of Parker's clothes and hair, blood soaked, and sold them as souvenirs with Hamer looking on;</li>
<li>that Ted Hinton posthumously claimed that Hamer literally kidnapped Henry Methvin's father, tied him to a tree, and made a deal to avoid kidnapping charges, that he, hamer, would obtain a pardon for Methvin's son for the highway patrolmen murders, in return for the elder Methvin's silence;</li>
<li>that only one warrant exists for Parker in the FBI database;</li>
<li>the facts John Treherne and Milner wrote about Parker's lesser role in the gang than was generally believed;</li>
<li>the sworn testimony of other gang members who said Parker did not participate in the gang's gun battles;</li>
</ul>
<p>Your own citations show that all these facts were deleted in your proposed revision. And great effort was made, by consensus, through many users/contributers, to reach this point in the article. You talk to me as though you were some superior historian, but Sir, you show no knowledge of the facts of this article, or Frank Hamer's. You may prepare all the revisions you wish, if they don't include all the facts presently in the article, other people will take your advice to be bold, and POV your revisions. In other words, while you condemn my writing, I frankly think it far superior to yours - but other users will decide which version best serves wikipedia! Finally, when you rewrite articles wholesale, it is considered good form on wikipedia to "Consider using talk pages to explain yourself, and give others the opportunity to do the same. This can avoid misunderstandings and prevent problems from escalating." This was what I attempted to do, leaving courteous messages explaining the historical problems of your revisions. They simply delete historical fact. When other users took your advice adn boldly opposed your wholesale deletions, you attempt to deny what is plainly in the proposed article: a truncated version of what occurred, with half of the article deleted for no good reason. That is the plain documented truth. Next time try talking to people, reaching a consensus means "a group or cooperative decision." It does not mean you simply delete facts wholesale and ignore everyone else.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 20:53, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>I</b> wrote this paragraph;
<dl>
<dd><i>Controversy lingers over certain aspects of the shooting. Should Bonnie Parker's life have been spared? Should Hamer have ordered to fire without warning, no matter what happened, prior to the car's arrival? Should <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prentis_Oakley_17c0.html" title="Prentis Oakley">Prentis Oakley</a> have fired the first shot without warning, into Clyde Barrow's head? Oakley is reported to have been haunted for the rest of his life by his actions that day. He was the only posse member to publicly express regret for his actions. Should the posse, including Frank Hamer, have taken and kept for themselves stolen guns that were found in the death car? These questions have been asked since the day of the ambush.</i></dd>

<dd>As can be seen, my rendition covers <b>most</b> of what was written before, but with <b>much</b> fewer words. You simply tacked on the old stuff, making the page even more redundant. I think piling on facts serves no purpose. Citations cover the need for further information. I have shown good faith, but you have accused me of bad faith, and you say I shouldn't make changes without approval. I've said, when I find the time, I will edit this page for NPOV and clean-up the text. I will try to incorporate more of your facts.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> At least we are discussing possible changes, which is an improvement. The fact is though, the facts you were deleting were not repetitive. You cited your paragraph - but it does not include:</p>
<ul>
<li>that E.R. Milner wrote of the scene the coroner reported;</li>
<li>that people cut off pieces of Parker's clothes and hair, blood soaked, and sold them as souvenirs with Hamer looking on;</li>
<li>that Ted Hinton posthumously claimed that Hamer literally kidnapped Henry Methvin's father, tied him to a tree, and made a deal to avoid kidnapping charges, that he, hamer, would obtain a pardon for Methvin's son for the highway patrolmen murders, in return for the elder Methvin's silence;</li>
<li>that only one warrant exists for Parker in the FBI database;</li>
<li>the facts John Treherne and Milner wrote about Parker's lesser role in the gang than was generally believed;</li>
<li>the sworn testimony of other gang members who said Parker did not participate in the gang's gun battles;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not redundent facts, piling on, but separate and very important facts. NONE OF THEM WAS IN YOUR PARAGRAPH. I am glad you will try to incorporate them, and I would much rather work with you, assuming good faith, than arguing. If you will check the Battle of Tours, or Charles Martel, you will see great articles written primarily by Smec and myself, together, with consensus from a wide variety of contributers. This is our goal here. I have given credit to you -- from the first edit you made -- that you eliminated much redundent language. But the specific facts listed above are not redundant, especially the three crucial issues that define this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>the real extent of Bonnie Parker's involvement as opposed to popular perception;</li>
<li>the absolute horror of the ambush, which today would involve all involved being charged with murder and associated civil rights violations;</li>
<li>the posthumous accusations made by Ted Hinton that Frank Hamer tied the elder Methvin to a tree, and then traded a pardon for his son, who had murdered two poor highway patrolmen, to avoid prosecution. This is particuarly vital (actually, all are vital - but is particuarly relevant to a fair presentation on Frank Hamer; as a user edited today, (and accurately) "an eyewitness account stated that Methvin fired the lethal shots" - yet <b>Hamer got him a full pardon for these horrific murders, and according to Hinton, published posthumously, the pardon was plain payoff for the elder Methvin not filing charges on Hamer for kidnapping him the night before the ambush!</b>I prefer to effectively start anew, ask that you incorporate these vital facts, continue to eliminate redundent language - where it truly is redundent, for instance, the article only needs to say once that no reputable historian believes Bonnie ever killed anyone, nor were there any warrants for her for murder. So let us go forward, instead of backward. I do believe both of us share the same goal: the best, most informative, article for wikipedia.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 21:50, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

He said Methvin shot the first officer, Clyde shot the second, but Methvin finished him off. Neither was supposed to be shot, Clyde had meant to take them on one of his famous "runs" where they carried them off, dropped them off later, usually with money, after Bonnie took some pictures. But Methvin got antsy, and shot them instead. And for this, Hamer got Methvin a complete pardon in return for old man Methvin not pressing kidnapping charges -- according to Ted Hinton's explosive posthumous revelations about the ambush. Good add. THANKS!

<li>the facts John Treherne and Milner wrote about Parker's lesser role in the gang than was generally believed;</li>
</ul>
<p>and in the Bonnie's participation in the gang section:</p>
<ul>
<li>the sworn testimony of other gang members who said Parker did not participate in the gang's gun battles;</li>
<li>that according to other posse members, like Hinton in Ambush, they were uneasy about firing on a woman, and argued with Hamer that a warning should be given, it was his direct order to fire without one, and keep firing once Clyde was dead;

</li>
<li>research showing she likely was not involved in any of the gang's killings but was limited to logistical support in the major crimes</li>
</ul>
<p>I am willing to agree to trim the Hamer article if - as you say you will - the information stays in this one. I rewrote the Bonnie involvement section to cut out unnecessary language, and rewrote the aftermath section - but every fact there in those sections needs to stay, especially if we agree that the Hamer article is trimmed because those facts are here.

<dl>
<dd>I removed the 'totaly disputed' tag from the page. I think the 'cleanup' and 'NPOV section' tags for 'Bonnies role' and 'The Aftermath' sections cover any remaining issues.</dd>
<dd>I know that 'The Aftermath' section is meant to illuminate the killing of Bonnie and Clyde, but I don't believe Ted Hinton's story; that Hamer kidnapped Henry Methvin's father, then made a deal to get Methvin off, to avoid kidnapping charges... It seems silly, on it's face. Every other author has said that Methvin's father set the duo up in exchange for getting his son off on the charge of murdering the two highway patrolmen. That's plausable. Hamer delivered.</dd>
<dd>But like I said, I'm taking a go-slow approach. I'm fine with the page as it is, with the section tags showing where some improvement in <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> may be made.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> I am happy with the compromise we have reached. I believe you have been fair to lift the totally disputed, and leave the minor tags to show people there is some disagreement. As to the story on Hamer and Ted Hinton's son, that has to be included although I, (like you, believe it or not!) have my doubts. Let me explain why. Wikipedia does not allow you or I to delete relevant facts because our opinions say we do not believe them. The explanation Ted Hinton's son gave is reasonable on it's face (for every other author not knowing the true story), that Hamer made every member of the posse swear none would reveal the truth as long as anyone of them was alive. Hinton was the last, and when he died, he released the story through his son. You have to understand that Ted HInton is a revered figure in Texas law enforcement history, and any story he wrote, adn released through his son - also a respected figure - has to be at least carried as part of the article. Personally, I tend to agree with you simply because Hamer was not the bargaining type - it would have been more likely for him to say to the elder Methvin, "do this or die." But my opinions don't count. We have to report this, because it is such a huge development in the Bonnie and Clyde story. I do wish to say that I feel you and I have shown that people with widely diverging views can reaach compromise and work together to craft good articles. Your willingness to allow the section on the controversy of the aftermath, and both our efforts to craft a good article is a good example of how people who don't agree don't have to be hateful, but can put aside those differences, and find a middle ground. Further, I appreciate your never making this personal. I tried also not to, and I feel again this is a good example of people working together despite diverging views. Congratulations on your Good work and willingness to compromise. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:17, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Only someone with a real problem, and a complete lack of history, would have made some of the changes 82.114.74.96 made in the article. For intance, " Both Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were believed to have been bisexual, and although Bonnie is known to have been with other men during their relationship, it was usually in the company of Barrow" is totally unsourced, not recognized by historians on the subject, and the additional comment "However, whatever the outcome, Hamer did bring the crime spree of Bonnie and Clyde to an end. Regardless of how Hamer did it, the end result is that had he not taken matters into an unconventional manner, their crimes would have continued, and most likely more lives would have been placed at risk." is POV at it's worst. It isn't history, it is more appropriate to the National Enqirer. If he wishes to propose this kind of POV, he needs to do it on the discussion page, and if he can source it, then propose it. Otherwise it will be removed, which I did. It is POV at it's worst.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 21:31, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">User:Oldwindybear</a> Not to make too much of a small point, but I think the paragraph as now written is quite complimentary to Bonnie's talents -- to go further risks turning this into a fan page &amp; losing credibility. A lot of people think the poetry is doggerel, and it's doubtful it would have continued in print all these years if the author weren't notorious. If the poems are in the public domain, the best thing would be to put the poems into their own Wikipedia pages, so readers can judge for themselves.<a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 05:43, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think her poems are treated pretty kindly here, and I'm fine with it as is. Readers can always check them out for themselves. What this section of the article sorely lacks is more info about her youth--It jumps right from her birth to her marriage. Was she a troublesome kid? Good student? This could use fleshing out. This is otherwise becoming an extraordinarily good article--a wealth of good information from all editors, and the tone is greatly improved from the rampant POV I and others sensed a month or so ago. I share 100% your opinion of Wikipedia--it's the greatest invention of the last decade easily imo! <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 22:51, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>HI there, <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> I based the comment on her poem on critical reviews listed on <a href="http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/35561" class="external free" title="http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/35561" rel="nofollow">http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/35561</a>, on reviews of the play on Bonnie Parker, which at <a href="http://www.bonnieparkeronstage.com/reviews.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bonnieparkeronstage.com/reviews.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bonnieparkeronstage.com/reviews.html</a> say "If Bonnie Parker hadn't met Clyde Barrow, her intelligence and knack for poetry might have taken her far from Texas," and numerous other sites, which cite especially Suicide Sal -- however, I think your point is fair, let readers decide for themselves, and I prefer, as I see you do, to discuss these things, and reach a consensus, so we will leave that section as you edited it. Actually, I agree with you on her early years, and am adding a couple of lines, and encourage you to add some more. She was a very precocious child, and did very well in school, until her teen years, and boy troubles. She was especially praised for her work in literature and the arts while in school. I think we all who have worked on this article, you, myself, My2cents, everyone who has tried to work together have put together a pretty darn good article, and a very fair one. Bonnie was no saint, but she was really in many ways a tool of a psychopath instead of the "partner in crime" she was so long painted. She was never implicated reliably in Clyde's killings, for instance. Anyway, You have done some good work on this article, and thanks for the support on my feeling that wikipedia is the greatest invention of the internet age, as far as information sharing goes!

Good point on the BAR - the Lucerne incident, which was the only recorded time anyone claimed Bonnie fired a weapon was a rifle, and supposedly AUTOMATIC FIRE - and the only rifle in the possession of Barrow at the time was a BAR, which, as you pointed out, was virtually impossible, (I would say plainly impossible, but i suppose a finite possibility exists!) that someone who was 4'10" and weighed 90 pounds could fire. In reality, both you and I know NO WOMAN THAT SIZE could possibly have handled a BAR! That adds to why no police reports were filed on the incident, and no charges, because it never happened...As to the issue of the number of Barrows, unfortunately, the problem comes because the various books list various numbers, and the census is not clear, as all the children were not living at home. Since there is no definitive agreement among the real experts, Treherne, Milner, and even Ted Hinton, then we list 7 or 8. <b>But good addition and good point on the BAR</b>.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 14:32, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">to MyTwoCents about wholesale deletions without discussion to advocate your POV</span></h2>
<p><b>Did you even bother to read the discussion page, and see this article had achieved consensus, before you deleted wholesale additions by at least six contributers? No, you don't care, only for your POV!</b> <b>Mytwocents wholesale chopping of article without discussion</b> I allowed some of the editing MyTwoCents did to stand, as they did shorten and improve the article, BUT mostly My2cents merely removed heavily sourced information in order to advocate a particular point of view, and did so without discussion on this page, so three areas stand, unless by consensus, the majority of readers agree they should be changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) the role of Bonnie Parker in the Barrow Gang, massively researched, very relevant to the article;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) the ambush, which is exhaustively researched, and quotes directly from reports by the officers, and which was allowed to stand as part of an agreement on the Frank Hamer article;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3) controversy and aftermath, which MyTwoCents agreed would remain AS IS in this article in return for removing it from the Frank Hamer article - this section is exhaustively researched and has been repeatedly rewritten.</li>
</ul>
<p>Massive deletions without discussion will not be tolerated on an article that everyone finally agreed was fair and without POV. If MyTwoCents again does wholesale revisions on Bonnie and Clyde without seeking consensus, I will immediately reinstate the controversy section in the both it and the Frank Hamer article, and tag it as POV, since I strongly disagree with MyTwoCents version - I agreed to it, as did others, provided the information, strongly sourced, remained AS IS, in the Bonnie and Clyde article. Bluntly, MyTwoCents you are NOT COMING INTO AN ARTICLE, REWRITING IT FOR YOUR POINT OF VIEW, without discussing it first on the discussion page. If you want to discuss it, fine, but again, I am immediately revising your rewrite of the Hamer article, because the only reason I allowed that totally biased version to stand was your agreement to allow the information to be presented in Bonnie and Clyde. Also, bluntly, what you call cleanup is really wholesale revision to present your point of view, and deletion of material which is both relevant, and heavily sourced - you cannot dispute any of the information you chose to delete, and such antics will not be tolerated. I hope you will leave the article alone, but if not, I will restore the original Frank Hamer article, tag it POV, and ask for arbitration. Finally, I remind My2Cents of the 3 edit in 24 hour rule, once those edits have been challanged as not discussed, which those were not, and are challanged as POV, which they are. old windy bear 10:48, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>what historical inaccuracies are there in the present article, and what source do you have for disputing the facts presented?</li>
<li>why do you think your version, which deletes wholesale the most salient and important historical controversies surrounding the duo is anything but a puff piece for your religiously right wing writing - typified by your statement on Ted Hinton's posthumous revelation that Frank Hamer traded a pardon for Henry Methvin, who murdered two state highway patrolmen, because he had kidnapped and tied up Methvin's father - you stated you did not believe it - you lack any historical perspective, it does not matter what you believe, or what I believe, what matters is what history says!</li>
<li>you seek to delete wholesale the following, which again, are the most important historical issues surrounding the duo:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) what was Bonnie Parker's true role in the Barrow Gang and their crimes?</dd>
<dd>2) was Phillips right that Clyde's motives were never monetary, but rather some vendetta against the Texas Department of Corrections that ended up costing a dozen innocent people their lives, plus his entire gang, except Methvin, whose father got a pardon in return for not having Hamer jailed for kidnapping during the ambush;</dd>
<dd>3) what really happened at the ambush site, and the horrific aftermath, where at page 147 of Milner's book he records the coroner's record as having to get Hamer away from bragging to a group of people to stop souvenir collectors who were busy cutting pieces off the dead bodies?</dd>
<dd>4) what is the real role of Bonnie and Clyde in popular culture, and why has their legend so dwarfed that of far greater criminals like Alvin Karpis and Ma Barker and her gang of the same generation?</dd>
</dl>
<p>You bring nothing historically, seek no discourse, cite no sources, and in short, are a POV writer with a right wing agenda to sanitize away the nasty details like Bonnie NOT being wanted for any capital crime, (and as the new entry pointed out on your talk page, which you did not rspond to because you could not) Hamer's subsequent turning the ambush into a lifelong financial sinecure where he parlayed the ambush into a book deal, paid speaking tours, and the sale of stolen weapons. Gosh, it must be nice to be able, as you do, to rewrite history without citing one single source for your puff piece! A LOT of people contributed here, including such items as the fact that the duo never carried machine guns, only BAR's, (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a>'s excellent find, or <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a>'s excellent suggestions we add more information on Bonnie's youth). You come with nothing but opinions, no fact, no sources, no history, just opinions, and I don't think you fool anyone with your agenda. You may have done this on other articles - Reagan is fine example, which I may just rip to pieces since your puff contributions on him typify your work, no history, no sources, no cites, just opinion, after opinion...I have forebore doing that, for instance, citing all the historians and correspondents with evidence that Reagan was already so lost in dementia his second term he didn't know Iran Contra from Counterfeiting. Your writing is simply that of an advocate, not a historian, and while I have not intervened elsewhere YET - though others have, <b>you won't do it here</b>. You agreed when we let you POV Hamer's article that you would allow the real issues to be aired here. That is called consensus; everyone else is fine with the changes and the current article, and you seek to renege. No go! If you attempt to POV this article, I will immediately reinstate the salient issues in the Hamer article, and source you to tears.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 18:06, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think that is unreasonable. You know a LOT of people worked for the last year on this article, including that user, who agreed that the controversy around the ambush could be fully addressed here - and other users agreed - so it was left off the Hamer page. Now he wishes to POV this page, without listing his factual disputes, sourcing them, or discussing them, as wikipeida demands.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Declarative Statements</span></h2>
<p>How am I supposed to say anything? You have personally attacked me. You have assumed bad faith. Editing <i>includes</i> deleting content. This page will receive more attention in the future from other editors, and a lot of the purple prose that resides today, will be gone. Here are some declarative statements that don't belong in any wikiarticle:</p>
<ul>
<li>'it is likely'</li>
<li>'However, this is questionable'</li>
<li>'it is highly improbable'</li>
<li>'Clyde had finally obtained his revenge against the hated Texas Department of Corrections,'</li>
<li>'and perhaps larger than their life'</li>
<li>'and she unquestionably appealed'</li>
<li>'one must realize'</li>
<li>'Even today people glamorize the couple'</li>
</ul>
<p>Who is talking here? In whose voice are these emphatic statements being made? Must I realize..., is it questionable?..., is it unquestionable?.... These statements <i>embody</i> a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">personal point of view</a>, and they inhabit a wikiarticle that reads like an editorial written by a member of the Parker family, not an encyclopedia article.

<dd><a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a> You did a truly outstanding job of rewording statements of fact, that were and are factually correct, but may have been worded poorly for an encyclopedia article. My thanks. ANY of the facts currently in the article have been sourced to death, but anyone who wishes a particular fact sourced, just ask here, and it will be given. In answer to My2Cents, I still say that you cited language issues rather than facts that were incorrect - on the ONLY "fact" you may have raised, Phillips book flatly states that the Eastham prison break was Clyde's long awaited revenge against the Texas Department of Corrections, and Treherne comes pretty close to saying that also. Milner cites Clyde's well known hatred of the department. As to their appeal, read Milner's book, or Treherne's, which starts out by saying he wrote the book in order to examine the enduring appeal this couple has 7 decades after they died. You really don't cite ANY facts to dispute, just language, and I am perfectly happy with <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a>'s rewrite of the language - and again, any fact in question, like the only one you may have raised, the issue of revenge on TDOC - go read Phillips, who flatly states (citing Fults and W.D. Jones as his sources) that Clyde's motivation was revenge on TDOC.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> Truthfully, your massive deletion of well sourced and correct facts was far more POV than my work, which was carefully and massively sourced, as noted in the issues above. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a>'s rewrite of the language is fine by me, it preserves the crucial questions and issues that have plagued this case for 72 years, while giving it a more encyclopedic tone. And it avoided the slashing of facts that My2Cents wants to POV out with no sourcing at all. Our job if you wish to edit is to give ALL available facts to our readers, not less, just because someone does not like the facts in question. I agree language should be neutral, adn facts neutrally presented, but that was never My2Cents intention. Slaughter of 60% of the article, all of it sourced facts - NO.

<p>Katefan0I agree, let peer review commence. Instead of letting one user ruin a great article with POV. Every fact in this article is exhaustively sourced, can be produced at an instant's notice, and a very good wikipedia editor has just looked at it and removed any vestiage of POV. Our obligation at wikipedia is to write the best articles we can, with the most facts possible without making them a 14 page article, as Geringer has done online with BONNIE AND CLYDE: ROMEO AND JULIET IN A GETAWAY CAR. The truth is in this well writen and fair article, and the article is the best on the net, except for Geringer's article at <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/americana/bonnie/main.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.crimelibrary.com/americana/bonnie/main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.crimelibrary.com/americana/bonnie/main.htm</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 22:49, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>AndyZ I have sources for every fact in question, with specific page numbers and statements.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also respectfully request that before you undertake any major rewrite, that you discuss it on the talk page. My2Cents came to peer review only because he lost in consensus seeking wholesale change on the talk page. With all respect, and I am not impuning you, I like your work, no one person should unilateraly rewrite this article, which a half dozen have worked on rewriting for a year, and which two wikipedia editors just examined for POV, one of which cleared it after a few language changes. It would be deeply violative of wikipedia rules for any single person to do a major rewrite without discussion, especially since the request was strictly POV motivated by a person who could not obtain consensus for such a rewrite on the talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>For instance, My2Cents has questioned Clyde's virtually decade long quest to avenge himself on the Texas Department of Corrections as being the motivating factor behind his crime spree -- that comes directly from one of the most respected writers to research a book on the duo, JOHN PHILLIPS, at <a href="http://historynet.com/ah/bleastham/" class="external free" title="http://historynet.com/ah/bleastham/" rel="nofollow">http://historynet.com/ah/bleastham/</a></li>
<li>He questioned the horrific aftermath of the ambush, and the actions of Frank Hamer in it, that also is directly sourced from Milner's book on the duo, at page 147;</li>
<li>He questions the extent of Bonnie's involvement, that comes directly from Phillips, Treherne, and Milner's books, ALL found no warrants except one preserved in the FBI data base - which is online to confirm, no proof she ever fired a weapon or was more than logistical support;</li>
</ul>

<p>The article as is is not meant, and another good wikipedia editor just went over it and removed any trace of POV -- see the talk page -- to be slanted, but it is meant to TELL THE TRUTH, which unfortunately, My2Cents has clearly shown, with his wholesale deletions, without challanging the truth of the facts, or producing sources, or discussing them on the talk page. Only when he failed there, to impose a POV, did he come here. POV is his objective. I hope you won't do the same. <b>NO major rewrite should occur without consensus</b>. old windy bear 23:08, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> Once again, and for me, I have better things to do, so this is really tiring, I hate coming behind you to an article you have decimated in complete violation of wikipedia policy, and having to restore facts you deleted wholesale without proving them false, sourcing or discussing, because - as you said about Ted Hinton's revelations about Frank Hamer, "you didn't believe it." It does not matter what you or I believe, the FACTS matter. I have impugned your reason for seeking repeated review because you have deleted FACTS wholesale REPEATEDLY without any attempt to follow the wikipedia process, to wit:
<ul>
<li>1. list facts in dispute;</li>
<li>2. source your factual disputes;</li>
<li>3. list your proposed rewrite and why you are doing it on the talk page and seek consensus;</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>You have NEVER ever listed one fact you have found in any reputable source to be in error, typical of you writing is your statement on Frank Hamer: you did not want Ted Hinton's revelation that Hamer allowed a murderer of two highway patrolmen to go free in order to keep from being charged with kidnapping because "I don't believe that," or your statement about the ambush "the only statement that needs to be said...it was a brutal way to die but it was a brutal time." POV? You bet. As to whether controversy lingers over the ambush -- read John Treherne's book, or E.R. Milner's, or Ambush by Ted Hinton. ALL question the events surrounding the ambush, especially the horrendous aftermath, Milner, 146-7. Even online, In his article "Romeo and Juliet in a Getaway Car" Joesph Gerringer writes of the ambush: "But, Hamer chose not to call out a warning -- not to Bonnie and Clyde...in a voice audible only to those around him, void of drama, void of malice, Hamer ordered, "Shoot!" Also in Hinton's book, the best source on the ambush, he makes clear Hamer had ordered firing without warning no matter what happened prior to the car's arrival,AND that the posse had great reservations about that!</dd>
<dd>I impugn your reasons because I cannot assume someone is fair and impartial who REPEATEDLY disregards the wikipedia process wholesale, and rewrites facts out wholesale to suit their own agenda. Once, I did not make this charge. Twice, I spoke to you, and we hammered out a compromise, which you then violated a third time, and yes, I am prepared to sit before a panel of wikipedia editors, have them go over your "edits" on this article, and believe they will conclude the same thing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you believe that it is wikipedia policy for a contributor - you are not an editor, nor am I - to delete facts wholesale, without sourcing, without discussion, and when he or she cannot get his way by consensus, seek to go around consensus achieved through months of work on the article by dedicated people, and not just me, <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">User:Woohookitty</a> (editor, and a great one!) randazzo56, User:CyclePat (editor, another good one), Katefan0 (editor and fairest person on the net) Ewulp, and others. randazzo56 said it best though, when commenting on your proposals: the article needs more facts, not less. You want less, could care less than the vast majority disagree, and keep trying to push a POV. I don't like to have to stand up like this against a contributor, but your contributions are all invariably - and I have studied them all -- geared towards a political viewpoint. I am sorry, but I have to oppose that on principle because that is not what wikipedia is for, it is to give the best possible information we can. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 10:36, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I cannot assume your good faith because you have broken your word and engaged in activity which repeatedly, over and over, violated wikipedia policy. As for your goodness of soul, I don't question any person's intrinsic goodness, the issue here is whether you violated wikipedia policy, over and over. You did, and I am sorry you did, but you did. That is all I am sorry for, that I have to waste my time arguing with someone who won't argue FACTS, but wants to argue philosophy - because essentially that is what you want. You want a pro law and order spin on the ambush. I am part of the law enforcement community - I want a FAIR article that relates FACTS. No, I will not remove my comments, I feel they are fair, and encourage good people like AndyZ to contact me to show me how to improve the UNDISPUTED FACTS WE HAVE. NOT A SOUL, EXCEPT YOU, has contacted me to say my comments are inappropriate. On the other hand, Andy has already contacted me, with guidance on bettering the article, So where is the negative impact you speak of? There is none, except my honest feeling you seek POV. Get <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> who I respect greatly, or <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> to look at them, as I asked him to, and if he, whose opinion I also greatly respect, feels they should be removed, they will be removed at once. You don't run the peer review page, we all do, and when there is a dispute, as there is here, I have already asked one of wikipedia's most respected editors to look at it.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> This is my last comment on this. You came here twice, and made wholesale deletions, TWICE, without any discussion, or any dispute in fact. The second time you did it, you did it after having agreed not to do it on the Frank Hamer talk page. Period, and the history reflects the two wholesale butcher jobs on the article, deleting facts willy nilly, with no listing of any dispute, no sourcing to contradict, no discussion. As to the peer review page, I kept my word, AndyZ said the statements should be removed, so I did. I said if one person agreed it was inappropriate I would remove it. I keep my word. Actually, as my arguments six months ago, yes, I was recovering from chemotherapy at the time, (not that that is your business) and was cranky. Katefan0 taught me better. If you go to my talk page, most of those folks are now my friends. As for you, I don't see you as my enemy, I see you as a nuisance to people trying to write a good article, when i think of you at all, which is only when I am here. 99% of my day, I don't think about you at all, frankly.

<li>The fact is that no charges were ever taken out on either woman, but that is being reworded. (that is in EVERY book written on the duo, including Treherne, who went to Lucerne - for an shootout reported to be that badly, NOT ONE POLICE STATEMENT OR WARRANT EXISTED -- also again, the FBI warrant data base shows just one warrant known on Bonnie Parker).</li>
<li>The statement on Bonnie's appeal came from three authors, it was not my statement - I can give you page numbers on it, and it is directly linked now.</li>
<li>As to their appeal to the disenfranchised, it is now linked and sourced online, quote by Milner, Gerenger, and noted historian Jonathan Davis, who, in an excellent A&amp;E Cable Network-produced Biography on the two bandits, says of Bonnie and Clyde’s crimes, "Anybody who robbed banks or fought the law were really living out some secret fantasies on a large part of the public," so I had have to laugh you thought it weasal to say Bonnie appealled to the disenfranchised, actually, noted historians say it a lot stronger than that, and I simply quoted them, and linked the quotes. THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS (actually, I am glad you made me reword that - Milner's, Gerenger's Davis's quotes on the duo are far stronger than what I had said)</li>
<li>As to Buck being shot, that is online, at Gerenger's article, but i reworded - there is no absolute proof to more wounds, so we stick with what we know, that he died of pneumonia after surgery for two head wounds.</li>
<li>As to the B.A.R. that was inserted by an ex-marine who has handled B.A.R.'s as have I, but you may be right that it is original research, which is prohibited, so I will remove it.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">merging of sections</span></h2>
<p>I would like to propose that we increase the lead paragraph, as it wikipedia general policy, and include the last paragraph of their impact on the public, then and now, that we merge Bonnie's role in the Barrow gang, which is vital to the article and heavily sourced, with her life in general. I would also merge Clyde's life with their meeting, which was fated to weigh so heavily on both. I would propose merging sections 6-10, preserving the information there, sourcing more heavily, as I have been doing, and labeling the first three sections, simply Bonnie Paker, Clyde (Champion) Barrow, and Early Days of the Barrow Gang; I would merge all of 10, calling it Bonnie Hurt and Buck Barrow Killed, and leave the final sections as they are. I seek consensus for this proposed consolidation of sections, as suggested by --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECherry_blossom_tree_d84a.html" title="User talk:Cherry blossom tree"><b>C</b>herry <b>b</b>lossom <b>t</b>ree</a> on the peer review page.

I have two versions written. One contained the original less powerful language, but no, you and Andy thought that was "weasal," and then I simply started going to the sources, as AndyZ suggested. AND NOT ONE IS WRONG. We need to decide whether you are going to finally accept that this is going to be an article that tells the truth, not from any point of view, just the sad, brutal, cruel, truth of what happened, and how people viewed it, and then I will post it, and people can freely edit.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No direct quotes</span></h2>
<p>I propose that we eliminate the use of quotes on this page. A direct qouote from a book or web article can be a little jarring in a wikipedia article. It is by definition, expressing a point of view, and because of the violent subject matter of this page, can disrupt the balance and tone of the text. I propose that we condense any quotations to a neutral, encyclopedic, statement with the appropiate citations. This excercise would go a long way towards making the article more neutral in tone.</p>

<dl>
<dd>You and Andy objected to the language that Bonnie appealled to the disenfranchised and unemployed desperate 35-40% of americans out of work, and a lot of the remainder enraged with the government. That is <b>FACT in every book based on the duo</b> - but it was said that was "weasal words." Okay, I did make them subjective, which is a valid point. So to eliminate that, now we go to direct sourced quotes from unquestioned experts in the field, the writers who are acknowledged the master historians on Bonnie and Clyde, whose information we should relay in this article - and you want now to eliminate that, because you have discovered - which I could have told you if you had read every single book on the duo, as I have, that this is a universal observation. I am willing to take out the quotes, and reinstate less powerful language. Though you cannot seem to grasp it, my goal was a nuanced FAIR factually accurate article, and I did it, with a lot of help. Then you objected to the wording, so we went back to unquestioned direct source from the experts - which do you want, the former, less powerful language, which we fashioned for a neutral article, or direct quotes? One thing is a certainty, I believe consensus will rally around:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>defining Bonnie's actual role in the gang, and her background, including warrant status, et al;</li>
<li>was Clyde seeking vengence on corrections and what he viewed as an uncaring government, whether it was insane and criminal being irrelevant to it being his motives, as Phillips and Milner, two of the real experts, maintain devoutedly;</li>
<li>their powerful effect not just on depression era americans, but generations after, and why;</li>
<li>what actually happened at the ambush, and the horrific aftermath;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You and AndyZ cannot have it both ways. I reworded originally to take out the sting from the direct quotes - and you and Andy objected to that as weasal words. Now we have the historians, and you are equally unhappy because your idea of a "neutral" article is one that puffs the police, and ignores the very real controversy that has dogged this matter for 72 years. Do what I did, and go look at AndyZ's work, which is so heavily sourced and has quotes. It eliminates any question of subjective interpretation. Which do you want? The former, less confrontational language, or direct quotes? I honestly believe consensus will not allow you to delete the facts, so you must chose. I don't believe you have the consensus to delete the facts, bluntly.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:05, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This page makes Bonnie and Clyde out to be heroes, with the Hamer posse' serving as the arm of an oppressive establishment, in the role of antagonists. It reads more like a novel, than an encylopedia article. The use of direct quotes from authors hinders making the article neutral in tone. The inbalance of pro B&amp;C statements is still there, big as ever. But the statements and quotes contained on the page have better sourcing now, which is good. <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> is still a distant goal. Since neutrality is at the heart of wikipedia, I think there is a lot of work still to be done to this page. Kudos to all, for there recent work.</dd>

<dd>I respectfully disagree. I think that Andy is right that when subjects are controversial, as this one is, the best answer is direct quotes from experts. Further, again, assuming your good will, you asked for this. Oldwindybear had toned down those direct quotes to avoid an article that might be interpreted as being pro B &amp; C, which I do not gather he is. You demanded a review, and as Andy says, the best way to resolve subjective differences in language and weasel words is direct quotes from recognized experts and sourcing. On B &amp; C there are no better experts alive than John Phillips, John Treherne, Joseph Geringer, and E. Milner. I think you should congratulate and thank oldwindybear for a great job on following Andy's direction, removing all weasel words, and I strongly support keeping the quotes, and the article is not POV to me, it shows Clyde for his 10 plus murders, but it also relays some very disturbing facts about the way they were killed, that you apparantly don't like, but are the truth. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> 16:45, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a>Quite naturally I am going to agree with you. I don't think the article makes Hamer out to be anything other than what he was - a brutal killer with a badge. Clyde was a worse killer without a badge, who murdered a lot of innocent people in his crazed vendetta against the Corrections folks. Bonnie was a intelligent yet foolish girl that followed a psychopath. Those basically were Treherne's and Phillips findings, and they are the best of the Bonnie and Clyde writers, along with Milner, who concluded the same. I tried to tone the article down, but My2Cents insisted on a peer review, where AndyZ was great in directing me to a number of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to link so sources can be made without disrupting the article, which has been done, virtualy every fact in the article is now massively sourced, but more are on the way, Andy sets a high standard,and I agree with his;</li>
<li>when controversial subjects, with weasal words are involved, or subjective interpretations, it is best to use quotes, and original expert sourcing, so that there is no question this is what the historians say;</li>
<li>as Andy and you have said, I think the quotes and lasting findings must stay;</li>
<li>some people don't want the facts told, they want a particular point of view relayed - they cannot grasp we are an encyclopedia here, to relay historial FACTS, not opinions, or beliefs;</li>
<li>no facts are in dispute, and all weasal words and subjective language has been replaced to eliminate any possibility of bias, replaced with the historical facts directly written, as should be in an encyclopedia article.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am NOT for Bonnie and Clyde. Neither am I for a so called law officer who would shoot a girl not wanted for any major crime 130 times after the real murderer was already dead; and then let people cut her bloody hair and clothes off for souvenirs. That is the reality of what happened. But I tried to keep my beliefs out, and simply relay the facts. It is absolutely true, as another expert observed - and which I left out to avoid POV - that today Hamer and the entire posse would be tried for murder, and convicted. Again, that was a historian, not me, but I left it out to avoid a POV slant. I think with AndyZ's direction, and Cherry's suggestions, and 12 hours of work from me, this has become a great article. It is not going to please everyone, but it is fair, nuanced, sourced, factually correct - no one disputes a single fact - and by the weekend will be even more massively sourced. Thanks for your kind words on my work. My only goal is the TRUTH, wherever that takes us.<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 18:48, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is my re-write of the intro:</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow</b> were notorious criminals who operated in the central <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. They captivated the attention of the American press and its readership during what has been referred to as the public enenmy era" — between 1931 and 1935, a period which led to the formation of the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_d581.html" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a>. Though remembered as a bank robber, Clyde Barrow preferred to rob small stores or gas stations.</p>
<p>Bonnie was viewed at the time, as a full partner in the gang. Gang members W.D. Jones and Ralph Fults said they never saw Bonnie fire a gun, but described her role as logistical.<sup id="_ref-Phillips_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phillips" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<dd>I would immediately revert, unless over the next 48 hours it is clear by consensus your version will be approved, which I do not believe will be so, because:
<ul>
<li>I think you deleted fact wholesale, and made it POV.</li>
<li>introductory paragraphs in wikipedia need to be fuller and discuss the article to come - go look at AndyZ's article;</li>
<li>the current introduction is full, fair, and by using quotes, eliminated the subjective language, but introduced us to all the powerful and controversial subjects in the article, respectfully, what you call opinion is historical fact, eliminates weasal words, and is quoted from direct sources to avoid exactly the kind of subjective interpretation, or POV deletion you wish to do:</li>
<li>what was the actual - versus perceived - role of Bonnie Parker (you eliminate that completely)?</li>
<li>who were these people, and why has their legend been so enduring, far outliving far more deadly criminals, such as Alvin Karpas and Ma Barker of the same era(you eliminate that completelly)?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>You eliminate all the foregoing. Respectfully, so far, all who have commented have supported keeping the quotes in, and the current, massively sourced rewrite, with keeping lasting effects in - go read AndyZ's comments. You would have no consensus for deleting wholesale, not leaving sufficient wikipedia paragraphs or truly introducing the subject, and I had consensus for keeping the quotes in, and lasting effects, which the introduction raises from direct sources. NPOV (Neutral Point Of View) is a fundamental Wikipedia principle which states that all articles must be written from a neutral point of view, representing views fairly and without bias. This includes reader-facing templates, categories and portals. According to Wikipedia founder Jimbo Wales, NPOV is "absolute and non-negotiable". The current introduction, and article, was massively rewritten to remove "weasal words" AndyZ was kind enough to identify, used direct quotes from unquestioned experts and historians in addressing controversial subjects to comply most effectively with Jimbo's policy. The proposed rewrite does not address the people and issues, it is an attempt to eliminate facts - undisputed facts -without consensus in violation of wikipedia policy. Because you do not have consensus, I also respectfully warn you of the three rewrite rule. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 09:58, 4</dd>

<dd>I must weigh in on this one, though I generally am a reader, rather than writer. The current introduction flows smoothly into the article, and does three things which are vital. It introduces us to these very controversial outlaws, especially Bonnie Parker. In the second paragraph, it focuses on the public misperception, according to all the experts, of her real role in the gang, and that flows beautifully into the third paragraph, which discusses why these two relatively minor league people have remained so dominant in popular culture 70 some years after the events in question. The use of the quotes is well done, Andy is right, they eliminate the weasel words that subjective interpretation can bring. I strongly support the existing work oldwindybear has done, which is outstanding sourced, and really works to introduce us to the article. Also, the rewrite is not even three paragraphs - one is one sentence, and it is essentially one paragraph spread out so it looks like it complied with the standard 2-3 wikipedia introduction paragraphs. Quotes are vital here, because of the controversial nature of the subject matter. No one has questioned the facts, and the quotes, as all have said, and the lasting effects, must stay. I strongly oppose the rewrite proposed. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> 12:55, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is excessive. One time would be enough.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please do not delete other people's work who disagree with you</span></h2>
<p>I am not going to engage you in a war of words, the way you have oldwindybear. Nor am I going to allow you to unilaterally disregard wikipedia policy, and simply change the discussion page, because you evidently want to minimize the fact that people are disagreeing with you. Removing other people's sections, or work, is not only rude, but absolutely against wikipedia rules. Only an editor, which clearly from reading this page and your ongoing argument with oldwindybear you are not, has such power. (Please spare me the "we are all editors" argument, you do not have the discretionary powers they do, through appointment! You are a contributer, as oldbear puts it, no more, no less) Please refrain from interfering with my comments. Your statement a response in it's own section can be considered rude is not in the wikipedia rules, especially where the seperate section is needed to clarify for other people trying to speak out on consensus, where to take a stand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unilaterally removing someone's comments or work is absolutely not just rude, but against wikipedia rules. Again, I do not have oldwindybear's infinite patience to argue with you. If you delete my work again, I will file a wikipedia complaint on you, for abusing the rules.</p>
<p>I oppose your rewrite, period, for the reasons listed above. I consider every quote in the article a good one, and the entry excellent. Your proposed introduction is silly, and ignores all the salient issues that have tormented so many people for so long about this couple. Two of your "paragraphs" are only two sentences, and the total is about one normal paragraph. It does not introduce the most important questions people ask: what was Bonnie's real role in all this, and why has their legend proved so durable? Andy is right, the quotes are relevant, important, as are lasing issues. I oppose your rewrite, and ask you to obey wikipedia policy and stop deleting people's statements that you dislike. I have now respectfully asked you to refrain from rude actions against wikipedia policy, and trust you will abide by that request.<a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> 16:02, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can see, by this indented reply, that continuing a discussion in the same section, makes it more clear, and doesn't imply that my reponse has greater <b>weight</b>, than your statement. When I changed the section lead to to an indented paragraph, this is called refactoring, and is meant to help the discussion. It's hard for any other editors to follow a discussion, when it is broken up into sections. it also makes copy and paste more dificult, if the copy text is on a different part of a long talk page.</dd>

I have never done so, and would not. First of all, it is unethical, and while you don't know me, I pride myself on being an ethical person. Secondly, it is stupid, since internet addresses are easily checked, and I, not that it is your business again, work for a law enforcement agency, and have no internet access (other than for work related sites I cannot name) during the hours those postings were made. Allow me to assure you that wikipedia, while highly respected, is not a law enforcement site, lol.</p>
<p>I am not getting into the argument between you and <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> over removing section titles, because I really consider that irrelevant to the main topic: the direction of this article. I prepared by reading every book on Bonnie and Clyde, watching the very excellent A &amp; E documentary, and preparing as much historically as I could - natural, since I was trained as a historian. I honestly believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>the real issues in this article are who was this duo, and why is their legend so enduring, why has it lasted generations after their death, when far greater criminals, i. e. Alvin Karpis, have been forgotten;</li>
<li>what was Bonnie Parker's true historic role in the so called "Barrow Gang," and why did the public think one thing while another was true?</li>
<li>why have so many people made heros out of a psychopath whose hatred of prison which he brought on himself, cost at least 18 people their lives, between his known 10 victims, 5 members of his gang, himself, and a foolish girl?</li>
<li>why did a supposedly respected law officer conduct one of the most horrific ambushs and aftermaths in the history of American law enforcement?</li>
</ul>
<p>I also honestly believe my introduction is far closer to what AndyZ had in mind when advocating three paragraphs, not one. You essentially have one, broken in three, to hide the deletion of material you personally oppose. I believe my introduction brings the reader into the article asking the same questions historians have asked - and answered - for 72 years, keeps quotes and lasting effect Andy, Still, and others have thought should stay, while yours attempts to sanitize the entire mess. You believe I am "pro" Bonnie and Clyde. Nothing could be further from the truth - there is no effort in this article to hide the visciousness of the crimes of Clyde Barrow and what it cost. But this article does into the historical complexities of the depression, the vision people had of this duo, rightly or wrongly, and still do. Yours does not. The issue here is not personal, it is which vision of the article is correct, yours or mine. I believe mine will obtain consensus for the simple reasons that is better written, quotes the experts, and brings the readers in introducing the issues the article should address, with no POV, just seeking the truth. <b>Respectfully, I honestly don't believe that is your goal, you want to sanitize what happened. I seek to put the facts out there, FACTS YOU HAVE NEVER DISPUTED, NOT ONE. All weasal language identified by Andy is gone.

I have gone to great lengths to explain to you why your introduction is lousy - and why mine is better. Yours is simply not good writing, or good encylopedia writing. It is terrible, and I think the introduction I wrote is far better, and so far, so do those who have commented. (which is the most important - what do the rest think? So far, they think the facts should stay, the quotes should stay, the lasting impact should stay, and yours does none of the above). You write 5 times that Bonnie did not shoot a gun, which is not what the introduction says - it leads flowingly into the facts of the article, which the really awful introduction you propose does not.

I have explained four times now why your introductory paragraph is terrible, and is really one sanitizing paragraph which you spread out to fake three so that you don't violate the basic tenet (two sentences do not a paragraph make, at any college I have been at!) that totally fails to lead into the crucial facts of the article. Not being smart, but didn't you take writing in school? The lead paragraphs, and certainly in an encyclopedia article, must give enough fact to let the reader know what the article is about, yours does not, mine does, and it flows quite well, while yours reads like the instructions on a pizza.

You seem unable to grasp that historically - and we are an encyclopedia relaying facts - the public's facination with Bonnie, versus her actual role in the gang, is an essential part of the article. Those quotes - which three of us have supported against you alone, are a powerful introduction to the mythos versus the reality, elinimate weasal words, and the subjective language you prefer</b>, something you cannot grasp. <b>Here are the three introductory paragraphs, as are, which do three things:</b></p>

<p><b>Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were notorious robbers and criminals who traveled the central United States during the Great Depression. Their exploits were known nationwide. They captivated the attention of the American press and its readership during what is sometimes referred to as the "public enemy era" — between 1931 and 1935, a period which led to the formation of the FBI.

<p><b>But noted writer Joseph Geringer, in his article "Bonnie and Clyde: Romeo and Juliet in a Getaway Car" explained part of their appeal to the public then, and their enduring legend now, by saying "Americans thrilled to their "Robin Hood" adventures.

<dd>I will say this simply and once. I completely oppose the proposed rewrite.

He again edited a posting, and while oldwindybear may not resent this, I do, and I carried my request to the mediation unit. MyTwoCents reformats people's postings to hide the opposition to his rewrites. This must stop. Anyone else resenting this user's highhanded erasure of postings, editing other people's postings, please go to mediation and report it. He needs to be banned. When he cannot, as here, obtain consensus for plain sorry rewrites, he edits postings to try to get through trickery what he cannot obtain by consensus. It must stop. I am not going to argue with him for months like oldwindybear, I can, and have, taken action to stop him.

<p><b>TO ONE AND ALL:</b> I would prefer that StillStudying withdraw his complaint, and we focus on the issues. My2Cents, don't edit my work again, period. You moaned and complained about my doing so to yours, so do me the basic courtesy of not changing my work. If I feel it should be italized, I have sufficient education - a number of college degrees, for what that is worth, (little, actually, I agree with Essjay on that, degrees are overrated as a measure of worth) - to italize my work, or indent it. Okay? We clear on that? Still, please drop the complaint. I don't want this deteriorating into a contest over My2Cent's rudeness in editing other people's posting, and whatever motivates it, I want the debate on his really lousy proposed rewrite. No writer in any school could get away with 2 sentence paragraphs and decimating the subject matter in the introduction. His work is not good here, and would detract from what AndyZ, a very VERY good writer said: with controversial material which is subject to interpretation, and weasal words result, use direct quotes from acknowledged historians and experts. We have voted so far 3-1 against deleting the quotes and lasting effects - so let us stay on topic, and not go after My2Cents personally. My2Cents, in return, you <b>STOP</b> changing the talk page, period, unless it is your posting. You are <b>NOT</b> empowered to edit other people's postings, and frankly, your writing and style is not particularly good, in my honest opinion - and yes, I once taught english and history both - so please, no lectures on how you are facilitating discussion.</p>
<p>In short, Still, please drop the complaint, My2Cents, please stop editing other people's postings on the talk page, and everyone, please keep the current introduction, which is infinitely superior to what My2Cents would like to do, delete quotations, delete facts, and WREAK the flow into the article. The three introductory paragraphs, as are, which do three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>tell you who these people are;</li>
<li>begin to define the real Bonnie Parker as opposed to the mythic;</li>
<li>try to begin to explain their enduring hold on the American public:</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The bottom line: the current introduction is better, simple as that, and better introduces the article and issues. Let us concentrate on that,</b> instead of other issues, though My2Cents, if you edit mine again, I will have to join the complaint. Please don't, I am asking you nicely, so we can finish this discussion. I believe consensus will keep the present introduction - let us deal with that issue. I have to add, My2Cents, you keep asking people about the introduction: AndyZ said the quotes and lasting effect should stay. Stillstudying has said 3 times your work is terrible and the current introduction must stay. I have said so many times I am tired of counting that your rewrite is bad, unencyclopedic, and wreaks a fine entry into the article, which if you were allowed, you would then wreak also. I think it clear most people don't want that, but you won't accept defeat. Please let other people talk now - the rest of us have made our positions clear, no one is changing theirs. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 18:54, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Redundancy in the intro</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">Old windy bear</a>, you stated earlier, <i>You write 5 times that Bonnie did not shoot a gun, which is not what the introduction says</i>. The introduction, as of now states this(with key statements bolded);</p>
<p><br />
<i>Though the public at the time believed Bonnie to be a full partner in the gang, the role of Bonnie Parker in the Barrow Gang crimes has long been a source of controversy. Gang members W.D. Jones and Ralph Fults testified that they <b>never saw Bonnie fire a gun (1)</b>, and described her role as logistical. In that book, Fults was adamant that Bonnie <b>never fired a shot (2)</b> in any of the gang's gun battles. W.D. Jones stated under oath to the authorities, <b>"Bonnie never packed a gun (3)</b>, out of the five major gun battles I was with them <b>she never fired a gun (4)</b>." Writing with Phillip Steele in The Family Story of Bonnie and Clyde, Marie Barrow, Clyde's youngest sister, made the same claim: <b>"Bonnie never fired a shot.(5)</b> She just followed my brother no matter where he went."</i></p>
<p><a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">Old windy bear</a>, you've removed redundancy before, but for some reason, you won't defend the five-fold mention of Bonnies non-gunwielding, just in the intro statement. Instead, you criticize my proposal. Done, you've made yourself clear about my version. Now, can you reduce the intro so it just contains ones tatement regarding Bonnies gunwielding?</p>

<dd><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> I defend multisourcing and direct quoting on a very controversial subject. Redundency exists when the same source is repeatedly cited with the same comment. This is not the case in this matter - See my previous 5 answers, and the one below: for many reasons, all detailed, the quotes provide powerful entry into the article and issues involved, which yours does not. There are four separate sources, which are necessary for a controversial topic. Andy was right - go look at his article - when anything is controversial, or allows subjective interpretation, quotes, direct history, is the definitive encyclopedic answer. That paragraph is a powerful, multisourced entry onto one of the salient issues of the article, (public perception of Bonnie as Clyde's full partner in crime - see the lead in then to the next paragraph, where another great historian explains that was part of their appeal, then and now, that a woman was helping strike back!) and a subject of enormous misconception for the past 72 years! To lead into such an article, weasal words, and subjective interpretations must be avoided, and multiple facts used. The paragraph reads well, all agree but you. The paragraph leads superbly into the third, why the two have an enduring public appeal, then and now. Yours sounds like the directions to the beltway, instead of an encyclopedia article on two of the most enduring figures of american mythos. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:55, 5 May 2006 (UTC)18:54, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS I hope you notice, that I have attempted to defuse this complaint issue. There need be no nastiness, and I hope Stillstudying removes the complaint. Come now, you have made your best arugment, and it has fallen short. Consensus sees that this is a great introduction, fashioned carefully in three very well written paragraphs, with multisourcing (and that is what you miss, multisourcing is not redundency, see the APA guidelines to citing!) to introduce us to some of the most controversial topics of the depression era.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">there is no redundancy in the introduction, just facts to introduce controversial subjects</span></h2>
<p>Paragraph one introduces us to a duo revered and reviled for 72 years as America's Robin Hood and Maid Marion, or a pair of deranged killers, take your choice. Paragraph two, delives into what is one of the most powerful subjects in this article - Public perception of Bonnie as Clyde's full partner in crime, which heavily sourced, (and as Andy says, where subjective interpretation, weasal words, are natural due to controversy, source HEAVILY and QUOTE HISTORIANS), we are writing an encyclopedia article where fact is all. Paragraph two shows that the myth is not so - and then see the lead in then to the next paragraph, where another great historian explains that myth was part of their appeal, then and now, that a woman was helping strike back! And you fail to show how the paragraph deals with a highly controversial subject, condensed material which was already in the article, and flows into the third. The paragraphs are carefully structured to introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>who this pair was, that trod so heavily in the national mythos for 72 years;</li>
<li>what was the real Bonnie Parker's role in the gang, as opposed to the:</li>
<li>public perception, which according to ALL historians that have studied the duo, that a woman helping strike a blow many americans would have like to struck, gave them a special aura that has NOT FADED WITH TIME.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the three paragraphs are carefully constructed to introduce us to one of America's great myths and a horrific set of tragedies that cost 18 people, at least, their lives. Thus, It stays, period. I have consensus to keep the article as is. You must not be reading my responses, or anyone elses. The introduction includes a first paragraph which introduces the couple, but needs no quotes as it does not delve into controversial material. Not so the second and third. The second and third paragraph were constructed with quotes which form absolutely perfect introductory paragraphs. <b>As to the second paragraph, that information, and it does flow, comes from different sources, (Fults, W.D. Jones, John Phillips and Marie Barrow), replaced weasal words which Andy was kind enough to identify, and involves an absolutely vital issue in the article:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>what was the real role of Bonnie Parker in the Barrow Gang and their crimes, which is a topic that has stirred controversy for 72 years, as Andy said, quotes and history are the best way to deal with such topics and avoid subjective language and weasal words;</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not redundent, it is vital. Because the subject is so controversial, it is vital to have as many facts as possible historically, and each is differently sourced. I am supported so far by everyone else that has offered opinion, and believe I have consensus to keep it. Bluntly, it is not redundent, it is vital, flowing, and moving, right into the third paragraph, which tries to give us a hint at what the article will explain, the enduring popular appeal of this duo, then and now. So the first introduces, the second offers a real versus perceived view of Bonnie - which, you fail to mention, is not repeated later in the article; those quotes were moved from the old "Role of Bonnie Parker in the Barrow Gang" Section, and contain vital information not repeated elsewhere. No, I will not remove it, I have consensus to keep it, and it stays. It is an encyclopedia, and as all other users but you have said, it needs more facts, not less, and teh truth, not a point of view. The paragraph stays as is, by consensus. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 20:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mytwocents, you walked away because when AndyZ told you to find facts to dispute, you could find none. He, a great editor, went through, found all subjective interpretations, and weasal words, and they were removed, and replaced by quotes, and historically undisputed facts. He supported the inclusion of the quotes, and lasting effect as an outstanding way to eliminate any possibility of subjective interpretation or language. That was why you left.

I stressed in the article, that Clyde's psychotic obsession with revenge against the Texas prison system directly resulted in at least 18 deaths, 11 of them totally innocent people. But the truth also shows that Bonnie Parker was essentially a lovestruck girl who followed a charming, but deadly, psychopath to her death. That is not my wording either, it is almost a word for word conclusion from John Treherne, John Phillips, and E.L. Milner, the three best Bonnie and Clyde historians, plus Jonathan Davis, the great depression era historian. The horrific aftermath of the ambush has to be told - that is NOT american law enforcement, it is murder Hamer got away with, again, another historian wrote "today he and the posse would be tried for murder, and at the least, imprisoned for life." I left that out, because I feft it, though historically correct, it did not help us achieve NPOV, which the current article has. It is nuanced, balanced, sourced, and fair. The difference now, which AndyZ in particular taught, is that all this is MASSIVELY sourced, and going to be more so.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intro paragraph</span></h2>
<p>I am in partial agreement with My2cents, the number of concurring statements on Bonnie's non-use of guns is bound to strike some readers as overkill. This rewrite helps without (as far as I can tell) cutting anything important:</p>
<p>Old version: Gang members W.D. Jones and Ralph Fults testified that they never saw Bonnie fire a gun, and described her role as logistical.[1] In that book, Fults was adamant that Bonnie never fired a shot in any of the gang's gun battles. W.D. Jones stated under oath to the authorities, "Bonnie never packed a gun, out of the five major gun battles I was with them she never fired a gun." Writing with Phillip Steele in The Family Story of Bonnie and Clyde, Marie Barrow, Clyde's youngest sister, made the same claim: "Bonnie never fired a shot. She just followed my brother no matter where he went."</p>
<p>Proposed rewrite: Gang members W.D. Jones and Ralph Fults testified that they never saw Bonnie fire a gun, and described her role as logistical.[1] Jones' sworn statement was that "Bonnie never packed a gun, out of the five major gun battles I was with them she never fired a gun." Writing with Phillip Steele in The Family Story of Bonnie and Clyde, Marie Barrow, Clyde's youngest sister, made the same claim: "Bonnie never fired a shot. She just followed my brother no matter where he went."</p>
<p>This way all the witnesses are still on record, but it no longer sounds like repetition of a mantra. If all agree feel free to paste it in. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 05:50, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>He did not list anything in dispute on the talk page, he just butchered the article without notice or the least bit of following wp policy before he deleted half the article, including everything he personally disagrees with, but which the peer review left in. He is now noticed that the three edit rule is in effect.</li>
<li>I have reverted his wholesale editing out of sections and/or paragraphs and references he does not like, which consensus allowed in.</li>
<li>If he continues, since he has ignored the requirement that all major changes be discussed on the talk page, and ignored the peer review, I will revert each time, and the third time he attempts to chop out sections, I ask he be suspended for violating the three edit rule.</li>
<li>By wp policies he is simply not allowed to destroy Ewulp's work on the introductory paragraphs, and her work on the remembering sections, chopping out whole paragraphs, and whole sections. He is not allowed to delete whole sections such as the aftermath, which the peer review and AndyZ specifically approved after elimination of all weasal words.</li>

I kept this about the fact that he failed to list facts in dispute, and ignored that a peer review HE CALLED FOR upheld the current article, asking only that it be heavily sourced, weasal words eliminated, and tightened - all were done, and the article approved AS IT WAS before this user came back, ignored consensus, and butchered it yet again in violation of consensus and wp rules.</li>

<dd>I will make my comment short, and to the point. I have thanked all the people who came and asked me to stay and work on wikipedia after the false sock puppet charge was dismissed. Before anyone makes such a scurulous accusation again, I would hope they would look at my work, which shows I have no interests in common with oldwindybear, except depression-era gangsters, and to my knowledge, he works on only this pair. My growing body of contributions, plus my internet address, shows who I am. That said, I agree 100% with his stance that no user should or will be able to come on this article, and delete whole sections, delete paragraphs, and other work achieved by the peer review, and by consensus. My2Cents made no effort to discuss this, or do anything wikipedia policy calls for, before once again devastating a good article with his massive deletions. If the bear does not reverse such vandalism, I will. These antics are wrong, have happened before, and won't be tolerated. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> Max 12:32, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Listen, talk pages don't need this level of mudslinging. If you can't work something out with an editor, <b>use dispute resolution</b> (see [WP:DR]]). There's so much soapboxing going on here that it distracts from discussions about the article's text.

<dd>I am sorry, but I don't see this as mudslinging. I noted the sock puppet matter, simply so that anyone who was interested can check my edits. I called no names, nor violated any policy, which I have religiously studied since being falsely accused. For the record, I did ask for dispute resolution, and I understand oldwindybear did also. It was not granted. The issue is the right of anyone to unilaterally delete sections of an article wholesale, without any discussion. Period. Such actions are wrong, period. This is about basic wikipedia policy. Period. Such unilateral deletions will not be tolerated.

If you wish to reopen debate on the article, for the 109th time, you must do so on the talk page, which is also in the wikipedia policies, and see if you can obtain consensus for your proposed deletions.

<li>if you delete sections, paragraphs, or references without coming here first and discussing them, I, or evidently others, will merely revert the edits as being done in violation of wikipedia basic policy that requires consensus before major change of any article.</li>

<li>You are also required to post any disputes in fact and discuss them. Wholesale deletions on an article which <b>you</b> insisted go to peer review, and which that peer review worked on and found a first rate article, are not acceptable unless, as Still says, you raise this for the 109th time (like that!), and get the consensus you did not obtain the first 108 times you tried to do this.</li>

<p>The fact that "Mytwocents' insists on shortning the article serves to show that he does not act in the best interest of Wikipedia, He acts to offend "Oldwindybear" by removing facts from this article.

<dd><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> Thank you, and I agree. I asked for dispute resolution on his issues with me, the false complaints, the name calling, but it was not granted. (his phony sock puppet charge was dismissed - and the odd warnings from an unnamed user began appearing displacing the Hamer page with the false information - and I have read it - from the Hamer book. What a coincidence!) This article was approved by a major peer review HE asked for, and now HE alone wants to delete information wholesale, information he cannot dispute as heavily sourced as true, agreed on by consensus by everyone else. EVERY other person who reviews the article likes the lengther article, with more information, (Ewulp for instance wrote and recommended we add information on Bonnie's childhood and youth). No one else wants to slice the article up. That pretty much sums it up, you are right, and he should take his issues with me and HE should request dispute resolution - perhaps if he asked, in addition to my asking, and Kate has recommended it, it would be granted. But you are dead right that his destruction of a great article is solely based on personal issues with me. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 01:57, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is not merely the weight, (but you make an excellent point which I will incorporate, because unloaded it would have been OVER 20% of her body weight, when loaded, the weight would have been nearly one third her body weight!) Also the Browning Automatic Rifle was an extremely difficult weapon to handle for anyone, when on fully automatic fire. And prior to 1937, it could only be fired wide open on automatic fire, at 550-600 rounds per minute, which is smoking! The option for slower automatic fire was not added till long after Bonnie and Clyde were dead. (I have fired one on fully auto wide open, and I don't care what the so called experts say, it is difficult to fire - witness the army adding the bipod to steady it in 1940! The resistance is much greater than that of a 12 guage shotgun, for instance, which is formidable) Since we cannot include original research, I will ponder it, change the wording, and you can check it for me. In any event, your help on this article has been invaluable and I hope I did not insult you, which I would not have deliberately done for the world! <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 09:16, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I always try, I will make my points short and to the point. MyTwoCents, once again, for the 109th time, you have failed to achieve consensus. 4 editors have stepped forward to oppose your changes in the last 24 hours alone. I agree with <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> on the deletion of the sentence involving the devolution of Bonnie, that issue is self explanatory. As to why, you have to read Treherne, and understand the effect a charismatic psychopath can have, especially on a person longing for romance and adventure the way Bonnie Parker was. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> also did a superb job on editing the introductory paragraphs, and the place the duo have in popular culture. As to the "machine gun" issue, again, I agree with <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> that simply listing the weight and specifics of the weapon, rate of fire, etc., is sufficient. We are an encyclopedia, and the reader will obviously draw the same conclusion I do: that no woman of less than 90 pounds can fire a fully automatic rifle some marines had trouble firing, that weighed one third of her body weight, or more. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">oldwindybear</a> did not say, probably because he could not source it with exactitude, that Clyde was probably using a bandoleer magazine, which would have made the weight well over 30 pounds, and absolutely unfirable by Bonnie. Back to the place the duo have in popular culture, <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> you cannot seem to grasp that for good or ill, this duo occupies a fairly unique place in the American cultural mythos. To this day, again, rightly or not, they represent to many a couple willing to strike a blow at an uncaring government. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 's use of quotes and references was beautifully done to try to explain why. Overall, the article tries to separate myth from fact, and explain why their legend has evolved as it has, which is not only legitimate for an encyclopedia, but as long as it is quoting fact and experts, necessary. These two are unique in that over 70 years after they died, they remain an enduring symbol to many people. While you delete the controversy on the ambush, (and I will address why you delete it shortly), I think is, if anything, understated. There are ample quotes, not in the article, that say today Hamer and the posse would be tried for murder, and Hamer executed or imprisoned for life, as he should have been. How anyone can possibly defend his allowing people to deface a dead girl and sell her bloody hair and clothes for souveners, is simply beyond my comprehension. That isn't law enforcement, it is pure vile murder. Finally, I absolutely agree with <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a>, and I think he put it very well, that Mytwocents destruction of this article is a personal attack on oldwindybear. Bluntly, you lacked consensus to force your changes before, you lack it now, the vast majority oppose you and will revert your deletions. Please do as admin Kate advised you, and take your personal issues with oldwindybear to dispute resolution, or, as <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> rather bluntly said, put them back in the closet while working on wikipedia. The article is a great one, thanks to everyone who worked on it. Take your personal issues elsewhere, and leave the article alone. You have absolutely no support for your proposed massive deletions.

<p>Hello <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">oldwindybear</a>, no offense taken, the reason I've been so polite here is that I'm dealing with some contributors like yourself who know this subject far better than I do. I can't add much to the historical account covered very thoroughly in the article so I've stuck mostly to cleanups and policing the language. I think that a number of the edits made by <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> are improvements and should be retained, others remove content that bears on the controversy and a discussion is in order. He's on the money in the Controversy &amp; Aftermath section where he's identified some redundant lines that can be removed with no loss. And "long, horrified pain-filled scream" is overwritten, 1 adjective too many. Some very long digressive quotes need to be kept on point. It's mostly about keeping the reader interested, and avoiding rhetoric <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 02:26, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> No offense taken, I believe you and I have worked very well together. I have edited the controversy section myself, (removing a number of redundancies, and tightening the language, while retaining the vital content) and you can let me know whether or not you agree with the changes. I did eliminate redundencies, and trimmed the language, while keeping in vital information - which is the trouble with MyTwoCents, he is editing to a POV and deleting vital information. I feel you have been, and are, far more neutral, and a good writer, who works well with me to eliminate redundent language - much as AndyZ did on weasal words - while still retaining the important content. SO, I have eliminated some redundent lanugage, (such as the warrants on Bonnie) and changed the scream sentence to read exactly as Ted Hinton wrote it, "a long horrible scream" which is eliminating the extra adjective. I appreciate your help and insight, and feel it invaluable that I have it, because I do feel you are a better writer, and again, quite neutral, simply seeking to improve the article while retaining the content. Thanks, and let me know whether the changes I make are satisfactory. The trouble with working with Mytwocents is I cannot. I have tried, and he simply removes massive amounts of content. <b>But if he will finally list specific facts and sentences, I will attempt, as I feel others will, to work with him. But, as you pointed out, he must list his proposed changes, so we can discuss them.</b> In the interim, I have consensus not to remove content as he wishes - but am very open, as I hope you know, from our previous work, to changes to improve the article, or better achieve NPOV. SO, let me know if the changes I made are acceptable, and addressed your concerns...<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 02:42, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will admit I am terse. I usually let the edit summary suffice for my explanation for my changes. I will make my changes using the preview button and then pull the trigger on the 'save page' button. I am sincere, and put some thought into my editing. My problem with this page is not the facts, but it's balance and the pushiness of some of the statements. I probably need to work on my communication skills......<a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> 04:32, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a>&#160;: The article is much improved, and as always it's a pleasure to work with you on it. I hope <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">MyTwoCents</a> will discuss some of his suggestions because I think we're all persuadable. Just for example, the Jimmy Fowler quote that MyTwoCents wants to cut from the Bonnie section is in my opinion iffy. It makes a great wrapup to the section, but Fowler is a theater critic not a historian, and maybe not a good enough source for a forceful statement like, "police admitted that she was no bloodthirsty killer". Fowler is casually paraphrasing unnamed police, which is not ideal in an encyclopedia article, even though the article makes it clear that she was not wanted for any violent crime, so he's in effect right. It would be good to hear what others think about this quote, acceptable or not? There are other issues of this type that could be resolved through calm discussion. Anyway, the article looks better and better. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 05:05, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> Thanks for the thoughts on the work I did last night, <b>and it is always a pleasure to work with you on this.</b> I also support the changes you made afterwards - each acted to tighten the article. Your editing skills are superior, and I enjoy working with you. We work so well together because my research skills are good, and since AndyZ taught me to link and source, I do that part well, but you have absolutely great language and writing skills, and can take my raw research and history and rework it in a superior way to flow in the article. Your help is GREATLY appreciated, and I may ask you to look at some of my other work, especially in the military history project, because I think you could really help me there also, if you would not mind?</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Fowler quote, I personally like the Fowler quote because it really sums up what happened in a way that is undisputable - literally Bonnie went from high school literary star, and stump politician warm up, to riding with rage filled Clyde. During the peer review, AndyZ felt that quotes were the best way to deal with subjective interpretations, and weasal words, and this quote specifically acts to sum up her devolution, and he is unquestionably correct. Yes, he is a theater critic, but he is commenting on the stage play, movie, and history of Bonnie Parker, and, as you pointed out, is a great wrap up to the section. The problem is, if we eliminate it, what do we replace it with to wrap the section up? The peer review found that quotes were the best way to do such wraps when controversial. But I will abide by consensus, as always. I think it should stay, or we should craft replacement language all can agree on, so I am open to suggestions...</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> the issue for me is not your communication skills, it is your absolutest attitude that you, and you alone, decide what is NPOV. You must accept that we operate by consensus - if you can, I will be pleased to work with you, and discuss changes. This is one such issue. If you wish to replace the Jimmy Fowler quote to wrap that section, what would you suggest we replace it with? The section still needs a wrapping statement - what would you suggest? I am willing to work with anyone, and certainly <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> and I have worked well together, as I have with AndyZ and Randazzo. But as a for instance, you would eliminate the third introductory paragraph also. That is totally unacceptable. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> rewrote all three introductory paragraphs, and three is the wikipedia norm - and each serves a purpose. THREE introductory paragraphs, each with a topic, the first to introduce the duo, the second to introduce the most controversial issue, that of Bonnie's real role versus perceived public role in the gang, and the third introdcutory paragraph brings up and introduces an issue vital to the article, the enduring place in the American lexicon of popular mythic figures that Bonnie and Clyde have, and why, emphasizing what historians have found, that the presence of a pretty girl elevated their acts into the heroic, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, and that legend persists to this day. (and it is vtial to note that that issue, of a pretty girl in the gang elevating their acts is NOWHERE else in the article! <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> rewrote that paragraph, nothing in it, especially the vital quote, is redundant!) ALL THREE were approved in the peer review, and <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> rewrote them to eliminate redundent language, and tighten up. This is VITAL to the article, and perfect the way <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> wrote it. That is one example where you chopped out a whole paragraph without discussion, where consensus had approved three, and a great writer had rewritten - and Ewulp is one of our best editors for language edits! - and we all approved those changes.</li>
<li><b>But that does not mean we can not work together! But let us start with the Fowler quote, as <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> suggested. If you want to replace it, what would you replace it with?</b> Bring your thoughts here, and all of us can discuss any potential change, as <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> and I always do, working together. I am open to removing it if replacement language can be agreed on. What would you replace it with? It does, as Ewulp says, do a great job of wrapping that section. What would you replace it with? Let us discuss it first, achieve consensus on language and go from there. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> has rightly idetified this as a good paragraph and quote to discuss and achieve consensus. I like the quote because it is such a great wrap for the paragraph, but if you wish to replace it, what would you replace it with? Let us work together if you have a better wrap up paragraph or statement, and discuss same here. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 10:25, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think the <i>Bonnie and Clyde were among the first celebrity criminals....</i> paragraph serves the purpose. <i>The Finally trying to put the duo's appeal to the public during the depression in perspective.....</i> statement is redundant, is lifted from the source, and is not encyclopedic in tone. It should go. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> 16:10, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree completely. Those are direct quotes, which AndyZ and Crystal specifically approved in the peer review, and which <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> edited in the closing. You see, this is why we never get anywhere. You want to delete good material. You say it is not encyclopedic in tone, but it is absolutely perfect in encyclopedic tone. Direct quotes, to quote AndyZ during the peer review, are the best way to avoid subjective interpretations on controversial subjects. The first section you cite introduces the section, and the later closes another section and the entire article. Both are highly appropriate, and perfect in tone, and respectfully, I have consensus to keep them. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> this is why we get nowhere. You were supposed to come here and discuss the Jimmy Fowler quote, and what if any language should or could replace its closing. Instead, you come here and suggest deleting material you know perfectly well I have consensus to keep, which are unquestionably quoted directly from historians and experts on the duo, and which are perfect for the sections in first introducing the subjects of the article, and for the later, in closing the article and assessing the duo's legacy in the popular mythos. So no, you may not delete either. If you wish to get serious, and discuss the Jimmy Fowler quote, or language to replace it, I am willing to listen and work with you. But on the quotes in the sections you cite, no, they both stay, and we have been through this repeatedly, and every time I have consensus to keep them. In point of fact, AndyZ suggested use of them to eliminate weasal words and subjective interpretations, and approved both, as did every other user, but yourself. THEY STAY. Now, do you want to discuss the Jimmy Fowler quote, or does it simply stay? I am certainly open on that one to replacement language but as I told <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> you are not really interested in editing as language issues, you don't dispute facts, you want to delete material you dislike. Sorry, that is out. I note again in closing, I am open to discussing the Fowler quote, but the sections you mention are perfect as is, and 7 editors have approved them, to your one opposing, you lose, and for good reason. There was an excellent reason <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> left both those quotes in - they are from different sources and introduce and close a section. The former opens the article, while the last closes the article, with a powerful sumnation on why these two people, a relative minor league crime pair, were and are so enduringly powerful in the national consciousness. The first statement says they were the first celebrity criminals - the later explains why, and more, explains their enduring appeal in a wonderful quote from one of the three most highly regarded Bonnie and Clyde historians. You say direct source material, though properly credited, is inappropriate in an encyclopedia - you must not read Britannica, or any of the others, which ALL use credited direct material! AndyZ explained to you more than once during the peer review that is the best way to avoid subjective interpretations of controversial material! They are from different sources, and while you do not think so, everyone else wants as much information - without reducdancy (which these, from different sources, are not) - as possible to provide the best article. That is true NPOV, not deleting material you dislike. Especially the final paragraph, which is among the most powerful closings anywhere in wikipedia, in any article. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:05, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

==Look Here==To user Mytwocents: you have been told by 4 editors to stop deleting whole sections of this article, and you refuse to stop. You have been told and are being told that your deletions are POV, by four different editors. If you make these deletions one more time, I will join the other edtiors in asking that you be permanently banned for defying a peer review, defying consensus, and vandalizing an article because you personally dislike the primary author, oldwindybear. Take notice that you have been warned, today, specifically, by three editors to stop, myself, Stillstudying, and oldwindybear, and Ewulp supports the article as is. You do not have the authority to defy consensus, so stop or we will ask for your permanent banning for imposing your POV against consensus and a peer review. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a></p>

Mytwocents is not willing to do that. He wants to delete more material. That being said, I agree that if he deletes again, the three editors who have warned him against it should ask for his permanent banning. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> I am sorry - you and I work well together, because you are a very reasonable person. Mytwocents is not. Instead of talking about the quote you identified, he wants to - and you noted it -delete again. You said it best: (about Mytwocents deletions: "others remove content that bears on the controversy and a discussion is in order." You and I cleaned up the controversy section - actually to give the proper credit, your clean up followed my attemps, lol! You noted a specific issue that Mytwocents suggested which was reasonable to discuss removing and replacing, and I asked him to do that. Instead, he wants to remove the closing paragraph which was specifically upheld by the peer review and reedited by yourself, and is an incredibly powerful closing for an article. This kind of deletion, which is pure vandalism, has to stop. 3 editors have taken a firm stand against it, and you oppose deletion without discussion. I am in full agreement of that stance. Mytwocents, your proposed deletions are opposed by consensus. They are POV by consensus. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> gave us both a good place to try to compromise, and I offered to do so, and you came back with more deletions and ignored Ewulp's suggestions in favor of delete, delete, delete. NO, AND IT STOPS TODAY. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandazzo56_08f9.html" title="User:Randazzo56">randazzo56</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> are right, and by consensus we are telling you to stop deleting at two edits, or face permanent banning.

I have accepted that perhaps we will both be banned, and will accept my banning, if you are also banned, because I feel so strongly that your removal is vital to wikipedia, since you absolutely refuse to work with others, absolutely refuse to accept the rules of engagement and mandate to work towards agreement, and disucss changes, and absolutely feel your sole judgment should override everyone elses. That viewpoint is so negative and harmful to wikipedia that it must be removed, whatever the cost. It violates every rule of editors engagement stipulated on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a></li>

<dd>I have reverted every one of your edits, as they violate every one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> and having consensus to do so, except the excess language in the Clyde section - that having been brought to my attention, was PARTIALLY redundent, and I moved the part not redundent to the final run section. EVERY other edit was reverted, and will continue to be reverted, since I have consensus to do so. Sooner or later the admins will act, and I pray they will remove you from wikipedia. You are a true danger to it, because of your feeling you are superior and above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagementis" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagementis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagementis</a>, and may act unilaterally to not discuss changes, or work towards agreement and destroy consensus in utter and total defiance of the wikipedia rules as mandated -- <b>THESE RULES YOU ARE IGNORING ARE NOT DISCRETIONARY, YOU POST PROPOSED CHANGES, AWAIT REPLY, DISCUSS, AND IF NOT IN AGREEMENT, SEEK AGREEMENT</b>, on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a>. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 10:54, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some trims</span></h2>
<p>Here are a few more edits I will try in a few minutes, and the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>the material in parenthesis about Hamer in Final Run seems to me more detail than needed here, and is covered in the linked Hamer article for those interested</li>
<li>There are some lines in the Clyde section that aren't needed because they're covered in the Final Run section</li>
<li>Some adjustments for more a more neutral tone in Buck joins the gang</li>
</ul>
<p>and <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> I'll be glad to take a look at your work in Military History Project, as time permits -- I'm currently writing an overhaul of a "neglected" page so WP is taking over my life a little--I'm sure you know that feeling! <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 06:26, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>MyTwoCents beat me to it on the Clyde section--starting at (if I remember correctly) "It was an expensive...". A good edit. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 06:35, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I just told <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">MyTwoCents</a> via his User talk page, I'm of two minds about that Fowler quote--on the one hand it's a good quote to summarize the section, on the other hand it's a little like a historical article on for instance the Italo-Ethiopian War sporting a quote from Roger Ebert. But if it was a really outstanding quote it would be fine, and this one is very useful here-- my position is neutral on this one. At worst it's borderline, not something that has to go imho <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 07:15, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> I believe I have preserved your edits in the final run, and I have removed the lines in the Clyde section which were redundent. I also did the following</p>
<ul>
<li>reworked the final run section, which really should focus in toto on the Eastham Prison Break, which was literally their shining moment, in Clyde's eyes, (crazy though he was, he had yearned to strike at the prison system for years!) and trimmed some excess language;</li>
<li>MyTwoCents did not discuss his other edits, which all deleted material, especially the final paragraph, which I restored in total.</li>
<li>3 other editors have voted to keep the information on Fowler, and you are neutral - I was willing to discuss replacement language but he simply removed it without discussion - so I reverted.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> can make whatever edits he choses, and the admins are going to have to decide how long he deletes and we revert; this can go on forever, but I know Kate and some of the other admins, and I don't believe they will allow this indefinately. I won't allow him to delete material without consensus, in violation of every rule, "post proposed change or disputed facts, await reply, discuss, work towards agreement and discuss changes" - he wantonly violates virtually every one of the rules as mandated in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> and deletes wholesale where consensus have been achieved on the material staying, in complete defiance of the 27 rules.</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> there is a vital principle at play here, and I am sure you can see it. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> simply refuses to even discuss issues such as the Fowler quote -which you admit, though by an arts critic, is simply outstanding for summing up the section - he simply deletes. Ditto for the closing paragraph, which a peer review, and 7 of us have voted to keep. He simply cannot be allowed, on principle, to come here and unilaterally delete material without discussion. He is unilaterally destroying the wikipedia policy on editing as stipulated in the rules of engagement, which mandate "work towards agreement and discuss changes" - he wantonly violates virtually every one of the rules as mandated in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> And I will not permit him to do it. Perhaps admin will finally act and bann us both. I would rather both of us be banned than permit one person to destroy the concept of consensus which is so vital to wikipedia editing. We work with each other, respecting each other's work - and he is the only editor I have ever worked with, who simply refuses, and deletes at will. VERY WELL, I must stand up to him, and have consensus to do so.</li>

<dd>It is always a pleasure working with you, when you have time, I just rewrote the entire article on the Mongol Invasion of Central Asia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Central_Asia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Central_Asia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Central_Asia</a> for the Military Committee - I would like your opinion on the general tone - there is no question I got the historial accuracy right, but your formidable editing and language skills would be a great help in assessing the overall rewrite. It is interesting you mention the Italian-Ethiopian War, we lived in Addis Ababa for 3 years when I was young, and even in the late 50's and early 60's the impact of that war was quite great on the Ethiopians. Let me say in closing I enjoy working with you, and I have considered carefully the consequences of my actions. I truly believe the principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> are so vital that they must be preserved at all costs. I enjoy working on wikipedia, and except for this person, Mytwocents, and one other, now permanently banned, have been able to work with everyone. But this user, Mytwocents, is simply so violative of the rules, so arbitrary in his absolute refusal to abide by the 27 rules, that he must be halted, or this kind of chaos will spread, and what Jimbo has built so carefully, with our help, those of us willing owrk with others, will be destroyed. I would go myself, provided this user goes also, in order to preserve the vital principles of post a proposed change, wait for reply, discussion, work towards agreement, and the other 23 rules mandated in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writers%27_rules_of_engagement</a> - all of which this user is simply ignoring. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 12:31, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
