<h2><span class="mw-headline">"orthodox economic theory"</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As the leader of the "Drop the Debt" Campaign, Bono has been strongly criticised in asking the top twenty-five wealthiest countries to write off the debts owed by the poorest countries. Critics claim that this amounts to asking the public to pay for the debt, <i>even though orthodox economic theory would suggest that it would (in the long run) make both developed and developing nations better off.</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h2>
<p>The explanation of his nickname should be moved to the first mention of him obtaining it. Placing it further down in the article leads to confusion and it seems out of place there.</p>
<p>Translating "Bono Vox" as "voice of the good man" doesn't correspond to any Latin construction I'm aware of. To say "of the good man", it seems far better to put the adjective "bonus, -a, -um" in the genitive singular: "Boni Vox". However, the name "Bono" could very well be interpreted as a dative singular neuter, in which case "Bono Vox" would mean "a voice *for the good*". Am I missing something, any classicists who may be reading this, or is the foregoing paragraph correct? I don't want to change the article before checking with others who may be more knowledgeable.</p>
<p>Bonavox was a name of a hearing aid shop and he was called Bono because someone mistook the where the o and the a were.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right. A while ago, I put something in the article about it literally translating to "the voice to the good man," but for is an alternate use of the dative. Anyway, it seems people don't want to make him seem really ignorant. The article says "roughly" to describe the translation. It's very rough. It almost looks like someone with a Spanish background figured that bono must be the masculine version.</dd>

<p>There are stories about misreading signs.. When you hear "Ye Olde ____," it isn't Ye, and has nothing to do with ye; someone misread a <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorn.html" title="Thorn">thorn</a>, (looks like a p combined with an l), the Old Engish version of "th," and wrote Y.</p>

<p>Why is this section called "social justice?" Call it what it is: socialism. Calling it "social justice" is biased because it assumes that wealth redistribution is just and that in order to have a just society, everyone must have equal wealth. These are socialist principles and should be labeled as such. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 158.135.1.92 (<a href="../../../1/5/8/User_talk%7E158.135.1.92.html" title="User talk:158.135.1.92">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.135.1.92_8ad6.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.135.1.92">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

The Bill of Rights of our own Constitution is made up of many social justice ideals, including freedom of thought, liberty of conscience, political liberties (e.g. representative democratic institutions, freedom of speech and the press, and freedom of assembly), freedom of association, freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person (viz: freedom from slavery, freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation); and rights and liberties covered by the rule of law.</dd>

</ul>
<p>Being nominated for the Peace Prize is an honor, but it is not official and not necessarily prestigious. Any national legislator or about a third of the university professors in the world can make a nomination, and there have been as many as 140 some years. Nominators are requested to keep their nominations secret, so it's only those wishing publicity who make announcements. Altogether, I see no reason to keep it.

<p>Since we've decided to take out the Nobel nominations (I know he's been nominated more than once...I remember that he was on the list back the Elevation days, too), what's the verdict on his being (one of) TIME Magazine's Person of the Year 2005? It makes more since to include that than the Nobel nomination, since he actually GOT the award, but not if the goal is to try to move the focus of the article to his music career...--<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronM_c77d.html" title="User:AaronM">AaronM</a> 15:56, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe we could put that Bono was "considered" for the Nobel Prize, since we've got plenty of sources for that. That does not deserve more than a line or two in the "Social Justice" section, though. The goal IS tomove the focus to his musical career, but I guess we shoud do that by ADDING more info about his work with U2.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKristbg_52e5.html" title="User:Kristbg">Kristbg</a> 16:49, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Billy Corgan</span></h2>
<p>The line about Bono being "lifelong" friends with Billy Corgan seems unlikely. Bono grew up in Ireland; Billy in Chicago. More than a decade separates the time when they first achieved fame. Also, I doubt that Billy is actually one of Bono's top two favorite musicians. Bono says that kind of thing about quite a few musicians. For example, in a recent book of interviews with a French journalist, he says something to the effect that Bob Dylan's work is important to him than anyone else's.</p>

<dd>This makes no sense. Even if it was true, which I doubt, it it irrelevant and should not take that much space in the article. I removed it. --<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKristbg_52e5.html" title="User:Kristbg">Kristbg</a> 14:18, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Christianity?</span></h2>
<p>Shouldn't this article mention the fact that Bono is a Christian? It seems pretty central to his worldview. I'm not sure how to edit it or even what to say, so hopefully someone in the future could phrase it correctly.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it should be included. However the category of "Born-again Christians" might not be correct. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/arts/books/1989/05/bono.html" class="external text" title="http://www.motherjones.com/arts/books/1989/05/bono.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> he says "I never really accepted the whole "born again" tag...

<dd>I think you have to allow that he is generally accepted to be "born again". (Actually, you quote him saying that he accepts it on the (let's call it) spiritual level. He goes on to say that what he doesn't accept is the political implications that it brings.) He gave a <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2005/bono-0805.html" class="external text" title="http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2005/bono-0805.html" rel="nofollow">long interview, or series of interviews to Christianity Today</a>, which <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/003/2.38.html" class="external text" title="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/003/2.38.html" rel="nofollow">previously profiled him</a>, which describe his beliefs very well. I think people generally consider him "born again" because he has a nondemoninational faith that he adopted having rejected his native faith, if that makes sense. I don't have a horse in the race myself and I don't have the inclination to fix this rather poor article but I think you were a bit rash to remove the category. Still, if you're convinced that the evidence points elsewhere, please go ahead and recategorise him. Personally, I'm not all that keen on "label" type categories anyway.

<p>On his most recent Vertigo tour, He sported a headband with symbols of Islam, Christianity and Judiasm. He belives that all three religions are true. This, i belive, is a departure from Christian views</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. The symbols helped spell out the word "Coexist." I think a fair interpretation is that he thought the three religions (and indeed all religions) should be able to get along with each other.</dd>

<p>In the British TV show Bono's Millions, the childhood friend being interviewed ends the programme by saying that Bono will not be happy until the Pope is a Protestant. That humourous comment hints that his schoolfriends thought that he was more inclined to the Church of Ireland. Anyway, it would be better to also have him mentioned under Roman Catholicism than to remove him from the Church of Ireland. Rockdgu6 00:36, 16 Octover 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If He is listed as beig and Irish Anglican I think it would be safe to list him as a Roman Catholic, since we do not know what religion he chose (or was raised as). I'm putting it.</p>
<p>I try to put it but somebody keeps reporting me for vandalism, plus on Bono and The Edge: Off The Record, Bono says he suffers from Catholic guilt. The page is blocked fr vandalism, someone put it for me, please.</p>

<dd>Seem him in concert and he does play on occassion. I do think that the statement"Bono was relegated to vocals only" isn't appropriate. Everyone knows him and the edge but not really the remaining ones. 71.28.245.177 22:11, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bono was never shown playing guitar in the early videos and I never saw him play guitar in concert on the Boy or October US tours. The first time I saw him play was in Rattle and Hum and that was the 4th U2 concert I saw. To say that he initially played guitar and wrote songs and later became relegated to vocals implies a conversation between the band members that may or may not have happened. . . but for which there is no evidence. What we do know is that he and Edge have written most of the songs that made them Rolling Stone's Band of the Decade for the 1980's. Why wasn't that mentioned? Bono plays guitar on "A Day Without Me" on the Red Rocks Video.</p>

<p>Bono and U2 didn't happen upon their activism, as mentioned in the Social Justice section of this article, in the 90's. I attended U2 concerts in the mid 80's where they mentioned Unicef and encouraged their fans to become involved in the organization on behalf of poor children. Unicef should be mentioned and linked. Thanks.</p>
<p>This article moves from showing up at the audition for U2 to 1999 and debt reduction. I think it skips a year or two. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 07:05, Apr 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is a real mess as it is... As said before, there's little about his musical career, there are sentences thrown around, out of context... I think it should be cleaned up.

<p>According to the BBC Bono is worth about 108 million pounds or about 180 million dollars. This is his liquid assetts and does not cover fixed or future assetts (such as royalties). To be 'born again' dont you have to give 'sell your possessions and follow me'? I look forward to the day when I hear Bono makes a $10+ million donation. There's also something about a rich man and a camel I believe.</p>

<p>(RED) is a campaign that has a well-known brand (so far the list includes Armani, the GAP, AmEx, etc.) design a product, usually in red, to raise both awareness and funds towards the issues faced by the African continent.</p>
<p>(RED) is a new line of credit-card by American Express. Amex will donate 1% of revenues generated by consumers who purchase certain "African-made" products with the card to combat AIDS in Africa.

Bono has an honourable desire to tackle some world problems, how he goes about it, we may disagree on.

<p>I know theres a critisism here, but I wouldn't be neutral enough to Edit it. I'd probably get booted off wikipedia. But using a 'celeb' party to promote the issue of Aids in Africa as a smokescreen to aquaint a south african casino operator with the UK prime minister to help smooth a business deal hardly smacks of charity. Perhaps there should be another section below critisms that deal with companies that use Bono's image as an humanitarian to further their own agendas and financial dealings.</p>

<p>Who on earth moved the page unilaterally to <i>Paul David Hewson</i>. No-one calls him that, not even his family. Wikipedia's rules are laid out clearly under the Manual of Style. We use the <i>Most Common Name</i> of a person, i.e., the name they are most widely known by. That is Bono.

<dd>Perhaps you didn't read the signatures too carefully, but at no point have you pointed out anything that I did wrong. As for the swearing, grow up, little man. A phrase like "lighten the fuck up" is said with the utmost calm. In fact, it's rather like its counterpart, "Calm the fuck down". Either phrase is meant to be the catalyst for some meaningful introspection, and perhaps a bit of the kicking back with a cold beverage and realizing that none of it really matters that much as long as we're all contributing something meaningful. This post is a perfect example. If at any point you feel that educating someone on the internet about basic matters of etiquette would be a worthwhile or otherwise fruitful venture, it's either time to go to sleep, or time to remove the pole from your rectum.

I think those languages he "reportedly" speaks should be looked into, if not removed. <a href="../../../e/n/a/User%7EEnakarasuma_605b.html" title="User:Enakarasuma">Enakarasuma</a> 23:01, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticisms cleanup</span></h2>
<p><i>Oddly, despite his devotion to his homeland (he has always lived there, even when the lack of musical infrastructure would have suggested London or New York to be better launchpads for U2, he is less than loved in Ireland.[citation needed] U2 are able to exploit a 1969 artists-tax exemption, intended to help struggling artists, and pay relatively little tax despite their great wealth (estimated at €800 million by the Sunday Times). This coupled with his charity campaigning has led to accusations that he is two-faced in the Irish Media. When he criticised the Irish government for not meeting the target of 0.7% of GDP to be set-aside for the 3rd World - a politician suggested that if he paid his taxes then the government would be half way to meeting the figure.[citation needed]</i></p>
<p>Somehow, I don't think we really need this. The first few lines are heavily opinionated (and I don't think there are any references that say that Bono isn't liked in Ireland), beyond the amount acceptable for Wikipedia. On top of that, there are no sources for the whole 0.7% GDP debarcle, and we don't even know which politician this person's on about! The use of the word "exploit" in this context is inappropriate (too opinionated).</p>
<p>Personally, I think that this paragraph can just go. I'll leave it here so that, in case anyone STRONGLY disagrees, they can put it back. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebrat_8637.html" title="User:Sebrat">Sebrat</a> 18:59, 8 August 2006</p>
<p>Excuse me Sebrat - check out last Sunday's Irish Sunday Independent at unison.ie which exclusively reported that U2 are moving their entire business operation to Amsterdam in order to avoid an Irish tax clampdown... In Monday's Irish Times, Bono was described in a leader as "not much of an Irishman" in relation to this so I think this must go back in. The politician quoted was Conor Lenihan. This is important because it shows Bono's latent hypocrisy, lecturing governments while refusing to pay tax in his own country.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebrat_8637.html" title="User:Sebrat">Sebrat</a> - Touché. This does need a cleanup, though, because it comes out sounding opinionated. Can we rewrite it so that it has more verifiable sources?</p>
<p>NOT everyone can be a rock star and a humanitarian activist. Imagine letting Robbie Williams lecture us on Third World poverty, for example, or Keith Richards. But Bono manages it. He pulls off the tricky feat of being simultaneously hip and worthy, combining a rock star image with a social conscience. I can't think of too many people who could persuade a Pope to wear wraparound shades.</p>
<p>Bob Geldof has had to surrender his rock star status and Coldplay' Chris Martin is regarded as a bit eccentric, but Bono continues to fill stadiums and trounce boy bands in the charts - while retaining the muscle to co-organise the Live 8 concert and attend world economic summits. He has moral authority, a quality our spiritual and some of our political leaders aspire to but few achieve. There are many more pretenders to moral authority than holders of it, largely because it's built up painstakingly over years; it doesn't materialise off-the-peg when someone is handed a mitre or a ministerial box.</p>
<p>Moral authority can evaporate overnight, however.</p>
<p>Bono's hasn't been destroyed but it has sustained collateral damage. And all to save a fairly paltry sum of money if you're a multi-millionaire. Now that a generous tax break is being capped - a get-out-of-jail-free card on royalties which has served the band's finances well for 20 years - U2 has whipped its music publishing business out of Ireland and into Holland. By going along with this, Bono saves his share of an estimated €15m a year.</p>
<p>In the context of U2's joint worth €690m, give or take the odd million, according to this year's Sunday Times Rich List, it's the equivalent of you or I saving ourselves the price of a few tanks of petrol. Definitely not worth the PR fallout.</p>
<p>If Bono belonged to the Mick Jagger/Rod Stewart rock school nobody would bat an eyelid. We accept they're hopelessly self-absorbed, and inclined to husband their resources and invest their squillions with a passion once directed at rock 'n' roll.</p>
<p>But Bono is a different class of rock star - a gifted performer but a rounded human being besides. A rock star with a cause, if you like. Granted, we occasionally tease him about his messianic complex, but most of us are proud to count him as a fellow Irishman. I am, for what it's worth.</p>
<p>I remember watching in amazement when he disembarked from a flight to Los Angeles on which I was also a passenger, to be mobbed by US immigration officials. I always assumed these guys had their jaws wired shut as soon as they were hired, so sullen are they, but they queued up to high-five Bono. He was first off the flight and last out of the terminal, while his wife minded the luggage and smiled patiently. You had the impression Ali Hewson was no stranger to waiting around while Bono fielded admirers.</p>
<p>And it's not only because he's a rock star, it's because he's something better than that. He's a rock star who uses his privileged position to make a difference. He knows he'll be mocked for it, and I expect Larry and the other lads occasionally tell him to give over with the preaching, but it doesn't deter him. Bono doesn't care about looking uncool from time to time because he sees how world leaders prick up their ears when he opens his mouth.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;That's because said world leaders can exploit him and his pathetic little has-been mentor Geldof by smiling on pictures with them to appear compassionate and 'with it'. These guys have helped nothing but their own record sales, and debt cancellation is a short-sighted joke&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Of course he and his fellow U2 members pay tax on other sources of income in Ireland. In this case they're availing of a legal loophole to protect their wealth, as the super-rich tend to do. But the decision to move their music publishing out of the Irish tax net and into a safe haven puts them in the same bracket as Denis O'Brien. Remember him? He made around €300m from the sale of Esat and avoided capital gains tax by opportunistically taking up residency in Portugal. Outrageous behaviour, but completely within the law, thanks to the non-resident wheeze. It's tax avoidance, not tax evasion. Leaves a sour taste in your mouth, all the same, doesn't it?</p>
<p>I guess maybe if you're a superstar long enough, the rarefied air you breathe can blind you to what ordinary people consider acceptable. Clearly you're astute enough to buy the best possible financial expertise, Bono, but don't you also hire PR advice? If you do, you're not heeding it here.</p>
<p>Because opting out of paying tax on your royalties in Ireland at a time when the rest of us are facing into leaner times - dearer mortgage repayments, savage hikes to gas, oil and electric bills - is a bad call. Especially if you want us to listen when you talk about debt cancellation for developing countries. The moral high ground is looking a little shakier than it was this time last year, with your face attached to the Make Poverty History crusade.</p>
<p>Tax isn't money entirely down the drain, even if it sometimes feels that way looking at the wasteful use this Government has made of boomtime revenues. More to the point, paying tax along with us is part of what makes you one of us.</p>
<p>Go down the tax avoidance road and you may as well pack up your banners and slogans and prepare for the Mick Jagger phase of your career.</p>
<p>I'd call that a shameful waste of talent.</p>

<p>Your attempt at sarcasm fails when we do see that the people that Bono are 'attempting' to help, must walk miles to achieve and gain basic necessities and living standards (water, medicine etc.) While Bono and his lads have just purchased themselves a private Air Jet to fly them around the world (possibly in grand luxury). With all the rhetoric that Bono puts out about world poverty, his personal actions (besides mouthful of words) has been sadly lacking in helping the people that he says he wants to help. Now, THAT is scandalous.</p>

Enlighten me. Does he really deserve as much praise as those on the front lines? Medecins Sans Frontieres, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and even Madonna has in comparison, done more for the African cause.</p>

<p>Yeah, I get sick of hearing this BS. He devotes so much time and effort into Africa. Most wealthy don't even pay attention to it, yet they are not persecuted for lack of effort towards Africa.

<p>I have switched the section titled "Criticism" to be a subsection of humanitarian work. Why? Well to me it's quite simple - all of the criticism, and there is tons of it for some reason, has to do with his humanitarian work. It has nothing to do with the band or anything else. When reading the 'criticism' section almost everything seems to be criticizing and rebuking 'humanitarian work.' Therefore it's a subsection.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism Cleanup</span></h2>
<p>Ok guys, this is getting really bad. <b>The criticism section makes up 22% of the article.</b> Wikipedia is NOT a soapbox! Because of this section this article is beginning to look like a joke. Quotes on his tax evasion are like listening to 6 year olds argue back and forth. "He doesn't pay his taxes." "He doesn't have to pay his taxes." "But he could be paying more taxes."</p>
<p>Love him or hate him, this section needs to be shortened. Folks, lets remember that the most powerful and meaningful statements are expressed clearly and in short statements. The section, currently, is making everyone look bad, whether your Pro-Bono (no pun intended) or Anti-Bono.</p>
<p>Now, if you guys want me to clean it up I will&#160;:). But I'm no expert on Bono's tax evasion ways. I'll simply eliminate whatever the world doesn't care about and try to keep it at a NPOV.

<li>I've changed the cleanup tag to a more specific 'sounds like a review' tag, which it does. See the banner links for more information. As I said earlier, this article should not be a soapbox. Remember that Wikipedia's policies state that minority opinions, especially those in extreme minority, do not, and sometimes should not even be talked about. I'm not saying that's the case here, I'm just saying it needs to be discussed.</li>
<li>The section does not present a NPOV. It's basically a Bono bash section. <b>Both POV need to be presented here.</b> So, I've added the tag until this gets resolved.</li>
<li>Offtopic - Is it on topic to discuss how he is a board member of a parent company who's subsidiary makes a game who's plotline is the invasion of whatever? (See my brain is already forgetting what the hell we're talking about because it thinks we're off topic.) This needs to be discussed. Any one else's brain feeling like this?</li>
