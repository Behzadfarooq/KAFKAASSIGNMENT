<p>The article often refers to the significant critical acclaim for this or that album. What critics? Any references?</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, Bon Jovi is right up there with the most critically <i>disclaimed</i> bands of all time.</p>

<dd>Hey I'm the anonymous user. My name's David, and it's anonymous only cause I don't have an account. I'm new here and not really sure of the conventions. I was just browsing and thought I'd express my opinion to improve the accuracy of the article... not sure what warranted abuse... I don't think mainstream TV stations have much claim to critical kudos, but even if they did, the substantial amount of negative press should not be completely swept under the carpet. At the very best, Bon Jovi’s critical status is "mixed", rather than consistently acclaimed. No need to get personal, I've got nothing against you if the band you like doesn't have much cred with critics. Don't be a hater!</dd>

<dd>By the way, if you're interested in a reference to an <i>actual</i> critic, here's a citation from a review by Jimmy Guterman, in <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bonjovi/albums/album/232107/review/5944130/slippery_when_wet" class="external text" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bonjovi/albums/album/232107/review/5944130/slippery_when_wet" rel="nofollow">Rolling Stone:</a>"Bon Jovi's band is barely functional: guitar solos pop up like afterthoughts, bass lines whine like spoiled children, and Jon Bon Jovi's voice is double- and triple-tracked in halfhearted attempts to cloak its blandness ... Jon Bon Jovi and his band serve up condescending sentiment, reducing every emotional statement to a barefaced cliché – either because they think that's all their audience can comprehend or because that's all <i>they</i> can comprehend. On Slippery When Wet, Bon Jovi sounds like bad fourth-generation metal, a smudgy Xerox of Quiet Riot." Please don't shoot the messenger! - David.</dd>

<p>I'm running on incomplete data for approximate sales of the albums. I'm relying on Gold/Platium certification data from the RIAA, this is both generally out of date and will be artificially low when international sales are taken into account.

<p>An editor named <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXinger_2fce.html" title="User:Xinger">Xinger</a> has repeatedly added a table to include just the latest Bon Jovi single, Have A Nice Day.

<p>83.23.217.83 added <i>You Give Love a Bad Name</i> from <i>Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back</i> to the "Original songs appear on" section of the discography on Oct 22, 2005. It was <i>Bad Medicine</i> that appears in that movie/on that soundtrack, but regardless neither of the songs belong in that section because they were previously released on proper Bon Jovi albums.</p>

<p>Someone added "I Want To Be Loved (with Frans Builder)" with some impressively high chart positions recently. I've been unable to discovery any kind of data to back this up - including on billboards own website, which should in theory list it at number one if that were true. And who is Frans Builder, and why is his name associated with the song?</p>
<p>Not saying it's not true, I'm just saying, it's all news to me, and I'd be interested to find out where that information was pulled from.</p>

<p>I don't know why people always revert it but Bon Jovi is obviously not a Hard Rock band. AC/DC is a Hard Rock band, Metallica is a Hard Rock band. What do they have in common? Nothing at all.
