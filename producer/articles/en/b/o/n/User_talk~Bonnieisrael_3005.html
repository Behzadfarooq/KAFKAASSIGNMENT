<h2><span class="mw-headline">In response</span></h2>
<p>You talked about opening up an RFC on Tom Harrison because of his block of Israelbeach. I plead with you not to do this, and I have three reasons for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Israelbeach made a legal threat, and has not actually withdrawn it. He said he <i>is not</i> pursuing any legal action, but he hasn't said that he <i>will not,</i> and in fact, his language specifically left open the possibility that he would purse the action in the future, so the *threat* of that action remains in place.</li>
<li>This whole thing has been escalating out of control, between the two RFCs and the legal threats and people being rude to each other. Why not just stop and take a breather?</li>
<li>Filing an RFC against an admin for his admin actions is a very serious thing, and it will put you and Israelbeach in an especially negative light. I don't think you want to get that kind of attention.</li>
</ol>

<dd><a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a>, thanks for your kind, intelligent and rational comments. But I must correct you on one item. I did study law and without any reasonable doubt Israelbeach declared that he would not take any legal action against a Wiki member. He stated that if he did he would "refrain" from editing, according to Wiki policy. What more does one want? Blood? There was no rational reason for Tom Harrison to block Israelbeach. What he should have done was request a clarification if this issue was not clear to him. Nope. He added more fuel to an existing fire instead. I agree that we should all "stop and take a breather" and start focusing on creating and editing articles, working as a team for Wiki's future. Blocking, as Tom Harrison did in this affair, was the wrong move at the wrong time.

<dd>There's a difference between (A) bringing legal action and (B) threatening to. I think it's clear Israelbeach isn't doing (A), at least not right now. But (B) is just as disruptive to Wikipedia. I think your definition of "legal threat" is slightly different from mine, and probably different from Tom's, but it doesn't really matter. I think the point is, if the comments Israelbeach left were directed at me, I would feel bullied, and the effect would be to discourage me from editing the article in question. Hence, he was blocked for 24 hours. If he was actually pursuing legal action, he'd be blocked permanently. The truth of the matter is, a 24 hour block is no big deal, it's just there to stop disruption from going totally ignored, which helps to control it. I do agree that the block added more fuel to the fire, but so did the threat, and so did the comment that lead to it, and so on. Hopefully the fire will die out, though, if no one feeds it. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 21:37, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to point out that since being unblocked, your only contributions to Wikipedia have been to vote against the deletion of two articles that are clearly very dear to Israelbeach. Voting in the name of a blocked user is classic sockpuppet behavior: if these are the only contributions you intend to make, don't be surprised when other users suspect you of being a sockpuppet. If you are indeed a real person with a mind of your own, and you really do wish to take part in the Wikipedia project, I appeal to you to make some useful contributions that are not related to the Israel News Agency. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 06:32, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>67,000 articles about the INA is a lot for a non-profit, part-time effort by Israeli journalists working for the INA since 1995. As the INA clearly states, it kicks into action during "times of crisis" in Israel. We are now at war. We need every pro-Israel, government press office accredited news organization to get their messages out. Please note that in the AfD vote, many votes came from the Islamic community - tragically supported by a few Israelis and user Danny. And people question why Israel loses the PR media war when are boys in uniform and are civilian populations in our northern and southern towns and cities are being fired upon? I see that the INA is now listed in Deletion Review.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sometimes people make mistakes</span></h2>
<p>But mistakes can be avoided if one confirms and verifies an accusation. That I have been called a sockpuppet, and blocked as being "suspected" as a sockpuppet is nothing less than harassment. I spoke with Danny Wool. I have a female voice. I am not Israelbeach. And I have no problem going open with my identity. My real name is Bonnie and you can write to me at bonniedon@gmail.com. By doing so you will now have my IP address and if you are an administrator who also ID's themselves - I will provide you with my last name and telephone number. Sometimes people make mistakes. Woggly has made many. And her obsession with Israelbeach has cost her dearly. There was no reason for her harassment of Israelbeach and stalking him here on Wikipedia. But this is now history. I am no sockpuppet. And those who allowed Woggly to block me owe me an apology. So if you still want to censor me, you will need to find another excuse other than "suspected sockpuppet." I want to continue contributing to Wiki, as my edits transcend the Israelbeach issue. Email me, let's talk.

<p>User:Redvers you are either a coward or a sockpuppet of Wool or Wale. <b>You fail to address the block</b> - that is an accusation of being a sockpuppet. No evidence. No checkuser. Not even a bother to email me to verify my identity. The difference between you and I is that I am ready to disclose my identity for purposes of accountability, as real editors in the real world do. While you censor behind a username. My words are real. My identity is real. I work with dozens of other editors in the real world here in Tel Aviv. I do not fear. You do. You fear me and Israelbeach.
