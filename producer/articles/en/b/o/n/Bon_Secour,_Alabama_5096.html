	    <p>"Bon Secour", Alabama (postal <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zip_code.html" title="Zip code">zip code</a> 36511) is located along the eastern coastline of Bon Secour Bay, (a contiguous bay that sits to the east of Mobile Bay). Over 35 miles due east of the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>-<a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> state line, near <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_Shores%2C_Alabama_632b.html" title="Gulf Shores, Alabama">Gulf Shores, Alabama</a> and over 45 miles west of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pensacola%2C_Florida_d556.html" title="Pensacola, Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a>. The name <i>"Bon Secour"</i> derives from the French phrase meaning "safe harbor" due to the secluded location on the inside coast of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Morgan_f0b3.html" title="Fort Morgan">Fort Morgan</a> peninsula of southern Alabama.<sup id="_ref-BSNWR_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BSNWR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bon Secour lies on the Bon Secour River. Elevation is 10 feet above sea level. The estuarial river system empties into Bon Secour/Mobile Bay.</p>
<p>The population of the town was recorded as 302 (see detailed <i>Demographics</i> below). However, since hurricane Ivan, single family housing developments and the population have continued to grow at an amazing rate.</p>
<p>Bon Secour is sometimes mentioned in <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane.html" title="Hurricane">hurricane</a> report statistics, for the region, since Bon Secour is the first town inside the eastern coastline of <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_Bay_6bdd.html" title="Mobile Bay">Mobile Bay</a> when entering the bay from the south, indicating weather and tide conditions for the population at the south end of Mobile Bay, nearest the entrance to the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Mexico_73a1.html" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. By contrast, <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile%2C_Alabama_e278.html" title="Mobile, Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a> is located near the (diagonally opposite) <i>north</i> end of Mobile Bay, much farther from the Gulf tide and hurricane storm surges.</p>
<p>Bon Secour has a rich history. It was originally a French fishing village settlement dating back to the late 19th century. Currently it is a beautiful, southern gothic, waterfront community that serves as a safe harbor (as named), to a current commercial fishing fleet. There are several major seafood industry businesses currently operating out of the Bon Secour estuary. Safe Harbor Seafood, Aquilla Seafood and Billy's Seafood all ship massive quantities of Gulf of Mexico seafood to all areas of the United States. The primary catch for the Bon Secour fishing fleet ranges from Mobile Bay shrimp to deep water "Royal Red" shrimp. Large shrimp boats line the shores of the Bon Secour River, docked at processing plants for packaging and shipment to all of America. One main point of pride within the community is the "Alabama Wild Shrimp Program." Because wild shrimp caught by the local fleet must compete with farmed shrimp from overseas, economic pressures have driven many, multi-generational shimpers out of the business. As a result, the local shimpers, along with shrimpers out of the Mobile area have formed an alliance, increased their marketing, public relations knowledge and efforts to brand Alabama, Wild Caught Shrimp. Their efforts have paid off. Marine science has indeed proven that wild caught shrimp from local waters are in fact less likely to contain contaminates than the farm-raised shrimp that have been imported from other countries. Still, the commercial shrimping industry in Bon Secour is hanging on by a very thin line.</p>
<p>Bon Secour is a very southern gothic, picturesque place, with huge water oak trees covered in Spanish moss, great blue herons, brown pelicans, ever present bottle-nosed dolphin pods and the potent smell of salty gulf waters everywhere. The local commercial fisherman that make their living from the Gulf are no less salty but also friendly. Other than the relatively small, family owned, seafood processing plants, Bon Secour is primarily made up of many rural neighborhoods, most of which enjoy beautiful vistas of the Bon Secour River and Bon Secour Bay. Brown Pelicans are everywhere and locals often see aligators from time to time, plying the waters of the estuarial system from the head waters of the Bon Secour River to the bay. One can see baby bottle-nosed dolphins playing near the mouth of the river at any time. In Bon Secour one can catch bass, brim, fresh-water catfish, then travel a few miles down river, to the bay and catch all manner of salt water fish, shrimp, and oysters in the same day. The natural beauty of the area is absolutely stunning!</p>
<p>Homes in the Bon Secour area are some of the oldest along the eastern Alabama Gulf Coast. With the arrival of the current development boom, post hurricane Ivan, property/houses in the area can go for anywhere from a hundred thousand dollars for an older, inland house to over several million dollars for a brand new mansion on the Bon Secour River banks or Bon Secour Bay. New, affluent, gated communities are springing up at an amazing rate. Those with the financial resources can purchase pristine, unadulterated land with million dollar views of a wonderful ecosystem complete with access to Mobile Bay, the Intracoastal Waterway and the maritime travel opportunities that such waterways provide. All you need is a yacht and the means to travel anywhere the Intracoastal waterway can take you. One can go from their own dock in Bon Secour, AL to Ft. Lauderdale, FL by water if they so please. You can circumnavigate the island or even pursue a trans-Gulf crossing if you have a big enough vessel and a enough seamanship experience for the voyage. Some local vessels have been known to travel from the Alabama Gulf Coast, across the Gulf of Mexico/Bay of Campeche´ to Cozumel, Playa Del Carmen, Cancun etc. AND BACK.</p>
<p>The amount of seabirds, tree frogs and other natural fauna that still live in the area is truly astounding and breathtaking for the lucky few who get to experience the pristine environment that is Bon Secour, Alabama.</p>
