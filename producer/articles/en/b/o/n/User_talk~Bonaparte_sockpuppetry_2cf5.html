<p>Could somebody give some evidence here? Maybe you think it's obvious to the people involved, but any serious accusation should really have some clearly-stated proof to back it up, and I don't see any proof (or links to it) here. –<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETifego_094d.html" title="User:Tifego"><small>Tifego</small></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/f/User_talk%7ETifego_c20d.html" title="User talk:Tifego">(t)</a></sup> <sub>21:36, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</sub></p>

<dd>Just unblock them all, Tifego, you will be doing Wikipedia a big favor. It is indeed obvious to the people involved, but for the people not involved it would require an experienced government agent a week to compile the dossier, though it would be quite an ovewhelming amount of evidence. Hard evidence, however, is not something to ask for, and in many cases it is irrelevant, because even if they are not socks, these accounts should be blocked. I do not plan on wasting time &amp; compiling an extensive dossier. Wikipedia rules are not that demanding for these cases. I can only laugh at those who demand unquestionable evidence. They are holding Wikipedia down. You are requesting a bit of evidence linked, however, and that's fine. I'm sure it will be forthcoming. Alexander 007 21:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It makes me uneasy, is all. This doesn't seem to have gone through any sort of official Wikipedia processes from what I see here. I don't like the idea that nearly anyone could be banned for holding a certain view or acting like another user who held that view, without any rationale given, simply because the "Wikipedia rules are not that demanding" for cases like this. It's not even clear why Bonaparte was banned in the first place, and I can't seem to find a discussion where it was decided to block him. It seems to be very personal against him. The apparent amount of hatred for him and pleasure being taken in the situation (and lack of respect for some admins) is a little disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure you have plenty of valid reasons and as far as I can tell these users do seem to be the same person, who felt the need to state the same POV quite a lot... I'm merely asking that all of this be made more clear on the page. It shouldn't be too hard, I think, to link to the relevant discussions that took place elsewhere (both on this sockpuppetry and the original ban) and a small handful of telling edit diffs. –<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETifego_094d.html" title="User:Tifego"><small>Tifego</small></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/f/User_talk%7ETifego_c20d.html" title="User talk:Tifego">(t)</a></sup> <sub>01:07, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</sub></dd>

So, the responsibility here goes to those editors who were directly involved during that period. Alexander 007 01:11, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And also, important point: these accounts are not blocked for just POV-pushing; aside from being suspected socks and pov-pushing, they also constantly engage in personal attacks (often in Romanian, often in English), harassment, they do not participate in resolving edits through careful discussion, rather they constantly revert, troll, and bully other users. Nasty bullying is a hallmark of these socks. Alexander 007 01:23, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, that settles it for me, especially some of the edit diffs of his that were brought up there, and the similar pattern of reverting with increasingly angry-sounding accusations across these usernames. It was hard to tell before from the user contributions just who was the initial aggressor and how many of the edits were simply a reaction to feeling harassed, but this makes it pretty clear. –<a href="../../../t/i/f/User%7ETifego_094d.html" title="User:Tifego"><small>Tifego</small></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/f/User_talk%7ETifego_c20d.html" title="User talk:Tifego">(t)</a></sup> <sub>02:25, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</sub></dd>

<dd>And just in case someone is wondering: this is not a case of something against Romanian POV; Bonaparte's edits cannot be called "Romanian POV"; the vast majority of Romanian editors do not align themselves with the edit technique of <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte">User:Bonaparte</a> and his socks. Bonaparte is in fact isolated, aside from a few who, through his socks, occasionally support some agenda of his (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorbertArthur_ab3b.html" title="User:NorbertArthur">User:NorbertArthur</a> being one example; but rather, the socks were supporting Norbert). You can enquire at <a href="../../../r/w/n/WP%7ERWNB_6e24.html" title="WP:RWNB">WP:RWNB</a> if you want. This diff is a good example of how isolated Bonaparte's socks have become:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Moldova&amp;diff=48085270&amp;oldid=48084693" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Moldova&amp;diff=48085270&amp;oldid=48084693" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>; it shows <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">User:Anittas</a> reverting <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasi_3d21.html" title="User:Iasi">User:Iasi</a>; anyone who knows Anittas' history knows that he has been seen as a "Romanian POV"-pusher himself. Yet he reverts Iasi... (this content dispute was not major however, but it once again shows that these socks are isolated) and then Iasi responds by harassing Anittas on <a href="../../../a/n/i/User_talk%7EAnittas_d652.html" title="User talk:Anittas">User talk:Anittas</a>, saying "you should be ashamed" and "if you were Romanian, you would not accept the separation of Romanians and Moldovans. I'm going to revert the text.". Anittas does not listen to Iasi, however. There are many examples of Iasi being a jackass and harassing any Romanian who disagrees with anything he says.

<p>I'm not convinced at all about User:Rybnitsa. We will see. I don't think it should be blocked yet. As far as I can tell, it separated Romanians from Moldovans in the text (? not a Bonaparte move).

<dd>It's funny actually - there are a lot of disruptive users that I never guessed were Bonaparte, not once. But he never fails to amaze me, as the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_CheckUser_53a4.html#NorbertArthur.2C_Andrei_George.2C_Bombonel.2C_.26_two_anons" title="Wikipedia:Requests for CheckUser">recent batch of socks</a> came in a few days ago, every single POV-pusher who was edit waring on Moldova-related articles (except for 1) turned out to be Bonny. And besides, he'll just make use of his open proxys (the exact reason why he was blocked) and just come back every day, probably for the rest of his life.&#160;:p His edits have hardly ever been neutral, and always seem to reek of <a href="http://mo.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Fratele_lui_Bonaparte%2C_il_cunosti%3F&amp;oldid=10375" class="external text" title="http://mo.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Fratele_lui_Bonaparte%2C_il_cunosti%3F&amp;oldid=10375" rel="nofollow">Romanian ultranationalism</a>. —<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 01:55, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid you missed my point... I'm not disputing the permanent blocking of Bonaparte and his reincarnations. My concern is that at times the attitude towards some user that <b>sounds</b> like Bonaparte is "shoot first, ask after". Now, if it turns out that the user <b>is</b> Bonaparte, by all means, block the lunatic; however, the mere fact that one sounds like Bonaparte doesn't automatically make one Bonaparte.

<dd>Yes, well I agree with you about the instance for Bidon, but usually Mikkalai has given his socks plenty of time of stop the disruption, and all of these times Bonaparte has not taken his advice.
