<h2><span class="mw-headline">This article is written by cross-over radio listeners</span></h2>
<p>If the article begins with ... most notable for their song "Tha crossroads" I can really see the guys who are Trying to write this are likely cross -over listeners. I've been trying to tell the things like they are.... Bone where obscure in their beinings, still, most people don't understand all the slang to actually figure out the true meaning of their Lyrics. They changed very much for their 1997 release, and not only lyrically but instrumentally as they got a little away from the G-funk... Whatever, I'm just tired of trying to make the article look less like: Bone is "Tha crossroads", tha crossroads is bone, I even don't have that track!... and for what?... I got plenty of thuggish thang from these guys to listen to... To mainstream Bone is tha crossroads, 1st of tha month and some featuring with a R&amp;B act, WHile for the streets, Bone is pure thuggish thang, with very serious lyrics sometimes, sometimes they are even religious, others they are just too violent (specially in their firsts releases and Krayzie' first)... whatever, Just try to make the article less pop-kiddie like. - <a href="../../../c/_/t/User%7EC_trillos_87c1.html" title="User:C trillos">C Trillos</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bizzy Bone</span></h2>
<p>This part of the artcle isn't correct "In late 2002, Bizzy Bone departed from the group after giving a drunken performance with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony at BB King's Blues Club in New York City. In October 2003, he rejoined the group for the Wicked Wonka Tour with the Insane Clown Posse and soon recorded Bone Brothers, a duet album with Layzie Bone. Things quickly turned sour, though, as Bizzy declined to tour in support of the album and refused to sign a record contract with the rest of the group to Swizz Beatz' Full Surface Records. After this and a number of other incidents, the group once again cut ties with Bizzy in May of 2005."</p>
<ol>
<li>Bizzy didn't depart from the group in 2002, Bone alleged he was 'kicked out', but it was problems with him not being paid for the album they just released "Thug World Order", Ruthless was back to not paying him like he should be paid, so he bailed. Who wouldn't? in January of 2003 they then sent him papers officially and contractually kicking him from the group</li>
<li>The reason he didn't promote "Bone Brothers" is because Koch Records wasn't totally honest about payment, and spent most of his money due on studio time and album mastering.</li>
<li>He didn't refuse to sign with Swizz Beatz, he wanted to be officially contractually signed as a Bone Thugs-N-Harmony member again. Bone didn't want to do that, so he didn't record. - gren 04:57, 14 Oct 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the input. I've made some changes to the paragraph to try to remove the POV. "Bizzy departed from the group" has been changed to "the group officially departed ways with Bizzy" and "refused to sign a contract" has been changed to "contract negotiations between Bone and Bizzy with Swizz Beatz' Full Surface Records broke down." I still think the part about the Bone Brothers tour should stay. Regardless of Bizzy's reasons for not going on the tour, the fact remains that he did not go on tour and that was his choice. I'm sure he has a billion excuses like he did for not showing up for tours for 6 straight years before him and Bone "parted ways", but that doesn't change the fact that the tour and Bizzy were not one. --<a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachary_Cohen_3bb0.html" title="User:Zachary Cohen">Kahz</a> 17:06, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whoever made these last edits (sometime around New Years'?) did a good job. The page is more informative and has a better flow now. However, I don't see why you took out the info regarding the origins of the group and the relationships between the members (ie. a few of them are brothers, right?) This was all good information.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the compliments. As for what I removed, I had to take out a big chunk of text because it was directly plagiarized from the All Music Guide and I don't remember if the part about the relationships between the members was in there. I'll check the edit history to see if I can find the part you are talking about and put it back up if it wasn't plagiarized. --<a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachary_Cohen_3bb0.html" title="User:Zachary Cohen">Kahz</a> 04:23, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thug Luv</span></h2>
<p>In the section for E. 1999 Eternal, it breifly brings up the song "Thug Luv." I believe this song is one of the most known songs from Bone because of its delivery and featuring Tupac. This song is iconic and whenever bringing up Bone thugs with Any stranger the first songs brought up are Thug Luv and Crossroads. I think someone should add to the part where Thug Luv is discussed. I know its my opinion but i feel its true.</p>
<p>Also I read an article somwhere that the song was first originally recorded with just Bizzy Bone, Tupac and a female rapper. Then later on the song was re-recorded to include Krayzie Bone, Wish, and Layzie and recycling Tupacs verse. It sounds a little trivial but i came across a very low quality mp3 that has a what sounds like an early version of the beat that we know today, missing certain sounds, bassline slightly different. The song starts off with an uknown verse by Bizzy then goes into Tupacs verse (exactly the same from Thug Luv), then a verse from a woman, then right after that its Bizzy again doing his verse from the known Thug Luv but not the same recording that we know. The phrasing is different at parts and ends with him repeating Cleave-a-land-land for the rest of the bar.</p>
<p>Anyway, i have this theory that Bizzy and Tupac and that woman rapper i dont recognize recorded the song before Tupac died. When tupac died, they remade the song and put Tupacs vocals on the track and added the rest of the group.</p>
<p>I dont remember where i read the that the song was originally recorded with just Bizzy Bone, it was a long time ago, but i have the mp3 file i was talking about. Someone should look into this and come up with proof. My Email is TruAmbitionz@aim.com if someone wants the song, or has questions.</p>
<p>I've seen pictures of 2Pac and all of Bone in the studio spitting their verses..wish I still knew where to find them but they were all there at the same time. Maybe 2Pac redid his own verse or added adlibs for the released version of the song but he definitely wasn't already dead. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPCP_MC_1d0d.html" title="User:PCP MC">PCP MC</a> 15:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also the fact that Tupac references Bone as a collective at least 2 times in the song leads me to strongly disagree with the theory that it was just Bizzy and some female rapper originally on the song. Tupac says, "Bone Thugs N Harmony-I know you niggaz been waitin for this a long time..." and then again on his verse, "My nigga Bone had the chrome..." and a third time he references them as a plural when he says he caught a plane to Cleveland to help his niggaZ...he references them in the plural, but yet nowhere does Tupac references just Bizzy(as would be the case if this song were recorded with only those artists) and this female artists gets no mention by Tupac in either the intro to the song or within the song itself.</p>
<p>It's possible someone got ahold of works-in-progress, both the instrumental and Bizzy's verse, and mixed it all together with some unused vocals from a female artist and touted it as the "original". It just doesn't add up to me to say that the track we got was not how it was intended in context to the vocals Tupac put down.--Killphil 09:00, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<p>I sorted out a lot of stuff from that section because it was too long, it looked more of a list than a paragraph filled with text, so now it became more perspicuous. A lot of them belongs to their own articles (singles', members', Bone-Thugs Biography...) thus needs to be merged there. Some of them were useless and unverifiable. What left is still unverified, but some of them is really interesting to know, if they are true. The rest is fair info though not vital to be familiar with them so still fits the trivia criteria.<a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi"><b><font color="#78866B">Lajbi</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/j/User_talk%7ELajbi_4318.html" title="User talk:Lajbi"><b><font color="#C3B091">Holla @ me</font></b></a></sup><small><a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Dogg_0d8a.html" title="Snoop Dogg"><b><font color="#808000">Who's the boss?</font></b></a></small> 16:54, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
