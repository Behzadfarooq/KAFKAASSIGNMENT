<p>As the article stands now, it does not assert his importance or notability. What has Weatherall done that's so great? Unless he's of the caliber of <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, I don't believe he should merit his own article. --<a href="../../../h/u/b/User%7EHubHikari_2b6c.html" title="User:HubHikari">HubHikari</a> 17:47, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. Firstly, how many people with articles on wikipedia <i>are</i> of the same calibre as Mandela or Einstein? <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Bridge_c697.html" title="Wayne Bridge">Wayne Bridge</a>? <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benigno_R._Fitial_28b3.html" title="Benigno R.

Secondly, he is distinguished in his own right as a university chancellor and former regius professor. --<a href="../../../o/x/o/User%7EOxonian2006_e7e1.html" title="User:Oxonian2006">Oxonian2006</a> 18:44, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is an extract from an interview with him: Sir David Weatherall, Nuffield Professor of Clinical Medicine of the University of Oxford, begins the interview by talking of his background and education. He speaks of medical studies in the 1950s at Liverpool University Medical School - where he was influenced by Rod Gregory and Harry Sheehan - followed by house jobs with Cyril Clarke in Liverpool. The discussion moves to National Service in the army in South-East Asia - when he developed an interest in haematology - followed by two research fellowships at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, where he worked on hereditary blood diseases, including thalassaemia, gaining both research training in molecular biology and clinical experience of haematology. At Johns Hopkins he worked with geneticist, Victor McKusick, biophysicist, Howard Dintzis, and haematologist, Lockard Conley, and in his last year met English protein chemist, John Clegg, who remained a long-term research colleague. Sir David talks of returning to Liverpool and continuing in his dual role as clinician and research scientist in haematology, and he mentions overseas collaboration with Singapore and Thailand. The interview progresses to his appointment in 1974 to the Nuffield Chair of Clinical Medicine at Oxford and the move to the new John Radcliffe Hospital, and Sir David speaks of receiving advice from former Regius Professor of Medicine, Sir George Pickering. He then discusses collaboration with Harvard Medical School and Yale, where he was Phillip K Bondy Professor in 1982. In the following section of the interview, discussion includes the applications of molecular biology to clinical genetics, such as prenatal diagnosis and gene replacement therapy, and the need for improvement in the public understanding of science to develop informed debate in society of ethical issues. In conclusion, there is consideration of the organisation of medical education in the UK and the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sir David Weatherall was Nuffield Professor of Clinical Medicine (1974-1992), Regius Professor of Medicine of the University of Oxford (1992-2000), and Honorary Director of the MRC Molecular Haematology Unit (1980-2000) and the Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford (1988-2000).</li>

<p>Thanks, but since there is a separate organization for universities in the West Midlands which is trying to integrate higher education provision I thought it was useful to provide this category. This is also reflects the UK government regionalization policy and the establishment of a formal West Midlands administration. Also, there are separate lists for universities in London, Scotland and Wales. There may be for other regions in the UK.</p>

<p>I've noticed that an edit made by you added H.G.Wells to the Writers section in Stoke-on-Trent. Since it is my certain knowledge that he was born in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromley.html" title="Bromley">Bromley</a> (taken from Michael Foot's excellent biography of him), and Michael Foot's work does not mention that he ever lived in Stoke-on-Trent, I am removing this entry.

<p>HG Well lived in Stoke for a short period. Indeed he based one of his books on it. I'll get the link to the details. ~~Bogle~~ Here are some details Stoke-on-Trent was the partial inspiration for one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time - H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine. Wells spent some time in the Potteries (as it was then) and the area made a huge impression on him. Arnold Bennett wrote to Wells in 1897 enquiring about Wells’ connection with the area since the town of Burslem is mentioned at the beginning of The Time Machine. Wells replied as follows:</p>
<p>“About Burslem - I’m not a native. But years ago I spent two or three months at Etruria and the district made an immense impression on me. I wish I knew the people. I felt dimly then and rather less dimly today vast possibilities there. Think of Trentham, white Newcastle, and that Burslem Hanley ridge jostling one another - the difference in the lives and “circles of thought” there must be! And I’ve sat in ’Trury woods in the springtime, bluebells all about me, and seen overhead the smoke from Granville’s (I think it’s Granville’s) Iron Works streaming by under the white clouds.”</p>
<p>In Wells’ The New Machiavelli there is the following passage:</p>
<p>“I took myself off for a series of walks, and acquired a considerable knowledge of the scenery and topography of the Potteries. It puzzled my aunt that I did not go westward, where it was country-side and often quite pretty, with hedgerows and fields and copses and flowers. But always I went eastward, where in a long valley industrialism smokes and sprawls. That was the stuff to which I turned by nature, to the human effort, and the accumulation and jar of men’s activities. And in such a country as that valley social and economic relations were simple and manifest. Instead of the limitless confusion of London’s population, in which no man can trace any but the most slender correlation between rich and poor, in which everyone seems disconnected and adrift from everyone, you can see here the works, the potbank or the ironworks or what not, and here close at hand the congested, meanly-housed workers, and at a little distance a small middle-class quarter, and again remoter, the big house of the employer. It was like a very simplified diagram—after the untraceable confusion of London.”</p>
<p>Wells stayed at Etruria in the spring of 1888. The Time Machine was first published in 1894. The Eloi and the Morlocks were born in Stoke-on-Trent. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogle_cfbf.html" title="User:Bogle">ridley</a>Bogle<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogle_cfbf.html" title="User:Bogle">ridley</a></p>

<dd>Thanks for the information, but the list is mainly for famous people born in Stoke-on-trent, and there has been a series of edits that have removed, and continue to remove, people who are not born in Stoke-on-Trent from the list. I don't think a stay of a few months would qualify even under the most liberal of interpretations, and a mention in The New Machiavellis certainly would not. It might be worth adding the information from The New Machiavelli in the "trivia" section, though, as long as you can a full reference (such as page numbers and edition, etc). <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen;">&#160;DDS&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">talk</font></a></sup> 17:00, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
