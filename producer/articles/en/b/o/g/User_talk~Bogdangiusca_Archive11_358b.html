<p>I'm new to wikipedia, and run into a problem that is too big for a newbie. The article in question is <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_People_4416.html" title="Sea People">Sea People</a> and concerns possible vanity/advertising issues, a self-written bio (elswhere on wp) and general self pimping...</p>
<p>But I might be all wrong. I didn't post/edit anything yet and I would like to talk it over with you first (as a fellow Bucharest dweller&#160;:)). Couldn't find a way to e-mail you, though, so if you could be so kind and e-mail me instead (possibly from a "fresh" account as to protect your privacy), I would be most greatful.</p>

<p>Good article, but I have two points:</p>
<p><br />
Why delete before an edit is put through? (referencing the word phyxtion)? 1. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Romania" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Romania" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, the fourth Catargiu Cabinet took office on 29 December 1891, but you have him becoming State Property Minister in that Cabinet on 27 November. This might be a simple Old/New calendar issue, but even so, 27 November is 9 December on the New calendar, still leaving us 20 days short.</p>
<p>2. Again according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Romania" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Romania" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, Manu was never Prime Ministerm despite what you claim. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 22:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>but according to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28Romania%2C_1880-1918%29_9304.html" title="Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)">Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)</a> and the book I used as source, he was a Prime Minister.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 22:38, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then I guess, as a project, we should work toward cleaning up this situation, determining which dates are on what calendar (in articles about Manu and other Regat politicians), also fixing that list of PMs, and eventually adding the full panoply of infoboxes and succession boxes that currently only the articles on Năstase and Tăriceanu have, plus a template à la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:UKPrimeMinisters" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:UKPrimeMinisters" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

Carol used a vertical tricolour, with a crest divided in half (Mold. and Wall., with the Dobruja dolphins, and prolly with Oltenia - not sure how on Earth they were arranged - and I'm not sure he used the white/black/black/white inescutcheon of the Hohenzollerns until becoming king...).

În anul 1863 a fost găsita soluţia reunirii simbolurilor tradiţionale ale Ţării Românesti (vulturul de aur cruciat) si Moldovei (bourul cu stea între coarne). Ulterior, în 1872, comisia naţională de heraldică a propus o stemă rezultată din combinarea simbolurilor tradiţionale ale tuturor provinciilor românesti: Ţara Românească, Moldova, Bucovina, Transilvania, Maramures, Crisana, Banat si Oltenia. Stema a fost adoptată de Guvernul României si s-a aflat în uz până în 1921 când, în urma Marii Uniri de la 1 Decembrie 1918, a fost creată noua stemă a României Mari, prin adăugarea simbolurilor instituite în 1872: însemnele Casei de Hohenzollern (casa regală europeană care-si are originile în zorile Evului Mediu)."<a href="http://moldova.go.ro/pagini/heraldica/romania.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://moldova.go.ro/pagini/heraldica/romania.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> The info about when the inescutcheon was added is valuable, but I have huge doubts about Transylvania, Banat, Maramures etc. having been added to the coa of a country in strong alliance with the Central Powers. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 12:39, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! The nationalist website is just hosting the map, they're not the authors or anything. The map is perfectly OK, it's reliable and used in many other sources. I also checked in a history book of mine (printed 1995, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 954-426-099-4</a>), which confirms the borders from the period. What exactly bothers you with the map? The extent to the north?</p>
<p>Actually, all of Romania and eastern Hungary were added to the Bulgarian Empire during the rule of <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krum.html" title="Krum">Krum</a> (796/803-814), who crushed the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasian_Avars_f3cc.html" title="Eurasian Avars">Avar Khaganate</a> together with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlemagne.html" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, and conquered these territories. Since these lands were not particularly well-organized and at all vastly populated then, the only trouble were the barbarian invasions from Asia (<a href="../../../m/a/g/Magyars.html" title="Magyars">Magyars</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/c/Pechenegs.html" title="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a> and later <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumans.html" title="Cumans">Cumans</a>) and the <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus%27_1194.html" title="Kievan Rus'">Kievan</a> campaigns. As the article <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania_in_the_Early_Middle_Ages_67b1.html" title="Romania in the Early Middle Ages">Romania in the Early Middle Ages</a> says, Bulgarian control over the former Dacia "would last between 802 and 1018". <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 16:24, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Bulgarian Empire simply went in a couple of military expeditions in there, they crushed the enemies and went home.

<dd>Did they really? Then who spread the "Slavic" language as a liturgical language in these lands? How did the predecessors of the Romanians get Christianized? Is that enough in terms of evidence? Besides, who do you think governed those territories when it wasn't the Bulgarian Empire?

<dl>
<dd>Well... You are slightly wrong:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, the predecessors of Romanians got Christianized using the Latin language. The most basic Romanian words related to Christianity are inherited from Latin, not from Greek nor from Slavic:</dd>
<dd><i>Boteza &lt; Batizare (Baptize); Paşte &lt; Pascere (Easter); Dumnezeu &lt; Dominus Deus ([Christian] God); Preot &lt; Presbiterum (Priest); Biserică &lt; Basilica (Church), etc</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then, Orthodoxism and Slavic as the liturgical language were adopted at the earliest in the 11th/12th century. How can we tell that? Simple, there is no archaeological evidence of any earlier Orthodox churches.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, that's not "revisionist". The mainstream history says that the region was inhabited by Romanians, who lived in the mountains and some valleys and various "barbarians" (Avars, Cumans, Pechenegs, etc) in the plains. Simply, there is no evidence of a Bulgarian administration. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 18:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is there any archaeological evidence of Romanians practicing Christianity after the Roman Empire, but prior to the Bulgarian control of the region? That would be interesting. Also, could you please give any details regarding this 11th/12th century adoption of Orthodoxy and the Slavic language? I'm very curious how that would have happened with today's Romania controlled by various barbarian tribes (certainly not having much to do with Christianity) in the period.</dd>
<dd>Also, the Romania in the Early Middle Ages article says "<i>By</i> the 10th century, the Wallachs (exonym of the Romanians) both north and south of the Danube, after having long remained faithful to the Greek ritual, had adopted the Slavonic liturgy and became subject to the metropolitan at Ohrid, the Bulgarian capital.", and cites an early 11th-century source that clearly evidences the Romanians were Orthodox by then. Thus, they were converted to Orthodoxy in the Bulgarian Empire.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure in what form the Bulgarian Empire controlled the lands north of the Danube, but it certainly did. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_I_of_Bulgaria_4fdc.html" title="Peter I of Bulgaria">Peter I of Bulgaria</a> is mentioned to have faced Magyar raids in these areas and later to have allowed Magyar tribes to settle as federates, later Samuil is also evidenced to have reigned over Wallachia. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 18:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyway, the whole religion issue is off-topic on this case, as this might be cultural influence. I'm just asking for a reference which gives proofs of a Bulgarian administration in that land.

<dd>I seriously doubt it was a cultural influence and provided enough evidence in the last two paragraphs of my last reply, as well as generally. An indirect reference is the 11th-century charter of Basil II to Samuil, and I'm sure there are other (maybe you should refer to <a href="../../../i/m/l/User%7EImladjov_b982.html" title="User:Imladjov">User:Imladjov</a>, he's an expert in the subject).

<p>Actually, Bogdan, it is entirely plausible that Bulgarian vassals of some sort clashed with the Magyars when the latter entered Transylvania (I think Xenopol argued that Gelou was one). What I suggest is a new map, where the regions north of the Danube would be hachured in the same color as Bulgaria and the color of, well, nothing. Who's gonna do it? <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:08, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IIRC, the vassals were only in Western Transylvania and we have no data about the rest of Romania/Moldova. Anyway, I guess a hachured map would be better: one with northern border no so precisely set, because we don't know it exactly.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 20:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course. From what I know, claims on both sides have speculated that the Bulgarian territory extended further than Western Transylvania (as I note, so does even our Greier-produced article - and that means that even the ultras have little problem with awknowleding that it <i>may</i> have had&#160;:)), A hachured map with your specifications would be the best deal. What do you say, Todor? <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh, btw. Todor: let's not turn an uncertain situation into one version of jingoism or another. Awright? Most of what you provided about "Bulgarian spoken in Wallachia" is actually about Church Slavonic, at a stage when Bugarian was slowly emerging as its own language - I know it is a habit of Bulgarian sources to take over Church Slavonic patrimony, but that is is just clumsy (especially since the language was used in Moldavia as well). Furthermore, <i>even if it were Bulgarian</i> (and it is pure sophistry to say that it was), drawing the conclusion that "Bulgarian-speakers" were "Bulgarian ethnics", aside from all the absurdity of assigning ethnicities in the Middle Ages, would imply that all people using Latin in Medieval Europe were members of Latin peoples! <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:12, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wait, wait, wait, what jingoism, I've never said these things. And furthermore you're confusing terms. I've never said Bulgarian was spoken in Wallachia as a vernacular (although people claim this and they've got some reasonable points) by the Romanians. I've also never said there was a substantial Bulgarian population in these lands then. And note that Old Bulgarian had already emerged and shaped in the period (this is the Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic that was spread among the Romanians). Don't confuse Old Church Slavonic with Church Slavonic, which is a later East-Slavicized version of it).
<dl>
<dd>Actually, those Romanians who expressed themselves in writing used Church Slavonic primordially. Sorry for jumping to conclusions, but I have seen Bulgarian contributors telling me that Romanian developed in a Bulgarian-speaking area etc. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 22:07, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>As for the hachures suggestion, I see no reason to have Romania hachured and the rest not — Simeon and the other tsars had many parts of the empire locally ruled by governors/vassals, that's why it's an empire. What is today Romania was not more autonomous than any other part of the Bulgarian Empire and it wasn't in any way special to deserve hachures. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 21:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, here's some obvious reasons: the extension to the north of the Danube should not be hachured because of vassalage, but because it is, for the most part, theoretical, with unspecified and unclear borders, and without clear pointers in time as to when it was factual and when it was not (rather, all we have are separated claims which do not clarify if it was a continuous rule). Add to this that, whereas some scholars agree that it was real, others, based on the same evidence, do not - I am not referring to nationalists in Romania, which deny it on principle, but to people involved in actual research). If something is relative, we should point it out as relative - I think the case is much clearer for all other areas ruled by the Bulgarians at the time. Let's build a bridge, dude: consider that the alternative is a an un-academic quagmire, with pages contributed by Romanians claiming that it did not happen at all, and pages contributed by Bulgarians exaggerating on the basis of vagueries. We have a chance to actually do something for the readers, and not for our respective catered audiences. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 22:07, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This isn't convincing. I'm not an expert on the subject, and I'm not aware of the Bulgarian rule over the region being denied by the international science. As I said, you should refer to <a href="../../../i/m/l/User%7EImladjov_b982.html" title="User:Imladjov">User:Imladjov</a>, who is an expert on the subject and will be hopefully able to explain things better. Until then, I'd avoid referring to anything as "academic" and "unacademic". That the Romanian science sometimes denies something and the Bulgarian always supports it doesn't necessarily mean the truth somewhere in the middle. In fact, I'd be more than happy to hear a number of external opinions, plus that of Ian Mladjov. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 10:39, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me read this to you again, Todor. I have pointed out that, even if the rule would be certain, its limits and continuity would <i>have</i> to be debatable (simply because <i>all</i> evidence about present-day Romania tended to be <i>decades apart</i>). I had thus not said that the truth is "somewhere in the middle": I do not establish truth, and nobody could on the basis of this little evidence. What I <i>had</i> asked you to consider is not that Romanian scientists deserve to manipulate knowledge, but that the knowledge itself is not certain! That is to say (and <i>I repeat</i> myself): a hachure does not indicate a compromise between historians for the sake of letting Romanians have a field day, but an indication that, although a Bulgarian presence <i>is very likely</i> to have been the case, proof of it is not definite and continuity cannot be established (much of the evidence <i>you Todor, for one, presented</i> is speculatory in nature - the difference between hachure and full colour is the difference between recorded testimony and speculation). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 11:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He argues that the page should be at "<a href="../../../c/e/z/Cezar_Badita_9e9a.html" title="Cezar Badita">Cezar Badita</a>" because most English sources spell it that way, but "most sources" spell it without the diacritics because they <i>can't</i> due to technical limitations. He's also saying "note also that, there are <i>no diacritics</i> in the English Wikipedia article title of Romania", which I think is absuard. Could you help me by joining-in on the discussion?

<p>I would like your help to calm a <i>revert war</i> with 194.117.231.39 about the article on the WW2 Romanian leader, Ion Antonescu. Originally I just tried to correct typos and reword a few phrases <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Antonescu&amp;oldid=71321299" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_Antonescu&amp;oldid=71321299" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> but then I realised that there was quite "unusual" POVs in the article. A few edits later and I'm into a discussion that I would prefer to avoid. I'd like your considered opinion on the comments highlighted in the Talk page of the article (section 19).

<dd>Bogdan, the IP who keeps doing that hides behind some disgusting sophistry, chiefly relying on Dragan's "works" (obviously, not only biased, but unprofessional, unsourced, and unlikely eye-witness-like). Besides that, he or she introduces another layer of POV, his or her own, leaving aside that he or she is painfully unaware of spelling rules in English. Probably all the text he or she added is sneaky and shameful historical revisionism: the issue of reverting the page and keeping an eye on it has become crucial for wikipedia's credibility and sheer common sense. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 08:12, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bună. I have two points on unrelated subjects. The first is that, as I noted on the template's talk page, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_park.html" title="Nature park">Nature parks</a> link leads to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protected_areas_of_Croatia_fff6.html" title="Protected areas of Croatia">Protected areas of Croatia</a> on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_areas_of_Romania_18cb.html" title="Template:Protected areas of Romania">Template:Protected areas of Romania</a>&#160;; I don't know the page where it should lead, but that should be corrected.</p>

<dd>I redirected to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_park.html" title="National park">National park</a>. It's not quite the same, but it's better than the Croatia link.

<p>Hi wow you are very quick. Also make sure you create the English redirects. The words are Romanian in English just remove the romanian accents so you can search on an english keybooard.

<p>e.g Malu Roşu - Malu Rosu #redirect [Malu Roşu] This is very important because if you are an English speaker - hundreds of millions of people in world using english keyboard and want info on Romanian village these pages exist thanks to your great work but they won't be accessible so they won't show up. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 10:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! I happened to be looking at your comment at <a href="../../../p/%C4%83/u/Talk%7EP%C4%83ule%C5%9Fti_41c0.html" title="Talk:Păuleşti">Talk:Păuleşti</a> and noticed you had a diacritic redirect bot - by chance I was just about to start work on much the same thing myself! (except primarily, in the first instance, for Czech articles). How would I go about creating such a bot? - I have AWB and so on. Or would it be better to provide new lists for your existing bot to work on? I would be very grateful for any advice or suggestions you could offer.</p>

<p>I just started investing time in recreating a page I spend hours and hours creating the original version of, for Cradle Technologies, only to get a message that apparently you deleted it yet again and I've only just started to edit it?</p>

<dd>Wikipedia has some standards for notability and the article must say why this company is notable. There are millions of companies throughout the world, but Wikipedia only lists those which are truely influential. A 71-employees IT services is almost certainly not influential enough. If you believe it is, please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a> and try your article to be within those lines. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 09:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When did this requirement of "notable" status become god rule? I thought the whole point of Wikipedia was to be an open source encyclopaedia of everything? It's starting to look like that dream is now being changed to "everything is now really just what 'we feel like allowing?' - That seems to go against what the founders of Wikipedia set out do to?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you really are going to refuse to allow me to include information about my firm in Wikipedia, then at least return the code I spend time investing in your project so I can load it in another wiki engine myself and host it elsewhere. I can't find the page I created so I can get the code. Interestingly enought you seem to feel that it was fine to have information about the USA firm Cradle Technologies, but when an Australian firm called Cradle Technologies wants to be included, you write it off?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Looks like Wikipedia is going to end up as a dead project if it keeps deleting the investment in time and effort people like me make in adding content, and no this is not a childish snipe, just an observation - you delete enough of people's efforts to support you and you're going to loose our support and end up with nobody interested in adding content but a select few.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That would be sad to see, but then you as an admin will know what your plans are far better than I ever will, and if you've decided to become eletist on what content you're going to allow about companies, so be it, but don't be surprised if we stop advising people to visit Wikipedia to get information about us or other topics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All the best with the project regardless, but again it's a sad day now that I see an eletist postion on what can and can't make it into the wiki - the original aims have clearly changed.</dd>

<p>În 17 septembrie va fi referendum în Transnistria legat de independenţa regiunii. Cu această ocazie probabil multă lume va căuta pe Wikipedia informaţii despre Transnistria. Am încercat să adaug în articol nişte informaţii legate de acest referendum, anume:</p>
<p>- faptul că mai multe organizaţii antiseparatiste au lansat un apel la boicotare, considerînd referendumul "farsă"</p>
<p>- faptul că din 46 de ţări membre ale Consiliului Europei, 45 sînt împotriva recunoaşterii referendumului, numai RUsia are altă părere</p>
<p>- faptul că datele Comisiei Electorale Centrale din Tiraspol au fost schimbate în mod ciudat, anume numărul total de alegători s-a micşorat cu 7% faţă de 2005, ceea ce ridică suspiciuni asupra unei încercări de creştere artificială a prezenţei la vot prin raportarea unui număr mai mic de alegători înregistraţi.</p>
<p>Totdeauna am dat lincurile care dovedesc cele scrise de mine, n-am născocit nimic din burtă.</p>
<p>Userul Willian Mauco, care pare fan Tiraspol, mereu mi-a şters adăugirile. (vezi istoria paginii)</p>
<p>Puteţi vedea la pagina de discuţii Transnistria ce argumente a adus. Anume: ăia care cer boicotarea referendumului din Transnistria sînt foşti KGB-işti, că aşa zice o organizaţie rusească de analiză (a dat un linc pentru asta). Întîi a spus că respectivii nici nu sînt din Transnistria, ci doar din Basarabia, dar i-am dovedit că unii dintre semnatarii apelului la boicot sînt transnistreni. Am fost împăciuitor, i-am zis că n-are decît să adauge părerea organizaţiei ruseşti că antiseparatiştii sînt foşti KGBişti, că n-are decît să-i considere pe cei care vor boicotarea referendumului drept băieţi răi, dar faptul în sine, că s-a cerut boicotarea referendumului, trebuie menţionat. Degeaba, mereu mi s-au şters adăugirile - pentru celelalte 2 fapte nici n-a adus argumente.</p>
<p>A mai fost o adăugire care a şters-o, despre arestarea a 4 persoane din Transnistria care sînt împotriva separatismului (între timp li s-a dat drumul). În cazul ăsta am renunţat eu să mai insist pentru includerea informaţiei în articol (deşi informaţia e incontestabilă), tocmai fiindcă n-am vrut să mă cert prea mult.</p>
<p>În perioada asta cînd agenţiile de ştiri vor menţiona referendumul de la Tiraspol, se va citi articolul Transnistria în Wikipedia poate mai mult decît într-un an întreg. De aia acum e nevoie să existe în articol informaţii despre contestarea corectitudinii referendumului. Nu cer să se menţioneze ca adevăr absolut faptul că referendumul e incorect, ci doar că există unii (OSCE, 45 din 46 ţări ale Consiliului Europei, unele organizaţii din zonă şi din Basarabia) care consideră asta. Vă cer de aceea sprijinul ca să interveniţi pe pagina de discuţii Transnistria pentru a susţine rămînerea informaţiei în pagină şi să repuneţi informaţia atunci cînd Mauco o şterge (eu nu pot să verific chiar 24 de ore din 24). Evitaţi atacurile suburbane, păstraţi ton civilizat. mulţumesc.</p>
<p>Who is William Mauco Here is an article about a Wikipedia celebrity, William Mauco, and his relations with the International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS), an organisation "which seems to be a front organisation for a Kremlin-backed rogue statelet called Transdniestria" (quote from the article) <a href="http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D" class="external free" title="http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D" rel="nofollow">http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D</a></p>
<p>Edward Lucas wrote about Mauco: "The other lead is William Mauco. He has an extensive record of posting intelligent and fairly neutral entries on Wikipedia, not only about TD but about other unrecognised statelets. Crucially, these predate ICDISS's birthday of January 2006. And he also claims to have been at their conference in Mexico City in April of this year. I have written to him asking to get in touch, and had a friendly email in reply. I am planning to follow up this research in an article in European Voice at the end of August, so watch this space!"--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariusM_97ae.html" title="User:MariusM">MariusM</a> 08:37, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a print edition of Tiraspol Times once monthly (I haven't seen it myself). This is not the case for Southeast European Times. It is online only. The editor of Tiraspol Times now has a Wikipedia account and participates in the discussion. No one knows who the editors of Southeast European Times are. They both have the same sort of contact information page. However, in addition, Tiraspol Times also has an accuracy pledge<a href="http://www.tiraspoltimes.com/getthefacts.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tiraspoltimes.com/getthefacts.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> which Southeast European Times does not. We are allowed to link to online sources such as Southeast European Times and Tiraspol Times when it provides additional relevant content that is not included in the main article. If there is a bias, you may mark it as such (POV in links), which is what I have often done for other sites. You should not delete them however. Southeast European Times has a presence on Wikipedia which has not been deleted or objected to by anyone.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&amp;target=www.setimes.com&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&amp;target=www.setimes.com&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and, in comparison, the presence of Tiraspol Times was much more limited and restrained. Apart from the fact that you removed all links from one, and not the other, those two sites are very similar in their markup and tone. - <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Mauco_97a3.html" title="User:William Mauco">Mauco</a> 22:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

We could set up a sandbox for that, and then present it to the rest of the editors when the two of us reach agreement.

<p>Just to be clear, I'm not opposed to bolding the more important parties, <i>if</i> we can find a neutral criterion, such as having supplied a Prime Minister. After all, the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistorical_Dutch_political_parties_1958.html" title="Template:Historical Dutch political parties">Dutch model</a>, on which we based this one, does use bold, putting the parties in chronological order by date of establishment. The current version is by no means the last word. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 00:16, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could do without highlighting them at all - I just though that the current is a better way to highlight if we have to. For example, bolding would create an obvious difference that would perhaps call for some explanation (the other version is "x party - others in alphabetical order"). The bolding for PMs-given parties is not really a barometer of importance: the Ploughmen's Front gave a PM, and so did the People's Party, the Romanian National Party, or the National Christians; however, neither the Communists nor the Social Democrats ever did. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 00:24, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe by vote totals or seats in Parliament then? It is indeed a tricky matter, and the current compromise might be as good as any, though I am open to other proposals. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 03:41, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Bogdan, in response to your edit to my user page. The sources stated in the Stari Vlah post are <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">reliable sources</a> from State and University libraries. All research was done 35 years ago by scientists from the German university in Berlin in cooperation with some Serbian scholars as well and these findings have been published. Either way, I will no longer edit this anymore. It will be Wikipedia's loss to display poor and inacurate information. It is my belief though that you didn't read any of the sources provided nor do I believe that your credentials are valid enough to make you an expert. SGS 12:54, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Bogdan.

<dd>Well... it's a murky area. It is possible that the copyrights might have been confiscated by the Romanian state, just like Bavaria did with Hitler's copyrights. But it's not really clear whether the confiscation is legal according to international copyright conventions. (in Hitler's case, his nephew did not wanted the copyrights).

<p>Hi. I meant to ask you: do you think we should begin [sub]categorizing Romanian people by county(ie: "People from Teleorman County", "People from Hunedoara County")? <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 13:34, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. I think that's a good idea. I see there is, for example, <a href="../../../e/n/g/Category%7EEnglish_people_by_county_3b98.html" title="Category:English people by county">Category:English people by county</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 13:47, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The main problem that I saw in such categories is their "parenting" - if we subcategorize "Romanian people by county" in "Natives of Transylvania"... We could create a precedent by naming it "People by county in Romania", and subcategorizing it in "Romanian people", with the mention "Note: Not all people included in this category were ethnic Romanians" or something. What say you? <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 13:53, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it a concern that traditional English counties have existed for centuries while the current counties of Romania were fixed only in 1968? <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 22:08, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I figure we have to use the present-day grid. French "natives of" categories have "by région" and the German ones use the land system (both post-1945). I don't think it is a real problem in this case that we may introduc people into counties they never saw (unlike indicating an apparent "filial" relation between them and a country they never saw). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 22:18, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hypothetically, then, of what county was Ţepeş a native? Born in "Mureş" county, ruled in "Dâmboviţa" county. Or Avram Iancu, born in some county that <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_divisions_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary_03d1.html" title="Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary">this</a> doesn't make clear, died maybe in Alsó-Fehér county, but today Alba county. And then there are people like Emil Constantinescu: is he a native of the interwar Romanian and 1991-2003 Moldovan Tighina County or of some present-day Moldovan/Transnistrian subdivision? I think your plan has merit, and is indeed supported by the French and German examples, so I could ultimately back it as well, but given some of these troubling historical questions, and also given the relatively weak "county identity" Romanians have (as opposed to the English), it's a plan I approach with some caution. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 22:53, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I figure that my plan is the one most relevant for the casual user. For one, it is the clearest: if we admit subcategorizing by "dead" subdivisions, we could just as well begin to subcategorize by all of them (say, if Iancu was born in x Hungarian county, a guy born in the same commune after 1968 would have to find himself placed in an altogether different category).Moreover, it is the most relevant: people arguably only use such categories to see what present-day region was home to each person, as those who are looking for where a particular person was born could only be helped by the respective article, and not by any particular category [note: I personally doubt that people use these categories at all, but we might just as well consider all their pros and cons].</dd>
<dd>In fact, the scandal I'd imagine happening is when Hungarian users would begin objecting to having, say, 14th century Hungarians included in present-day counties of Romania... (I'd point them to the elementary rationale, but I'd be bound to get a headache when dealing with some of them).</dd>
<dd>Also, I don't think that this necessarily involves the county identity (granted, it is very weak - though perhaps not in several Wallachian and Oltenian realms); people were objectively born in x place, which is part of y county (even if it was part of z county at q time) - their mothers could have been passing through not only the county, but also the town and the country, so no such category should not aim at using more than more than likely, but accurate, happenstance.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps not the ideal one, but most workable on wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 23:50, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough; we'll see how this plays out in practice if and when Hungarian editors start attacking our categorizations. But you raise an interesting point about mothers passing through a particular county, and the definition of "native". My grandmother was born on a train in Jimbolia simply because her mother wanted to give birth in Romania and not Yugoslavia. She spent over forty years in Bucharest after that and I don't know if she's ever returned to Jimbolia. So, if she were encyclopedic, would we class her as a native of Timiş-Torontal county (I assume no), Timiş county, or Bucharest? <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 00:14, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Interesting story. For the purposes of wikipedia, I'd have to say "Timiş county" - to what I have argued above, add the fact that, if such a way of categorizing is meaningless, so may be said about the category system "by region/land/county" itself. In any case, I could not class someone as a native of x county if not born there, even if tthat person never returned there (consider that Weissmuller is universally seen as a native of Timişoara, and, based on shaky tradition, Vlad Dracula as a native of Sighişoara...).</dd>
<dd>I'd forgotten a detail: I'd have rather kept the "natives of" denominator for cities and towns, as I had originally created the categories - "people from" is ambiguous, and, if we remember what has happened on the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craiova.html" title="Craiova">Craiova</a> page a while back (when someone began including all passers-through as "Notable people"), encouraging explosions of crap. The change was not (yet?) made for "natives of [the higher level of administrative division]", which leads to an intrinsic, but tolerable, paradox. But threin lies a potential solution to a collateral problem: if county affiliation is shaky, town affiliation is less so - we have a bit more than the skeleton of a "people from [town]", and, since we make "people from [town]" subcategories of "natives of [county]", people included in the latter are only the leftovers of the former (yes, most Romanians have traditionally been peasants - but, comparatively, only a few of them have been notable enough to deserve articles). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 00:36, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that works: town identity is probably stronger and would nest within an emptier county category. Imperfect, as such categories tend to be, but it could be of some value (that is, if anyone looks at categories, which is certainly possible). <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 06:15, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Bogdan,</p>
<p>One admin (I presume), <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">User:Millosh</a> has blocked me on meta for one day. He is POV -pushing some nonsense over the fact that the Moldovan nation is in the process of merging with the Romanian one (sic!), and that the Moldovan language is very-very different from Romanian. You can see it here <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_projects_are_not_for_nation-building" class="extiw" title="meta:Wikimedia_projects_are_not_for_nation-building">meta:Wikimedia_projects_are_not_for_nation-building</a>. I tried to edit and explain what's wrong, but the guy simply blocked me. I think he's trying to push some Montenegrin wikipedia, and is drafting wikipedia policies allowing it.</p>
<p>It's the first time I'm blocked, and it's probably a case of blatant POV-pushing by an admin on meta on policy issues.</p>

<p>Not that it mattered in the long run, but is there any reason why you unprotected tajikistan-bio-stub? It was protected to try to stop one user from overriding the decision of a process page (WP:SFD) that the template be upmerged. The user was repeatedly re-pointing the catalogue and was becoming abusive on several stub-related pages after hjaving been warned that overturning such a decision without going through process was not a good thing. As pointed out at WP:PP, the situation was slowly becoming resolved, but unprotecting the page before that happened (which you did only a few minutes after the page was protected, before I even got a chance to get the protection replaced by an admin not involved in the dispute in any way) risked starting the revertiong once again. As it happenns, it seems that the user in question was unaware that the protection had been removed, so no harm was done, but it was a curious move on your part. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 22:40, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, two things there - first, I protected to preserve the decision of a process page - it wasn't a personal edit war I had no personal opinion as to what should have occurred, and was only trying to uphold due process. Secondly, as I said, you did that before I even got a chance to get the protection replaced by an admin not involved in the dispute in any way. <i>That</i> is a faux pas which could have resulted in an escalation of the problem! No fuss though - what you did made sense, the timing was just a little unfortunate.&#160;:) <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 07:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bogdan, could you please put in an official request on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Moldovan_Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Moldovan_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Meta</a> to close voting on the closure of the Moldovan Wikipedia. The vote has been going on for many months now, much more than the two weeks initially stipulated. I know you don't have administrative rights on meta, but as your status as an admin on en and mo should carry some clout, and since you are the one who opened the vote on meta, I hope your voice will have more weight. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 23:11, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that any non-partisan would want to join that dispute and make a decision. From my experience, everyone avoids this kind of issues like the plague. The Moldovan issue won't be settled unless there'd be some intervention from above (i.e. simply removing the mo domain), but that seems rather unlikely. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 23:20, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Bogdan, I see that you also attacked my uploaded images. Anyone <i>can</i> go and take a snapshot, but I am not in Ukraine and am not able to take images of the places/buildings, nor are many other Ukrainian en wiki users. Should I just call a random person off the street and say "Would you pls take a snapshot for an article that I am writing on Wikipedia?" or what? It is very hard to find replacements for the images or create them, and there are a lot of the images floating around on the web (for instance the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_with_Chimaeras_dcde.html" title="House with Chimaeras">House with Chimaeras</a> statues<sup>1</sup>) but they are also all copyrighted!! Anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Watchlist&amp;days=0&amp;namespace=6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Watchlist&amp;days=0&amp;namespace=6" rel="nofollow">on some images</a>, you were not very careful about the tagging, for instance <a href="../../../n/e/a/Image%7ENear_Caves_%28Kiev_Pechersk_Lavra%29_Interiour.jpg_0f13.html" title="Image:Near Caves (Kiev Pechersk Lavra) Interiour.jpg">this</a>. I believe that you know that photography is strictly phrohibited in some religious places, like the interiour of ancient caves... How am I to obtain a free-replacement for that? —<a href="../../../d/d/i/User%7EDDima_3374.html" title="User:DDima">dmytro</a><i><b><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Avoid_Copyright_Paranoia" class="extiw" title="meta:Avoid_Copyright_Paranoia">/s-ko/</a></b></i> 04:43, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. In order to comply to our Fair use in Wikipedia, the images must irreplaceable or nearly so. You are right about that cave image, but for the House with Chimaeras, anyone who is in Kiev can take some pics without any difficulty. Maybe you should ask this on the Ukrainian noticeboard? <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 00:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bogdan, thanks for your work on this article. I need to be a stickler for accuracy, however, because this is something which I've spent a lot of time on in the past with now-permabanned user Greier. I have no serious problems with most of your edits but we do need some sources for the following, please:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>You latest change made the South Slavs sound like mere transit-lounge travellers. If there is a historic record, some of them are bound to have put down roots. I suggest something along the lines of "Transnistria was an early crossroads of people and cultures, including the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Slavs_95cc.html" title="South Slavs">South Slavs</a>, who reached it in the 6th century."<br />

The <b>may</b> is good if we don't have conclusive sources, but if that is the case, then it is debately on which grounds we are including it anyway? Perhaps a source which is not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>?<br /></li>
<li>"but they were pushed further north by <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic</a> nomads such as <a href="../../../p/e/c/Pechenegs.html" title="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a> and the <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumans.html" title="Cumans">Cumans</a>."

<li>Then there is "In the 10th century, the "Volohove" (<a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a>, i.e. Romanians) are mentioned in the area in the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_Chronicle_7f87.html" title="Primary Chronicle">Primary Chronicle</a>."<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>This is interesting because Primary Cronicles is mostly a Slav history. In the 10th century, we find the area to be part of Kievan Rus. So they encounter a Latin people in the area. On which side of the Dniester?<br />

<p>I failed to add "film-screenshot" to the photo when I first loaded it. When I went back to the photo summary page for the photo and added it as instructed by Wikipedia it transferred the fair use rationale to the edit summary section as well. The only thing I put into the edit summary was "added"film-screenshot". <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilbertgray_a076.html" title="User:Philbertgray">Philbertgray</a> 02:44, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
