<p>I have seen a movement towards deleting the Hungarian names of the Moldavian town. While I don't care/know about what happens with Piatra Neamt etc., I'd say that early Catholicism is very important in the history of the towns from Siret Valley. If you remove Catholicism, be it Hungarian, German, or Italian, from Roman history, it remains close to nothing.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuci_Sandor_c1e5.html" title="User:Luci Sandor">Luci_Sandor</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELuci_Sandor_219c.html" title="User talk:Luci Sandor">talk</a>,&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Luci_Sandor_7991.html" title="Special:Contributions/Luci Sandor">contribs</a>)&#160;</small><a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a>&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg/20px-Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" /></a> 13:56, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The earliest Catholic diocese in Moldavia was not "Hungarian": it was the Cumans diocese, established in the 13th century. The Cumans lived across the Southern half of Moldavia, from Comăneşti to Galaţi, Vaslui, Covurlui (all names of Cuman origin).</dd>
<dd>Well, the common policy is that in the lead section are listed names of significant minorities of the town. If there is/was no such minority in recorded history, but that name is somehow important, it should be written in the history section. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 16:47, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then it's the issue of the Hungarian speaking minority living on the Siret Valley. I hope nobody will say that the Hungarian name for Roman is irrelevant, as long as hundreds of Hungarians are living in a range of 10 km, like in the village of Secuieni. It is like pretending that my name is not Hungarian.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are still thousands of Romanians living within in a range of 15 km of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>. Go and add the Romanian name to that article and see if you can.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 16:47, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the other I hand, I would have to lookup, but I suppose there was / is some Hungarian minority even in Tirgu Neamt / Piatra Neamt, towns where you removed the Hungarian name.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuci_Sandor_c1e5.html" title="User:Luci Sandor">Luci_Sandor</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELuci_Sandor_219c.html" title="User talk:Luci Sandor">talk</a>,&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Luci_Sandor_7991.html" title="Special:Contributions/Luci Sandor">contribs</a>)&#160;</small><a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a>&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg/20px-Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" /></a> 14:38, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not aware of such a minority, though I guess that at one point in the past (possibly during the Dark Age), there Hungarians in some of the cities: the names of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bac%C4%83u.html" title="Bacău">Bacău</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suceava.html" title="Suceava">Suceava</a> feel too much like borrowings from Hungarian, judging by the phonetical appearence. I'd better add this on the articles. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 16:47, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>There are a handful of villages where some people still speak Hungarian. I had classmates, whose parents came from such villages and were able to speak Hungarian, I know some people who were children there and still speak Hungarian with their parents. The Catholic Church was really perverted during the Communism, as they (Church &amp; Party) allowed only Romanian mess and used to send only non-Hungarian priests there. Hungarians had to learn Romanian for church and for school, and only countrymen from villages outside main roads still speak Hungarian.</dd>

<dd>I also got your point about Belgrade, but I hope Romanians and Hungarians are a bit more tolerant and less tensed than Serbs.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuci_Sandor_c1e5.html" title="User:Luci Sandor">Luci_Sandor</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELuci_Sandor_219c.html" title="User talk:Luci Sandor">talk</a>,&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Luci_Sandor_7991.html" title="Special:Contributions/Luci Sandor">contribs</a>)&#160;</small><a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a>&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg/20px-Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" /></a> 21:33, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, I don't speak Hungarian, my people lived for long around Tirgu Neamt, on the Eastern side of the mountains - no <i>igen</i> bashes, OK? Secondly, you should stop seeing malefic plots against Romania. It's not a POV when I say there are Hungarians on the Siret valley and it's not a POV when I say that the Communist (and the Legion) state did everything to change their minds. I remember how the priest who was supposed to teach us about the Catholic Faith had no idea what 'Greek-Catholics' (Eastern Catholics) are. Plus, it's not a POV that their very existence is hidden to the other citizens of Romania.</dd>

<dd>As of Cuman religious inheritance, it happens that it is highly believe able that the Baia Bishop was acting on this area of the Siret valley, but there are no writings about it acting in Roman. A small town with no current or recent importance (I had an edit war with the supporters of the county-hood), with proud citizens, I'm sure that if we would learn something about documents from Cumans, we will spread it on our monuments and on the Internet ASAP.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuci_Sandor_c1e5.html" title="User:Luci Sandor">Luci_Sandor</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELuci_Sandor_219c.html" title="User talk:Luci Sandor">talk</a>,&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Luci_Sandor_7991.html" title="Special:Contributions/Luci Sandor">contribs</a>)&#160;</small><a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a>&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg/20px-Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" /></a> 13:56, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me leave my mark on this little page (sorry, Bogdan). Bonaparte, you are wrong and judgemental this time around (I mean that "igen" thing).</p>
<p>p</p>
<p>1. I do not think that "Cumans" indicates ethnicity, but is more of a topos. Be that as it may (there really is no point in arguing the existance of national awareness in the 1200s), the Church was likely to include many native Hungarian-speakers (because this is the real category indicated) in its hierarchy (most likely the largest group within the local structure) and the followers in Moldavia. Because the Church was already (and for quite a while), the Catholic one. Consider the Csangos: their identity will eternally float between "being Catholic" and "being Hungarian" - simply because, in medieval Moldavia, the two would usually blend into each other.</p>
<dl>
<dd>At least initally, the "Catholic Cumans" were Cumans. IIRC, the Cuman tribes made an alliance with the Pope against the Byzantines. However, the Episcopate of the Cumans kept its name long after the Cumans were assimilated... <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 13:40, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>p</p>
<p>Towns in Moldavia have Hungarian names from around the time of their origin. Some may even be of Hungarian origin (you do not reject the obvious German connections of the town of... well... Neamţ). Hungarian names are legitimate and should stay.</p>
<p>p</p>
<p>3. Wikipedia is the place where we expand and add. It's okay to give the Latin name of some city or town, all over Europe (even though there are no Romans around to inhabit them), but you object to otherwise traditional, old names (which may be the search criteria for some users who need the equivalent of antiquated information: "I've read this transcription, but the translator could not find the modern versions of the place-names etc."). This "vae victis" attitude really has no meaning, Bonaparte.<a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 12:55, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't believe that you're right Dahn. And certainly your last words "Losers weepers" either. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">Bonaparte</font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonaparte_ba39.html" title="User talk:Bonaparte"><small>talk</small></a> 13:04, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, why am I not right? (Perhaps you might want to take this topic on my talk page, so we do not chew up Bogdan's space.) I think you got me wrong on the vae victis: I meant that this was the nature of your reply. What I meant was that you were dismissive of an attitude, only because Hungarians are no longer present there. Also, you showed that you were ready to engage in a conflict with a person who tried to make a point. The fact that I largely agree with it should point out that the topic is not a "Hungarian" way of thinking (lest I be a betrayer to the cause&#160;:) ).<a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 13:28, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First of all, I've had enough with the plot theory on my hometown page. People claim that Roman county was absorbed by Neamt county, just to change ethnic proportions and to stop Hungarians from ever claiming parts of Neamt county. Well, I think more Hungarians are living in Siret valley than on Bistrita valley and, anyway, there weren't elections and there was no claimant left un-jailed (if there ever was one of them). It comes down to a theory of country salvation, but also a horrible communist act, which is of course funny and unfunded, while reverting is boring. This Hungarian danger attacking Moldova is pretty boring and I hope Bonaparte is not one of those scared by the possibility of a Hungarian Pascani. I will try to revert the Hungarian names and hopefully no war will start, be it an edit war or a Hungarian invasion. I hope Romanian names will make it in Serbia and I hope Balkans will once and for all stop all the unrests.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuci_Sandor_c1e5.html" title="User:Luci Sandor">Luci_Sandor</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELuci_Sandor_219c.html" title="User talk:Luci Sandor">talk</a>,&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Luci_Sandor_7991.html" title="Special:Contributions/Luci Sandor">contribs</a>)&#160;</small><a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a>&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg/20px-Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Jersey.svg_0583.html" /></a> 00:49, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Bogdan,</p>
<p>I'd like to start putting a bit in perspective the articles related to two extremely controversed subjects: Golaniada and Mineriada. As they are now, they express only the oppinion of supporters. While I respect your oppinion, I think this is not fair, nor NPOV. Why am I doing this? Because I think it is time to see the things as they were and cease to create false moral references. It's like being religious just because you cannot judge by yourself.</p>
<p>So: I made a first edit that may have been a little premature. Let's discuss this and come up with a NPOV version. I believe that the following things must be said here:</p>
<ol>
<li>. The anti-communists were mostly former communists.</li>
<li>. The majority of the population was against it.</li>
<li>. The guilt is not as clear-cut as the articles present it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me argue a bit for these two points:</p>
<p>1. In 1989 the Communist Party had almost 4 members for a population of 22 million (the largest communist party in relative terms). It was practically impossible to obtain a position of responsibility without being a party member. For instance, becoming a University professor practically required party membership. It was also practically impossible to go abroad without the consent of the Securitate (which in a sense formed the hard core of the regime). Therefore:</p>
<p>a) Of the University professors that participated to Golaniad, most were party members.</p>
<p>b) Unfortunately, the situation was even "worse", because many of the moral references of the Golaniad had been deeply involved with the communist power. I already mentioned Paler, but I should also mention Blandiana, which navigated for a long time in the communist high-life. To my knowledge, the communist high-life and the members of the "Securitate" dispersed rather indiscriminately in the new political parties, and occupied high rank positions even in PNT. Of course, there were figures like Coposu (or you preferred opponent), but there were only few left from before 1944, while the younger ones were actually as dissident as Iliescu.</p>
<p>2. The majority of the population of Bucharest did not support the Golaniad movement. And there is a clear measure for this: the results of the 1990 elections. You can argue that the public was not well informed, and I clearly agree with you, but nonetheless, this is a fact. What I wrote about disruptive behavior is true. Just imagine Times Square, or Place de l'Etoile blocked for months. Actually, this is why I mostly resent the current presentation: I used to live nearby and it became a hell after the first two weeks. And people were actually more annoyed than anything else.</p>
<p>3. Something must be said about the situation of the police (or were they still "militia"?) at that time. I do not know your age (I'm 30, therefore 14 at the time), but you may remember that the guys were afraid of doing anything. This is at least one of the causes 13 june was possible, as well as the Targu Mures events. This is usually called "vid de putere" (lack of power).</p>
<p>So: let's discuss this.</p>

<p>Salut, am nevoie de cunostintele tale.</p>
<p>Cat de multe cuvinte au fost introduse din Italiana si franceza, in romana? Cat de multe procente fac aceste cuvinte din limba noastra? Cat de multe procente din cuvinte sunt de origine latina? Se spune ca sunt in jur de 60-70, dar cum a fost cazul inainte de a imprumuta aceste cuvinte? Cat de latina a fost graiul munteneasc si moldovenesc? --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 12:49, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whatever good info you guys gather, add it here:<a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_lexis.html" title="Romanian lexis">Romanian lexis</a>. But the opening paragraph will not give percentages for the contemporary language, I chose to frame the article in a more professional chronological fashion, unlike the less-professional Bulgarian, Spanish, and Portuguese, etc., articles.

<dd>Nu se poate da un răspuns clar la o asemenea întrebare. Depinde cum faci calculul. Procentul de cuvinte din dicţionar, procentul de cuvinte folosit în cărţi, procentul de cuvinte folosite în conversaţie, etc. Chiar şi aşa variază în funcţie de stilul de a vorbi al fiecărei persoane. De exemplu, la ţară se folosesc mai puţine neologisme decât la oraş. În zonele izolate (de exemplu în Apuseni), nu prea se folosesc neologisme, în timp ce în mediile specializate (afaceri, ştiinţă, etc) se folosesc extrem de multe neologisme.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ca exemplu, în poezia lui Eminescu:</p>
<pre>
                Vocabulary      Usage
1. latin inherited:  48,68%      83,00%
2. slavic            16,81%       6,93%
3. french            11,97%       2,52%
4. latin literary     3,41%       1,13%
5. hungarian          1,63%       0,84%
6. neogreek           1,33%       0,29%
7. turkish            1,20%       0,28%
</pre>
<p>Cât despre diferenţa în numărul de cuvinte moştenite între graiul muntenesc şi moldovenesc, ea nu este semnificativă: în general diferenţele consist în cuvinte împrumutate (din tătară, ucrainiană în Moldova şi din turcă, greacă în Muntenia)</p>

<dd>No, I don't have an exact figure, but I'd guess it's something like 70-80% French and/or Italian, 8-10% Slavic (most of them obsolete and replaced by the French words), 5-6% Latin inherited.

<dd>I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. I asked how much of our language was replaced with words from French and Italian.

<dd>I have a plan, my friends.

<p>Are you sure Transylvania was a ROMANIAN voivodship in 1600? As far as I know, the expression "Romanian" was only used in Wallachia, and only after the 19th century, the creation of modern Romania was the meaning extended to Moldova? And to Transylvania after 1920.<br />
The explanatory text you have written is misleading anyway. A foreigner not familiar with Transylvanian history would think that Transylvania was united with the two other principalities for quite a long time during the middle ages and this state was called Romania. --<a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKIDB_32a1.html" title="User:KIDB">KIDB</a> 15:52, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know what you intend, but the way you wrote it was quite ambiguous. The expression "Romanian" was used throughout Transylvania and Moldavia, <i>but was it used when speaking of voivodships (e.g., a Romanian voivodship of Transylvania)</i>. Non-Romanian, non-Hungarian readers stumbling upon this page can easily read your sentence and get the impression that the <i><a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjective.html" title="Adjective">adjective</a>/<a href="../../../n/o/u/Noun.html" title="Noun">noun</a></i> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">Romanian</a> simply dropped from the sky after the 19th century, when in fact it goes back before 1600 as shown by documents (much earlier than that, there are simply no documents, but no historian or linguist disputes that the term evolved directly from the Latin word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/romanus" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:romanus">Romanus</a>, meaning <i>a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a></i>, e.g., a citizen of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, citizenship (thus, the right to call oneself a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a>) having been extended to all who lived in the Roman territory.

<p>My vote goes to KIDB on this one.He is right-for-all-purposes on the question of the adjective (sure the term features in Miron Costin's or whatever's works, but it is <i>nowhere</i> meant to imagine a state). If it is meant for ethnicity:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Let us be reserved about attributing ethnicieties in the Middle Ages;</li>
<li>2. Let us admit that Transylvania was not Romanian-ruled (ethnically, or state-included... since, well, the state only originated in 1866).<a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 18:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the case of <i>Romanian</i>, I do not agree with your point number 1. The Vlachs, foremost, used a term deriving from <i>romanus</i> to describe themselves: that term was/is <i>român</i> and/or <i>rumân</i> (=Romanian, in English). Their ethnicity was <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanians.html" title="Romanians">Romanian</a> (those north of the Danube). Of course, we cannot speak of a Romanian <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> back then, but <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a>, I see no problem. Does any historian see a problem here? Alexander 007 18:44, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ethnicity is contrieved, just as well. The identity was given by Orthodoxy, if need be, and by the fact that they were serfs. Their serfdom and, thus, not-really-there-officially status within Transylvania is the most relevant reason for caution with "Transylvania being Romanian". Consider as parallels: "Mexico is Aztec", "Canada is Algonquin", "Australia is Aborigenous Australian" etc. The fact is that there was no nation other than nobility (and ethnicity was defined within it, if need be, for Hungarians, Szeklers and Saxons: which was not a distinction in the modern sense, since they were different social categories - respectively noblemen-proper, free men, colonists obeying the king). The "Romanian Principality of Transylvania" is a leftover of Ceausescu rhetoric (mainly whitewashing). I hope the point I'm making does not make me look like being on the different side of a barricade. I just aim for less subjectivity. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 19:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dahn, can you be more specific? Saying: "Their identity was given...by the fact that they were serfs..." is not quite illuminating for an English reader, nor does it seem accurate. Nor would historians agree that their <i>ethnic</i> identity was given by their Orthodoxy or their "serfdom". If a <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_peoples.html" title="Slavic peoples">Slav</a> was a serf, and Orthodox, he would still not be a <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlach.html" title="Vlach">Vlach</a>/<a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian.html" title="Romanian">Romanian</a>. Unless I'm mistaken, you are speaking of social status, not ethnicity. Alexander 007 19:57, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To repeat: I disagree completely with your point number 1 as far as Romanians in the Middle Ages are concerned. Alexander 007 20:07, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As far as the Hungarians were concerned, people of all origin could be serfs. However, some Catholics were serfs, as opposed to all Orthodox being serfs (by law). The identity was exclusively religious from the point of view of the functional/functioning state-structure. On the bottom level, the situation cannot <i>really</i> be reconstructed. I. e.: I do not think that "Slav" serfs and "Romanian" serfs made a distinction among themselves as for the sake of it. Whatever people called themselves cannot be known for sure. Why? Because a person who had the means to learn to write (and thus record it), up until the XVIth century or so (and in many regions for long after that), was no longer connected in any way with serfs etc. That "they considered themselves..." is a generic statetment, for which there can be no proof. Whatever identity was slowly forged, it was given in time by servitude itself. Most serfs would not see whatever was beyond the domain they were tied to (it's a documented fact, I've read books that made this clear for serfs in Northern Italy or Southern France, such as that of <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmanuel_Le_Roy_Ladurie_81d5.html" title="Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie">Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie</a> - I really see no point for it being otherwise here). The grinding mechanism of other forces, introduced by modernity, has ssslllooowwwllllyyyy constructed different options. And even then, if you look at the Romanian Transylvanian peasants as late as 1848, they were deeply loyal to the Emperor in Vienna. Even intellectuals in the Transylvanian School had used the ideology of our Latin origin to prove: 1. that we had as "clean" a pedigree as any other nation (since prejudice against them had been turning to ethnical themes, a contribution of secularism within the Empire); 2. that we were deeply connected to the person of a still-offically-Roman Emperor (of the Holy Roman Empire, of course).<a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But pehaps all of this is beside the point: even under your own assumptions, Transylvania cannot be "Romanian", since it never had a Romanian administration.<a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:44, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I disagree with your point 1 completely in this case. Your speculation that the average Slav and Vlach in the same social class did not make an ethnic distinction is unverifiable, and contradicted by evidence to the contrary (I seem to remember, for example, <i>Vlachs, Bulgars, and Greeks</i>, Bulgars by that time meaning <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarians.html" title="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a> (a <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_peoples.html" title="Slavic peoples">Slav</a> people), unless I'm mistaken). If you look at the Aromanians and Istro-Romanians in diaspora, they also preserved their own idea of a distinct romanus-derived ethnicity up into modern times. Your speculation is rather wrong, and it is preferable that you don't include your speculation in Wikipedia articles unless you have suitable references. But yeah, probably the lines between ethnic groups were often eclipsed by social status, but that doesn't negate ethnic distinctions. The Daco-Romanian speaking Vlachs of the Middle Ages were ethnic Romanians of their time, nor do I know of a historian who would disagree with that terminology. It is not quite an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a>, as you speculate. Alexander 007 20:52, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again. What contributed to the distinctions (and it did so <i>in time</i>) was the fact that <i>serfs were not allowed to move</i>. Which led to uniformity in regions. You assume that they were dealing with speakers of several languages on a regular bases. I don't think that they did. I mean, look around: social levels and languages/identities tend to co-incide, which led to assimilations <i>within</i> one level and differentiations <i>between</i> levels. Let me point out that, if "Iancu" Hunyadi ever identified himself as "Romanian" or whatever, he was still <i>regent of Hungary</i>. How is "being Romanian" matter here, even if appliable?! The same for Aromanians (which are only <i>arguably</i> and <i>wishful-thinking</i>-fuly "Romanian"). What mattered in their difference was the fact that most were sheepherders, mobile and free. But, for the third time, even if I am completely wrong about all of these, <i>nothing makes 1600s Transylvania "Romanian"</i>. If you don't change the legend on the map, I'm gonna go over to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> article and change the title to the "Sioux United States".

<p>Fine. Do as you will. Let me go out on this note: I did provide proof for my statements (or directed in that general area). An anthropological studies of records have shown that ethnicity was purely abstract in the Middle Ages (Ladurie, for one). Lucian Boia has also made ample comments on XIXth century etc, national mythology and its dream of etarnal existence. The Scool of Annales has shown that nuance and carefulness should dominate our perspective about the past, especially the time dealt with here (since it has been the working tool of nationalism for so long). Check out <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernand_Braudel_44f6.html" title="Fernand Braudel">Fernand Braudel</a>'s <i>La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen a l'époque de Philippe II</i> for a perspective on what dominated the Balkans during the 1590s (his is an analysis that also looks deep beyond that time). The prevailing point of view is that people's identities were constantly shifting: the common, generic, level was <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christendom.html" title="Christendom">Christendom</a> (or a particular Church). Beyond it was the social order you belonged to, and then the ellusive ethnicity (which never "stayed put": compare with the many avatars of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniaks.html" title="Bosniaks">Bosniaks</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croats</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainians.html" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a> etc.). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh ok. You're right. Romania is unique. I'm sorry, I didn't realize it. Also, here we can breathe under water and leap over high buildings. (Note: Braudel made points about the Balkans as well.

"united" - plus the map that I think you created), the one about Zalmoxis (on and on about things that can hardly be true, and with a picture that is interesting, but hardly factual). There are some others.

<dd><i>In early medieval Latin documents Vlachs were also referred to as "Timocanis". Also, the term "moţ", used to designate Romanians living in Western Carpathian mountains, may have its root in the Ti<b>mok</b> word. (Ti-mok =&gt; ti=Hungarian "you" + mok-&gt; moţ (say: motz)).</i></dd>

<dd>Can't be, because the Vlachs of Timok speak the Oltenian grai of Romanian, not the Transylvanian one. (This does not exclude a migration from Timok before the graiuri were splitted, but the Hungarians theory states that the Romanians came to Transylvania rather late.) <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 18:58, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I might be wrong. But I was also adding new info to the article itself. The best we can do is a revised version for both our edits. Since mine is, alas, the newer one, you could go on the page and perhaps merge it with what you want kept.

<p>This particular category is bewildering. The Category:Writers by language has clearly been created to cover people who write in languages without official status or with secondary status (Breton, Catalan, Kurdish etc.).

<dd>Yes, that category, the way it is now is redundant.

</dl>
<p>No, because many Romanian writers have not limited themselves to Romanian, and several included have not written at all in Romanian (I guess it might be the same for Moldovans). The category Romanian language authors should just go out the window, in my opinion. I think that Bonaparte did not consider the details of it, since all he wanted to do was to cover ground before the Moldovans got to it. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 16:24, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gentle Editor/Administrator, In the Vadim Tudor discussion page we seem to have reached a consensus that "Great Romania" should indeed be changed to "Greater Romania" (notice the "ER") added.</p>
<p>I tried to change the subject line in the article on "Great Romania" but could not. Would very much appreciate if you could make this one correction, as evidently only people with access can make this change. I will do my best to make all the other changes.</p>
<p>If you have questions, pls see our discussion in the Vadim discussion area.</p>
<p>Many thanks MIsterMan</p>

<p>Thanks again. By why did you state they are copyrighted? They might be, I guess, but the Romanian version says they were released into public domain.

<dd>Because by the laws of the EU, the copyright length lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. Since the two painters died less that 70 years ago, their works are still protected.

<dd>By the way,I don't want to be offensive,but I saw that other people complain about your behavior.namely silent deletes and the likes. Without any notice nor discussion you placed my article on copyright infringement. Well suppose that was so. What you do is at least a "not fair" procedure. My guess is that your administrator "status" somehow implies a higher rank on a wikipedia "hierarchy" that you probably perceive. Try and take it easier with that or some people, including I,would likely complain about your behaviour to those even higher on the "hierarchy" than you. This romanian-police-like attitude quite familiar to me and I can't tollerate it on such a forum.--<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadufan_ba22.html" title="User:Radufan">Radufan</a> 14:07, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You copy-pasted it from a website. It is a copyright violation, there's absolutely no question about it. If you want, you can complain, I won't stop you, but you're wasting your time. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 14:13, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I copy pasted and was working on it at the moment you intruded. I was taking the History of Hungarians Jews model and was looking for info and writting it. You are simply doing a police-like job rather than administrate. A note and possible guidlenes on writting it would have been nice. You are way off-track in what you're doing.

<dd>Wikipedia should not contain copyright violations, period. Not just "temporarily", not in the page history, that's the Wikipedia policy.

<dd>why then did I have to go look for who placed it on copyright infringement?because you are too incomptent to administrate,not police-around. You attempt on my good-faith in writing this. That still doesn't excuse you.period

<dd>I cited my source just as the jewis community website.it is stated above the chronolgy that the article is taken from:"From the History Museum of the Romanian Jews; Hasefer Publishing House " I did just that. Plus I was in the process of editing it and gathering more information. That is complete nonsense of you.

<p>The Wikiproject No Ads, created as a backlash against the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_1-Click_Answers_172e.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/1-Click Answers">Answers.com deal</a>, has served an important function in providing a space for users to express their disagreement with the Foundation proposal. While the current controversies about userboxes raise questions about political and social advocacy on Wikipedia, there should be greater flexibility regarding advocacy <i><b>about</b></i> Wikipedia in the Wikipedia namespace. Reported and linked by Slashdot and other press sources as a unique and spontaneous occurence in Wikipedia history, it has apparently had some impact as, despite being scheduled to begin in January, not a peep has been heard about the trial and proposed sponsored link since the deal's controversial announcement months ago. Currently, however, there is <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_No_ads_e460.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject No ads">an attempt to delete the project or move it off Wikipedia altogether</a>. Since the Foundation has provided no additional information and has not attempted to answer the specific questions that participants in the project raised, it is unclear if the Answers.com deal has been abandoned or simply delayed. Until the situation becomes more clear, I believe the group should still have a place in the Wikipedia namespace.
