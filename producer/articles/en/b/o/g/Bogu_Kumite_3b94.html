	    <p><b>Bogu Kumite</b>-armored fighting, is a form of training used in some Okinawan kempo styles of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">karate</a>. The origin of this unique training approach is credited to Shigeru Nakamura. Nakamura was the teacher of important martial artists such as Sekichi Odo and Seiyu Oyata.</p>
<p>Bogu Kumite is a rough, full contact training method in which the participants are discouraged against feints and jabs and expected to throw full-power blows. Rules vary between practitioners; but, a generally accepted norm is to only count strikes that would incapacitate the opponent, had he not been wearing the gear. Hits must land on the gear and on the steel cage of the mask.</p>

<p>An interesting article by Col Roy J. Hobbs about the history of Seidokan Karate reveals an important note about the effect bogu kumite has had on all of Karate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The martial arts political scene of Okinawa has often changed over the years. One change, in the mid sixties, was when the All Japan Karate Association split into a number of factions. Sparring style was the gist of this split. The most widely accepted method of sparring in Japan, was, and still is, the "controlled contact" variety. It was generally felt, by the All Japan Karate Association, that this "controlled contact" sparring should be taught, practiced, and officially sanctioned. One of the main points of contention was the traditional full contact method of sparring utilized on Okinawa. This type of sparring employed the use of body armor similar to that used in Kendo (Japanese fencing). It was quite brutal and knockouts were not uncommon. Since the main goal of the All Japan Karate Association was to integrate the Karate of Okinawa, now officially part of Japan, with the Karate of the main islands of Japan, conflict was bound to arise. Many, like Shian Toma, were brought up in the "hard" way and felt it was the true Okinawan way. Shian Toma also had the reputation for being a tough, no nonsense karateka, and was well respected for his fighting abilities both inside and outside the dojo. Thus, the split occurred, and the Okinawa Kempo Association was formed, made up of similarly traditional hard and tough sensei. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dennis Branchaud, Hachidan in karate and kobu-jutsu, writes this of his bogu experience with Sensei Odo on Okinawa.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was adamant about showing respect to the spirits before kumite. He insisted that if you failed to show proper respect by bowing (while kneeling) and remaining on your knees while putting on the gear or removing the gear, you would risk trouble. He said "maybe break arm or leg". He got furious when this rule was even slightly violated. Stopping the match was not allowed. We once had a man who got knocked out quite dramatically from a head strike. The following week his men became loose during kumite and he tried to stop the match to tighten it. Sensei flew to his feet and sternly said "No stop. Break arm, break leg- no stop!" He was livid. He made his point. If the match ended up on the ground we were to keep fighting until we were physically separated, dragged across the floor, yanked to our feet and shoved back into each other. Points were never scored and the matches ran for two or three minutes. There was never a declaration of "winner" or "loser". The match simply ended and you knew how you fared.</p>

<p>Bogu gear is made of pieces analogous to those of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendo.html" title="Kendo">kendo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogu.html" title="Bogu">bogu</a></p>
<p><b>Men</b>- steel cage mask (or heavy clear plastic) that covers the anterior and lateral head, with an opening in back. It extends to the neck to provide a degree of control during heavy impacts. Kumite men usually have shorter neck pieces since they do not usually need to stop the heavy blows to the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clavicle.html" title="Clavicle">clavicle</a> as with kendo armor.</p>
<p><b>Kote</b>- padded gloves, often of the <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kempo.html" title="Kempo">Kempo</a> variety with finger articulations.</p>
<p><b>Do</b>- semi-rigid chest protector made with several padded plates of various materials such as heavy plastic or light metals sewn into it.</p>
<p>Participants also usually wear a groin protector, elbow pads and shin protectors as with other karate training methods.</p>
