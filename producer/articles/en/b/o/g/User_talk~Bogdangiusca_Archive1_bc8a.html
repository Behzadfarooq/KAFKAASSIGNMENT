<p>Hello,<br />
I am one of the contributors from the Polish Wikipedia.<br />
Could you possibly create and upload also a blank map of Romania (with no lettering) so that help other language Wikipedias benefit from your hard work. Thank you.

<dd>Great! Thanks a lot. I suppose the map will do. However we, in Poland, have some "our" names of Romanian cites - Braszów, Krajowa, Konstanca. Still it will be much better than the CIA map with only English names.<br />

<p>I really like that map you use of Romania. I wish every province/state/country article on Wikipedia had one that like that. What software did you use?</p>

<dd>I used XaraX from <a href="http://www.xara.com/products/xarax/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xara.com/products/xarax/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (a vectorial graphics program)</dd>
<dd>About how it was made: First I got a public-domain administrative map and imported it in XaraX, then used the pen tool to create poly-lines of each county. It's pretty easy in Xara, I think it took me between a half an hour to an hour the effective drawing time.</dd>

<p>Hi, you cast a vote in the TEMP5 debate. The Temp5 proposal was voted down by 61.3% to 38.6%. We seem to be going around in circles on the whole issue of the main page. A new vote is now taking place to clarify what <i>exactly</i> we want, namely</p>
<ol>
<li>Do we actually <i>want</i> to have a new page?</li>
<li>If so <i>when</i> (immediately, after a pause, timed to the press release, etc)?</li>
<li>What do people want on the front page and what do they want excluded?</li>
</ol>
<p>As of now, the whole issue seems surrounded by complete confusion. This way, <i>finally</i> and <i>definitively</i>, we will know <i>what</i> we want and <i>when</i> we want it. So do please express your opinions. The vote is on the same page as the previous votes. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 20:31, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your series of articles on Romania could, and IMHO should, be reduced to a single one. Most of them would form a single paragraph in a consistant history, whereas now you have to jump from article to article to learn it. Given the way the 'net works, I assure you that your readers will stop after the first one.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The idea was to include a brief history on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a>, that will be expanded in separate articles, the way <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_a072.html" title="History of the United States">History of the United States</a> is organized.</dd>

<p>No, actually its YOUR view that are not accepted by moden historians. There is not one shred of proof to support continuity, and every evidence against it. What youve written on this topic is idiocy - truly. I am not Hungarian and have no preference for hungarians.

<p>Thanks for the help on the Dacian words. Your English is obviously better than my Romanian. I had translated the article from the Romanian-language site, which could (of course) presume that the meanings of these words were self-evident.

<p>On the heads of state pages, I've generally put not fully sovereign rulers indented (**) within the state to which they owed allegiance. Thus, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallachia.html" title="Wallachia">Wallachian</a> rulers ought to go under <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> (which, of course, does not yet exist on most of these pages).

<dl>
<dd>Actually, it kept its full autonomy (in exchange of an anual tribute) and voivodes were not always allegient to the Turks, as they would often even fight against the Turkish armies. So, it's pretty hard to say when it was independent and when was a not. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 08:07, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, autonomous, certainly. But they were not considered sovereign, as far as I am aware. I mean, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> was <i>de facto</i> independent from 1878, but it was still considered to be technically part of the Ottoman Empire until 1908 - the liberal government of that year was even going to have Bulgarian reps in the new Ottoman parliament. So, autonomy, yeah, maybe even <i>de facto</i> independence, but <i>de jure</i> the regions were considered (at least by the other European states) to be part of the Ottoman Empire. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 08:12, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. The European states recognized Romania only <i>after</i> the Independence War of 1877. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 08:20, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>Some comments on your <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolae_Paulescu_57fe.html" title="Nicolae Paulescu">Nicolae Paulescu</a> article.</p>
<p>1) Paulescu was definitely NOT the "discoverer of insulin", by any definition. The nature of insulin, although it was not called this at the time of course, was first discovered by Oscar Minkowski in 1889, and further developed by Eugene Opie in 1901.</p>
<p>2) Paulescu was not the first to use insulin. This honour belongs to Georg Ludwig Zuelzer in 1906, followed up with similar studies by E.L. Scott and Israel Kleiner in the pre-war era, all predating or being contemporaries of Paulescu's work. In fact it appears that Paulescu's methodology was a copy of Scott's.</p>
<p>3) Paulescu's method could not be used for the treatment of diabetes. Like the other teams, his methods extracted the insulin by essentially grinding up the pancreas. This makes it impossible to extract the pure insulin from the other biological material, thus making it essentially useless for injection into anyone but the person it came from. It was Banting's idea to naturally "kill off" the rest of the pancreas that was the key to successful extraction, something no-one else suggested before.</p>
<p>4) Banting and Best did NOT duplicate his experiments. Banting's notebook on his unique method predates Paulescu's publications by well over a year. Moreover the experiments are completely unlike each other. There appears to be no evidence that he was even aware of Paulescu's experiments until after he won the Nobel in 1923. Later that year Paulescu wrote to Banting including his papers, assuming he had read them.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of Romanian sites claiming Paulescu to be a "victim" of some sort of conspiracy, but the historical record is pretty clear on this: Paulescu was one of many steps on the long road to the successful extraction of insulin, but certainly by no means was he the first (discoverer) or last (successful) step.</p>

<p>Hi! Are you going to add the figures about nationalitites to all the county entries? I see you have done it for Bihor, but not for Harghita or Cluj, for example. In fact, I already started to add them for Harghita, Covasna, Mures and Cluj before realising you did it for Bihor. Maybe it would be enough to list only those nationalities wich make up more then 1% of the population, and provide a link to the statistical office for those interested.

<dd>Hi Bogdan! I asked you the same question on ro.wikipedia, but if you read here before...&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>What is the licence of the small map you upload for judets&#160;?</dd>
<dd>I use them on the French wiki, but we want to know the licence. Is it <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>&#160;? Thanks in advance iubito 10:47, 3 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bogdan, remember the discussion of Dacian toponmys Boraczek, you, and me were engaged in? In the end, we reached a compromise on the text to be included about this argument. However, I just checked the equivalent article in the Romanian Wikipedia, and it seems to have the old version, with Varadia listed as a Dacian name etc. Could you please check and update the version in Romanian? I would do it myself, but unfortunately I do not speak Romanian. --<a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamas_284d.html" title="User:Tamas">Tamas</a> 15:20, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Can you please re-upload the image of rugby football as a .jpg rather than a gif. also perhaps, while we don't have any pictures on the Football page for other sports, it should be placed on the Rugby football page instead. I would like to see pictures on the football page, but I would prefer to see pages that reflect the content of the article and its emphasis on the earlier history of the game. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 21:20, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Bogdan,</p>
<p>could you please explain your overreaction? Before proposing change, I've checked the sources at hand, and they didn't contradict to what I've written.</p>
<p>As a foreigner, I don't see what's wrong or derogatory in tracing Romania to Roma, so I would be grateful if you englight me.</p>

<p>Hi, Bogdan. I see you're an expert on Wiki imaging. Would you upload an aerial picture of that isle (and may be other images of our mutual interest) correctly having an HTML link? This is a temporary need, I hope to learn respective rules and procedures as soon as possible. Best wishes, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, there is a problem with copyright, as that aerial picture is copyrighted. We would need the author's permission before uploading it to wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 15:40, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll check legal status of that picture ASAP. Actually, copyright in Ukraine is something pretty different from civilized world. Many media companies only require claiming the fact that we took the picture from their resource, without payments or restrictions.
<dl>
<dd>You could also help by looking for appropiate picture by yourself, especially if you read Ukrainian and/or Russian (do you?). Some Ukrainian web-zines have English versions too. Of course, If you have enough time for that. Anyway, thanks for cooperation. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexPU_ea69.html" title="User:AlexPU">AlexPU</a></dd>

<p>Greetings. I am not finished writing <i>Raul Hilberg</i>, nor am I finished writing the article for his TDotEJ. I request that you refrain from formating these (unless you see something grossly at fault) - the picture you moved dosen't fit yet, though it might once the article is at a more developed stage. Feel free to continue <i>writing</i> the article though (that is something that might be helpful), or make any editorial changes in the discussion field. I Will be happy to review these. This is only a <i>request</i> — you are free to ignore it, I suppose. Incidentally, I like having lengthy bib. at the bottom and most of my article are written in that way, please do not switch the bib. with the ext. links in other articles that I have written.

<p>Hi Bogdan!</p>
<p>There are two new translation efforts this week: a wikimedia newsletter, and a global press release. We very much need someone to handle translations into smaller languages, and provide feedback on the wikiprojects from their languages (in the newsletter, under <i>out of the projects</i>). See <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Translation_requests" class="extiw" title="m:Translation_requests">m:Translation requests</a> for details.</p>
