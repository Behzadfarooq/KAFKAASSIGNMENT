<h2><span class="mw-headline">Igor no longer banned: now editing as User:Igor B.</span></h2>
<p>Igor has indirectly responded to my plea above by editing the article as <a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgor_B._1494.html" title="User:Igor B.">Igor B.</a> (and has improved the article by uploading and inserting a personal photo). He is no longer banned from editing the article, but edits on the same conditions as everyone else. I ask <b>everybody</b> to refrain from sterile edit warring, and to work towards consensus on this talkpage. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:17, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good. Thank you Bishonen for having removed my "banned status".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>since Igor never submitted to his "banned status", what difference did it make in the first place? (when us honest editors are blocked for 24 hours, we don't edit for at least 24 hours.) what law is there for someone above the law? <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 02:10, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that EE Guy, E.Shalow (for the photos) and yourself have really improved the article and it is now a faithfull and well balanced informative article about the "affair". If it is not subject to a new wave of changes or perturbative actions we (Grichka and myself) have no more reasons to modify it (except, perhaps, for minor details like "Honorable mention" and the number of citations).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since the very beginning of this "editing war", we did not battle for a blindly "positive article"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>that is decidedly a false statement. what we normally call a "baldface lie".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(which would have been ridiculous since it is dealing with the "affair") but only for an objective and balanced "compte rendu". There are some things that are obviously unpleasant to us (CQG statement, Hawkins report, last Motl's citation) but we accept it as it is&#160;: a faithfull image of the reality surrounding the "affair". We hope that certain of the most "determined contributors" will also accept the positive informations that are balancing the negative ones.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you again for all your efforts in the matter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks, Igor. Note that your name account will be especially useful for you (and convenient for admins and others) if you log in for <b>all</b> editing — editing on this page, too!

Also, you'll have access to the useful "Watchlist" feature, that can tell you immediately when anybody edits <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogdanov_Affair_7b8e.html" title="Bogdanov Affair">Bogdanov Affair</a>, for instance. (Just click the "watch" link top right on any page that you'd like to keep an eye on.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:59, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>yeah, like Igor's gonna pay any attention to those "New messages" that he's been blocked for any reason. why bother, when he can just get another IP and edit away? <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 02:10, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but the concept of "subarticle" in the sense "Not an article that can stand on its own as encyclopedic" is not accepted on Wikipedia. And obviously a text written in the first person--an argument, yet--wouldn't be an encyclopedic article, so I'm afraid creating it would be a waste of time. I foresee that it would be briefly discussed on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, where it would be condemned (for Wikipedia purposes) as "an essay", then deleted. Counterproposal: why not publish the text somewhere outside Wikipedia--on the web--and put a pointer to it in the External links section in <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogdanov_Affair_7b8e.html" title="Bogdanov Affair">Bogdanov Affair</a>? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 06:37, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>YBM did that&#160;: he created a page on his web site and put an external link to Riazuelo's article. But do you (Bishonen) see <i>how</i> he did it&#160;? By using Wikipedia's design and imitating its style, in such a way that most readers will think that it is an article of Wikipedia&#160;! And the illusion is even stronger that in this page there are a lot of links which point to articles of Wikipedia, exactly as if it <i>was</i> one of them&#160;!</dd>
<dd>I don't know if he has strictly the right to do that&#160;: Wikipedia's style can be free of copyright, I don't know... But I hope you will appreciate at its true value YBM's sense of manipulation.</dd>
<dd>I remind you that Riazuelo and YBM are <i>personal</i> enemies of the Bogdanov brothers, two of the most relentless ones among people who harass them on all the fora for monthes and monthes. YBM's site has been made only in order to criticize and insult them. Thank you of taking this into account, even if you don't want me to write about the problem of harassment on the article "Bogdanov Affair" - in spite of the fact that it is an integral part of it, and despite the role of this harassment on the article itself.</dd>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I am normally a very patient and comprehensive person but I can no longer stand the repeated wrong assertions of Sophie Petterka (XAL) concerning my qualifications nor her constant raving about quite everything, especially in science. Once and for all, Ms Petterka, I do NOT have a Phd in physics even if I have some moderate knowledge about it. I wrote some remarks on usenet that I still consider perfectly well- founded in order to rectify certain points about the criticisms of ALBB by YBM, that's all. For the other points (not only in ALBB) concerning Igor and Grichka Bogdanov I think it is preferable for them to answer themselves since, of course, even if I've had some conversations with them, I cannot always tell exactly what they had in mind when they made some affirmations.</p>
<p>It‘s also time for you, Ms Petterka, to come back to Earth and realize that Alain Riazuelo IS A COSMOLOGIST and that he is perfectly qualified to discuss about early cosmology.</p>
<p><br />
BTW can YBM be more precise when he pretends that I lied in order to protect cranks? I suppose it’s only a bad expression .</p>

<dl>
<dd>I do not know who you are, and this family name was given by YBM, thought you only appear on the internet side I refer to as, Laurent. So I don't give a damn about your comments, and concerning Alain Riazuelo, I do maintain that he don't have a thing to do with cosmology, and that he know nothing of the subject and that he prooves it by staying away instead to present his academics and his area of research, which he has fail to do for 2 months now!&#160;:-P</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are not the one I refer to, so your comments are displaced here.</dd>
<dd>I didn't ask for you to pretend being somebody else.</dd>
<dd>I quote Laurent and not Laurent Sacco or something like that.</dd>
<dd>You are quiet late by the way? Staying too long on Rio Brava? or just never used before by ybm?</dd>
<dd>I also wondered how ybm could suddendly talk of a Laurent family name Sacco when he just had denied any knowledge of it and denied laurents' article in june 2004.</dd>

<dd>Glad to see you here, and to see someone from the "pro-Bogdanov" side explain to XAL how shamefull his behaviour is. I would have appreciated, though, that Igor would have done the same, but apparently he doesn't care much on the correctness of some people's conduct as long as they are on his "side" (same applies to some <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurence67_fab4.html" title="User:Laurence67">Laurence67</a>'s edits).

<dd>I've been a bit rude when qualifying your usenet post as lies, in fact there are some in it, but quite minor relativily to your purpose. Basically your post was a rhetoric escape, ignored most of the real problems with ALBB and had to rewrite part of the book to give it any sense.</dd>

<dd>To YBM and Laurent</dd>
<dd>The way imaginary numbers are mentionned by the Bogdanoff in this part of the book is extremely ambiguous, to say the least. YBM does not give them the benefit of doubt there, whereas Laurent does. There is definitely some links between complex numbers and many areas of physics. Everybody agrees on that. It is 99% sure that the Bogdanoff heard about it. There is however nothing that guarantees that any of these connexions they might have heard of was clearly understood by them. Moreover, there are plenty of others parts of the book which show in a much more definite way their poor understanding of many areas of science. For example, I think that both YBM and Laurent would agree that mentioning that the size of the Solar System was sensitive to the expansion of the Universe was incorrect (well, that becomes true soon before the Big Rip, but that's another story). So it is useless to argue about this issue imaginary numbers/imagination stuff. I do have the impression that Laurent was honestly trying to figure out some serious stuff they referring to, but contrarily to him, I think that even though they are right to point some connections between complex numbers and this or that, they do not understand them at all.</dd>

<dd>I'll let Laurent speak for himself, but regarding your last question, I don't think a "real scientific debate" belongs on Wikipedia, and definitely not on this Talk page where insults and disdain corrupt the discussion much too often.

<dd>Come on girls&#160;! I had to import a large part of Wikipedia CSS in the document in order to make it appear correctly, as it make an intensive usage of special style class, especially in order to have mathematical formulas correctly inserted in the text. The whole Wikipedia stuff (logo, sidebar, tabs, header and footer) is not on the copy of the text. Anyway, if you are so scrupulous about these kind of unlikely confusion (you'd better have the same attitude with Igor and Grichka usual behaviour, when it has been a real problem), I will try to change part of the style so that the page appear even more as not a part of Wikipedia), there's still some glitches I'll have to correct.</dd>

<p>As I told you this morning ybm, you cannot use photoshop to that kind of purpose, even with the help of JP Voyer who don't have a clue about this program and do believe that it is used by newspapers for their preprint!!! As I told you this morning, and you avoid answering to it but choose to reinsert the same article again and again, you cannot use photoshop to that purpose, as you cannot use an iron to make a phone call. You are so naïve to support the estonishing theories of JP Voyer, and of Alain Rialuezo, when in fact the guy has been bluffing you since the beginning. He isn't at all a specialist in cosmology and he hasn't read the thesis nor understood them. He simply don't have the level of expertise, as it can be seen in his lessons of physic given by him in your "previous " forum, before you made a copie conforme of it, without the disturbings contains..(((-:&gt;.</p>

<dd>I wonder what proportion of you mind is insane and which is dishonest, and if the sum is more than 100%. It is <i>Igor</i> who pretented first that Photoshop was used to compose pages at Grasset, then he realized how stupid it was to say so, and found another, contradictory, line of defense. Anyway, the <a href="http://ybmessager.free.fr/wp/presse/fauxbogdanov-en.html" class="external text" title="http://ybmessager.free.fr/wp/presse/fauxbogdanov-en.html" rel="nofollow">forgery of a preprint of their book</a> has been confirmed by Grasset. --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 18:33, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Really? I would be curious to know where and when Grasset "confirmed a forgery of the preprint of our book". Can you provide us any proofs of this? Of course not. As usual, you are diffaming without any grounds (except your own words). I talked to the people from Grasset this very morning&#160;: they are very surprised you pretend that they took position as you make them appear to have. This is another aspect of your person&#160;: if the reality is not the way you wish it to be, you will distord it untill it appears as you would like it to be. But there is a major difference between your "model of reality" and the reality itself. In this particular case, YBM, you have to know that your assumptions about "Grasset confirming...etc" are of no value. And you should stop right here.</p>

<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>Igor sayed to have use Photoshop to make a scanning of the document in order to can insert it on the internet, as it is the purpose of photoshop program beside its use for digital photography. I use it often myself, but I can see that you have no knowledge of this basic. Understandable since it is a very long time since you obtained your degree in informatic and the world of IT do have changed a lot since...((-:&gt;</p>
<p>Proove of it is also your compleete ignorancy in regard of IP adress and server network system. I use also a portable computer, with a blue tooth integrated internet connection system, and my IP will therefor change from a place to another. Anybody travelling from a city to another and using cyber café computer or librairy computer, or any internet access from a public place or access by capting the signals through blue tooth, will have a different IP adress. In order for wiki to follow up with the IT devellopment they will have to found another system than this IP signature as the iP is not controlable by the user but depend on where the user is to be found geographically. I have 47 different IP adresses, and am obliged to only send to wiki from my home base in order to avoid controversy and "socket puppets" accusations. Thought it was made anyway... Thats also why private mails can only be received at home base unless using a general mail box like yahoo, or msn, or any international mail box accessible from any computer with an internet connection. Upgrade your knowledge and your vision. As regarding my "more than 100%" (how scientifical!) degree of insanity and dishonnesty, this answer clarified it all and if in doubt, I learned it from you master lyer.</p>

<dd>It is indeed very scientific, in the limit case where you would be completely insane and completely dishonest, it would sum up to 200%.</dd>
<dd>You'd better read better what Igor wrote <a href="http://ybmessager.free.fr/wp/index.php?p=12" class="external text" title="http://ybmessager.free.fr/wp/index.php?p=12" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</dd>
<dd>Anyway he failed to explain why the photoshop file layers show that the image has been heavily processed around the offending sentence - thus proving that the "«" and "»" has been copied and pasted as bitmaps, and why the spacing is irrealistic.</dd>
<dd>What the hell are you talking about IPs and Wikipedia now&#160;? You should know that Wikipedia does not relies on IP in order to track editing, but for non authenticated authors. Explaining you a bit of TCP/IP and modern client/server technology is probably far beyond my capabilities, even if I use to teach them, I've never tried to do so inside a psychiatric hospital tough. --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 19:06, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fact being that you don't even have a clue as what I am referring to as you don't know a thing about new computer technology. My knowledge in this area is far more up to date than yours, and you can't hammer up with my know how in this area.</p>
<p>So go back to school instead of blaring. The Ip is the alone way through wich wiki can trac the editor so your rant is a confession of your ignorancy in this domain. You have never been able to advanced any prooves of your completely far out accusations about this photoshop <b>scanning</b>. Your bit map story has not a thing to do with what they used this photoshop for, and in fact a scanning with photoshop insure that the copy is as close to the original as possible, unless you wish to make a lawsuit against the editions Grasset..be my guest&#160;:-P</p>
<p>Regarding the psychiatric hospital I am very sorry but not so surprised to see you confined in such a place. I know it is going to be a very long time before you can come out and see the sun rise on Quimper again, but as long as they provide you with a bredband connection, I think you shoulf be glad and not so much aware of the change anyway..&lt;:-))P.</p>
<p>Not to forget, the insanity from your friend JP Voyer in the departement above yours, "restrain dpt", who had the vulgarity, with your permission, to insert those atrocities inside my own text. So I duplicate it here, for all to witness how far out you all be, thy god might have pity on your poor souls! Good I ain't God, 'cus I haven't this view on you both. He think he is General de Gaulles, also sign with this name (!!!) and believe that I am the reincarnation of Simone Veil (its getting creepy out there)))-:)</p>
<p>Also in his numerous mails to me, I let the other users to be judge of it, but in my mening they should put up the dosis, some Lindanaum, might do the trick. &lt;:-))P</p>
<p>PS: Bishonen it is in french and it wasn't me who inserted it in my own text. So if it was this you ment by "not inserting danish sentences on wiki english", I ain't to be blame, Thats YBMs' gurou, mister Voyer or de Gaulles, I ain't completely sure yet. But feel free to ask him directly for his identity, which he seemes to hide. Ashame?</p>

Pour prouver qu'il existait des guillemets sur un certain jeu d'épreuve, il suffisait de scanner l'épreuve et de la livrer au format .jpeg ou .tif par exemple. Nul besoin de Photoshop pour cela, et encore moins besoin de livrer des fichiers au format Photoshop, fichiers lourdement retouchés. Si les frères avaient eu deux sous de jugeotte, ils auraient retouché le scan puis ils l'auraient enregistré au format .jpeg depuis Photoshop et ils auraient publié ce document. Ainsi le tour aurait été joué, toute trace de manipulation aurait ainsi disparu.</dd>

How dare you mention this when the arbitration ABOUT IT is still rolling? Don't you believe that the administrators and arbitrators of wiki will be clever enough to see pass your tricks? Don't be so sure of your untouchability. The veil will soon fall. You didn't answer concerning photoshop real purpose and the mix of your friend, in french. Do you have any explaination for this behaviour, and do you mind staying on the subject, and stop making personal attack to divert from the real matter? This is the ninth time you make attempt do bring me in disgrace by making personnal attacks. Are you finish with it now? I believe this photoshop story and guillemets story and transcendental numbers to be over now. Case closed.</p>

<p>I think it will be better to have YBM stopping to make personal attacks on me to avoid the questions. He called me alier, insane, dishonnest up to 200%, from a psychiatric hospital, an idiot, a teolog with no understanding, an ignorant of IT, a socket puppet of Igor Bogdanov, and accused me for not delivering answers when I did deliver answers in order to avoid to take a new stand point on the basis of those answers. I chose to send him back the ball straight and smooth, with elegancy, to avoid any escalation of it and to make him understand that it wasn't going to work. I think you should point it to him from the beginning. Also to this anonymous person posting here under the name of general de gaulle and who is a very dear friend of YBM. I don't know what it is he is after, and his words make no sense at all.</p>

I have 47 different IP adresses, and am obliged to only send to wiki from my home base in order to avoid controversy and "socket puppets" accusations. Thought it was made anyway... Thats also why private mails can only be received at home base unless using a general mail box like yahoo, or msn, or any international mail box accessible from any computer with an internet connection.

<dd>just to let you (Bishonen) and everyone else know that i have not decided to "bow out". (it was wonderful temps here in New England and the rest of the Northeast U.S. and when i go out into the elements of nature, i assume there is no wi-fi there.) the deletion (or "suppression" as Igor would call it) of factual data, namely what identified physicists themselves say about the Bogdanov work is simply what it is, the deletion of relevant factual data that the B brothers do not like. it will go back in, but i am working on another section where these brief statements plus links to expanded statements are made. that is part of the affair.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>another part of the affair is the dirty tricks. we'll be spending some time to document them (essentially identifying from first person accounts on various blogs and web pages) examples of creation of bogus personalities (at least one of which Igor has admitted to here) and, most damningly, the ostensibly deliberate mistranslations of <b>criticism</b> (particularly dismissive critique) into <i>praise</i> of the B brothers published "research" and inclusion of that misappropriation on their books. that is, in and of itself, scandalous by the mores of most true scholars and deserves to be included.</dd>

Rbj&#160;: what you call "dirty tricks" is only the consequence of some things that we wrote, based on our full liberty as authors, in our book. Two remarks here&#160;:</p>
<p>1. Peter Woit&#160;: The slight mistranslation concerning <b>1 word</b> of his text (<i>"certain"</i> instead of <i>"certainly possible"</i>) was made by the translator of our Publisher and it was minor (did not change anything about the content of his text).</p>
<p>2. Schreiber&#160;: He made a good "step by step" analysis of our "démarche" and (except on 1 or 2 points) proposed a rather faithfull image of what we did. This is the reason why we decided to publish his text&#160;: as a good technical synthesis. Not for his conclusion that reflected a personal opinion (we beleive his conclusion was negative because in the paroxysm of the "hoax discussion" he had to claim "I do not agree with their work" in order to stay within the "conformal group"). This is what we beleive. Because his analysis was far too acurate and exact to "bear" such a conclusion which came from the context. If only you understood the definition of a partition function and the role it plays in our theory you would also understand why Schreiber's conclusion was not based on any technical point of view but on some contextual feeling. As authors, we decided not to publish this conclusion in our book because it was not relevant. You have not read our book. The Schreiber text was not published in the book itself but in one of the "annexes" of it (as a minor element). This is why we only went to the "essence" of it (a good technical analysis) and not to any personal conclusions. This is not a "dirty trick".</p>
<p>Here is what Schreiber might have seen in our theory. This is what should be discussed (don't hesitate to ask some theoretical physicists what they think of it&#160;: this is more important than asking Riazuelo what he thinks of quantum groups when he does not understand a single word of it).</p>
<p>Our partition function is quite general and corresponds to the sum on all the possible states of the metrics (in terms of signature). This partition function is written Z = trace of minus S exp minus beta H. When beta goes to 0, this partition function, clearly, does not diverges and is reduced to a topological invariant (exactly the same topological limit considered by Witten when H goes to 0). Of course, as far as the physics is concerned, there is a divergence around beta = 0; but note that our supergravity lagrangian is&#160;:</p>
<p>L = beta hat R + 1 over g squared R squared + alpha R,R dual.</p>
<p>So when beta goes to 0, we have showed that this lagrangian is reduced to the topological term alpha R,R dual, dominated by zero-size gravitational instanton. This result has been validated by all the string theorists involved in the committees (Kounnas specially). Instead of "puzzling" together the so called "dirty tricks" we played in our book, why dont you ask Kounnas (or Motl or whoever is competent in that field) what they think about our partition function and the form of our lagrangian?</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The gravitational instantons based on the topological action could indeed be an important part of a dual, "quantum foam" description of quantum gravity. Nevertheless, it is hard for me to agree with your statement that the Lagrangian "reduces" to the topological term. In the full Lagrangian, if written properly, there are also higher derivative terms that are expected to exceed the "R squared" topological term at ultrashort distances, near the big bang you study, much like the Einstein-Hilbert action, which you write among your terms of choice, wins at long distance scales. These terms appear even if you have 32 supercharges in supergravity, and they are the main reason why we normally believe that the usual geometric and topological intuition should not be trusted at subPlanckian distances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you think that there are no E-H and higher-order non-topological terms in the action in your limit, you would have to give more evidence for this statement. In that case, it would indeed be an extraordinarily interesting observation. More generally, my feeling is that the brothers at least approximately know what the Lagrangian and the partition sum are, and their work deserves to be respected as an attempt to uncover some interesting gravitational short-distance physics - an attempt that has not quite succeeded yet. And this discussion looks, because of their contribution, as a legitimate discussion about a speculative idea - and no one has the moral right to humiliate them just because their route to physics was unusual.

YBM&#160;: About Schreiber&#160;: his text (published in the "annexes" and not in the book itself) was - as I wrote above- a technical "step by step" analysis. Schreiber's personal conclusion was totally irrelevant. It is one thing to say "here is the technical construction" and another thing to add "here is what I think". Because what "Schreiber think" was a personal and simple opinion that was not argumented and demonstrated on scientific basis. The only thing that was a little argumented was the "step by step". If Schreiber had developped the reasons why he thought our approach was wrong, why did'nt he demonstrate it explicitly in his text? In this case, we would have probably published it. But since it was not the case, we treated his conclusion as a simple opinion not relevant and therefore not acceptable as a scientific statement.</p>
<p>Regarding the other translations, you seem to neglect the basic fact that <b>all</b> the translations of english material were made by the professional translator appointed by our publisher (who wrote an official statement on this point) who took full responsibility for these texts (for instance he explained why he translated "interesting" by "important" which seemed more appropriate in the context of the french reading). You have to admit that all these elements are details and that we certainly did not <i>ask</i> the translator appointed by Grasset to translate these texts in our favor (in fact we did not even read these translations which were done by a professionnal and published in "annexes" of our book, not in the book itself).</p>

<dd>Schreiber <i>technical</i> exposé is about illustrating how cranky was your "construction". It is especially dishonest to remove his comments, since you were sure that for non-technical readers, such exposé will appear as a support.</dd>
<dd>Moreover&#160;: <i>you didn't comment about the facts</i> which prove even more your bad faith&#160;:</dd>
<dd>* You didn't restablish the full text, and translated very very badly the conclusion you eventually added</dd>

<dd><i>[...]</i></dd>
<dd><i>Nonetheless, l’affaire Bogdanov might give post-modernists justifiable cause to snicker. And it leads you to</i></dd>
<dd><i>wonder what else is getting through the supposedly foolproof net of peer review.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the Book "Avant le Big Bang", Giorgis opinion is quoted as&#160;:</dd>
<dd><i>Tous les articles des Bogdanov ont été publiés dans des revues à “referees” extrêmement respectées. Cela veut donc dire que dans chaque cas, la publication a été rigoureusement soumise à l’approbation d’experts indépendants et anonymes. Des articles incompréhensibles ne peuvent pas passer au travers d’une telle procédure, et certainement pas à cinq reprises&#160;!</i></dd>
<dd>(complete paragraph, note that the Bogdanov began to translate in the middle of a sentence and the words they added up and changed, the result is a complete reversal of meaning)</dd>
<dd><i>All Bogdanov's papers has been published in well-respected peer-reviewed journals.

<dd>It is not a translation issue&#160;: you had to remove half a sentence, change context and add words in order to <i>reverse</i> the meaning of Giorgis statement.

<p>YBM has nothing else to do than being obsessed with details. He is aware of that. What is he gonna do later&#160;? Will he spend his whole life trying to destroy the work of other people or will he one day try to do something constructive&#160;? This question about translations is one aspect that he is obsessed about for most than a year. Igor is too patient. LLL</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, members of the "fan-club" and/or sockpuppets consider all of this as "details". The problem is that when you remove from their book every quote of scientist which is not forged or misquoted there is not one left, the same if you remove every scientific innacuracy or stupid blunder, there is no content left.</dd>
<dd>BTW, if you consider that quoting scientists while making them say the contrary of what they actually did is a <i>detail</i>, you should be much more interested by the critics against the scientific content of their book/TV shows/papers/thesis&#160;? Curiously noone never heard you on these subject (even if Igor said you're involved for a year or so, I only saw you popping up some weeks ago) --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 20:33, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a very simple criterion which can applies to any such situation. Someone who disagree with an argumentation based on facts and actual content without giving <i>any</i> comment on these facts and contents is a <i>fan</i> or a <i>sock puppet</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About the new campaign of quotes injection by Igor</span></h2>
<p>We have to be very carefull about the quotes Igor is now injecting again in the article. Forging, tweaking, reverting quotes is an habit of Igor and Grichka, they did it numerous times in their book, on Usenet and here.</p>
<p>The one supposed from Massimo Porrati is completly unauthenticated. As a matter of fact it has been quoted on Usenet only <a href="http://groups.google.fr/group/fr.sci.physique/msg/89601cd1b913a574?hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.fr/group/fr.sci.physique/msg/89601cd1b913a574?hl=en" rel="nofollow"><i>once</i></a>, on fr.sci.physique, and it was in a post from "Huang Lu" one of the numerous fake identities of so-called scientists Igor admitted to have used.</p>
<p>The second one, from Roman Jackiw is part of the thesis reports. It should be noted that&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have no other source of this reports than Igor and Grichka</li>
<li>They have not been authorized by their authors to be published</li>
<li>They are very conventional texts, and should be read <i>"between the lines"</i>, as Shahn Majid explained when he discovered to have been similarly abused in Bogdanov's book (his report has been published there without authorization and partly falsified).</li>
</ul>
<p>Same apply to Verbaarschot's report, with even more doubts&#160;: Verbaarschot has never been a reporter to Igor or Grichka thesis (but their former director) and there is no way to track down this "report" even at University of Burgundy. --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 20:57, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An answer to Lubos Motl</span></h2>
<p>Dear Lubos, welcome on this page of discussion. It is really good to see you here.</p>
<p>you wrote&#160;: <i>The gravitational instantons based on the topological action could indeed be an important part of a dual, "quantum foam" description of quantum gravity. Nevertheless, it is hard for me to agree with your statement that the Lagrangian "reduces" to the topological term. In the full Lagrangian, if written properly, there are also higher derivative terms that are expected to exceed the "R squared" topological term at ultrashort distances, near the big bang you study, much like the Einstein-Hilbert action, which you write among your terms of choice, wins at long distance scales. These terms appear even if you have 32 supercharges in supergravity, and they are the main reason why we normally believe that the usual geometric and topological intuition should not be trusted at subPlanckian distances. If you think that there are no E-H and higher-order non-topological terms in the action in your limit, you would have to give more evidence for this statement. In that case, it would indeed be an extraordinarily interesting observation.</i></p>
<p>Indeed, it is perfectly true that in the general string context D = ... , the theory generally induces non-perturbative corrections and a coupling with higher derivative terms expected to exceed the R squared term. But here, the context in slightly different, since we consider the low-dimensionnal sector of the theory. Indeed, D=4 (and N=2). In four dimensions, the expansion of derivative terms can be limited in a natural way to the R squared term (see for instance Kounnas and al). This is also true in our Kaluza-Klein context (viewed here as the D=5 superposition of the D=4 Lorentzian + Euclidean gravitationnal theories). So, on the ultra-violet limit of the theory (associated to the coupling constant g goes to zero) the Einstein term and the R squared term are exponentially supressed of the Lagrangian. Consequently, the only <i>effective</i> contribution on this 'topological limit' comes from the topological term RR dual. In this case of course, the time-like direction of the theory is compactified on the circle of radius zero (where we find the instanton sector, dual to the monopole sector of the 'superposed theory'). From this point of view, the ultra-violet limit (beta goes to zero) and the infra-red limit (Planck scale) represent two sectors of the same theory and can be seen as related by a duality relation of the T-duality type (which, in string theory, exchanges the scales of the theory). Then, in our approach, the so called 'zero-scale' (initial singularity given by the topological term) is dual to the 'physical scale', given by the Einstein term.</p>
<p>This is a brief hint and can be of course more detailed and referenced, if you wish.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your kind attention and your precious comments about our work.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Internet Discussions</span></h2>
<p>The Bogdanov affair has first been discussed extensively in the Usenet newsgroup sci.physics.research, then on fr.sci.physique, various english and french-speaking blogs and web forums, and Wikipedia. The Bogdanov brothers have frequently taken part in these discussions, presenting vigourous defenses of their work. However, it has been demonstrated that in many of these discussions, they used countless pseudonyms and fake identities (<a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet.html" title="Sock puppet">sock puppets</a>), invented to pose as respectable mathematicians and physicists, such as Roland Schwarz, Petitot or Liu Yang.</p>
<p>All of the postings on Usenet by these pseudonyms were done through Google, and their e-mails originated from dial-up accounts in Paris, France, or through anonymous relays. Invariably, these identities agressively defended the Bogdanovs' work, launched <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks against their critics, and urged people to buy their book, before disappearing as quickly as they had been created. The Bogdanov brothers have acknowledged using these pseudonyms in order to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>Those tactics, after they were exposed, did further erode the credibility of the Bogdanov brothers. See for instance <a href="../../../b/o/g/Talk%7EBogdanov_Affair_a499.html" title="Talk:Bogdanov Affair">Talk:Bogdanov Affair</a>.</p>

Obviously this "Ze Miguel" post does not contribute in any manner to the present article. In itself, the uses of a "Ze Miguel" pseudonym here illustrates what happens all the time on internet&#160;: people are constantly hiding behind pseudos to convey their messages or their position. I have explained extensively last year why I used pseudos myself in response to these kind of stupidities. It's time for "Ze Miguel" et al to realize how far they are from reality.</p>
<p>Igor</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mr Bogdanov: I updated the paragraph to mention that you acknowledge using pseudonyms. While I'm not a theoretical physicist and certainly would not be able to judge the correctness of your work (I even enjoyed your shows on French TV when I was a kid), I was astonished to see the behaviour you have been displaying towards your critics since the beginning of the controversy in 2002. I think this behaviour is quite relevant to the discussion about the Bogdanov Affair, and has been sufficiently documented to justify inclusion in the Wikipedia article. The tone of your reply to me merely proves my point. <a href="../../../z/e/_/User%7EZe_miguel_0384.html" title="User:Ze miguel">Ze miguel</a> 11:48, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>___________ Again, WHO ARE YOU? if you are so "certain of yoursefl" why don't you disclose your real identity? So who are you? You know my name, what I do, where I work, you know almost everything about me. Therefore, it is normal that I ask for your name. Specially if you aim to criticize my use of pseudos. You could be as well a "sock puppet of YBM" or anyone else. It is indeed because of behaviours like yours that I used pseudos some time ago.</p>

<dd>I'm quite certain you realize that what is the target of criticism here is not your use of pseudonyms on public forums, which could be understandable, but the <b>unethical behaviour</b> associated with that use: multiple pseudonyms, creation out of thin air of real-life scientists endorsing your work, personal attacks on your critics, and so on. As for my identity, there's only one thing to say: "If you can't attack the message, attack the messenger." <a href="../../../z/e/_/User%7EZe_miguel_0384.html" title="User:Ze miguel">Ze miguel</a> 15:17, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cite-Mania</span></h2>
<p>Obiously it isn't the encyclopedic style to add a whole pile of cites to the article. I see, why this is happening: We cannot agree on how to paraphrase and weight all these cites. But we should definitively give it a try. One condemning an done laudating cites could be left on the page, for illustration. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 10:42, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, I have always said that such an accumulation of cites would be of a very bad effect on the article. Here is what I wrote to Bishonen on her "talk page" this morning&#160;:</p>
<p>"Good morning,</p>
<p>I just added some more "positive" comments in reaction to all the "negative" material collected by rbj. As I said, I do not think that it is a good idea to put together all these comments. I have 2 remarks and one proposal.</p>
<p><b>Remark</b>&#160;: Rbj is now obliged to collect private emails (ie the one between the journalist Fabien Besnard and Urs Schreiber) in order to feed his "negative" tank. How far can we go like this? I observe that, at this point, we have far more "positive" (and argumented) material (it all comes from scientific discussions or reports made by mathematicians or physicists about our work) than rbj. If we continue like this, his material will come from YBM and other "internet anti Bogdas" that are haunting various forums. I really do not think that this will improve the article, far from it. As it is today, this article is really less good and clear than yesterday. Does rbj really care about it? Does Ybm care about it? I do not think so. Their only aim is to hit their target, by all means. As soon as we try to have a scientific discussion (ie our last answer to Lubos Motl on the discussion page) they promptly invent another pseudo to pollute this discussion with the same old "rengaines".</p>
<p><b>Proposal</b> : I propose to come back to the version we achieved yesterday (with only the 3 "positive" additions to the 3 "negative" rbj's). At this point, every Wiki reader would have understood the controversial content of the "affair. This way the article would still be clear and readable. What is your opinion?</p>

<p>The same applies to you, no? The material I put together was published on many websites since 2002 (most of it comes from the thesis reports, as you should have noticed). Igor</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, but I didn't insert such material in the article, only in the talk page (always with full references). Most of the material you've inserted has been published on a few website or Usenet articles... but most of the time by <b>you</b>. It is a quite a weak reference. Most editors won't accept such auto-reference.

</dl>
<p>Before to satisfy your request (and mainly to save some time) I propose to cancel all these cites&#160;: I never agreed with this kind of avalanche and never will. If rbj understand that he is destroying the article and accepts to go back to the initial state (1 or 2 "anti" and 1 or 2 "pro") then it will be OK. And we will fully document the cites left in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I quite disagree. There's not so much different documents quoted in the article right now. Keeping part of all of them could have some interest for the article. --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 11:38, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Giving references and status of every quoted or linked document is a prerequisite to anything. Then we could discuss how pertinent it is to include some in the article.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Request for a third party inquiry</span></h3>
<p>Given that almost every of these documents were only published by the Bogdanovs and therefore we do not have any trustworthy source, so we could only have quite a relative trust on their complete veracity. I ask for someone not involved in the debate to check with all of their attributed authors (whose e-mails are easy to obtain)&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their veracity, exactitude and completude</li>
<li>Their meaning, given the context where they were produced, relatively to the merit of Bogdanovs' work</li>
<li>Their status relatively to public divulgation</li>

<hr />
<p>YBM&#160;: I really find your above proposal totally insane. It shows how far you are prepared to go&#160;: the one who suspects manipulations and dishonesty everywhere is himself...a manipulator and a dishonest person. What else can I say? Did I propose to double or triple check your own posts?</p>
<p>And beyond all this dispute&#160;: are you unsain enough to think that I would take the risk to publish this material on a public page like Wikipedia without having all the proofs that these documents are for real? Do you seriously think that if these documents were "forged" (an expression you apply to us ALL THE TIME) their presumed authors would not react and confirm the fraud?</p>
<p>I do not know in what world you live. But let me tell you that beyond what we think of it, your proposal is also embarrassing for all the people that you will contact for confirmation&#160;: how do you think a serious professor like Roman Jackiw (or anyone else who certainely does not pass his time on internet) would react if someone abrutly asked him "to confirm the authorship, dates, veracity meaning, status, etc" of their reports? Can you imagine the effect of it?</p>
<p>Perhaps. And this is why you request such a proceedure.</p>
<p>On our side, I propose to send the copies of the originals to whoever accepts to be the "proof referee" of these documents. Once more, if there was any doubt regarding their authenticity, be sure that the reaction would fire immediatly. This is a "self evident proof".</p>

<p>I was ironic, of course, but you had understood, had'nt you&#160;? Why would Igor propose the referencies of what he and his brother published if that would dangerous for them&#160;? Think about. LLL</p>

<dd>LLL, if half of the quarter of what <a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> cites is true (and I have no reason to believe it is not), then the Bodganov have already taken several actions which are "dangerous for them", be it for their scientific reputation or even for their legal security.</dd>
<dd>We here at Wikipedia are forced to take into account the possibility that some other errors or mistakes could be made here as well. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 16:58, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rama, did you REALLY read the last post of Igor. I really doubt about it. LLL</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did, and I stick to what it said. There have been in the past, apparently, instances of erroneous quotations for one reasons or another.</dd>
<dd>That these quotations are authentic (in the sense that the said person did say exactly that) proves nothing if they are taken out of context. Besides, the argument that a misuse of quotation would be too dangerous would also apply to these previous instance of actual misquoting. So I am left with the impression that we do want to carefully check every quotation, absolutely.</dd>
<dd>This being said, LLL's reaction, and Igor's intimidating "how do you think a serious professor like Roman Jackiw (...)" or categoric "This is a "self evident proof" could leave readers with the impression that there is a strong will for these checks <i>not</i> to be made. I do not understand why; the worse which can happen is some time begin taken about it, and Wikipedia is not on a hurry. Since Igor is so categoric about the validity of his quotations, I have not doubt that he has nothing to fear of a close scrutiny, and the article will have much to gain. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 17:18, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such precautions are really having "double standard"... On the other hand, the fact that YBM has wasted such a time to create a blog and 2 forums against the Bogdanov, and have taken part to such a lot of discussions doesn't seem to worry you a lot... The fact that Riazuelo is quoted 3 times in the article, including a whole article of his own that he wrote <i>especially for Wikipedia</i>, apparently doesn't disturb you either, as you reverted my last edit (I was 84.226.133.252, I had not noticed I wasn't logged). If you want to take into account of the "past" and the context of the Bogdanov affair, you have to do it for <i>all</i> aspects, including the harassment and the insincerity of the Bogdanovs' enemis. It's too easy to be very suspicious for the Bogdanov and to pretend to not notice that some other people who take part to the writing of the article are "not completely impartial" about them, and try to make an article as negative as possible, by using all tricks for it.</dd>

<hr />
<p>Well, I stick to my position too. I do not think that YBM's proposal to double check the content (or even the mere existence) of the reports and comments I published in the artcle is innocent and "clean of bad intentions". YBM knows that the simple fact to disturb <i>again</i> the authors of all the reports issued on our work will (no doubt) have an "irritating effect". Once again these academics will be extremely disturbed by the "nth" question about what they wrote, why they wrote it, etc. To complete the picture, these questions will be inevitably associated to the vague suspiscion that what they wrote could have been...manipulated? or false? or faked? or forged? etc.</p>
<p>All the reports went public in 2002. All of them. Don't you think, seriously, that if these reports had been forged (even for one word&#160;: we are not speacking of any problem of translation here), we would have gotten <i>some</i> reactions?</p>
<p>Let's face it. We do not fear any "close scrutiny". All we fear is to disturb once again people who gave lots of their time to analyze our work.</p>
<p>But if you <i>really</i> do not see any other way, fine. Let's ask these scientists "if what they wrote about the Bogdanoff is true or not".</p>
<p>Igor</p>
<p>You see&#160;? Is that clear enough for you, YBM&#160;? Do you need more light&#160;? LLL</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've read that before (for almost every sample I've provided sooner), and checking was indeed a good idea. --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 19:12, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

---</p>
<p>A good idea? It was before anything else an enormous manipulation of your kind. Let's take your "examples" one per one.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>YBL wrote&#160;: Unauthorized documents</b>(<a href="http://ybmessager.free.fr/docs/ciel-et-espace-bogda1.pdf" class="external text" title="http://ybmessager.free.fr/docs/ciel-et-espace-bogda1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Majid's report</a>)</p>
<p>It is true that Majid did not appreciate that we published his report in our book as endorsing the whole content of Grichka's thesis. Majid is a mathematician. His evaluation only applied on the quantum groups part of the thesis. He said to Grichka in the phone that his reaction (about the publication of his report in our book ) would have been different if Costas Kounnas had also been published for the physical part. But we did not publish Kounnas (or any of the 15 reports issued on the 2 thesis). You know why? only because we thought it was not appropriate to publish too much material of this kind. That's why we picked only 2 reports&#160;: 1 for Grichka's thesis (Majid) and 1 for Igor's thesis (Jackiw).</p>
<p>Now, if Majid was very irritated by the publication of his report, he never asked to withdraw it from the book (which we offered). So please stop speaking all the time about "unauthorized documents". It was a mistake to have published Majids report (especially without Kounnas report) but it is not an "affaire d'état". Unless people like YBM wants to promote it as an "affaire d'état".</p>
<p><b>YBM wrote&#160;: Incorrect report on private conversation</b> (<a href="http://groups.google.fr/group/fr.sci.physique/msg/3672cc092056a507?hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.fr/group/fr.sci.physique/msg/3672cc092056a507?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Majid</a>)</p>
<p>What are you taking about? are you referring to the heated conversations that developped around the "Ciel&amp;Espace" bad journalism?</p>
<p><b>YBM wrote&#160;: Heavy cut documents, changing their meaning</b> (<a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000377.html" class="external text" title="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000377.html" rel="nofollow">Schreiber</a>)</p>
<p>How many times shall we repeat that no author is <i>obliged</i> to quote someone else's comments "in extenso". We quote the documented and argumented part of Schreiber's technical analysis of our work. But as far as his "personal views" were concerned, since he could not provide any arguments in favor of his "opinion", we considered his opinion as non scientific and not acceptable for a scientific text. That is the reason why we did not publish it.</p>
<p><b>YBM wrote&#160;: Out of context documents (thesis reports)</b></p>
<p>What do you mean by "out of context documents"? Where did we publish "out of context documents"?</p>
<p><b>YBM worte&#160;: Forged proof of academic institutional support</b> (<a href="http://ybmessager.free.fr/wp/index.php?p=11#institut" class="external text" title="http://ybmessager.free.fr/wp/index.php?p=11#institut" rel="nofollow">th-phys.edu.hk and HKUST street address</a>)</p>
<p>This is a good illustration of your way to proceed. You are distording and twisting reality untill it looks as crooked as you are. Once more I will tell you that this "so important address" that you quote at each corner of a phrase WAS GIVEN TO US BY THE HONK KONG REGISTRAR!!!!!! I remind you that we legally bought a domain name that we created ourselves (th-phys). It never existed before us. Can you at least understand this? We did NOT EVEN KNOW on what address our site was referenced on the registrar's page. This was not even our problem.</p>
<p>Now the fact that you dare to call this a "forged proof of academic institutional support" is a shame. No other word to qualifiy your attitude.</p>

<p>Here also you abuse reality. Why? simply because I wrote some days ago that ALL translations from french to english were made by the professional translator appointed by Grasset. This is a fact. The translator wrote a specific statement about this point and explained, line per line, all the translations he did from the Majid's or Woit's text. And contrarely to what you pretend, his translation is, in its essence, exactly conformal to the original text.</p>
<p><b>YBM wrote&#160;: Forgeries (your so-called book</b> <a href="http://www.epiphysique.org/presse/fauxbogdanov-en.html" class="external text" title="http://www.epiphysique.org/presse/fauxbogdanov-en.html" rel="nofollow">preprint</a>, <a href="http://ybmessager.free.fr/docs/lettre2.jpg" class="external text" title="http://ybmessager.free.fr/docs/lettre2.jpg" rel="nofollow">Heudier's letter</a>)</p>
<p>About the preprint of our book you have created all by yourself all the "proofs" that it was a forgery. You and only you has created all that and you know it. We have a written statement established by our publishers that evidence the authenticity of the page you pretend to be false. The shame is that you still continue to pretend that you "uncovered the truth" (when you only manipulate the truth). Next week you will hear some news about this particular problem you have created.</p>
<p>About Heudier's letter, it is a shame (once again) that you still dare to pretend that it was forged. You and only you is writing such an outrageous lie. Can you even produce a beginning of a proof supporting your claim? No! And let me tell you one good thing&#160;: if you continue to throw such lies on this discussion page you will have to justifiy them. One way or another. And not by links sending the reader to your Epiphysique website. You know that you are falsifying the truth. Heudier wrote his statement as it was sent to France 2 and you also know that we hold the ORIGINAL OF IT!!! What else do you need?</p>
<p><b>YBM wrote&#160;: It several cases <i>"copies"</i> were not copies at all but forgeries.</b></p>
<p>In several cases? which cases? can you even document your lies?</p>
<p><br />
In a more general way and as a conclusion I would observe 1 thing&#160;:</p>
<p>In the case we ask such or such scientist if he indeed wrote such report, he should of course confirm it. But at the same time I fear that this scientist will add that he does not wish his opinion to be published in any polemical article on internet. Regarding this point, you should ask rbj if he ever got ANY REACTIONS FROM CQG. I am 100% certain that <b>CQG DID NOT CONFIRM ANYTHING REGARDING THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE EMAIL MADE PUBLIC BY KUPPERBERG ON NOV.1ST 2002</b>. Do you know why? because (as all other scientists authors or reports) CQG does not want to be caught once again in a public debate regarding the so called "Bogdanoff affair". This is a simple fact. Ask RBJ&#160;: he will tell you that he NEVER got any answer from CQG.</p>

<dd>two points. 1. i am not a "Dr" but i assume Ms. Adams didn't want to risk insulting a "real" Dr (like our friends Igor and Grichka) by saying "Mr". 2. i figure that this is a wash. CQG is embarrassed and they want to have it both ways. they want to distance themselves from this paper that they published, but they don't want to draw attention to it with an explicit repudiation. the problem is then, their reputation actually gets lower by trying to cover it up and hoping it goes away.

<dd>Catherine, your weakening the inference of the statement is unjustified. if you insist on weakening the shortened synopsis, then i insist on including the whole statement again so you cannot distort its meaning. the Adams reply to me did not get your dishonest friends off the hook. not in any manner. we are doing precisely what the CQG intends. they issued the statement for "journalists" (like us, here at WP) to refer to. and it was supplied to us by an editorial board member for this purpose. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 20:09, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No. I did not ask you to insult us. But you did it. As I did not ask you to qualify us (Grichka and I) as "salauds", which you did on "La Toile" about 6 months ago. As I did not ask you to be treated as "crooks", "charlatans", or who knows how many other insulting names.</p>
<p>Is it a normal way to behave? Is it a normal way to "build an article"? Is harassement your only "code de conduite"?</p>
<p>Igor</p>
<p>PS. For your own knowledge I remind you that our thesis were never put on the CERN server. Never. Go to the archives : you will never find any traces of them. Because we never placed any thesis there. But that's not the problem. The problem is your chronical insulting attitude. The problem is your way to attack the two of us by all means.</p>

<dd>Well, <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_A._c515.html" title="User:Luis A.">Luis A.</a> did write <i>thesis</i> where he should have written <i>papers</i>, let's quote the current version of the article : <i>"Nevertheless, the bogdanoffs observe that their articles were available on the server of the CERN since January 2000."</i>.</dd>
<dd>Apparently you don't know very well yourself what you put on this server since you didn't point him out that it was not the thesis but some papers which were there.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, something <i>else</i> you put there did indeed disappear, the "thesis reports" we were talking about today. So let's me rewrite my question (you're taking as an attack for some obscure reason) : Why have these "reports" been deleted from CERN server ?</dd>

<p>I do perfectly agree with what Igor said last night about YBM's behaviour : his only way of reacting is the harassment. And when he feels he hasn't got any to say, that occurs very frequently, he insults. He said things to Igor and Grichka that should have been apologized for, which has never been. And when persons say things which are in the same direction that the B's arguments, they are, as I was, treated as sock puppets. Poor YBM. LLL</p>

<p><a name="About_CQG_Email" id="About_CQG_Email"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">About CQG Email</span></h2>
<p>So now, grace to the message of Julie Adams, we finally got the confirmation of what we constantly repeated since the beginning of this discussion.</p>
<p>I wrote many times the following:</p>
<p>1. The so called "statement" (as rbj liked to qualify it) has never been issued as an "official" document. It was only a private email sent as a <i>working document</i> to a few (not all of them, and we know it) members of the editorial board of CQG.</p>
<p>2. We also know (because we discussed with <i>many people</i> from CQG at this time) that CQG did <b>not</b> wish this email to become public. It was only because Kupperberg, acting on his own, put it on Usenet that people became aware of it. Upon various discussions, we knew that CQG was against it.</p>
<p>During the frenetic discussions surrounding a possible "hoax" published in the journal they <b>had</b> to find a way to control the fire. This private email was nothing else but a possible solution of compromise.</p>
<p>3. CQG issued this private mail to certain members of the Editorial Board but did not <i>withdraw</i> the article (i) neither from their internet site, nor from the journal itself. A withdrawal of a paper happens when there are real reasons to do it. It happened several times in many scientific journals. In our case, CQG did not even consider to do it because they <i>knew</i> that their referees had seriously done their work and that our paper could be <i>"sound and original"</i> (as written by their referees).</p>
<p>Some time later we discovered the real identity of the second referee (the one who suggested to modify our paper 2 times)  : this referee (whose name will never be disclosed) is a highly reputed theoretical physicist (in fact one of the best and most cited ones) and (contrarely to what was written in many forums) he continues to normally work as one of the most reliable referees for CQG.</p>
<p>In conclusion : today CQG obviously intents to "turn the page" on this incident provoked by Niedermaier for <i>non scientific</i> reasons and protect our article for what it is : a paper seriously written, cautiously refereed, and that could contain interesting new ideas about Plansk scale physics and topological states at initial singularity.</p>
<p>In that view, I think that the best solution would simply be to suppress the CQG private email from the body of the article (the same with CQG's referees report).</p>
<p>Igor</p>
<p>I still think the article would benefit from a serious shrinking procedure, but seeing that it will provoke another revert war, I have modified the article in keeping with Ms Adams' email (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bogdanov_Affair#Request_for_a_third_party_inquiry" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bogdanov_Affair#Request_for_a_third_party_inquiry" rel="nofollow">see here</a>).

It's strange also that you feel a need to precise that your blocking must not be interpreted as you taking side, as if your behavior could let suspect that you are partial... In fact you are incredibly partial, and it's a shame, for an administrator. It's not the first time that I think it, but I would never have thought that you would do such a thing : blocking an editor because he has reverted more than 3 times, or because he has comitted strong personal attacks, OK, everyone knows that it can happen.

<p>Laurence67 just asked the GOOD QUESTION : why is YBM NEVER BLOCKED ? He keeps insulting Igor (and with very serious words, totally unacceptable) and over people without any kind of trace of beginning of problem. And you say you are not taking side ! What would it be if it was the case ? This is a complete parody. LLL</p>

<p>YBM, what you wrote is so stupid that I prefer thinking that you are kidding ! You say all the time the same things. You must be so tired ! LLL</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course I was, somewhat, kidding, but what I ironicaly proposed is not so stupid, regarding your contribution to this page. What have you to say on the present affair but "I don't believe it. period." ? When you were chating with Alain Riazuelo you said once that "no Ph.D. could be given to cranks", then when faced with the astrologist case E. Teissier, you said it has nothing to do whith the B.'s case. It is a point of simple logic : Teissier's case is a counterexample of your first general assertion, so it has been refuted. period. Now if you want to argue rationnaly about the Bogdanov you should consider facts : what they wrote in their thesis, papers, book, what they said in their TV show, what they did in order to promote themselve. People who consider them as charlantans, don't do so because of their own belief, but because they read the papers, they read the thesis, they read the boot, they saw the TV shows, they even try to find sense out of the crap by talking with them.</dd>
<dd>If you had any interpretation which could give to their blunders (let's take the golden number, or the algebraïc curve definition, or the solar system issue, whichever you want) any meaning outside absurdity, you could at least explain it. Did you ever say anything else than "I disagree" even in front of <i>facts</i> ? --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 21:11, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You should read once again, in an attentive way this time, what I responded to A.R because you did not understand what I told him. Nothing. What I told him was very logical and very clear and you did not understand one word of what I said. Such a pity. LLL</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did with the higher attention, here are you last words <a href="http://ybmessager.free.fr/epiphysique/forums/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=17" class="external text" title="http://ybmessager.free.fr/epiphysique/forums/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=17" rel="nofollow">there</a> <i>"Je ne crois pas aux thèses de complaisance."</i> (Alain responded, you not).</dd>
<dd>What you told him says that whatever facts could be true, you won't even have a look at them. It is very clear indeed, it is by no way logical. --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 21:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I said and I repeat "Je ne crois pas aux thèses de complaisance" because a these can be refused. There are some examples every year. And there are students who give up before finishing there these every year. That's more than logical, that's the way it is in the university. If you had tried studying that long, you would know that for a long time. LLL</p>
<dl>
<dd>That a these can be refused does not mean that every bad work lead to a refusal. If you had <i>really</i> read thesis in your work you'd know that. Note that there is no scandal behind every bad thesis, the real refusal in to bloc academic career (what has been done in the case of B&amp;B). In the Bogdanov's case the first error was to allow them to subscribe at university for so long with so poor competences, at the end it was a kind of justice to allow them to get two toys Ph.D., the scandal is what they did then with these toys, what was probably their goal from the very begginning : the prentended to have Ph.D. years before they began their thesis. --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 22:01, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who are you actually to pretend that the teachers in university who decided to allow Igor and Grichka to work on their these made a mistake ? Who do you really think you are ? Do you lead a department of research somewhere in France ? Or are you only frustrated ? And as I told you many times I am not a fan of them. I don't live in a futile world at all, but the fact is the only and so easy thing you do all the time is insulting persons who disagree with you.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SECOND STOP</span></h2>
<p>Looks like nobody is paying attention about some "rationnal" proposals... So, again :</p>
<p>1/ WIKIPEDIA ISN'T A KINDER GARDEN (and this is adressed to all editors, except for administrators, to whom I adress my condolences for being responsible for this page)</p>
<p>2/ CLOSE THE ARTICLE and don't let anybody start a new one about this so called affair. There's nothing of any interest neither on this page nor on the article. I bet that nobody is interested in reading two contradictory POV. Has anybody read an article in an encyclopledia saying one thing and the contrary, both presented as the true?!? None of the people involved here are objective, therefore the article will never meet the criterias of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>RAMA ==&gt; This being said, I bet you to take this proposal into account. You'll never find any conscensus that makes sense and offers some interesting material. Julien Alexandre (I'm still not a registered user, I posted at 11:22pm, 5 october 2005)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Noone is paying attention because your proposal makes no sense : the Bogdanov Affair exist and deserve an article here. As a matter of fact, this article existed far before Igor tried anonymously to turn it into vanity.</dd>
<dd>Consensus can be found between people who consider seriously facts and scientific evaluations of their work. Not only from people who consider the brothers as cranks, but from the badly called "other side" as well (well, I can only think of one : CatherineV). Consensus with people who consider their irrational feeling to be more important than reality, and are only trying to rant against who inserts facts on the page has no meaning. If it had some, <b>no</b> article could survive on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 21:31, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks again to all the editors for illustrating themselves, giving precisely the example of what I just said. This isn't an article, this will never be, there's no Bogdanov affair, there's nothing to win. CLOSE THE ARTICLE. Julien Alexandre</p>

<p>You have my name and you know who I'm since I posted on your website, asking some technical questions to the Bogdanoff (btw. I'm still waiting for my answers to come...). About this "affair", you brought some elements, that's true. But how do you think it will end up... Igor and Grishka will finally abandon and accept that their papers are worth nothing? Certainly not. You'll just go on and they will defend themselves, and vice versa. Thinking that this issue is leading somewhere is, in fact, non sense. From the very first beginning of your "affair", what changed? Nothing, they still have their thesis, are still working on television and selling their book full of mistakes. And you won't change this. But they'll never publish anything anymore about science, they'll just go on doing their tv show, and that's it. . The scientific community doesn't care about it anymore, since things have been stated already - and not in a positive way. And honestly, who will read an article on the EN wikipedia about an "affair" concerning two totally anonymous french guys? So, as you kindly asked me : there's an affair, but it's in fact a personal affair between you and the Bogdanov (including the satellites on both sides). Is this worth an article on Wikipedia? Julien Alexandre</p>
<p>It's worth writing an article about the "Bogdanoff affairs" as soon as this story has involved (at least) scientists from France to U.s.a and has centred on important issues about sciences(pseudo science,peer reviewing,popular science, etc). --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_A._c515.html" title="User:Luis A.">Luis A.</a> 04:33, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Julien Alexandre, I have read your previous suggestions (it's not that I ignore or despise people if I don't answer to everything, but I just don't have the time to answer every tiny bit.</dd>
<dd>The Bogdanov Affair is, in my opinion and I daresay in the opinion of many, notable enough to warrant an article. In this light, your suggestion is not a reasonable solution to the matter at hand.</dd>
<dd>However, I would like to call the attention of everybody on this: this article is becoming such a quagmire that even uniterested third parties get inconvenienced. This is one more opportunity for me to call everybody to
<ol>
<li><b>tone down</b>. I am particulary thinking of <a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a>, but also of Laurence67, for instance. Wikipedia is a place where all work <i>together</i> toward a better article, <i>not</i> one against the other. The way that the discourse is polarised here turns the argumentation in nothing more than a shouting match, and this is a waste of time, ressources and peace of mind, and I don't think that I need to say in what sort of esteem I hold petty attempts at forcibly putting uninterested third parties in one "side" or another, as Laurence67 tends to do.</li>

Anyways it was a good initiative of your own for "the other side" (even if it doesn't exist, of course, as we are all brothers-and-sisters...) : each time that I try to put my version of what happened on the forums, someone from the other side reverts it, and as they are more numerous I can't revert it back too often cause of the 3RR. So I understand better the interest of blocking one of us, and especially Igor, of course, who is more symbolic than us.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think so, but it's exactly the sort of state of mind there is here between all the participants ! Didn't you notice that there were really 2 <i>sides</i>, that the Bogdanov had not only defenders, but also enemies, who are able of anything against them ?</dd>

</dd>
<dd>our appreciation of the 3RR, for instance, is very wrong. The 3RR states a limit about the reverts, it does not say that reverts are fine in the general case, and it does not grant a right to revert 3 times. That people start using their "3RR" like ammunition ship-of-the-line style is a symptom that things are going astray.
<dl>
<dd>I didn't revert only, I wrote a text with a lot of precise references and links, I edited it and it was imediately reverted ! And nobody seems to worry about it !</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I suggest that you <i>discuss</i> a commons version with the other contributors rather than reverting and making inflammatory statements on the talk page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another proposal</span></h2>
<p>Dear Rama, thanks for your answer. I understand your point of view, but let's be realistic. I've been following this "affair" for almost 3 years, and despite the efforts of many people involved, like me (means without being on one side, which is my case and maybe yours on this page, nobody else), they never managed to state on anything definitely. Therefore, even if I do respect the willing of Wikipedia, I firmly doubt that any administrator will be able to make the pros and antis come to a normal discussion. The antagonism is far too deep to imagine any conscensus between them.</p>
<p>So, here's another proposal : ban YBM, Igor, Rbj, Laurence, LLL, Sophie, Alain Riazuelo, and all the people participating in the revert war. Don't let any user edit the article. Leave it blocked for a while, and then if it of such interest as you think it is, somebody else will edit it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I wish you a very good luck and a lot of courage and tenacity. Julien Alexandre (still not registered, and will never be since I'm not editing any article, 9:25, 6 october 2005)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's great : you are not registered, you have never edited anything, but you suggest to ban 7 people ! I dont't dare to imagine what you will do if one day you become an administrator !</dd>

<p>Dear Laurence, I'm sorry if you feel agressed by my proposal, it's not my goal. I've a lot of consideration for all users,and I'm not attacking anybody. Therefore, I consider there's no reason to be agressive in return. But as far as I can read, you just added some comments in response to Rama saying that there's no way to get a conscensus. Just to remind you what you wrote about my first proposal :</p>
<p>"It's surely the most sensible thing which has been written since the beginning... Of course I agree completely : the "affair" itself is already not fascinating, and the article is even less... Nobody cares about it, and nobody would remember any more that a "Bogdanov affair" occured if it was not fueled artificialy for years by some people who apparently couldn't live without that. Laurence67 10:28, 5 October 2005 (UTC)"</p>
<p>You changed your mind? If nobody cares about it, why should this nobody be allowed to edit?</p>
<p>So, in order not to be taken as a target because I'm proposing something, I want to make clear that I do not search any agreement with editors of this talk page, just a reasonable action from the administrators, which are considering that this affair is worth an article (a respectable position), but slowly start to realize that the conditions required to make such an article are not present right now. Cordialement, Julien Alexandre 10:22, 6 october 2005)</p>
<hr />
<p>Julien, a number of people have displayed questionable and irritating behaviour, but I dont know what you could say against Alain Riazuelo; I would rather cite his edits as an example of the sort of contributions I expect people to make. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 12:52, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Rama, I do consider Alain Riazuelo and deeply respect his work in the cosmology field. But it's impossible in this case to separate any of the speakers, without being presented as a pro or anti. This article, if you want it to be one, needs to start from scratch, with people not involved in any maneer. It's just my opinion. Julien</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A word or 2 concerning the Julien proposal</span></h2>
<p>Salut Julien!</p>
<p>I know that I was the one who initiated you to the story of the Bogdanovs Affair, of which you knew absolutely nothing, in early august, and that you already had some very clear preferencies thought you din't knew a thing and was about to write an article on wiki about the subject with a bagground Zero to do so.</p>
<p>For you knowledge I have NEVER EVER REVERTED ONE SINGLE ARTICLE ON THIS TALK PAGE NOR ANY OTHER ONE ON ALL WIKIPEDIA FRENCH AND ENGLISH AND GLOBAL.</p>
<p>So that I am sure that the point is really clear for you anf for all. I was thought blocked several times and for long period of time for reverting too much, thougjt i had no idea at the time what reverting was all about nor how to do such a thing, and personal attacks, thought they were perpetrated by YBM agaisnt me.</p>
<p>He has been reverting since the word exist and has done it on a daily basis more than 3 times a day, more like 12 to 20 times a day at the time, and not only on the article but also on the talk page where he hindered me to place a single article during 7 days at the end of august, and managed to get away with it by complaining at the same time to Bishonen, who didn't knew a thing about this talk page at the time, about MY vandalism, and pretending like if all those overreverting on the talk page were my doing and not his.</p>
<p><b>He was NEVER investigated</b>, and from the beginning got 3 admi to support him in all his doing, as we got 3 admi to deny us all essentials rights, like the right to express oneselve.</p>
<p>I had a mediation done,giving nothing, and now an arbitration running about this subject. I prepared for it since the 7th of september, I had to wait a month, but now it is rolling, finally.</p>
<p>All the others never asked for mediation nor arbitration, I have been working in the background on my own making contacts and stating the problems to hundreds of people, administrator and leader board, before something happened.</p>
<p>RJB was not there at the time it all begin, he and YBM met each others at the Bishonen - YBM - Geogres' meeting on the wiki chat room, the night YBM got me blocked for his crimes. They are since unseparable.</p>
<p>So don't be so complaisant with yourself to dare accuse me for revert war. There must be at least 2 individual to make a war. To insert a text and get it reverted is not being part of a revert war, but <b>being the victim of a revert maniac</b>.</p>
<p>When this goes on during a week, and the maniac also revert and move some of the other users articles, beside your own, and then on bright day light accuse you, to them, for having done so, and convince them to also report you for vandalism on wiki, as you watch and cannot interveen because he is reverting your articles immediatly, then you have reach the bottom of frustration and the top of angryness.</p>
<p>He has in fact successfully ban me access to the talk page for more than a week, using the revert function, and since blocked and baned me using the "Admi function", who is also a button who function very good for him, and who respect him in return very dearly for ab-using of it so often, so don't you dare comparing me to him nor setting me in the same mafia gang and reverting and control freak as YBM!</p>
<p>Another point, I have made proposal of concensius in the past, the first concensius here was my work, and recently invited all parts to work together to get the real opinion of real specialist on the matter, as you can read it on the article " Settlement Proposal" Archive 3 or 2. I was blocked 3 days 20 minutes later. Thats how pro Bogdanovian get payed if they dare to make more sens that YBM or to contradic him or to proove him wrong: blocked! And in fact i just got a ban for having prooved him wrong, so that all the articles prooving it so, could also be removed from here for nobody to see. As it is ususal for admi to do, on this wiki side of a talk page, since the beginning of september. 20% of the problems originate from rjb, 50 % from YBM and 40% from corrupt or partial admi/admi doing favoritism. And when only rjb is there, 80% of the problems emanate from admi favoritism, actions, insults, and remarks and side taking on the talk page, and 20% on rjb, if YBM is there alone thats a 50/50 collaboration between him and admi. I never saw an impartial admi here, thought I know plenty outside this talkpage. The wiki equivalent of this affair in french never ever got this kind of bottle neck problems, nor any edit nor reverting war ever. There was one changement who occured and that was it. The admi was never unjust and never took side. He was a model of impartiality and a person one could count on and reliate on. Not like here, where they block you just as your arbitration begin, by aphhazard most certainly.. and ban as the other one begin, and can't get you unban for "technical uinknown reasons" and asked you to register as a socket puppet, just for the time being,(!) or get you mediation deleeted by contacts, or deleete your entire talk page because YBM suddendly made strange and interesting confidences about the real background for this Affair. Vupti! All gone! Not his text only, it will have been to visible, but the whole talk page, for ever. No revertion to original possible not even for an external admi, it was not to be found, evidencies desintegrated into thin air.</p>
<p><b>Now to your suggestions above</b>:</p>
<p>YBM should know that there is no these "de complaisance" since his own thesis was refused after the first year, so bad it was.</p>
<p>It says also much about <b>his real motives</b> in this affair and his level to can evaluate the thesis of other people, who them, got it!</p>
<p>It is also good to remember that his attempt regarded a thesis was in <b>language</b> and that he has no academical degree what so ever in physic nor math.</p>
<p>All he got is a very ancient diploma in informatic, (from a local informatic ingeneering school who isn't officially recognised) who is now regarded as an antic as IT exams don't pay in the long run.</p>
<p>Regarding yours, Julien, and Luis remarks, correct, this pretended article and the discussions about it are indeed a stride between ybm and the Bogdanov, who has nothing to do with the pretended motiv of wether those thesis are good scientifical stuff or just crank.</p>
<p>Proove of it: YBM is not interested in the opinion of the worlds greatest specialists in cosmology, just in his selvmade websites "prooves", and his archeological founds from 2003 and 2004 in his own blog site and divers forum site from 2004.</p>
<p>With selectiv choices and a very selectiv memory of the events.</p>
<p>This combine with hatress and the compleete unknowledge of basic Theoretic Physic can only give what we see here: fight and twisted argumentations.</p>
<p>What I call: "Argumentation with missing central links", in the field of "Argumentation Theory", where I have my roots.</p>
<p>I am doing the right thing, I am communicating with those real cosmologists, not the fony ones like Rialuezo, and get the pertinent answers I am after, and that this antibogdanov side pretend to be after: <b>salients prooves, and the truth and light about this whole affair</b>.</p>

<p>Dear XAL,</p>
<p>"I know that I was the one who initiated you to the story of the Bogdanovs Affair, of which you knew absolutely nothing, in early august, and that you already had some very clear preferencies thought you din't knew a thing and was about to write an article on wiki about the subject with a bagground Zero to do so."</p>
<p>I'm glad to learn that you initiated me to the story!!! I'm glad to know that you're reading my mind about some "preferencies". I'm glad to learn also that I don't know "a thing" about the scientific matter exposed in the Bogdanov academic work. And I'm also glad to learn that I was about to write an article in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I bet you're mistaking me with someone else. If not, and even if I don't get the reason why you're inventing this, don't worry, I don't mind your mistakes, and allow you to invent whatever you want about me.</p>
<p>As I just said before, my remarks aren't to be taken as personal attacks, but simply as the only way (according to me) to find a way out. Julien Alexandre</p>

<p>You are not julien Alexandre but julien Aleg------, to begin with, and as your proposal you will achieve nothing believe me. ((-:&gt;</p>
<p>Notheless if you are interested to understand the stuff, so reaf the proposal I made in archive 2 or 3 and see the welcome it receive. You can also look at, not interveen!, the arbitration there:</p>

<p>All right then, proove me wrong!</p>
<p>You can't deny that an old exam in informatic has no worth today as the area is mooving constantly and new and better systems are founded every single day, in programation and in control unit systems.</p>
<p>As for your thesis and lack of academical references, it is the simple truth and as relevant as the discussion about the doctor degree of the Bopgdanov was obtain through mean of complaisancy or was the result of 10 years of hard work. And as relevant as wether or not their thesis is a crank or not, and as relevant as wether or not Rialuezo is a cosmologist or not, which he is definitely not.</p>
<p>So come with your proove regarding your academical degree, I am waiting and very exhilarated about it!</p>

<dd>You're the one who affirms, the burden of a proof is yours. I was kind enough to answer when you first asked me about my degrees in math and physics. You are now forging a fantasy cursus out of your mind. The fact that you lied about <i>your</i> scientific background, and been caught, does not mean that everyone do the same.</dd>
<dd>I you had been able to address (or at least try to) only <i>once</i>, only <i>one</i> scientific issue on this affair, you'd be in position to ask something. I have coined Igor numerous times on basic maths and physics (he does not even know what an <a href="http://bogdanoff.forumactif.com/ftopic39.Une-erreur-peut-en-cacher-deux-autres.htm" class="external text" title="http://bogdanoff.forumactif.com/ftopic39.Une-erreur-peut-en-cacher-deux-autres.htm" rel="nofollow">algebraic curve</a> is for instance, nor what [Dense_set|dense] means in topology), I could have done so even without having graduate degree on math (what I definitely am). --<a href="../../../y/b/m/User%7EYBM_e89b.html" title="User:YBM">YBM</a> 14:06, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>No No No</p>
<p>You din't answered the question but <b>avoided to do so</b>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>You cannot proove it?</p>
<p>You never prooved your degree in math other than a high-school level, which is not an academical degree, and as for physic, you have none.</p>
<p>I never lied about my background, that you have been able to check, so why do you pretend the opposit now? But you certainly hide yours plenty! I gave access to my research field, but you were unable to deciffer what was, in my meaning, very obvious!</p>
<p>So it should be it, concerning your supposed academical degree in physic, or math.</p>
<p>I have done nothing else but adress the scientifical part of this affair, which you have avoid to do all along, and denied plenty to have done so.</p>
<p>I stay on course and do not change of one degree, my ship is sailing to the right shore and there is nothing you can do about it, but observe.</p>
<p><b>You never ever coined Igor nor Grichka Bogdanov on any physic nor mathematical matter</b>. You will be unable to even ask a question who could even approach the level they have, because you do not have the level of knowledge they have in those fields.</p>
<p>You do not know what you are talking about. You even managed to make a fool of yourself without knowing it for very long with this algebraic curve of yours. You don't see why?</p>
<p>Ask a real specialist in the field, but it will crave from you a certain level in math and theoretical physic, who will take years of activ learning from you, to can grasp it, and fully understand why, and on what point, you made a mistake. And quiet a fool of yourself, which Igor din't abuse, keep this in mind.</p>
<p>You just don't have it in you, but prefer to hold onto the believe that you understand it all. It isn't a way who able one to learn more, nor to access knowledge all together.</p>
<p>Why, tell me why then, it will take at least a month for great men as Professor Stephen William Hawking, and Professor Holger Bech Nielsen, to read those thesis and understand them fully?</p>
<p>Why those thesis interest them both so much?</p>
<p>And you think you can just stand there with your gullable of math-basic and critisize the work of Doctor in Theoretical Physic Igor Bogdanov, and Doctor in Mathematic Grichka Bogdanov, and surpass the level of understanding of the 2 greatest professors, and eminent scientists, <b>in the world</b> in the field of Cosmology?!</p>

<dd><a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXAL_be45.html" title="User:XAL">XAL</a>, there is absolutely no reason to doubt Rialuezo's references. He provided a position, a thesis and links.

<p>Dear Rama,</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt the credentials of Rialuezo in a field of research for the CNRS and for working with physic, but he is absolutely not connected with work in Theoretical Physisc nor High Energy Physic, which are the credentials required to call oneself a Cosmolog.</p>
<p>Dito Rialuezo, also known from the french wiki equivalent of this talk page as Alain R., has not the background attributed to him by YBM on this talk page, for his good and loyal services in YBMs' private forums.</p>
<p>Thats a fact not an invention, ask him and you will see.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Laurence67 blocked for 24 hours</span></h2>
<p>I have blocked Laurence67 for 24 for excessive use of reverts and insufficient discussion and negociations.</p>
<p>I will suggest that further editions be made in a genuine spirit of collaboration; in particular, and though I do not mean to interfer in the writing process itself, I think that there are some elements in Laurence67's version which can rightfully be mentionned, notably the harsh nature of some criticism against the Bogdanov.</p>
<p>That said, censoring the HKUST story is utterly inacceptable of course. However, I expect some work to be done to merge what's good in the two versions of the article (and to soften the tone of Rbj's version a bit).</p>

<i>I have blocked Laurence67 for 24 for excessive use of reverts and insufficient discussion and negociations.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, you're a hypocrite : you have blocked me because you didn't like what I wrote you. I wondered if you would be as dishonest as doing that, now I know it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yesterday I wrote a text in which I described what occured on the forums. I know well the subject, as I have taken part to these forums for more than one year. My version was reverted each time I edited it, very often by YBM, of course, and nobody tried to have any "discussion" or "negociation" with me. I just restored my version which was reverted without any explanation. You know it perfectly, I precise that as a matter of form.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>I will suggest that further editions be made in a genuine spirit of collaboration; in particular, and though I do not mean to interfer in the writing process itself, I think that there are some elements in Laurence67's version which can rightfully be mentionned, notably the harsh nature of some criticism against the Bogdanov.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Bravooo ! But you should have written that <i>earlier</i>, and above all <i>before</i> blocking me ! So I wouldn't have had to restore my version after each revert ! But as an administrator, in a system which is supposed to be fair, in which the rules are supposed to be the same ones for everyone, you have to pretend to be impartial and to treat everybody in the same way. You don't, as one can see, but you have to pretend to !</dd>

<p><i>That said, censoring the HKUST story is utterly inacceptable of course. However, I expect some work to be done to merge what's good in the two versions of the article (and to soften the tone of Rbj's version a bit).</i></p>

<dd>Sure... that's why you have blocked me : to ensure a great balance to the article ! It is the best way, indeed... I find your hypocrisy even more disgusting than your unfairness.</dd>

<dd>I won't edit this article any more, I'm fed up with loosing such a time to fight against malicious people who are protected by a partial administrator. I know that it is exactly what you wished to get by being so strong with us and so lax with YBM, rjb, etc., but in such conditions there is no point to continue. But it's not over, you can be sure of that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Laurence</p>
<hr />
<p>I sympatize with you Laurence, now you know almost exactly how I have been feeling since the first week of september, when I warn you all about this but got no reactions at all. I was already telling that something was definitely wrong, but I found no tools and nobody in wikipedia to help with this current abnormity, thats also what the running arbitration is about.</p>
<p>There is already 3 users asking for a clarification about this, and for the definitiv banishment of RJB and YBM.</p>
<p>Without changes in those 2 areas this talk page cannot goes on and the article not be accepted.</p>
<p>We are not going to repeat all the irregularities here, but concerning your deletion of very pertinent articles by YBM I have also observed it, and also done by administrator Bishonen, with a very opinionated reason/observation.</p>
<p>I have heard that there has been cases on wiki english of lawyer intervention so far it had gone, so it isn't exactly a new tendencoes, or other admi will have reacted, and fast, instead they just assure the continuation of the crime and make even a cover up for each other. Like when bisho is access denied here, she set a buddy in her place to perpetrate her own wish and doing. maru exemple was definitely one to remmeber, he insulted users and made several personal attacks with no reason at all, and was named administrator on wiki a few days later. I heard that one of the voters was Bishonen, Georgre, rama, ....well we all see the picture, and Bishonen has already received a ban star for her "good work" on the Bogdanovs Affair Talk Page!!!</p>
<p>Yes, and no, you are not dreaming. So certain people view of reality and set of value and ethical background and mentality are not the same as one could wish for nor the same as mine and i suppose yours.</p>
<p>And thats why this talk page suffer of a major disfunctionement since administrator Bishonen appeared on this stage, with huge help from ybm and later on rjb, of course. But who help whom the most, is difficult to say. 50/50 from both side is now common.</p>
<p>Do you now understand why I litterally exploded in late august early september?</p>
<p>Being vandalized 100% by ybm and accused of vandalism by him, and paying for his wrong doing. Again and again. That was the top, and that is why he has and feel no shame in reverting intensively the article: because he just can, so he do.</p>
<p>Thats also why I got blocked for saying that i had contacted specialists to evaluate those thesis for good, and that this chapter was soon a closed one and a new was about ot beckon: because they cannot accept that, and because they know what they say is a lie, and that htose specialists will proove it very soon. Thats why they faint to ignore this very good news and disregard it, prooving that all they are after is a fight, and not the truth, and certainly not an agreement about the contain of this article.</p>
<p>I have now no doubt about that, as I tryed it all. Rjb even accused Igor for having white washed the article as soon as he heard that Igor accepted its stand no matter which version, meaning of the 4, where 3 of them were the work of rjbs' industrious revert abuse. So even when agreed with, they disagree and accuse and insult.</p>
<p>Often of their own crimes, that's like a basic rule for them.</p>
<p>Bishonen ban me for saying that Igor had agreed with those version and that the article was now a closed chapter! but he had sayed it a few hours before on this talk page, No it had to be wrong, the war must ABSOLUTELY go on and on and on.</p>

<dd>Rama, after you've blocked Laurence and Igor, you ask for <i>some work to be done to merge what's good in the two versions of the article (and to soften the tone of Rbj's version a bit).</i> Well, with me being the only editing supporter left, guess who feels this task weighing heavily on her shoulders? Do you think someone else will try to tone down rbj's version? And yet, no, I won't spend another half hour trying to write what I think could be a correct text because, come tomorrow morning, it will have been reverted without a word of explanation. And without blame either.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About Internet dicussions</span></h2>
<p>Since I regained so far my faculty to edit the article again, I reformulated the section about "Internet discussion"/</p>
<p>Two remarks :</p>
<p>1. Grichka never (or almost never) posted on forums and threads of discussions. Why? because he did not beleive (and still does not) believes that it is possible to discuss real science on internetm (especially in the Bogdanoff context which is twisted by passions of all sorts). Of course Grichka never used any pseudos.</p>
<p>This had to be corrected in the araticle and I did it.</p>
<p>2. About the "th-phys.edu.hk " domain name : I created and bought this domain name from HK registrar for the International Institute of Mathematical Physics whose president is the reputed mathematical physicist Ark Jadczyk. It was me (and only me) who invented the domaine name (th-phys).</p>
<p>When I undertook the necessary actions for the payment of this domain name, the HK registrar explained me that every educational HK domain name remained the actual property of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and was officially seated at the adress of the university. The registrar added that it was not a problem and that we could use our domain name as if we fully owned it. It was only a year later that YBM (again) created a big mess around this official ownership and started to accuse us to use a domain name without any rights to do it. YBM went so far in his accusations, sending dozens of emails to the university, that we finally had to cancel our domain name/</p>
<p>This is the real story about this domain name and I wrote it.</p>
<p>Igor</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Fact 1 : you pretended on fr.sci.*physics that the domain was owned by HKU</li>
<li>Fact 2 : you said to David Fossé from Ciel &amp; Espace that the "operational center" of your "International Institude of Mathematical Physics" (in fact a simple private association) was in Hong Kong (just check the paper in the magazine)</li>
<li>Fact 3 : Mr "Yang", whoever he is - you or an hypocrite friend of yours - posted several e-mails and blog entries <b>from your home</b> (as you admitted) with an reply-to address from this very domain, and pretented on several e-mails to be from Hong Kong University, he did the same on Usenet</li>
<li>Fact 4 : What you've just said makes no sense regarding the <i>real</i> administrative structure of the DNS and WHOIS databases.</li>
<li>Fact 5 : This is your third contradictory explanation of the HKU(ST) reference in the th-phys.edu.hk : first you said to be affiliated to HKU(ST) (and even bet on it), then that it was randomly added by HKDNR, now it is added because of the .edu.hk uplevel domain. All three are false, moreover, all three are in contradiction.</li>
<li>Fact 6 : During about the same period you registered maths-phys.edu.bs with, this time not the adress but the name "Paris Univ. 4," (this is nothing less than <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorbonne.html" title="Sorbonne">Paris Sorbonne</a>. You were prudent enough to never pretend, afaik, to be related to this prestigious university. Are you about to pretend that the .bs TLD registrar asked you to add a French university in the from for some nonsensical administrative reason ?</li>
<li>Fact 7 : here is an excerpt from the <a href="https://www.hkdnr.hk/eng/legal/rules.html" class="external text" title="https://www.hkdnr.hk/eng/legal/rules.html" rel="nofollow">Rules for .hk Domain and Sub-domains</a></li>
