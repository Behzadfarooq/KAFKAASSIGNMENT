<p>Ive just removed this quote which was just newly added. It contradicted the statment above it which said that bogan was a statment based on behavior and not class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>A person who uses the insult may draw a distinction between bogans, and more 'respectable' working class people. However, bogans are usually perceived to be working class. A person from a comfortable background who is violent, anti-social and unintelligent may well be derided and insulted, but not ncessarily be called a bogan. They may be told they are acting</i> like <i>a bogan, but not that they actually</i> are <i>one.</i></p>

<p><i>"Although the looks of general bogans can be catalogued (many of these overlap with other sub-cultures in Austalia), it is the attitudes of bogans that truly makes them a catagory seperate from <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westies.html" title="Westies">Westies</a>, which they share many common attributes with."</i></p>

<p>As the definition of Westies in the Wiki is <i>"predominantly Irish American organized crime gang hailing from the Hell's Kitchen area of the West Side of Manhattan in New York City."</i>. I presume that the editor who made this change lives in an area where Westies refers to people from the "western suburbs", and even if you use that definition, the comment is meaningless to someone who doesnt live in australia or doesnt live in a town where bogans come from the "west"--<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennyCrane_8c2b.html" title="User:DennyCrane"><span style="color:#9900CC">DennyCrane</span></a> <small><i><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyCrane_06a3.html" title="User talk:DennyCrane">Talk</a></i></small> 08:07, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm really getting tired of seeing articles that are contributed to by multiple sources being eviscerated by a single self-righteous individual. Reverted to last revision by Ivan Kricancic. Asa01, before you arbitrarily delete large sections of an article that has been edited by multiple people, at least have the decency to propose such changes here first. I anyway consider such deletion an act of vandalism.</p>

<dd>OK I'm proposing my changes here: I propose reverting back to my last edit. I'm not really sure what discussions here prior to editing would have done? Would you have agreed to my changed had I proposed them first? Previously the page was a load of unverified chat. The few references were highly questionable. The Age article on the CUB seems like a humour piece, based on quotes from a <i>marketing</i> guy, so I don't really know what that article proves. I know of no wikipedia policy that states that information created by multi editors is subject to special rules and higher levels of respect: no matter how many authors something has had: if it unverified, it can be deleted at any time. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 11:53, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the original, archetypal Bogan of Broadmeadows (or surrounding areas of northern Melbourne) in the late 70's definately wore the more flat moccassins all year round, they were often referred to as "moccies". More effeminate Bogan chicks (often referred to as 'Boge chicks') sometimes used to wear lace up ones to the knees, however definately not in summer. this look still seen widely in the late 80's, however the bogan look is not entirely uniform anymore as there have been several different bogan 'looks' and stereotypes/(mis)uses since and certain apparel consistently worn, differing only slightly depending upon conditions and possibly the era. eastern victorian town Moe, is sometimes derogatorily referred to as Moccassins On Everyone.</dd>

<dd>I believe the word bogan was originally a term of disdain for a particular stereotype in the UK at one time, although I can't remember where I saw the reference. To me it is highly likely that the term possibly migrated here, and was used here in connection with people who displayed similar characteristics.</dd>

<p>I object to the suggestion that this article be merged with the Westie article. The person who made that suggestion is obviously from the eastern suburbs or north shore and stereotypes all residents of western Sydney as identical. (I might add that I have met bogans resident in the eastern suburbs)</p>
<p>I also object to 'Westie' being merged with 'bogan' - in Melbourne the term is rarely interchangeable, and is far more applicable to Sydney. Bogan is a far more ubiquitous description.</p>
<p><b>The real questions perhaps are:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>do "Bogan" and "Westie" denote largely the same phenomon that occurs in many different places.</li>
<li>whether the big city word (Westie) for it should be allowed to assume the provincial word for it (bogan).</li>
</ol>
<p>My instinct on the first is that while there are probably differences in what a bogan is assumed to do in Auckland as opposed to Invercargill (and I assume Australia) these are probably superficial and shifting. I'd be comfortable with the two being on the same page <b>but</b> resistant to any confusing of the two with boy/girl racer as there are clear qualitative and generational differences from that term.</p>
<p>To resolve/avoid the second question I'd suggest that a third term be used and Bogan and Westie both redirect/become part of it - Australasian class slurs is a bit pejorative, but essentially accurately indicates why the two terms exist irrespective of the exact detail of what is meant in different places.</p>
<p>Generally the article is a bit weak on analysing the phenomonon of <b>calling</b> people bogans - ie why social groups develop stereotypes about other groups.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the above is two comments (with one beginning at "the real questions perhaps are...", or one.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm the one who made the suggestion.</p>
<p>The person who objected seems to be saying that people in the western suburbs of Sydney use 'westie' to just mean 'someone from the western suburbs' (which is obviously where the term comes from).</p>
<p>My reason for suggesting merging the two was my experience of people, not so much in the eastern suburbs or north shore but the inner city, which is basically the same thing, who use both 'westie' and 'bogan' as a slur for working class people.</p>
<p>I'd be happy with having an article something like "Classist Terms in Australia" - maybe 'bogan' could re-direct to it, and 'westie' could just be a short article to the effect that "refers to someone from the western suburbs of Sydney, or less often Melbourne, and is also used as a derogatory term for working class people."</p>

<p>Yes, my comment began with "The real question" - I struggled briefly with a way to delineate from the two unsigned comments and settled on bold! I agree with the general direction of your suggestion, except that it would need to be "Classist Terms in Australasia" as both bogan and westie are in common New Zealand parlance. Westie is used to tag people from West Auckland in particular.</p>
<p>I think that the two objections above miss the point that what an encyclopaedia page on these terms is is not an exhaustive map of the subtleties of the usage of the terms, rather it should explain that the terms are mildly derogative, tend to denote working class and/or petrol head pastimes, and are Australasian. The differences between them can be adequately dealt with in one article. These are terms, not realities after all.</p>
<p>If it were in fact the case that in Australian usage westie is a more innocent general term for people from the west of a city, then I agree that a standalone article could be useful. In New Zealand English it is much more of a loaded term and properly belongs with bogan (notwithstanding any subtle differences).</p>

<p>If there is a re-write, I suggest that it be clearly indicated that not all people from the western suburbs conform to the bogan stereotype, and also that bogans are not confined to the western suburbs but can also be found all across Sydney (and presumely other cities). They can also be found to varying degree across all social groups.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm from the north shore/northern beaches area and disagree westie people should be merged with bogan as there are a hell of a lot of bogans on the northern beaches (try going north to avalon).</p>
<p>My contention is that when snobby people think of westies they automatically think bogan - that's probably what inspired the merge suggestion. I challenge the notion that because someone has tattoes, speaks with a westie accent, cleans garbage bins for a living and lives in a fibro shack they are automatically a bogan. Bogan is a mindset, a mindset that typifies a stereotype. For all you know he is putting food on the table for his kids and keeping a household in order. To me that's not a bogan. To me bogans are the idiots who started Cronulla fighting - that IS bogan mentality.</p>

<hr />
<p>Bogan is in wide use in Perth, but Westie is unknown, as 'The Western Suburbs' are the more affluent areas. The Word Map from the ABC doesn't list Westie beyond the south-east of Australia - merging Bogan into Westie would be misleading. A more accurate merge would be to merge Westie into Bogan.<a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKellyunderwood_45dc.html" title="User:Kellyunderwood">kju</a> 11:30, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Personally, I hear 'Bogan' being used far more often than 'Westie' (There's even a CD released in Australia recently called: Bogan! Simply the best pub rock).

<p><b>Westie?</b></p>
<p>There is absolutely no reason why <b>Bogan</b> and <b>Westie</b> should be merged at all. As mentioned...whilst the similaries between the stereotype of what a bogan represents and what the stereotype of the westie does are similar and deserve a small link, the westie has as much to do with it's opposite the <b>Eastie</b> as purely a Sydneycentric item (the term unused outside of sydney/auckland) representing where someone originates, with their perceived stereotypical lifestyle. Similarly the <b>Bevan</b> is used widely in Queensland, but little elsewhere if anywhere else. The term 'bogan' and bogan's themselves is an Australia/new Zealand wide representation or template and by far most widely used term. <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavencheese_af04.html" title="User:Havencheese">Havencheese</a> 07:00, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This subject can be developed further, with a more appropriate NPOV, if it is permitted to extend to the social psychology term "boganism." While the root may still harbor some pejorative meanings, the phenomenon has been documented with increasing frequency over the past few years. The following is excerpted from the article referenced below:</p>
<p><br />
"Bogan? It is an Austrailian colloquialism--street slang used by teenagers. It dates from the late 1980s, has been used in print at least once, and was commonleard on an Australian television comedy. We heard it often while living in Perth, Western Australia, a few years ago. It is not a term of endearment. As a colloquialism, there is no definitive meaning for bogan. As we heard it, it refers to teenage boys who are considered losers, slackers, and deadbeats--goin' nowhere and doin' nothin'. In Melbourne, the word has signified nerds and geeks. Generally, bogan does not denote criminal or delinquent behavior; bogans are not gang bangers, juvenile delinquents, or teenage criminals. So what are they? First, bogan is a popular culture neologism. We have given it an academic twist because it is a word that immediate comes to mind when one sees two behaviors that increasingly define our culture tuday: unaware and irresponsible. This is not what Australian youth mean by the term, but when we asked them about it, these two features always surfaced.</p>
<p>"<i>Boganism</i> describes more than the behavior of Australian teens. Consider bogan behavior to be that of folks whose everyday activity expresses a lack of concern for what is going on around them or how their behavior affects others in their midst, whether on or off the job, on or off the freeway, in their housing complexes, or on the steet. They do not see the connections between what they are engaged in and its effect on their community, the environment, or others around the world. Additionally, they are unaware of the consequences of their activities for future sustainability. Corporate CEOs are surely guilty of this, as are politicians, neighbors, and coworkers. We thought of title this article 'The ABCs of Boganism.' Why? Because there is surely adolescent boganism; there is [Presidential] boganism...there is corporate boganism, like Enron...WorldCom, and so on.</p>
<p>"Bogans are everywhere, and their behavior pattern is painfully observable. The question is not whether boganism exists, but whether it is a result of broader social forces that we can identify and analyze...The bottom line is this: Boganism, the social phenomenon of being both unaware and irresponsible, is the result of a particular type of human abandonment."</p>

<p>It seems to me that there has been a considerable broadening of the meaning of the term bogan over the years. When I was growing up in the 80s, in my circles it had a very specific meaning: the style of dress (flannies, tight jeans and moccasins), the hair style (mullet) and the musical preferences (pub rock or metal). Nowadays it seems to be used to refer to basically anyone who comes from a blue collar family and does not aspire to become white collar or attempt to effect an air of intellectualism. The article seems to refer more to the former (more disparaging and less useful) meaning than the latter. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussell_E_272a.html" title="User:Russell E">Russell E</a> 08:12, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a feeling in the community that the true essence of the bogan has deteriorated. There is the '80's bogan look and characteristics that are indelable and romantic. There has since then been a substantial evolution of the bogan. There are undoubtedly some 1980's true blue bogans still strutting the streets, but there is a new generation of nouveau bogans that are often termed pseudo bogans and there are difficulties in the classification. Do these new lifestyles truly deserve the term of bogan? The answer is surely yes, there are striking similarities between these new forms and the original bogans. The differences are due to the different environments we live in today and the impact bogan lifestyle has had on our psyche as a whole. We can now see roaming our streets various forms of creature that still have their ancestral bogan roots in the same way the human coccyx is the remants of a tail. From this evlutionary perspective and current observatoin, there should be added several sub species to the bogan line, namely;</p>
<p>Cro-bogan (originating from the pure '80's bogan stock, but harder, meaner and more phyically and mentally scarred) Metrobogan [mogan] (the softer, understanding bogan who is in touch with current issues but is still a bogan at heart/slightly scary) Cashed up bogan (as previously mentioned, this is a real phenomenon - it derives from the realisation that bogan isn't forced upon you - it is a choice and a priviledge) Agribogan (formed from the mixing of outer suburbs with agricultural areas where elements of each culture mix</p>

<dd>Perhaps. But, as far as I know, we are not prosecuting bogans on criminal charges, and we are describing a social group based on a stereotype, not individuals. There are many differences between encyclopedia standards and courtroom practices, including that encyclopedia editors do not cite precedents. If you want to show Poida et al exists, I suggest you document their behaviour, and post your research on another website. Maybe you could quote their police records to prove their deviancy. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 07:51, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Michelle and Ferrett bogans? Well if we agree to list them as bogans can we also say that bogan girls wear black lippy, tight connies <i>all the time</i>, have short platinum blond hair that never shows any dark regrowth, and that bogan men are totally dominated by their women to the point of never ever speaking?! Because they were the key features of Michelle and Ferrett. Kylie Mole I believe is a rather low class wannabe <i>Valley Girl</i> in training. She <i>used</i> the term bogan herself; it does not mean she is one. Article also suggests that "It's the only authentically Australian subculture," (!) Not sure if I agree, while bogan is really just an Aust word for something that exists in other countries but is called Chav or Ned. Meanwhile she refers to panel vans: weren't they more connected to <i>surfie</i> culture? Anyway we sure can refer to the article; but maybe the WP article on bogan should specify "one researcher/academic has suggested that" before recounting her claims. I believe her claims are pretty bold and out there (like, her suggestion there are no bogans in Box Hill). <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 12:00, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'<b>I disagree with your suggestion that what you see as the notable characteristics of Michelle and Ferret must therefore apply to all bogans'</b> I was joking. I was trying to emphasise that their key characteristics are nothing like any bogans I have ever heard of. Apart from Michelle being somewhat thuggish, they don't have any specifically bogan characteristics at all, do they? Therefore it is a bit misleading to list them. Magda might be a funny comedienne who thinks she knows what a <i>bogan</i> might be and how one might be played, but unless she's a published expert in sociology we can't base the bogan article on any of her comments either. She might think she is playing a bogan, who is to say she can accurately judge what a "bogan" is in the first place? <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 21:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point. A big problem here, and the reason the article is gets so out of hand is because the term is so widely used and broadly applied that it's quite difficult to define. As my edits last night indicate, the Kylie Mole usage was to mean "dag", not in the sense that most of the article is referring to, and you can't quantify that if someone has 5 or more ticks on the "bogan checklist", then they're a bogan - the term is almost always subjective.</dd>
<dd>One of the main sections I was going to add to the article is about "bogan pride" - people, often expatriate Australians, claiming "bogan" as a badge of pride and Australian-ness - see the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly_Valance_dd59.html" title="Holly Valance">Holly Valance</a> link in the Herald Sun and the bogan.com.au website. Now, I don't know about you, but it seems to me that Holly Valance has fewer "bogan qualities" than Michelle &amp; Ferret, despite her self-identification as one. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 01:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite all the recent AfD discussions about what should and shouldn't be included, and that we should avoid having a list-type article where people just jump in with their favourite description of a crass person stereotype, people continues to do just that. Meanwhile no one seems to be improving the article or adding any references. I mean look at the most recent changes! As if the name <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes.html" title="Mercedes">Mercedes</a> is a non-standard name!! Amazing.

<dd>I've done some work to improve most of the sections of this article, and cited numerous references - I'll wait to see if they're reverted or deleted by the editors/anon IPs who removed your edits. You're right, some of this had to go: the essay on the evolution of the bogan, and the unreferenced outing of celebrity bogans. That list of stereotypes is an absolute mess and I'm steeling myself to deal with that part shortly! I'm thinking it needs to be reformatted and drastically shortened to stop it being a OR?POV magnet.

<dd>Your additions are fine. It is the long, ever expanding unverified list that is the problem, not the opening descriptions (which remained after my drastic cutting awhile back). My deletions (and those of other people) that would be quickly reverted, were deletions of the "locations" section, and the lists of examples. Note that during this page's AfD, the page <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darrin_Syndrome_6679.html" title="Darrin Syndrome">Darrin Syndrome</a> came up for its second AfD having survived one a few weeks before. Because of the first AfD the listcruft type list was successfully kept off the article. However the result was a pointless page with so little content that when nominated the second time the AfD succeeded. I guess I am saying that some decent references to the main section are the safest bet to keep this from becoming a dictionary entry when the lists are trimmed. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 20:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. It should be amended to <i>The stereotype might be exhaustively, speculatively catalogued, without verification, as follows</i>. If it is a summary, it should be short. Most people think bogans are unsophisticated, so the stereotypical traits should be short anyway, and simple to describe. I think many anonymous editors from Broadmeadows and Epping in Melbourne, and the Western suburbs in Sydney decided to attribute the traits of their neighbours to bogans, and add them to the list.</dd>

<p>Because there seems to be a dearth of literature on bogans, maybe Melissa Campbell's thesis on bogans, if it can be found, and whatever sources she consulted, should be cited as references for the stereotype.

<dd>Actually I decided this article can only be improved to a satisfactory quality if it receives the attention of an expert. For there are few useful references that can be sought in an internet search, and academic-quality information is not likely to be found in library books or encyclopediae. Maybe we should just let bogans describe themselves. Then, at least, all we need to rely on is honesty. As slang, "bogan" is a catch-all term for lower-class or unfashionable people; no specific stereotype is evoked. Anyone who uses it or hears it often will probably falsely receive the impression it can easily be reduced. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 11:48, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No we cannot just let "bogans describe themselves" because of a lack of references, because that is not how wikipedia works. If the term bogan seems to be a catch-all word, but its specifics have never been formally described, then the wikipedia article can say <i>only that</i>. WP can't describe any specific attributes without an external reference that states <i>that that attribute is a characteristic of a bogan</i>, because doing so is original research. At one point this article was just like that: it gave a definition of the term and described its origins but avoided unreferenced specifics, but then all the long, <i>long</i>, example list was added (and then added to), and that section of the article is original research. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 19:22, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

Still, I doubt there are sources trustworthy enough to elevate this article to "Very Good" standard.

<dd>Isn't the list just a vague caricature of the Australian working class? Based on the current list, it is difficult to distinguish the stereotype of blue-collar Australians from 'bogans'. I think some of the list items can still be trimmed, because they are not worth finding sources for. If someone wants to help, it would beneficial if someone searched the term 'bogan' in academic papers. I could not be bothered doing this myself. Any university student or staff member could do this. I don't think much more can be found in newspaper articles. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 06:54, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Although Melissa Campbell, who wrote her thesis on bogans in 2004, wrote in The Age: "It is no coincidence that Bogan is an Irish surname. Irishness is associated with bogans' 19th-century ancestors: English and American hooligans, and Australian larrikins." [3], there is no known evidence the meaning of the adjective is derived from the characteristics of any person or people named Bogan." That can be true but Bogans do have the attitudes of stereo-typical Irish people (eg. Like Irish people alot of bogans are Heavy drinkers, have short tempers and often disobey the law)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Those similarities do not imply the bogan stereotype derives from the Irish one. Your example fits many fringe stereotypes. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 11:35, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This stereotype is difficult (if not impossible) to define in a manner complying entirely with Wikipedia's policy regarding citation of sources, since although both the stereotypes and adherents of it are known to exist, the definition of the stereotype is largely held/transmitted in an oral rather than formally printed way.

<p>I disagree. All WP needs is a reputable external source to corroborate any particular attribute listed as being typical of bogans. The long list of examples that I suspect this paragraph refers to, was hardly necessary. The article on <i>bogan</i> does still exist and the definition is there, so what's the problem? <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 21:53, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hardly anything on this page is there without the uncited tag; people reading the article who are aware from their own observation that bogans exist may wonder why that is. I considered it important to attempt to offer some explanation for that. I'm going to put the passage back, and part of the reason why is because I actually consider you yourself to be a member of the army of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedant.html" title="Pedant">pedants</a> I was referring to in it. Before you consider me calling you that ad hominem, I invite you to look the definition of the word up; I've included the link. There is a rather glorious irony associated with the word having its' own article on Wikipedia, since I know of no other word in the English language which more eloquently describes a large number of the people present here, in my own mind. I am, above all, deeply tired of the archetypical denizens of this site attempting to falsely make out that their customary attitude is more elevated or desirable than it genuinely is.</dd>

<dd>Um. Well, I can vouch for myself not being a bogan, though I did drink a VB 6 months ago — I think. The others you are complaining of are probably not bogans, for their intellectual interest is greater than what is allowed by the bogan stereotype. Looking up the dictionary defintion doesn't help; it is already described in the article and is not longer than a sentence. Per criteria of neutrality, the bogan article is not a place to express one's hatred of bogans. Such is more suited to letters to the editor in most newspapers. The uncited tag is useful for drawing people's attention to unsourced information. If you want to fix it, find sources for it. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 15:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was leafing through a fairly recent large edition of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macquarie_Dictionary_57a6.html" title="Macquarie Dictionary">Macquarie Dictionary</a> in a discount store recently (the old MSD shop on Swanston Street, Melbourne) and absent-mindedly looked up "bogan", fully expecting the origin to be "unknown" as I had read in previous editions. I was quite surprised to read in this edition that the Macquarie Dictionary now seems to claim the origin of the word "bogan" is from the Swahili word for "enclosure"! As this seems so strange and unlikely, can someone with access to the latest edition or the online version of the Macquarie check that I wasn't seeing things or looking at the wrong word? If this is verified, we can add it to the article. Any Swahili experts or Macquarie dictionary editors, please also chime in... what is the Swahili word for "enclosure" and how on earth would it end up being applied to bogans? --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 00:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I subscribed to the online Macquarie, and the origin is unknown. Have done some research, and we actually have an article on the Swahili word for enclosure: <a href="../../../b/o/m/Boma_%28enclosure%29.html" title="Boma (enclosure)">Boma (enclosure)</a>. Only very slightly similar, but I cannot see how "bogan" and "boma" could possibly be related unless I was (a) seeing things - unlikely as I'm sure I re-read it several times to make sure, or (b) it was an error in the "Bo" section of the Macquarie Dictionary. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 05:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article includes the following in the <i>bogan</i> article, but neither entry provides any reference that substantiates the item as being specifically about <i>bogans</i>.

<dd>I just read your comment — properly this time instead of scanning it while half-asleep. The article does actually imply Warne's is a <i>bogan</i> person. It does not say he receives "ribbings... for his <i>perceived</i> bogan persona", but says for "his bogan person". Therefore, the writer assumes Warne's is in fact a "bogan persona".

<dd>I agree. Bogan does not merely refer to an economic underclass, but has specific Australian cultural connotations; an American "white trash" or hessian or British <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a> is typically not a bogan, despite having some things in common with them. Moreover, the state of being "white trash" (even in a deregionalised, de-Americanised sense) is not the essence of being a bogan; one could be the Australian equivalent of such without being identifiable as a bogan, by not embodying the characteristics of bogan-ness. <a href="../../../a/c/b/User%7EAcb_9b8c.html" title="User:Acb">Acb</a> 17:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are plenty of common and widely-accepted aspects of the bogan stereotype omitted from this article, the reason being that some months ago several editors including myself removed a great deal of information which did not have a source or reference in a reliable publication. Everyone knows about bogans and Acca Dacca and Chisel and "Khe Sahn", but unless we're strict about pruning uncited information, the article may slide into the messy original research magnet it was last year, with every man and his blue heeler adding their two cents about what a bogan was, where they live, cars, music, clothes and so on.
