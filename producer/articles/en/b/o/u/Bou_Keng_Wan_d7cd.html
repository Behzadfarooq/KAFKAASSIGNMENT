Unlike <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a>, he is almost non-diplomatic. He has empathy only to those he cares about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deceased stepfather - Fok Bou Tin (霍步天)</li>

<li>Deceased second love, Chor Chor</li>
</ul>
<p>but he rarely shows them. Cloud is a man who is cold on the outside but passionate on the inside. For this reason, Cloud was frequently perceived by others as a cruel and cold-hearted man. Being one of the best and most feared fighter in the martial world, he specialises in using palm and sword to fight.</p>
<p>Cloud was one of first people who absorbed the Dragon Pill (龍元). Both him and <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a> managed to obtain one Dragon Pill each. Cloud gave his Dragon Pill to save <a href="../../../p/o/_/Po_Kuan_e4de.html" title="Po Kuan">Po Kuan</a>'s life after seeing the dying menace turn over a new leaf. The first duel with arch villain Dai Seik Tin saw Cloud doing a kamikaze to save his master, friends and family. <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a> carried the fatally injured Cloud to a cave. At the same time, <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a>'s daughter was also facing death after being hit by Dai Seik Tin's men. However, Wind chose to give his Dragon Pill to Cloud.</p>

<p>Cloud loathes <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> (雄霸) for killing his stepfather. Thus he planned to get as close as possible to <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> for revenge. Fate has it that half a prophecy made by Mud Buddha (that <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> will conquer the martial world with the help of Wind and Cloud) prompted <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> to take Cloud as apprentice together with <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a>.

Cloud hiding when the Fok family was being terminated</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>His father was a blacksmith. When Cloud was very young, his father left the family in search of the special black steel that was supposedly required to make the Ultimate Superior Sword (絕世好劍). His mother thought he was a mute, because Cloud did not utter a single word since birth until he was about 8 years old.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of her husband and living with a silent son, Cloud's mother lived a very annoyed life. As a result, she always vented her anger towards Cloud and never showed much motherly love to him. Things started to worsen when his father died in his quest. When his father's body was sent back, Cloud did not shed a tear. Thinking that Cloud is a heartless son, his mother began to hate him.</p>
<p>His mother then remarried into the Fok family. Cloud first found the warmth of humanity as his stepfather, Fok Bou Tin (霍步天), loved him as his own son and taught him the Fok Sword stance. Not long after that, Fok Bou Tin angered the most powerful martial lord, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a>, master of the Tin Ha clan. As a result, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> sent 2 assassins to annihilate the Fok family. Hiding in a corner and not showing any fear or sadness, the two assassins did not expect Cloud to be a member of the Fok family and thus spared his life at first. Just when they were about to leave, Cloud lunged out and killed one of the assassins. The remaining assassin retaliated and was about to kill Cloud when <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mou_Ming_b864.html" title="Mou Ming">Nameless</a> passed by with his young disciple Kim Sun. Cloud was rescued and sheltered at <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mou_Ming_b864.html" title="Mou Ming">Nameless</a>'s place.</p>
<p>After Cloud was refused discipleship by <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mou_Ming_b864.html" title="Mou Ming">Nameless</a>, he ran away and fought his way to become a member of <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a>'s Tin Ha Wui. Cloud planned to get as close to <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> as possible so that he could murder <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> someday.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> ordered the young Cloud to snatch two of the best weapons of the time, the Blizzard Sabre owned by Nip Yan Wong and the Fire Kirin Sword owned by Duen Sui. Hiding nearby with two servants, Cloud observed the duel between <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duen_Long_2a34.html" title="Duen Long">Duen Long</a>'s fathers. Cloud then surprised the duellists by taking <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duen_Long_2a34.html" title="Duen Long">Duen Long</a> hostage to force Duen Sui to hand over the Fire Kirin sword. Chaos ensued and the Fire Kirin beast appeared on the scene. The end results were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Cloud's servants were killed</li>
<li>Nip Yan Wong and Duen Sui disappeared into the nearby caverns</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duen_Long_2a34.html" title="Duen Long">Duen Long</a> fell into the river</li>
<li>Cloud got a severe shock (from witnessing the Fire Kirin beast)</li>

<p>Cloud was <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a>'s strongest disciple in terms of martial skills. During his teenage years, he had already achieved 80% of <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a>'s Cloud Palm stance, fueling it with his sorrows and hatred. He successfully executed many of <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a>'s tasks without questioning.</p>
<p>Thirsting for love, Cloud had a crush on girl servant Charity. After Charity was married to Frost, Cloud began to have affair with her. The morally just <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a> knew about this and frequently reprimanded Cloud. As a result, there were deep misunderstandings and frictions between Cloud and <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a>. Unknowingly, it was all part of <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a>'s plans to disunite his three disciples.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> only taught Cloud 11 out of the 12 Cloud Palm stances. However, Cloud learned it in secret after witnessing <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_Ba_634c.html" title="Hung Ba">Hung Ba</a> use the 12th stance (and the strongest stance) on innocent women and children.</p>
<p>Cloud was caught in the act having an affair with Charity one day. Wanting to kill off the eye witness, he duelled with <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a> but ended up killing Charity (who took Cloud's blow on behalf of <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a>). After refusing to accept Charity's revelations that she loved <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_Fung_925d.html" title="Nip Fung">Wind</a> the most, Cloud fled with Charity's body and became a fugitive.</p>

<p>Though the death of Charity had put a rift between them, Wind and Cloud guided by the planning of their elder martial brother Frost, united against Hung Ba. Wind and Cloud were forced to combine their strength, using Winds speed and Clouds strength. For a moment it would appear that they had their former master beaten. Unfortunately the duo's attack was interrupted by one of Hung Ba's allies. During the confrontation with their former master Wind lost his eye and Cloud lost all use of his left arm. Though they were defeated it proved one fact: that together Wind and Cloud are a nearly unstoppable force.</p>
