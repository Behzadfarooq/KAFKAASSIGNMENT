<dd>I think it's relatively unknown. I'm sure that none of my friends or anyone I know has the slightest clue what bounce music is. They'd probably say it's "some kind of <a href="../../../t/e/c/Techno.html" title="Techno">techno</a>." So, "not well known" is actually a good description of it. — <b>Phantasy Phanatik</b> | <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhantasy_Phanatik_518a.html" title="User talk:Phantasy Phanatik">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Phantasy_Phanatik_516a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Phantasy Phanatik">contribs</a> 05:55, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Mannie Fresh is well known, bounce music is not. You don't need to study long for proof of this. Go ask twenty people if they know what bounce music is and probably only two of them at most will know. — <b>Phantasy Phanatik</b> | <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhantasy_Phanatik_518a.html" title="User talk:Phantasy Phanatik">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Phantasy_Phanatik_516a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Phantasy Phanatik">contribs</a> 01:54, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What I'm saying is that the sound is known, just not the term people call it, and it seems to me like the sound is more important than the term.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 23:39, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bounce music is well known in hip hop in general, considering its mentions in various hip hop mags over the years. If Phatasy Phanatik doesn't recognize the name or assume that others won't, its because he knows little about Hip Hop as a whole. Ask 20 people who read XXL or The Source to name a Rockabilly, Jungle or Garage artist, and maybe 1 out of 20 will have any idea what that even refers to. That doesn't mean that those genres are virtually unknown, it just depends on who you're talking to (because they all have big followings). Hip Hop heads in general know what it is, and the majority of people from Houston down to Biloxi are definitely going to know what it is because its a regional music.
<dl>
<dd>Mannie Fresh is well known for his work after Cash Money's deal with Universal, but not his work before. That said, Fresh's pop gangsta stylings, which helped Cash Money achieve national success, are post-bounce in a sense, but had abandoned many of the key elements of bounce music. Many of the bounce artists that he produced at that time, UNLV, Lil Slim, Pimp Daddy, etc... are not well-known nationally in any sense. It is true that the mainstream Hip-Hop media has made many a mention of Bounce music, and mainstream artists with Bounce backgrounds reference the genre often, but the music itself is often difficult to acquire and has had virtually no exposure on national radio. As far as I know, no album has been released by a major label that offers a detailed example of Bounce. Beats by the Pound and Mannie Fresh's late production show a great deal of influence, but that's all.
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't the person who brought up Mannie Fresh because he doesn't really cater to bounce fans. But if your argument that albums with distribution don't have bounce tracks, that's incorrect. Master P (Game Face), albums by Kane &amp; Abel, Chingo Bling out of Houston. Bounce music has gotten spins in different cities, but just because it isn't played as much as snap music, that hardly makes it "virtually unknown". If it was that unknown, you wouldn't have artists like Yin Yang twins biting 90's bounce lyrics word for word, or East Coast artists using words like "twerk" which is a bounce term originated in New Orleans.
<dl>
<dd>"Virtually unknown" is a completely different phrase than "relatively unknown." Something that is "relatively unknown" could be known by tons and tons of people, but to a much lesser extent than its analogues. "Virtually unknown" means that it 'may as well be unknown.'</dd>

<p>I'm recommending that the Acadiana artist list be completely removed. Most, if not all of them, are obscure. You don't have a list of semi-known or up and coming crunk artists on the crunk page, just the established ones. None of those artists even get significant radio play within Louisiana, the list should be removed.</p>

<p>Man, the N.O. has been through so much wit Katrina and all the other shit people goin through. Bounce music has really brought back some memories for most people. When people evacuated they took they cd's cause ain't nothin like new orleans muzik. For the people that got rescued, they didn't have no music to listen to in their new homes. That drove me crazy and I'm sure it drove others crazy too. But when u finally go back to tha city or get it from another new orleanian, u here that beat and start dancin'. It's hard to listen to bounce and not move your leg or shake ya ass. Bounce is tha shit and nobody knows about it. That's a symbol of new orleans. A DJ is another way of gettin together and have fun as people in New Orleans. It brings people together and they have fun. People miss gettin on top of the cars and bust out dancin. We wouldn't be the same if we had a party there was no bounce. No rock tha canoe, drop and gimme 50, faster, buckle ya knees, drop the hulla hoop, nolia clap, bounce it biggity bounce it, all that good shit!!!!! Man New Orleans could do that shit infront some people in other states and blow they minds. Bounce Muzik is fun and a beast. It's tha shit my nigga!!!!!! 9th Ward Souljarette</p>
