<p>thanks for the mediation, <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcorr_b5f0.html" title="User:Bcorr">Bcorr</a> - once again i'm impressed with how the wikipedia functions.&#160;:) My hope is that sooner or later enough Polish speaking people will feel concerned enough about debates on "encyclopedia level" cosmology/physics on the Polish wikipedia that we also need some meta-process there. So far we're still too low in numbers and unmetered access is still too expensive... <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 13:37, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please see the note I left on <a href="../../../t/h/a/Talk%7EThanksgiving_f8a2.html" title="Talk:Thanksgiving">Talk:Thanksgiving</a>, Thanks <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 16:16, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC).</p>
<p>I'd rather move this discusion to our individual talk pages, see if we can agree, then post the results to <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>. That said:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't intend to take on Loewen, since he makes his living pushing a PC view of history. But I will remove the poisoning entry from the Thanksgiving article. Seems to me that ONE sociologist is not an adequate source.</li>
<li>The attack in 1637 did occur. (Researching material for an article on the <a href="../../../p/e/q/Pequot_War_bd19.html" title="Pequot War">Pequot War</a> was what brought me here in the first place.) But mercenaries and Dutch weren't involved, massacres on both sides happened, and Loewen is again the only source for 'heads like soccer balls in Manhattan' tripe. I think its logistically impractical (almost impossible) for this to have happened.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please answer here or my talk page, thanks <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 22:12, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification that you're only talking about the poisoning entry, not the 1637 attack.</p>
<p>Regarding the poisoning claim, at the meta-level, the fact that Loewen <i>makes his living pushing a PC view of history</i> and that he seems to be the only person supporting this POV, is not enough to make it false. After all, most historians make their living pushing PC views of history - the difference is just which political correctness filters they use, how carefully they check facts, whether they naively accept majority points of view or whether they are critical and try to get to primary sources. However, still at the meta-level, i did email loewen (jloewen at zoo.uvm.edu) about the whole question on 19.12.2003 recommending he participate directly on <a href="../../../t/h/a/Talk%7EThanksgiving_f8a2.html" title="Talk:Thanksgiving">Talk:Thanksgiving</a> rather than replying in private. That's four days ago - maybe not much during the Xmas season, but so far he doesn't seem to have chosen to speak up.</p>
<p>How about simply NPOVing it, with something like <i>One sociologist, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Loewen_29b5.html" title="James Loewen">James Loewen</a>, claims on the basis of a colonist's letter that...</i> in front of the poisoning bit? People who dismiss Loewen's POV as PC can decide for themselves.</p>

<dd>Can't see it. We might note it somewhere with a link back to Thanksgiving. If I had any belief in that Loewen was correct, maybe. Your note implies that we might need or want an article on Loewen. Want to help write one? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 15:53, 23 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, to be honest i really would prefer to concentrate on areas of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spacetime.html" title="Spacetime">spacetime</a> closer to where i'm located or where i'm more intimately involved. If the author of the indymedia article and Loewen choose not to get involved in rational, open, version-tracked debate on a wikipedia Talk page, which so far seems to be the case, then we're just going to have trust your judgment. i spent a lot of time on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Gujarat_violence_54bb.html" title="2002 Gujarat violence">2002 Gujarat violence</a>, which is less than two years away in time, and only a few hundred km from where i lived for two years. The witnesses there are mostly still alive and there's a massive amount of evidence which is pretty close to primary source (and a lot is online), which is a very different case from an alleged <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>-based massacre which happened in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1623.html" title="1623">1623</a>. So while my intuition suggests that your intuition about Loewen is probably wrong, i'm unlikely to have the time to go further. Better that US based people follow this up. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 01:26, 24 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your consideration over the Thanksgiving article. I'd like to think that I'm going on a little more than intuition. I have tried to research his reported incident, but get no where. On the other hand, like Loewen, I'm not a professional historian, just a retired computer nerd, and an amatuer physicist and historian with a growing case of wikiholism. I will write a short summary for the Talk:Thanksgiving Page, you might want to check it. I sympathize with your difficulty over Gujarat. I've had trouble for years trying to find a balanced and insightful write-up about the Kent State shootings from the era of Vietnam War protests. And I'm having trouble now writing the Pequot War article. You might watch that one to keep me honest. See you around the Wiki!

<p>Hi, and Happy New Year! I just wanted to let you know that I've finished my efforts on the <a href="../../../p/e/q/Pequot_War_bd19.html" title="Pequot War">Pequot War</a>, and posted an update on Talk:Thanksgiving. Hope this resolves things, so I'm bak to the Revolurionary War.

<p>Hey Boud, I agree with you about them meeting the same number of times, but you might want to revert yourself or otherwise clip that text. Why? Because some editors gripe that the section is off-topic, so we try to keep it to the bare, factual minimum. I totally disagree that the section is off-topic but we try to keep everybody happy as much as reasonable. With the addition of Rumsfeld in there, the passage could be seen as argumentative. Without the Rumsfeld mention, the passage is still effective at illustrating the mistakes that were in the report. I leave it up to you, but someone will probably change it if you don't yourself. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 00:51, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>i'm not so sure the passage is as effective at illustrating the mistakes if the Rumsfeld-Saddam-Hussein meetings are not mentioned. The difference between <i>many</i> and <i>two</i> is not that strong, it could be considered as a single careless word and sound like a pedantic defence, playing on single words; the difference between <i>many</i> and <i>the same number of times that Rumsfeld met with Saddam Hussein</i> is IMHO much stronger, and IMHO it would be NPOV to remove this. However, i'm unlikely to struggle over the Coleman page, there are more important things to work on... <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 01:18, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I happen to think this is an important entry, even if you don't. You disrupted somewhat of a balance, and you yourself or best positioned to fix it. You could insert the text "**for example** citing the charge that he had met with Hussein "many times" when the number of meetings was two." But sure, you can go off to something else and leave others to deal with it. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 10:24, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Nandesuka, the material which i put in 2003-2006 alleged US violations of Iranian sovereignty is <b>not</b> the main theme of the deleted article. Threats to attack and an actual attack are two very different phenomena. If you look at the discusssion page of the article (available to admins only), you will see that this was a debate about whether or not to break it off into a separate article. As long as the threats article existed, the conservative approach was <b>not</b> to create the actual territorial violations article. The deleted article was about threats to attack Iran; the <b>new</b> one i created was about actual (claimed) violations of Iranian territory. People on the discussion for deletion discussed the general threats article; they did not discuss about whether or not to create an article about the actual (claimed) territorial violations. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 21:44, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Second, please note that Wikipedia cannot accept <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<p>Hi Boud,</p>
<p>Regarding your statement at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Anti-war_e322.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Anti-war">Wikipedia:WikiProject Anti-war</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"one of the people wishing to delete the page claims to be from the US army"</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is considered a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. The user you're referring to has a userbox that says he is or was a member of the military, not that he is "from" the army. Whether or not someone served in the military has nothing to do with the rationale for deleting an article. Please see <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">poisoning the well</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 21:36, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So you seem to be saying that "whether or not someone served in the <b>US</b> military has nothing to do with the rationale for deleting an article" <b>about an organisation opposing a US/Israeli military attack on Iran</b>&#160;? In any case, i do agree with the substantive part of your argument, i.e. that it is more productive to focus on the arguments rather than on conflicts of interest. i suggest you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Wikipedia:Notability_(organizations)</a> and compare it to your deletion proposal and the discussion can return to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Action_Iran_127d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Action Iran">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Action_Iran</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 22:41, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
