<p>Your additions to the Western Canada article are without merit. Please research your contributions before revising, and attempting to ruin, an otherwise good starter article. Everything you added was hogwash, including the arguments regarding time zones, economic acivity, and ethnic composition. BC is absolutely a part of Western Canada, and has always been considered to be so. After all, it is Canada's westernmost province. --207.161.41.91 09:32, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. In response to your question, I have a wide range of interests. I am not so interested in WWII in Asia per ce, though I do take an interest in some of the naval campaigns. I have a fairly wide interest in Chinese &amp; Japanese history.</p>
<p>I think you might have misunderstood my comment. I didn't mean people in the "real world" so much, more nationalistic internet trolls who make it their hobby to go around denouncing Japan over almost everything. Anyway I wasn't too sure which article you were referring to. A link would be nice, so that I could have another look at it. Many of the WWII articles concerning Japan are biased one way or another, because there are people on either side that have an agenda.</p>
<p>I would also say the same applies to China in a way. The number of Chinese people that I have come across who keep insisting America started the Korean War, that China was only protecting North Korea, etc is not getting funny anymore, especially given how many British soldiers died trying to protect South Korea. There is historical revisionism in China and Korea - Japan is far from being an exception (though of course that doesn't mean Japan shouldn't be clear about the past). It just means I have little sympathy for people that cry foul over Japan but then tell me to butt off because their education policy is an "INTERNAL AFFAIR!!" <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 22:44, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your last message, yes there is of course a time and a place to talk about Japan's responses but not on that article, as you said. So can it be listed for deletion, or what? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 13:11, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I don't know how it can be objective, given that there is no comparison between Germany and Italy, Italy and Japan, Romania and Italy, etc. The best thing would be a single article dealing with how the Axis nations dealt with the issue of the war after 1945.</p>
<p>If you want to save the article, you could rename it and make it a discussion of all the Axis powers. But if it remains as it is, I think I'll have to request it being deleted. It would be like having a comparison between Poland and China, to shame China by pointing out that Poland has become much freer after the Cold War, etc. Hope to hear your response, otherwise I'll have to put in the request - or add my support to a deletion request if there is one already. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 15:51, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We must consider the possibility (though highly unlikely), that the Green Party of Canada could win seats in the House of Commons. If we use this criteria (Four Federal Parties), then it's possible (BQ minority government). Hypothetically the BQ could get 75 seats , the remaining 233 seats devided (roughly even) among the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP &amp; GP (for Example: 59 seats, 58, 58 &amp; 58). So when you include the Green Party of Canada it's possible. PS remember the Cons, Libs, BQ &amp; the NDP aren't the only Parties running candidates for the House of Commons. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 16:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yep! if ONLY the Con, Lib ,NDP &amp; BQ win seats in this Election (2006), there's no way the BQ can form a government, thank goodness. Can you imagine, Prime-Minister (Let me out of Canada) Duceppe?? Yikes. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 17:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>Although there was some discriminations against other ethncities in Europe, they were relatively mild to what the Chinese had experienced.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Thus, I wouldn't exactly mention discrimination against the Chinese and that of the Irish in the same breath.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'll be back at length on my own talk page with much more, but even though I just got up and have had only two sips of coffee I wanted to rejoinder the above comments immediately. You clearly don't know much about history of ethnic and class discrimination in Europe or the British Isles, and about the Irish in particular. Even during the railway-immigration period when the Canadian government promoted free land in the Prairies, the Irish were among the most impoverished and discriminated against of all Western European peoples - the mythical "No Dogs or Chinese" sign in Shanghai (which even the PRC hypesters now admit never existed) DID have its real-world counterpart in the UK, and in Ireland itself - "No Dogs or Irish". I suggest you read some Irish social nd political history (instead of focussing on that of your own ethnic group). But the anti-Irish discrimination I was talking about was in the much earlier period when BC was first being exploited/settled by all comers; you <i>have</i> heard about the Irish Potato Famine, haven't you? The Wars of Religion before that? The socioeconomic status of the Irish in the post-famine era (i.e. after the 1840s) was just before the colonization of BC, and the settlement of the West, and even today the Irish are discriminated against in England, and Catholic Irish to this day in Ulster (and in Britain; similarly the discrimination against their kindred the Scots during the Enclosure Acts is in the same category, although slightly earlier, but it too is one reason there were so many Scots in the fur trade). Irish fled to the United States and even Latin America (there is a large Mexican-Irish element, for example) to escape the crushing and systematic poverty and discrimination caused by British rule of their homeland. And the flip side is the many laws and social attitudes against non-Han in China (it was a virtual death sentence for whites to enter the Middle Kingdom before the Opium Wars, was it not?), particularly "foreign devils" from Europe/Britain who ultlimately made the Emperor and mandarins kowtow to the foreign presence, admittedly by the nastiness of the Opium Wars; but make a comparison between the Opium Wars, when Chinese fought Chinese proxies of the British over the opium trade, vs the outright British control and subjugation of Ireland; it's not incidental that the Opium Wars occurred in the same time period of the Potato Famine, which was a deliberate policy of the British to starve Ireland to death (see J. Swift's <i>A Modest Proposal</i>). On the continent of Europe, the experiences of the Poles and others fall into the same category. I'll leave off here, but YES I CAN speak of discrimination against the Irish in the same breath as that against the Chinese; if you can't you just don't know enough Irish history, or enough BC history <i>or</i> railway history for that matter (check into the labour contracts for the Winnipeg-Sudbury stretch of line, for instance). And I repeat my earlier suggestion - that you should study someone other than your own ethnic group's history!!!! I have quite a bit to say about the status of Chinese in the early province and in the colonial period (a very different equation from the railway period, i.e. post-1880) but I'll save that for my own page; but if you were the guy who put in the since-deleted misinformation that the first immigration to Canada happened because of the Opium Wars (the dates of the First Opium War were given, though those of the Second Opium War DO coincide with the founding of the mainland colony) this is a fallacy, and interestingly omits mention of the Taiping Rebellion at the same time; the reason the Chinese came to BC (not "Canada", which BC wasn't part of at the time) was for <i>gold</i>, not as refugees; and they came from California in the first wave; and those in California were not there as political refugees but in search of <i>gold</i>, like everyone else; including the Poles and Irish and others who were fleeing persecution and violent revolution in Europe. By focussing only on your own ethnic group's context you equivocate "everyone else" into one category/group, <i>which they weren't</i>, and as if they had an easier time of it, <i>which they didn't</i>. Take off your ethnic blinkers if you're really a Canadian now; it's the monocultural focus that each new immigrant community seems to have that irritates the long-time Canadians, including those of gold-rush/railway-era Chinese stock (who are derided by the newcomers by the racist epithet "banana" for having assimilated, and as discussed on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinese_Canadian_d3d0.html" title="Talk:Chinese Canadian">Talk:Chinese Canadian</a> are "not Chinese enough". Well, the Irish until this century were "not white enough", and in point of fact were not even considered "white" by the English.... <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:45, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
