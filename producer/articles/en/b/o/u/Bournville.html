<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cadbury_1677.html" title="George Cadbury">George</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cadbury_2f80.html" title="Richard Cadbury">Richard Cadbury</a> moved their <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocoa.html" title="Cocoa">cocoa</a> and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site beside Bournbrook Hall, four miles to the south. The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner, healthier and more amenable to longer-term expansion plans. Although rural, it was also already serviced by a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway.html" title="Railway">railway</a> station and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canal.html" title="Canal">canal</a>.</p>
<p>The Cadburys named the area 'Bournville' after the Bourn Brook; with 'ville' being French for 'town', this set Bournville apart from the local area (some people wrongly believe Bournville was originally known as Bournbrook - Bournbrook exists to the north of Bournville). The Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury also pioneered <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pension.html" title="Pension">pension</a> schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service. Indeed, the Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health of their workforce, incorporating garden areas into Bournville's plans, and encouraging <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming.html" title="Swimming">swimming</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walking.html" title="Walking">walking</a> and all forms of outdoor sports.</p>
<p>Later, George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5 km²) of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_village.html" title="Model village">model village</a> which would 'alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions'. These almost '<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_and_Crafts_5c45.html" title="Arts and Crafts">Arts and Crafts</a>' houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, and were designed by the resident <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Alexander_Harvey_40e3.html" title="William Alexander Harvey">William Alexander Harvey</a>. These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain. It is also noteworthy that, because George Cadbury was a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker.html" title="Quaker">Quaker</a>, no <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_house.html" title="Public house">public houses</a> have ever been built in Bournville.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournville_Village_Trust_4411.html" title="Bournville Village Trust">Bournville Village Trust</a> was set up to formally control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the estate. The trust focused on providing <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">schools</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospitals</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum.html" title="Museum">museums</a>, public baths and reading rooms. As Bournville is a conservation area, another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification.</p>
<p>An almost campus feel evolved, with a triangular village green, infant and junior schools, the School of Art and the Day Continuation School (originally intended for young Cadbury employees) and a host of events such as fêtes and <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maypole.html" title="Maypole">Maypole</a> dances.</p>
<p>The trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally. Now containing 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land with 100 acres (0.4 km²) of parks and open spaces, Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.</p>
