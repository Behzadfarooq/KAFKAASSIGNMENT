<p>The <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundary_Commission_f5e4.html" title="Boundary Commission">Boundary Commission</a> is legally required, by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 (as amended by the Boundary Commissions Act 1992), to conduct a general review of all the constituencies in England every eight to twelve years to ensure the size and composition of constituencies are as fair as possible. The Commission completed their previous general review on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">12 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, and is currently undertaking the latest, which must complete after <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_11.html" title="April 11">11 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> and before 12 April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>. The Commissionâ€™s recommendations throughout the review must by law be based on the numbers of electors on the electoral registers on that date.</p>
<p>After completion of the review, the recommendations were sent to the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Constitutional_Affairs_267c.html" title="Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs">Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">31 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. He will put them before Parliament. If Parliament approves, the new constituencies will be used in the next General Election.</p>
<p>Constituencies in Wales are also reviewed every 8-12 years by the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundary_Commission_for_Wales_8909.html" title="Boundary Commission for Wales">Boundary Commission for Wales</a>, which has completed its latest review which was laid before Parliament on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">14 December</a> 2005. Scotland saw its most recent large-scale review complete in 2004 the boundaries of which were those in use in the 2005 General Election in Scotland.</p>

</div>
<p>In <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> review areas are usually based on traditional county boundaries, with Unitary Authorities only being regarded as separate review areas in special cases. <a href="../../../y/o/r/York.html" title="York">York</a> for example has been split into two constituencies with no electoral wards from <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Yorkshire_4d9b.html" title="North Yorkshire">North Yorkshire</a>.</p>
<p>Some areas of England have been awarded extra constituencies in the review, including <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, and the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex.html" title="Essex">Essex</a> review area. Other review areas have had one constituency removed, such as <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyne_and_Wear_1c8b.html" title="Tyne and Wear">Tyne and Wear</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_d0dd.html" title="Greater London">Greater London</a> as a whole is reviewed on borough-by-borough basis and has lost two constituencies overall.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, the total number of seats is to remain at 40, although new seats have been recommended by radical redrawing of boundaries in <a href="../../../c/l/w/Clwyd.html" title="Clwyd">Clwyd</a> and <a href="../../../g/w/y/Gwynedd.html" title="Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>; <a href="../../../a/r/f/Arfon_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_3321.html" title="Arfon (UK Parliament constituency)">Arfon</a> and Dwyfor Meirionnydd could replace <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caernarfon_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_679e.html" title="Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)">Caernarfon</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meirionnydd_Nant_Conwy_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_2240.html" title="Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)">Meirionnydd Nant Conwy</a> respectively; <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberconwy_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_0276.html" title="Aberconwy (UK Parliament constituency)">Aberconwy</a> could replace <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conwy_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_28d8.html" title="Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)">Conwy</a>. Currently Welsh constituencies have on average 25,000 fewer people than their counterparts in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> Boundary Commission announced in 2006 that minor changes would take place in the east of the province to its existing constituencies.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> is the only part of the United Kingdom with no changes made to parliamentary representation.</p>
<p>These changes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be the first major changes in the composition of UK Parliamentary constituencies outside of Scotland since 1997.</p>
<p>The current list of recommended constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales is in <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituencies_in_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election_b1da.html" title="Constituencies in the next United Kingdom general election">Constituencies in the next United Kingdom general election</a></i>.</p>
<p>One consequence of boundary reviews is the notional changing of representation of some constituencies where calculations of voting intentions suggest a party other than the victor at the last general election would have been successful had the boundaries been in place.</p>
<p>Notional changes in representation as a consequence of the current boundary reviews can be summarised as below:</p>
