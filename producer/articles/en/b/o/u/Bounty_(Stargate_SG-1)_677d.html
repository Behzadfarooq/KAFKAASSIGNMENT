<p><a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameron_Mitchell_%28Stargate%29_5b88.html" title="Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)">Cameron Mitchell</a> rings into a darkened room. Moving to the cargo he slices open a bag with his knife, finding Kassa beans inside. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samantha_Carter_750d.html" title="Samantha Carter">Sam</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teal%27c.html" title="Teal'c">Teal'c</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel</a> ring into similar cargo rooms and begin setting explosives with a countdown of one minute. Sam notices a green light scanning the room. She radios the team telling them to get out. Daniel and Teal'c finish, and they all ring out, except Mitchell. He has been caught by a number of guards. A firefight ensues, pinning Mitchell.</p>
<p>Aboard a <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a> transport, piloted by <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vala_Mal_Doran_92bc.html" title="Vala Mal Doran">Vala</a>, Sam informs Mitchell that everyone else is done. Teal'c offers to help, but there is no time the explosives will detonate in less than 30 seconds. Mitchell manages to get onto the ring platform, and Sam activates it remotely from the transport. The transport flies away as the Kassa transport ship explodes. On board a <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucian_Alliance_7c85.html" title="Lucian Alliance">Lucian Alliance</a> Ha'tak, Natan the leader of the Lucian Alliance, receives the news that a third raid by <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a> has destroyed another transport. This has severely depleted the Kassa bean supply. Enraged, Natan places a bounty on SG-1.</p>
<p>Back on Earth, Vala convinces Mitchell to let her accompany him to his high school reunion in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>. Sam and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Lee_%28Stargate%29_ecb9.html" title="Bill Lee (Stargate)">Dr. Lee</a> are presenting the <i>new</i> technologies of the Chimera holographic projector (revealed in <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenant_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_bd1f.html" title="Covenant (Stargate SG-1)">Covenant</a>) and a <i>busted</i> plasma cannon at a science conference. Daniel, meanwhile, is in a museum conducting research when he encounters an attractive young woman who offers to help him with his searches, but he declines.</p>
<p>A few bounty hunters near Earth and detect only three members of SG-1 on the planet. Off-world, the <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jaffa_%28Stargate%29_c4d5.html" title="Jaffa (Stargate)">Jaffa</a> Cha'ra urges Teal'c to take a position on the Jaffa high council. They are suddenly attacked by unseen bounty hunters and Teal'c is grazed by an energy blast. Teal'c urges Cha'ra to put out word that he was gravely injured in order to lure the attackers into a trap.</p>
<p>While setting up for the reunion, Mitchell reunites with Amy Vandenberg, "the one who got away". Amy was previously mentioned in <a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripple_Effect_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_792e.html" title="Ripple Effect (Stargate SG-1)">Ripple Effect</a>. Vala is introduced to Mitchell's old friend Darrell Grimes. Elsewhere, Daniel is again accosted by the strange young woman, who now asks him if they would like to go somewhere to be alone. Daniel again declines and the woman pulls out a small <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a> energy weapon similar to the one used by a <a href="../../../z/a/t/Zatarc.html" title="Zatarc">Zatarc</a>. Daniel runs while she shoots repeatedly. Daniel exits the museum, but the woman teleports in front of him and points her weapon at a woman walking down the sidewalk with her baby. Daniel surrenders, but the woman is hit by a bus.</p>
<p>Sam, at the conference, receives a call from <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Landry_%28Stargate%29_174e.html" title="Hank Landry (Stargate)">General Landry</a> about the incident. General Landry, believing this to be an isolated incident, tells her not to worry and to stay at the conference. Mitchell's cellphone has no service and he is unable to hear General Landry's message.</p>
<p>Sam walks onto the stage to deliver her presentation and is shot by a sniper. The shot however, passes directly through her. Sam shuts off the holographic projection, and with Dr Lee's help fixes the plasma cannon. Sam walks onto the stage with the gun and shoots the sniper. The audience, believing this to be part of the presentation, applauds.</p>
<p>Back in the Jaffa village, a cloaked stranger enters the tent where Teal'c is being treated. He pulls out a knife, but is Zatted by Teal'c. Cha'ra and his men come back, astounded that the would-be assassin was Jaffa. Teal'c is not convinced. With one finger, he wipes the assassin's "tattoo" off his forehead.</p>
<p>Mitchell receives another call from General Landry, but still cannot hear him. Two bounty hunters follow him in his search for a hard-line. One is using a mimic device similar to those first seen in '<a href="../../../f/o/o/Foothold_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_2b49.html" title="Foothold (Stargate SG-1)">Foothold</a>'. The other, a human, leads the first bounty hunter into a closet and kills him, then continues to follow Mitchell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Darrell offers Vala some moonshine and takes her into an auditorium where they sit as Darrell attempts to woo her. Vala stops him, telling him that she is married.</p>
<p>Mitchell calls General Landry, but finds himself held at gunpoint. The bounty hunter takes the phone and, using a device to mimic Cam's voice, tells General Landry to send backup. He then tells Mitchell that he intends to get all of SG-1 at once.</p>
<p>Vala, coming back from the auditorium with Darrell, recognizes the bounty hunter and assumes he is after her. Mitchell, dancing with Amy, asks her to slap him and leave the auditorium, but Darrell distracts the bounty hunter so Vala can throw a fire extinguisher at him.</p>
<p>The bounty hunter pulls out a gun and fires once into the air. The crowd panics and tries to get out, but the bounty hunter has magnetically sealed the door. He threatens to shoot Amy or Darrell, but calms down upon hearing Sam saying that SG-1 will surrender as soon as the hostages are released. The bounty hunter tells Sam that the hostages will be released, but SG-1 has to come in first. Sam, Teal'c, and Daniel beam in unarmed. The bounty hunter herds SG-1 into the center of the dance floor. Rings break through the ceiling of the gym and they are all ringed aboard a transport ship sitting on top of the gym.</p>
<p>The bounty hunter is surprised to find himself held at gunpoint. Sam explains that they found the ship, and then used the holographic projection technology to create the illusion of their beaming into the gym.</p>
<p>The bounty hunter, Ventrell, tells SG-1 that stopping him will not stop the bounty hunters. Mitchell replies that Netan's followers will see this incident as a failure on Netan's part.</p>
<p>Later, On Netan's flagship, an intruder dispatches Netan's guards and enters his quarters, but is shot by Ventrell. Netan tells Ventrell he will be richly rewarded. Ventrell points his gun at Netan and says that he will be, but not for saving him.</p>
<p>Back in Kansas at the Mitchell family farm, Amy and Mitchell set things straight and share a kiss, before being interrupted by Vala. Amy agrees to visit Colorado Springs, sometime soon.</p>

<ul>
<li>SG-1 has apparently hit 3 Kassa transports over a period of several weeks, forcing the Lucian Alliance to put a bounty out for the team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Plasma weapon Dr. Lee demonstrated, codenamed the <i>X-699</i> at the conference was based on the technology <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri_characters_in_Stargate_SG-1_1366.html#Jay_Felger" title="Tau'ri characters in Stargate SG-1">Dr. Felger</a> introduced in '<a href="../../../a/v/e/Avenger_2.0_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_f336.html" title="Avenger 2.0 (Stargate SG-1)">Avenger 2.0</a>'.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Chimera Optics technology was a follow on of season 8's "<a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenant_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_bd1f.html" title="Covenant (Stargate SG-1)">Covenant</a>".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Lucian Alliance have apparently changed their Kassa transport methods since '<a href="../../../o/f/f/Off_the_Grid_98a3.html" title="Off the Grid">'Off the Grid'</a>', changing from using Stargates to "Space Trains".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When Teal'c and Cha'ra return fire at the bounty hunters sent after SG-1, Teal'c's staff weapon is firing while the almond-shaped head remains closed. It alters between open and close between shots - Teal'c point of view shots show it close, while the frontal shots show it close.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The matte painting depicting the tent in which Teal'c is recovering after the attempt on his life was reused from "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Serpent%27s_Venom_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_2232.html" title="The Serpent's Venom (Stargate SG-1)">The Serpent's Venom</a>".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One of the bounty hunters uses a "mimic device", similar to the ones seen in '<a href="../../../f/o/o/Foothold_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_2b49.html" title="Foothold (Stargate SG-1)">'Foothold'</a>' and again in '<a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_%26_Mirrors_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_8aef.html" title="Smoke &amp; Mirrors (Stargate SG-1)">'Smoke &amp; Mirrors'</a>', but considerably more compact. The biggest change is that the original version (and, presumably, the ones the SGC makes use of) used a scanner that required the subject's body to be loaded into it, while the bounty hunter had a handheld scanner which did the same thing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The fact that the high school reunion takes place in Kansas and Vala's gingham clothing early in the episode are possible Wizard of Oz references. When Cam later mentions in a garbled phone call to General Landry that he and Daisy are having fun and then looks at Vala, it could be a reference to Daisy Duke and the shorts Vala is wearing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Daniel directly references <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a> near the end of the episode when he states "And you might have got away with it if too if it wasn't for us meddling kids," a statement supposedly used by most of the 'bad guys' in the cartoon series.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A sign on the wall of Mitchell's high school has old posters of class president/secretary races on the wall. One poster says "Peter DeLuise for Class Secretary" and the other says "Damian Kindler for Class Treasurer." Peter DeLuise directed this episode and Damian Kindler wrote the script.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Odai Ventrell's <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel%27tak.html" title="Tel'tak">tel'tak</a> is armed with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_weapon.html#Staff_cannon" title="Staff weapon">Staff cannons</a>, marking the first time a tel'tak is seen carrying weaponry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is the second episode showing Mitchell's father and his mother. Both also gain names in this episode (as listed in the credits), Frank and Wendy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A plot combining bounty hunters and a high school reunion was previously seen in the film <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grosse_Pointe_Blank_d14f.html" title="Grosse Pointe Blank">Grosse Pointe Blank</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anne Marie DeLuise is the fifth DeLuise to appear in Stargate SG-1, along with David, Michael, Peter and Dom DeLuise. She is the wife of director Peter DeLuise and previously appeared in the Season 4 episode <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Other_Side_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_a301.html" title="The Other Side (Stargate SG-1)">"The Other Side"</a> as "Farrell" where she was credited as Anne Marie Loder.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The un-named female bounty hunter who traps Daniel only to get hit by a bus is played by Jody Thompson. The same actress had played Devon in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_4400.html" title="The 4400">The 4400</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
