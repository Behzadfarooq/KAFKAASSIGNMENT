	    <p>There is an occupation "doorman" that is separate from the occupation "bouncer". Hotels, office buildings, and expensive urban condos and highrises often hire someone who sits or stands near the door and helps to ensure that no one has unauthorized access to the building. Residential doormen often also accept packages, assist people with luggage, and even open the door for people entering and exiting.</p>
<p>So... can we make "bouncer" a separate article? <a href="../../../a/v/o/User%7EAvocado_d936.html" title="User:Avocado">Avocado</a> 23:06, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I utterly and completely agree. The two occupations cannot be likened together as in this article. How can you possibly say that a "doorman is a bouncer working in a hotel"? Just ridiculous. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 13:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also agree. A hotel doorman and a bar bouncer are as related as a casino security guard and a mall rent-a-cop. There needs to be two seperate entries. I added substantially more "meat" to this article before signing in - if the article is split, please retain this information under "bouncer". <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYouspeakmylanguage_abfe.html" title="User:Youspeakmylanguage">Youspeakmylanguage</a> 20:14, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I cannot disagree more than I do with the assessment nd recommendation put forward by Jacklumber and Youspeakmylanguage. Aside from a bit of strangeness which was pointed out below, the article here does a remarkable job of summing up the professional performance of bar security. The quibble about the word 'Doorman' is makes little sense when one considers that nouns can shift what they refer to based on their surrounding context. If I use the word, "car," no one objects to it's meaning both "automobile" and "a section of a passenger train. The same is true when it comes to the "bouncer/doorman" question.</p>

<p>Inside the industry in the UK the use of Bouncer is very much depreciated to the point where the SIA and BIIAB get quite upset about terms like “Bouncer” Training courses <a href="../../../m/j/w/User%7EMjwalshe_2217.html" title="User:Mjwalshe">Mjwalshe</a> 14:57, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, the SIA and BIIAB tell us that we are "door supervisors" which is just as alien a term, if not more so, than 'bouncer' in the industry. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPienamo_5f58.html" title="User:Pienamo">Pienamo</a> 23:10, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who the hell thought up this line? "Many clubs enjoy tailoring the appearance of their powerful bouncers to increase the likelyhood of you attacking one of them, at which point they will overpower and ruthlessly punish you." I've seen bouncers approach someone, and they don't try and instigate a fight at their first chance. In fact, in the only case that i've actually seen the bouncer hit someone first, it was because he was brandshing a broken bottle and threatening to attack someone. 70.113.23.254 23:41, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many people seem to have a real problem with us, but Wikipedia shouldn't be used as a soapbox. We're okay people really, most of us. Violence is the last resort, and only then if you are doing it out of defence or protecting someone else. The skill of a good bouncer lies in his or her ability to talk a situation down. It'd be nice if people were more positive about us. We may not always be a pleasure to deal with, but we're looking after everyone's safety. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPienamo_5f58.html" title="User:Pienamo">Pienamo</a> 13:11, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fully agree with User:70.113.23.254 (I wonder if he would let me just call him 'user') the line he cites is beyond ridiculous if for one practical reason that no one seems to take into consideration: bars and nightclubs can be sued for the actions of their employees. No bar-owner would retain an employee or crew of employees that he knew to be habitually violent. The Numbers fail to add up in that the cost of defending a lawsuit far outstrips the value to a bar of any security employee hired to provide security. Whatever else you may say about us (more than a decade of experience in my case) we are low-paid employees and easily replaceable. Sorokahdeen 17:31, 18 December 2006 (UTC)Sorokahdeen</p>
<p>Here in the UK the bouncer stereotype of large muscular men seems to be fairly accurate - probably more as a detterant against violence, although I have witnessed several people being phsically ejected from bars, etc for hurling verbal abuse at the bouncers. This seems to go against the "persuasive verbal techniques" mentioned in the article. Those are just my experiences though - I imagine something like that would be quite hard to find a reliable cite for. 86.16.36.41 10:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article generally lacks neutrality, claiming that bouncers "will supplement their wages by collecting "tips" from patrons in order to bypass a line or enter a club that has already reached its legal capacity". Expressing that bouncers "often prefer[…] intimidation and loud verbal threats" is also a bad thing to do in Wikipedia. I further find it peculiar that the article claims it to be normal for bouncers to call the patrons "nancy bitches". In addition, the article needs references. The article is so badly written that it probably should have been deleted. 84.48.89.77</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd have to agree. I've worked the industry for five years, and I've never collected a "tip." I've also never referred to a drunken customer as a "nancy bitch," nor have I worked with another crowd controller who has used such an insult in my presence. I've taken the liberty of removing the section regarding bouncers being payed less than police officers, soldiers and other security officers. I'm inclined to believe that pay rate depends on the employer, the nature of the work and the bar/club/venue a bouncer has been contracted to protect. Besides, I'm earning far more in security than I was earning in the Air Force. I've also added that the professional term for a "bouncer" is "crowd controller," as this is the license we must possess in Australia in order to work in this particular area of security (oh, and because "bouncer" is a label, not an occupation). If anybody disagrees with this, go ahead and change it, although it would be appreciated if you would explain why on this page. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 05:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've tried to clean up the article. It should probably be moved to Bouncer (security), Bouncer (profession) or something like that. 129.177.48.69</dd>

<p>That sounds rather original researchy to me, does anyone have a reference for this? I'm not from the UK myself, but I've never heard of bouncers "arresting" random people off the street there. That's a rather strange accusation to make without a reference to back it up. Besides that, wikipedia isn't supposed to give advice like that, I know it's in the policy somewhere, I remember reading it. I just don't remember exactly where I saw it. Still, anyway, that section really needs a reference if it's to stay in the article in its current form. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrickfoxy_aa49.html" title="User:Errickfoxy">Errick</a> 17:47, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The section in question was also very poorly written and unencyclopedic. I have replaced the paragraph with a brief summary, but unless a reference is found then this should also be removed. I have also removed all uses of "arrested", since without further explanation it is not clear what this means (A bouncer / doorman is not a policeman and does not have the power to legally arrest anyone inside or outside of the club. The suggestion that nightclubs buy land outside the club in order that their staff can attack passers-by (which of course would still be illegal) seems dubious if not ridiculous without a reference and I've also removed that. 85.210.134.104 07:39, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
