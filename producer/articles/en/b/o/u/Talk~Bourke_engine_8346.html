	    <p>Where is the reference for the claim of nitrous oxide production problems? It's very logical and "sensible" but those who build Bourke engines say that it doesn't happen. In any event, wouldn't that be primarily a result of the lean fuel-air mixture and easily remediable by running a richer mixture and trading away the assitional fuel economy in order to gain the simplicity of design?</p>
<p>New Comment</p>
<p>My understanding of nitrous oxide production in the bourke engine is that it does not happen. This is an "explosion" engine with a flame front of over 5000 ft/sec. At the time of the explosion their is peak temperature and presure and all the fuel is consumed. The short time does not allow for the production of nitrous oxides. As soon as the piston starts "shooting" down the cylinder the expanding gasses absorb the heat that is contained in the piston and the cylinder and lowering the gas temperature below that necesary for the production of this oxide. Their is no burning occuring while the piston is moving down the cylinder, only expansion which causes cooling. This leads to the low exaust temperature of around 200F degrees.</p>

<p><b>Turbocharge</b></p>
<p>Turbocharge is the correct term...and is done on the engine. Turbochargin is the compressing of air, prior to mixing with fuel in order to have more air mixing with fuel then under normal atmospheric pressure. This is done on the engine (see the piston that compresses the air, under the main piston where the air enters)</p>

<p><b>Reality Check</b></p>
<p>"Turbocharging"? Where is the turbine?</p>
<p>And that bit about the slipper bearings being "key" is not true as Bourke Cycle engines have been built by the Constant Pressure using roller bearings instead. I'm all for this engine being given attention but if unreal claims are made and latter seen to be hokum then the whole design is disregarded which I don't want to see happen. The whole "Simplified Explanation" section is a parroting of what Russell claimed without the application of critical thinking. Don't get me wrong, I think Russell was an amazing engineer but he considered many things to be very important which in reality are not so, things like: building the engine without gaskets so that heat transfer was improved, how automatic transmissions are horrible (sorry but I just haven't needed to push start my truck in... well I can't remember when I needed a push start), how the engine had unlimited RPM potential (the Constant Pressure people found that to be untrue). See I do my homework. What say you Sno2? <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBRoys_1c09.html" title="User:BRoys">BRoys</a> 04:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Roy...I do not claim to be an expert on this engine...what happened was I tried to figure out how it worked, by going to all the web pages I could find that explained the engine...I thought and still do that Bourke and those who have played with the engine would be the experts...I thought a synopsis of what I found out would be helpful here on wikopedia....I do not have any problem with adding to or changing what I wrote...as long as it makes some sort of sense &lt;grin&gt;....</p>
<p>I think a simplified explanation is needed, since by discussions I have seen on the net about this engine, they seem to show that most people who look at it do not spend any time trying to figure out how it works....with the explanation hopefully they will take a look at what is in the explanation and look at the animation and see how it works...</p>
<p>I appears that any number of engine designs have stolen from or reinvented what is in the Bourke...I do not see where anyone has really improved on his orginal design...</p>
<p>Turbocharging....The intake air is compressed, prior to being mixed with the fuel...what do you call this other then turbocharging...??...it appears to me that this is done to force more scavaging by raising the pressure of the intake charge adding to the pressure of the exaust gasses to improve scavaging and to raise the amount of the charge that is injected...it is done without a turbine, I agree, but what else should you call this...maybe unconventional turbocharging....???....I included a link to turbocharging so that people could find out what turbocharging is and what it does...</p>
<p>Rollerbearings....since I could not figure out how the slipper bearings work can not really comment on another way of doing the same thing...do not know which would be more efficient...however should a roller bearing comment be included in an explanation of the Bourke engine....??...since as designed it does not use them....??....I came across some other engines that tried using other types of bearings, that had problems with distortions of rods and scotch yokes because of the shock of the detonations...maybe the comment should be "as designed the slipper bearing is the key to the engine"....???....etc.</p>
<p>I did not say anything about the high rpm's because I could not explain it...maybe should be a comment that it has the capability of higher rpm's then a conventional otto engine...???</p>
<p>I used "latching" instead of trying to explain sine wave motion in comparison to the convention parabella motion of an piston...an ideal internal combustion engine would be a square wave engine with true latching...ideally would be a graph showing conventional piston motion along with Bourke motion...time verses piston distance traveled....along with start and stop burn time for each engine with degrees.....tried drawing one up but could not find drawing program that would do it.....think conventional burn time starts about 10 degrees before tdc and stops about 40 degrees, for total time of 50 degrees....Bourke should start at tdc and continue for about half, or less, then conventional...aprox. 25 degrees....??</p>
<p>Thank you much for your comments, was hoping someone would come along and improve what I had written. Change what you will and if I have any disagreements will comment on them and give any arguements that I may have.</p>

<b>Supercharging</b></p>
<p>Sno2 dude: it is "supercharging" not "turbocharging" if anything and it happens in most 2-cycle engine designs. I've put a bunch of attention and time into this engine design, love it and I'm very close to building one, though diesel (that is a whole 'nother story). I'll tackle the "Simplified Explination" section soon. And "Roys" is the last name, good to have you on the page.</p>

<p>BRoys...looking forward to your changes...probably will never build one of these but would like to know how it really works....&lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p>have fun....</p>

<p>The Bourke engine was built and tested and was in pre-production at one time. I believe that it is a proven engine and not a proposed design.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>And yet no performance data has been released to justify the claims made. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreglocock_2608.html" title="User:Greglocock">Greglocock</a> 23:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I seem to remember that just prior to WWII this engine was in pre production (American Motors...??)....am sure there was performance data at that time....and it must have been better then conventional otto engine, or they would not have been prepared to use...is it a proposed engine design if it was in pre-production...??...as I understand it pre-production means it has been tested and approved at one time....am sure not by todays standards as this was done in the 1930's....</p>
<p>However, now that I think about it, cannot remember where I got this info....and cannot find it on the web, or rather a good reference....so have to agree with you, it is in the right category (until I can come up with a reference..&lt;grin&gt;)...</p>
<p>thank you for your comment</p>

<p>Needs links from other pages and to other pages. Otto 2 cycle, 4 cycle, turbine...etc.....</p>
<p>Needs links to other pages of different type engines.</p>
<p>Do not know how to do this.</p>
