<p>Douglasnicol: please do not merge Bourtreehill with Irvine. The whole point of a clickable encyclopedia is that each feature can have a page of its own. Bourtreehill should remain a clickable link on the irvine page. The political union of Bourtreehill and Irvine is relatively young and as you have seen, Bourtreehill was an independant Barony and as such merits its own entry. As do stanecastle, girdle-toll, perceton, dreghorn and lawthorn. All of which are now part of Irvine.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough, it was a suggestion when the entry was quite young. Maybe what should be done is a revision of the Bourtreehill entry, multi headings, starting with the history of the area and what it entails. Then mention the housing scheme in a section something like "Bourtreehill in Modern Times" in the same page. You get the idea? That would satisfy both the local historian and those interested in the present housing scheme. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglasnicol_6f3f.html" title="User:Douglasnicol">Douglasnicol</a> 17:04, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Merging the Bourtreehill entries would be superb. A modern section and old together, all under the subheading of Bourtreehill.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry folks, I am new and have just noticed this very active discussion. I am a local historian from Bourtreehill, who felt quite unhappy with the pre-occupation with modern Bourtreehill. The suggestion that it had problems since its inception was just something I had to correct.</p>
<p>I did not remove Shona's section (at least I don't believe I did) and as she was a friend of my mother, i would also appreciate a return of that section.</p>
<p>Medieval Bourtreehill is a magical world of research and I represent a fledgling organisation founded to help protect the history of Bourtreehill and its neighbours. All that is required for membership is a love for Bourtreehill's history and a desire to promulgate it to the younger and less aware generation of Bourtreehillian. The membership is purely 'speculative' so to speak in that members simply have to read and submit information for public display on [<a href="http://www.geocities.com/thebourtreehillian/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/thebourtreehillian/index.html" rel="nofollow">TheBourtreehillian</a>] website.</p>
<p>I am currently living in Germany, but spend around 7 months of the year back home writing. My wife and I are due to move back in a year or two after our researches are finished.</p>
<p>I do have a suggestion for the merging of articles. Bourtreehill House is not the correct title for my article. The original estate is called Bourtreehill and was still called this in the early 1960s, long before the housing estates outside were built. But, the housing estates do have the same name. I suggest we merge the old with the modern under the one heading of Bourtreehill. Bourtreehill House may be given its own article some other time.</p>
<p>I am sorry to be stepping on folks toes but I have been working towards the preservation and propogation of Bourtreehill for most of my life. Its history is incredibly neglected. Distrubingly so.</p>
<p>I mean...The Beatles/Bourtreehill? (and this one is just a silly example we use to catch the attention of young B'Hillians)</p>
<p>For the older ones we have: Robert Burns, Mosley and King Robert II.</p>
<p>There is soooo very much to know about this estate and my organisation has collected some wonderful references covering the last 700 years of activity.</p>
<p>I apologise for barging in on this article. It was my first and I had no idea that it was subject to such an active debate.</p>
<p>I am delighted about that last fact. Wonderful!!</p>
<p>P.S Although TheBourtreehillian website is oriented towards B'Hill, the history of its sister villages and estates will be the subject of future displays of information.</p>

<li>I remember very clearly the shock and disbelief at what had happened in our community,so thats why I felt it was necessary to add the link and to provide a useful link to anyone after all these years who has information to help with the invesigation to come forward and contact the police.I used to go to the ruins as we used to call them alot when i younger,so it is very interesting to discover the history of bourtreehill which I have always thought about.Thanks for the history-I think it would be good to merge the recent Bourtreehill with the old.---<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesBronson18_5ecc.html" title="User:CharlesBronson18">CharlesBronson18</a> 01:28, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This may be just my opinion, but shouldn't this really be merged with the main Irvine entry? <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglasnicol_6f3f.html" title="User:Douglasnicol">Douglasnicol</a> 17:59, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But Im new to this thing,so didnt want to mess up the irvine page. <small>(The first thing a newbie should learn it to sign talk page comments with ~~~~.)</small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>In general Wikipedia is quite expansive on place name articles. I am sure that this does not need to be merged. <b>But</b> it does need to decide whether it is about <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourtreehill.html" title="Bourtreehill">Bourtreehill</a>, North Bourtreehill, Bourtreehill South, South Bourtreehill, etc. I suggest one article with redirects from the other titles. Note also a newly arrived article <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourtreehill_House_1f24.html" title="Bourtreehill House">Bourtreehill House</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 18:56, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd><small>Well perhaps we need to clear something up, Bourtreehill housing estate was generally known just as Bourtreehill, though in your postal address you could differentiate, but common usage seems to just refer to Bourtreehill (and Broomlands). <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglasnicol_6f3f.html" title="User:Douglasnicol">Douglasnicol</a> 20:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>I lived in Bourtreehill South, near Heatherstane way, and it was regarded as part of Irvine New Town, not just the Northern part. Indeed Springside was also regarded as part of the New Town. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglasnicol_6f3f.html" title="User:Douglasnicol">Douglasnicol</a> 13:00, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
