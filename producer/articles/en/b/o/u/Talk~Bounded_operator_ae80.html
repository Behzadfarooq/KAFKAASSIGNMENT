<p>I think you are making a mistake here. An operator which is defined on its domain is not necessarily bounded on that domain. It is essential that the <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i></span> in the estimate must be independent of the <span class="texhtml"><i>v</i></span>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you refer to the first paragraph? In the inequality there, I think it was clear that <i>M</i> is independent of <i>v</i>. I also made a small change for clarification. I wonder what you think.

<p>At the moment this page deals with continuous linear operators between <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normed_vector_space.html" title="Normed vector space">normed vector spaces</a> which are exactly the bounder linear operators. This is not true in general and continuous linear operators between <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topological_vector_space.html" title="Topological vector space">topological vector spaces</a> need not be bounded. Continuous linear map redirects here so either we create a new article <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuous_linear_operator.html" title="Continuous linear operator">continuous linear operator</a> or we rename this article to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuous_linear_operator.html" title="Continuous linear operator">continuous linear operator</a> and rewrite the content. I would prefer the second option and treat bounded linear operator as a special case of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuous_linear_operator.html" title="Continuous linear operator">continuous linear operator</a> but this might increase the abstractness of the article.

<dd>Well, I am not a physicist (an applied mathematician if you wish). My own opinion, is that this article should not become more general and more abstract. I have some grasp on linear topological spaces and all those exotic definitions of bornologic things and stuff, but I always thought those were very abstract beasts hard to get an intuition on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would rather suggest a new article be created, called say continuous operators in topological vector spaces or so. This because, as you yourself mentioned, things can become quite subtle in such a space, and, I think many exotic things can happen which do not happen in a normed space. In that new article all the fine details can be tackled, while <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_operator.html" title="Bounded operator">bounded operator</a> would stay the way it is, discussing the much simpler and the much more widespread case of normed spaces.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's just an opinion. Even though I wrote a good chunk of this article, I will not mind if it is decided to have it rewritten. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 15:26, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I am currently working on topological vector space articles and I need some place to talk about the morphisms (linear continuous operators) between those spaces.

<p>Whatever is decided about the page and whether the focus is on topological vector spaces, the statement in the article that "A linear operator is bounded if and only if it is continuous" is wrong, unless you qualify it correctly (e.g. it's true in a normed space, I think). <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELavaka_cc2d.html" title="User:Lavaka">Lavaka</a> 06:11, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A reader emailed the following comments to Wikipedia. Please review and correct the article, as appropriate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think there is a mistake in the article at <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_operator.html" title="Bounded operator">Bounded operator</a>. It is claimed there, in the fourth example, that "if a linear operator L has as domain and range Banach spaces, then it will be bounded". This is false, as shows the following (quasi-explicit) example: consider l^2, the vector space of square summable sequences <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/e/6/fe6b0ab5e412faaa6b58998ed6c9531d.png" alt="(u_n)_{n\in\mathcal{N}}" /> (of real numbers); it has a natural scalar product which makes it a Hilbert space, and a natural Hilbert basis (the canonical basis <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/5/d/35de4b2ac0e7ce5ea57033243f0b6875.png" alt="(e^k)_{k\in\mathcal{N}}" />, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/b/9/cb97ae4374184ab078f905af21f99c23.png" alt="e^k_n = 0" /> if n is different from k, 1 if n=k). The axiom of choice allow to consider an algebraic basis of <span class="texhtml"><i>l</i><sup>2</sup></span> containing <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/5/d/35de4b2ac0e7ce5ea57033243f0b6875.png" alt="(e^k)_{k\in\mathcal{N}}" />. Now, the linear map A from <span class="texhtml"><i>l</i><sup>2</sup></span> to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/3/1/131ce5f8ec4744bd9a86d87cefda1d11.png" alt="\mathcal{R}" /> which sends <span class="texhtml"><i>e</i><sup><i>k</i></sup></span> to <span class="texhtml"><i>k</i> + 1</span> and sends other elements of the basis to zero is well-defined, linear, one-to-one from <span class="texhtml"><i>l</i><sup>2</sup></span> to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/3/1/131ce5f8ec4744bd9a86d87cefda1d11.png" alt="\mathcal{R}" />, but not continuous.</p>
<p>I suppose that the mistake of the author comes from Banach's theorem, which asserts "any linear one-to-one continuous map from a Banach space to another has continuous inverse".</p>
<hr />
<p>Let me add an erratum to my previous mail. In the end of the counter-example I gave, don't read "the linear map A from <span class="texhtml"><i>l</i><sup>2</sup></span> to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/3/1/131ce5f8ec4744bd9a86d87cefda1d11.png" alt="\mathcal{R}" /> which sends <span class="texhtml"><i>e</i><sup><i>k</i></sup></span> to <span class="texhtml"><i>k</i> + 1</span> and sends other elements of the basis to zero is well-defined, linear, one-to-one from <span class="texhtml"><i>l</i><sup>2</sup></span> to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/3/1/131ce5f8ec4744bd9a86d87cefda1d11.png" alt="\mathcal{R}" />, but not continuous", but replace "one-to-one" with "onto" --I think this is now a correct counter-example.</p>

<p>The map is rather well defined I think.

<p>Hi Taku. I am really not sure that the proof of equivalence of bounded operators and continuous operators belongs in the very introduction to that article. Actually, I would argue that it does not belong anywhere in the article, except maybe at the bottom, as it obstructs the flow of the article. So I think it is good that you removed that. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 05:06, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know why the proof is not important. It's not that trivial for those who haven't studied it, and that a bounded operator is continuous and vice versa is an important fact if it is not surprising. Besides giving some proof is the best way to show that the continuity at one point is the sufficient condition, which in my opinion should be mentioned. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 05:46, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, Oleg, for nicking this task away. By the way, I agree that the proof should be included because "bounded <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/6/c/66c71a989b24a9eae7158be73e2b45cd.png" alt="\iff" /> continuous" is such an important equivalence. I removed the sentence

<dd>"In general, a linear operator <i>L</i> is continuous everywhere if and only if <i>L</i> is continuous at some point <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sub>0</sub></span>. For if <i>L</i> is continuous at <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sub>0</sub></span>, then <i>L</i> is continuous at 0 since <span class="texhtml"><i>L</i>(<i>x</i> + <i>h</i>) − <i>L</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>L</i>(<i>h</i>)</span>.

<dd>I thought that the exposition was not nicely put too. But again I think the article needs to cover more elementary facts related to continuity. I was going to check but I think we can show the continuity is actually uniform continuity. Those basic facts. I also think the article can use an exposition from the point of view of a neighborhood. That is, more topological approach. That can help clarify the concepts.

<p>A minor typographical proposal. Can we use the letter A to denote a linear operator in the article as par <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operator_norm.html" title="Operator norm">operator norm</a>. I also think A is more common than L.

The introduction I think should be a simple as possible, and the point of the two original short sentences was to</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it clear that bounded operator ≠ bounded function</li>
<li>linear bounded operator is the same as linear continuous operator</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't see how the new concept of Lipschitz continuity helps with that; the reader may not even know what that is, and I think it distracts from the point the intro is trying to make.

<dd>The reason I made the change is this: the article currently states that the continuity is a consequence of the linearity of the bounded locally bounded function. This is not correct, or at least it's misleading. When one recognizes that the boundedness condition is simply a strong continuity condition, then continuity is automatic. Now, if you want to keep the intro as simple as possible, why is there this stuff about locally bounded functions? I consider locally boundedness more obscure than Lipschitz which seems somewhat common to me. Maybe you want to mention local boundedness so that the name bounded doesn't confuse people. I want to mention Lipschitz so that continuity seems natural. But I could be persuaded to move it down the article. You're not arguing for complete noninclusion, are you? -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 04:06, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Verbatim, the article used to say:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A consequence of the linearity property is that a linear operator is bounded if and only if it is continuous.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It says just that, <i>a linear operator is bounded if and only if it is continuous</i>. Now I removed the words "A consequence of the linearity property", so I think it is more clear.</p>
<p>Yeah, including something about Lipschitz further down may be good, although I don't see why you would do that. Maybe except if you wish to provide a complete proof of linearity+local boundedness= linearity + continuity. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 04:24, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's a nice thing to include, but I agree with Oleg that it is not as important as local boundedness. Local boundedness needs to be mentioned early on because it answers the question "why is it called bounded if it is not bounded as a function?" I added a sentence on Lipschitz continuity further down. I'm not quite happy with the location though. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 05:46, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was reading the discussion above about the apparently erroneous statement that all linear operators between Banach spaces are bounded. After all my recent work with <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discontinuous_linear_map.html" title="Discontinuous linear map">discontinuous linear map</a>, I feel I understand these sorts of questions better; clearly the statement is wrong if we assume AC, and it appears to do so, since the Baire category theorem uses AC. So this isn't a constructivism issue. The material was originally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operator_norm&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1965136" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operator_norm&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1965136" rel="nofollow">added</a> to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operator_norm.html" title="Operator norm">operator norm</a> by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a>. I'd be pleased if we could fix his work and find a home for it. In particular, this notion of "condensing singularities" sounds fun to me. Now, as for what he was going for with this, the closest I could find is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform_boundedness_theorem.html" title="Uniform boundedness theorem">uniform boundedness theorem</a>, which relies on the <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baire_category_theorem.html" title="Baire category theorem">Baire category theorem</a>, and says that a family of maps is pointwise bounded if and only if the family is uniformly bounded. For a single map, I guess this says that a map is bounded if and only if it's bounded, so this isn't what he was going for. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 11:34, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At that point I was probably trying to reconstruct something that appears in one of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halmos.html" title="Halmos">Halmos</a> books, for which you need to find another Halmos book to get the proof.
