<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundary_%28cricket%29.html" title="Edit section: Edge of the field">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Edge of the field</span></h2>
<p>The <b>boundary</b> is the edge of the playing field, or the physical object marking the edge of the field, such as a rope or fence. If the physical object is moved during play (such as by a fielder sliding into the rope) the boundary is considered to remain at the point where that object first stood.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_ball.html" title="Cricket ball">cricket ball</a> is inside the boundary, it is in play. When the ball is touching the boundary, beyond the boundary, or being touched by a <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fielding_positions_in_cricket.html" title="Fielding positions in cricket">fielder</a> who is himself either touching or beyond the boundary, it is out of play and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_%28cricket%29.html" title="Batting (cricket)">batting</a> side usually scores 4 or 6 runs for hitting the ball out of play. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball often flick the ball back in to the field of play rather than pick it up directly, and then return to the field to pick it up after having slid into the boundary.</p>
<p><a name="Fours_and_Sixes" id="Fours_and_Sixes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundary_%28cricket%29.html" title="Edit section: Fours and Sixes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fours and Sixes</span></h2>
<p>A <b>boundary</b> is also the scoring of four or six <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28cricket%29.html" title="Run (cricket)">runs</a> from a single delivery by the ball reaching the boundary of the field. These events are known as a <b>four</b> or a <b>six</b> respectively, and can be considered analogous to a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a>.</p>
<p>Four runs are scored if the ball bounces before touching or going over the edge of the field and six runs if it does not bounce. When this happens the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsman.html" title="Batsman">batsman</a> does not have to run, the runs are automatically added to his and his team's score and the ball becomes <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_ball_%28cricket%29.html" title="Dead ball (cricket)">dead</a>. If the ball did not touch the bat or a hand holding the bat, four runs are scored as the relevant type of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra_%28cricket%29.html" title="Extra (cricket)">extra</a> instead; but six runs cannot be scored as extras, even if the ball clears the boundary (which would be highly unlikely anyway).</p>
<p>Four runs can also be scored by hitting the ball into the outfield and running between the <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicket.html" title="Wicket">wickets</a> four times, although this is rare as there is usually not enough time to do so before a fielder returns the ball. This is referred to as an 'all run four' and is not considered a boundary. It is theoretically possible to score five (or more) runs in this way, but this is extremely rare and would usually require <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overthrow_%28cricket%29.html" title="Overthrow (cricket)">overthrows</a> by the fielding team.</p>
<p>Four runs can also be scored as overthrows, if a fielder gathers the ball and then throws it so that no other fielder can gather it before it reaches the boundary. In this case, the batsman who hit the ball scores however many runs the batsmen had run up to that time, plus four additional runs. If the ball has not come off the bat or hand holding the bat, then the runs are classified as 'extras' and are added to the team's score but not to the score of any individual batsman.</p>
<p>The scoring of a four or six is a significant event, often achieved by a display of skill by the batsman, and is usually greeted by a round of applause from the spectators. Fours can also be scored accidentally as the bowler achieves an edge off the bat, but no fielder is able to catch or gather the ball as it runs to the boundary behind the batsman.</p>
<p>A deliberate four is often scored using an aggressive, attacking stroke of the bat. It signals that the batsman is in an attacking mode, and most often occurs when the batsman has played himself in and the bowlers have begun to tire. As such, the ratio of fours to runs scored by running often rises the longer a batsman bats in one innings.</p>
<p>Bowlers, for their part, sometimes encourage batsmen to attempt to hit fours and sixes by bowling deliveries slightly wider of the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Off_side.html" title="Off side">off</a> <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stump_%28cricket%29.html" title="Stump (cricket)">stump</a> than would normally be considered a good line, because a batsman who is batting aggressively and trying to hit fours is more likely to make a mistake and get out.</p>
<p>Fours are not uncommon, and usually something in the range of 10 to 100 fours will be scored in the course of a cricket match. Sixes are relatively uncommon, and usually fewer than 10, and maybe none , will be scored in the course of a match (especially in a <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">test match</a>).</p>
