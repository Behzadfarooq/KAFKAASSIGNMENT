<dd>Great idea. I'd probably like to participate myself. One does wonder, though, what might happen if corporations or other organizations start posting large bounties. Would they be dictating our content in some way, even if the output was NPOV?

<dd>Well, a corporation could also pay people to write POV articles and then "vote" that the articles aren't POV. So I'm willing to try this out, and see what happens.

<p>These are questions and comments about the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html#Forgotten_biographies" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">Forgotten biographies bounty</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Who determines what articles qualify? There may be disputes about whether a bio has been written if, for instance, it's a 2-page magazine article bio or something. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 13:22, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I determine which articles qualify, of course. I'm only counting book biographies.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 13:26, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If a book was first printed prior to 1950 but reprinted with little or no changes to the actual text, are they still eligible?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The idea is that it's been ignored by modern scholarship.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 15:33, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Question: It seems to me that to write a FA-able article on a fellow who has been utterly ignored for ~55 years, one would need original research (since if there was a sufficient literature that one could write an FA-able, it is extremely unlikely that they would have been completely ignored in that long a time period.) For clarity's sake, who would qualify <i>vis-a-vis</i> the time limits, and would be FA-able without original research? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 05:01, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Many, many people would qualify. A couple may have qualified already: <a href="../../../s/v/e/Sverre_of_Norway_abcf.html" title="Sverre of Norway">Sverre of Norway</a> seems a likely candidate. The only requirement is that there hasn't been an English-language biography written about them recently. There are many older sources available and many non-English sources, and there are many lives chronicled in bits and pieces in contemporary literature that haven't had a biography written on them in many decades, if at all. Here's a suggestion: find interesting people mentioned in old books and newspapers that you've never heard of before. Has anyone recently written a biography of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordecai_Manuel_Noah_2b26.html" title="Mordecai Manuel Noah">Mordecai Manuel Noah</a>, who had a plan to found a Jewish utopia in Upstate New York? Probably not, but there's plenty of available research material. The idea is to drive more people back to primary and secondary sources to find lives that have fallen out of our historic consciousness. --<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 05:49, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Indeed, there never has been a book-length biography of <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felice_Beato_f931.html" title="Felice Beato">Felice Beato</a> in any language. A small number of monographs have been published on his work but apart from the (excellent) chapter-length chronology of Beato in John Clark's "Japanese Exchanges in Art" I believe this Wikipedia article is the first and most complete consolidation of the latest information regarding Felice Beato's life. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 19:51, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The FA requirement is pretty tough; if we could expand possible criteria to de-stub and make it good enough no templates like NPOV or WIKIFY or anything need to be added, or possibly upgrade an article to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">Good Article</a> status- these criteria would let me participate much more fully.

<dd>Hm.

<p>I just heard of this. This sounds <i>highly</i> problematic; I would say objectionable. Offering money (even if the money is to be given to a charity) for doing things on wikipedia is a very bad idea. It will distort the wikipedia process. Say someone (let's exaggerate here) offers $50 million if an article makes FA status. Don't people think this will lead to a distortion of FA procedure? This is one of the reasons wikipedia does not make use of "affiliate" links for amazon.com or whatever when referring to books. Any hint of pay-for-play (pay-for-coverage) is a bad, bad idea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, say a company offers $50 for users to bring an article about their company to FA status? Let's just say for the sake of argument it's a company that wikipedia generally has a nice article on, like, say, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a>. I think we can all agree that there is something somewhat not-OK with that scenario. Even if the article is totally NPOV and a wonderful example of wikipedia's work, really what's happened is that a company has "bought" themselves a place on the front page for a day (and possibly quite cheap!)</p>
<p>Look, I'm not saying wikipedia is fool-proof without bounties, and totally messed-up with. I applaud charity, and the idea behind it. But it seems to be a very flawed idea. That I think maybe you folks should rethink?</p>
<p>In what way is this "bounty board" official wikipedia policy? Was it discussed by anybody? --<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 10:51, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm -- there also appears to be a bounty that puts conditions on the content (the "free images only" bounty.) While I sort of "agree", this is even more problematic, since it is an attempt to use money to influence the nature and content of the article (i.e., which images are included.) Again, to take a thought experiment, say there is a very appropriate image available only under "Fair Use" (e.g., of a recent historical event); this "bounty" would distort the goal of an editor trying to make the best possible article. Again, imagine if someone didn't like creative commons, and offered a bounty for articles that do not use creative commons images? --<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 11:08, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally -- here are a few suggestions for things I think would be important to include (I am not sure what the rules are on "project pages", and in general, I think people can do sort of whatever -- I'm not going to cause an "official" fuss.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Make clear that only bounties that have no "content restrictions" are allowed. <i>i.e.</i>, the bounty can not specify anything about the article except its title.</li>
<li>Perhaps restrict the allowable categories a bounty might be offered for. For example, do not allow bounties for pages that describe commerically available products, or for companies.</li>
<li>Reject "bias" bounties: <i>i.e.</i>, bounties that refer to articles on only "one side" of a debate. For example, reject a bounty that funds political candidate "A"'s article, but not candidate "B" (where A and B are in the same race.)</li>
<li>Have a "FA process" exemption: the bounty is not payable if the FA process is distorted, perhaps this can be specified by a negative ruling by an arbitration committee. If an article makes FA, there is a one week waiting period during which the bounty is held in escrow to see if any ArbCom complaints are made.</li>
<li>Have a statement about counting "<a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>". Presumably, bounties are going to be for articles that people who are able to pay bounties are interested in. This will make systemic bias in wikipedia worse. Actively solicit bounties for topics outside the First World.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think these will solve all the problems, but they would be a very good idea. A general "ethics" statement would be important. Again, just because the money goes to charity does not make it "clean"; many people do dirty things to make money, and then give most of it away&#160;:).</p>
<p>I promise you a number of groups really want their group to be featured as an FA, and will go to lengths to get there. <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a> is an example (I was involved with their peer review.) Their FA was denied, but they really made a solid push for it, in ways I think tried to subvert the process. Wikipedia is not a "small" place any more, and PR firms pay a lot of attention (in the OD case, it was the London office of the group.) --<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 11:26, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These are all reasonable objections, but I think the benefits outweigh the risks. I asked Jimbo Wales and a dozen or so long-time Wikipedians what they thought. Some asked tough questions, as you can see above, but eventually everyone who commented was supportive of the idea. When it appeared the Wikipedia community as a whole approved, I started the project, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to address some of your objections. Even without the Bounty Board, PepsiCo could hire 50 authors to improve the <a href="../../../p/e/p/PepsiCo_a4ba.html" title="PepsiCo">PepsiCo</a> article and make it "featured". But I'm not sure that this would be so terrible. If the content they added was POV, it would get removed or changed to make it NPOV. And if the content was NPOV, well, this helps Wikipedia. I wouldn't like the precident it set, but Wikipedia can't control what PepsiCo decides to do.</dd>
<dd>With the Bounty Board, PepsiCo could put up a large bounty for <a href="../../../p/e/p/PepsiCo_a4ba.html" title="PepsiCo">PepsiCo</a>, but it would be risky for them. After all, there are certainly negative things in PepsiCo's history that they would rather not be brought to light, and a featured article would have to cover those. It would certainly be a delicate situation - but even without the bounty board, PepsiCo could simply announce that they will donate $1,000,000 to Wikipedia if PepsiCo becomes a featured article. I'm not sure how Wikipedia would respond to this - but Wikipedia couldn't stop some user from improving the PepsiCo article to make it featured (nor should they), so all they could do is refuse to accept the money.</dd>
<dd>I don't think any of this will happen. But if it does, I'm certainly willing to revisit the Bounty Board concept and alter it or scrap it if need be. Why don't we wait and see if it becomes a problem? – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 12:42, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your response, Quadell -- it's wikipedia, so we're all a bunch of squeaky wheels. I am reassured by the fact that you talked directly to Jimbo and some old hands, who presumably have an excellent sense of the complexities of these things.</dd>
<dd>I am in favor of your suggestion of letting it run for awhile and seeing what happens. Certaintly, people could do this outside the wikipedia space anyway! Something about it being more "officially" part of wikipedia still bothers me, though, and personally, I'd like it if some of the ethical issues could be raised on the main project page itself in some sort of official manner. However, I certaintly trust you and others to keep a "eye" on things, and it seems that you are aware of the possible (and remote, I'll definitely add) ethical risks involved, so if something a bit "untoward" was going on you'd make a sort of executive decision not to feature the bounty on the project page.</dd>

<p>I like this page. One comment, however. I don't think that it's necessarily "contrary to the wiki philosophy" to have someone paid to edit Wikipedia articles. If an editor was paid, it could certainly influence his actions on Wikipedia, but much less so than strongly held convictions about, say, religion or politics, and we already handle such editors quite easily. If one editor wants to pay another editor to do a task, then that's up to them. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:18, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't seen any evidence that my bounties would be seen as controversial -- could you point to any discussions which show this? I think that bounties for individuals should be tried out, and the "Bounty Board" seems like the logical place to do that. Why does paying authors "set a really bad precedent"?</dd>
<dd>You mention that you'd prefer if this page be used only for a very specific type of bounties -- bounties for featured article status, which are paid to the foundation. I think that the page name (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_Board_56c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty Board">Wikipedia:Bounty Board</a>) is more general than that. We could put a page at "Bounty Board" that linked to several different subpages (Wikipedia:Development bounties, Wikipedia:Featured Article bounties paid to the foundation), but with the relatively small number of bounties at this point, doesn't it make more sense to have them all on the same page? --<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 21:13, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that there would be more than a few people made uncomfortable by the idea of directly paying editors. It's not so much the idea that this practice would necessarily lead to "corruption" and POV-pushing, but rather that the concept would seem to go against the "ethos" of Wikipedia which is highly-valued around here, and is one thing which sets Wikipedia apart from its wannabe imitators. Although WP is not an exercise in purposeful altruism, many regular contributors do see it almost as a kind of "public service", and bringing financial reward into the equation lends itself at least to the perception that WP is not the open institution it holds itself up to be. WP's success to date has amply demonstrated that the accolades and respect of one's peers is more than sufficient motivation for making good edits. Specific incentive schemes to address otherwise-neglected areas such as the original concept of donations to the Foundation are all well and good, as the community as a whole benefits; however, if the benefit is targeted at the individual, it becomes more problematic. The day that WP mirrors commercial enterprises, or starts charging admission (either directly or via adverts), restricts its open-access policy, or otherwise becomes (or is even seen to become) more enamoured of its own interests and open to exploitation, is the day that many valued contributors will walk away- IMO. I'm not saying that the proposal for direct editor reward here is necessarily so catastrophic, and like all things in WP there are bound to be widely-divergent views on the issue- I just think it would be wise to consider more carefully.</dd>
<dd>For example- have you thought how you would handle disputes in a case where more than one editor claimed substantial edits on an article for which a direct-reward bounty had been offered? How would you decide who "deserves" to be paid where this is contested? All sorts of ugly scenarios would seem to be possible. --<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 23:09, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thing is that we're having <b>individuals</b> directly pay editors. That's something that I can easily do without this page, and that doesn't violate any rules or guidelines. I could set up a bounty system on my talk page, or pay people that I know in real life. Since it's something that's currently allowed, and it's a type of bounty, it seems silly to do it somewhere that's not the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_Board_56c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty Board">Wikipedia:Bounty Board</a>. A rule that someone who's donating a bounty can't vote in the Featured Article discussion is something that I've been thinking about recently; would that solve some of the ethical problems? --<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 19:20, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, I've removed the section again pending further discussion. We need to work out the details first- if two or more editors work on a bounty, who gets the money? I personally agree with cjllw that allowing bounties to be paid to individuals is dangerous- and there is no cosensus to allow them (Tally is 3v2 I think). I would suggest taking up an RFC on the issue to get community opinion- regrettably too few ppl visit the bounty board to really determine a cosensus. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_1bc2.html" title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 19:54, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thing is, you could easily run bounties from user space, or off an external web page. You can't really forbid bounties paid directly to users, because it's an arrangement between two people. Of course, there are some potential problems that might arise that are unique to bounty-motivated editing. Nothing we can't handle, but it would be best if we had an official place where people could keep an eye on it (i.e. here), rather than forcing it out of view where people can't keep an eye on it. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:21, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that view is still your personal view, and I and others don't share it. I would even argue that to forbid paying editors goes against the purpose of Wikipedia, because it goes against the creation of a free encyclopedia. Volunteer editing has been, and always will be, the norm on Wikipedia, but, as far as I'm aware, "doing it for free" has never been a core principle.

<dd>On this talk page, at least cosensus (ie, everyone except you and credeiki) seems to indicate opposition to the idea. The "sample space" here is too small however, and I think starting a RFC survey to gauge community sentiments about the idea would be good. If indeed they think paying editors is OK, then it's OK. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_1bc2.html" title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 18:15, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for the record, as somebody who's actually both posted a bounty, and worked on one... I side with Quaddell. I am against the idea of paying editors, even more so against it appearing on this page.

<p>I've tried breaking the article into sections, and putting different types of bounties into each section. This should hopefully defuse some of the problems with my previous bounties, which didn't meet the criteria listed at the top of the page. If we eventually want to split the Bounty Board into separate pages for different types of bounties, that would seem quite reasonable to me, but at the moment it seems rather silly, given the small number of bounties. Is this a more acceptable solution to people? I'm certainly happy to talk about some of the logistical issues in the individual-pay bounties with people; I've tried to make the judgment criteria a little more specific in this version, so I hope that it's a little better. --<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 19:07, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>May I suggest that a condition forced on all bounty offers is that donating to the Foundation is <i>always</i> an option? That way, if work is manufactured, but the conditions are nevertheless technically met (so the offerer can't actually decline to pay like they would prefer), the offerer always has the option of balking the make-worker editer, and giving it to the foundation; a safeguard, in other words, since presumably donating to the foundation is not a distasteful proposition. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 19:01, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It occurs to me that stacking bounties, one bounty being sponsored by many small pledges, could be a valuable fundraising tool.

<dd>Ya dudes, this is totally cool with me, and will definitely get things done faster than donations to Wikimedia Foundation, and that'll get more donations in the long run because people will be impressed at the good article they found that someone was paid to write, and want to support the creation and hosting and everything else of similar articles, and maybe they'll even want to join the project. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECookiecaper_cd84.html" title="User:Cookiecaper">cooki</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECookiecaper_cd84.html" title="User:Cookiecaper">caper</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECookiecaper_c7b0.html" title="User talk:Cookiecaper">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cookiecaper_bade.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cookiecaper">contribs</a>) 20:20, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am dubious about even donating for particular articles or edting actions, but if paying individual editors for articles is supported by this page, or by any page on wikipedia (including in userspace) and I becoeme aware of it, i will put that page up for deletion at <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMfD_481c.html" title="WP:MfD">WP:MfD</a>.

<p>I was wondering if, later on, other images can be exchanged for FA's, like they do over at DE? Items can include CD's, a latte, photos being sent to the Commons taken by the person who offered the bounty, etc. BTW, great scheme, been waiting for this for a while. --<a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a></sup> 11:59, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mm. I don't see why not, but some of those are not particularly easy, and rather subjective- how would you improve an image to FP-status, or put up a bounty for one?

<dd>Well, one of many things, an example: write an FA on a musical style, act, genre or "Music of CountyX" and you get a CD of your choice, and the one who offers the bounty pays for it (they work out terms off-site). Or, they can do this: create an FA about X subject and I will take photos of "whatever" and put them on the Commons. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a></sup> 03:07, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I see what you are getting at- you are suggesting we allow non-monetary methods of payment, such as payment in kind or service.

<p>I see there were concerns about this page when it was created, but am I the only person who sees this as worsening the existing problem that led to the creation of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>?

<p>On September 3rd 2006, the bounty for <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddle_Creek_Corporation_fb42.html" title="Saddle Creek Corporation">Saddle Creek Corporation</a> will expire. However, if it is at that time deemed to be a non-stubbed article, half the bounty (US$15) will still be paid.
