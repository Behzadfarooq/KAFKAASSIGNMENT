<dd>The article is insanely bloated with needless trivia and minor events. I felt like I was being generous with what was left in, it probably needs pruning beyond its current state. Do you honestly think a two second shot of a church in Boulder in About Schmidt is encyclopedia worthy? And the address of the house used for exterior shots on Mork &amp; Mindy? Or precisely which minor celebrity attends a minor conference? Give me a break.

I could name a half dozen weekly frat parties and a weekly poker game that draw more participants, but these aren't encyclopedic either. Fringe events shouldn't be in, it's not culturally relevant at all unlike Kinetics or the Bolder Boulder. --Junky 19:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>That's just your opinion, and there may be more people like me who didn't know about Happy Thursday until reading about it in Wikipedia. It's part of Boulder's culture, and who are you to say what events are too insignificant to share with the world? I don't mind you pruning the movie and TV crap, but it sounds like you have an overly zealous view of what's important that many don't agree with.

<p>Edited the Transportation section to correct errors about bus system.</p>
<p>Dash, Skip, Jump, Stampede, and Bound are all owned by RTD and operated by First Transit. The original entry had included several of these routes with the Hop as being operated by Go Boulder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regardless, those routes are an important and integral part of Boulder transportation, and are very popular and prominent. I've put them back in, but left their managerial details unspoken-for. Feel free to add details about who operates/owns them but do not remove them.

<ul>
<li>I know this isn't vital information to get right, but technically, the RTD now partly funds the Hop, and the University of Colorado Student Union has long been a financial partner in it. In fact, they apparently pay for all of the Night Hop service <a href="http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/goboulder/html/transit/hop/hop_fact_sheet.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/goboulder/html/transit/hop/hop_fact_sheet.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which explains its existence as late night buses never serve enough people to get tax money. Also, I know the Bolt is operated by RTD, but the other routes are not. So somehow we need to word this more generally because each bus route was a totally seperate creation and negotiation, with financing and operation varying accordingly. --<a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> | <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder">Talk</a> 18:07, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I originally added the statement about GO Boulder's management and funding, which I based on information I got from the bus driver. To clarify regarding the Hop and GO Boulder's lack of commercial advertising, I emailed the city and here's what I got:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From: Cris Jones<br />
<br />
Hi Ken,<br />
<br />
The HOP is operated by a non-profit organization called Special Transit (www.specialtransit.org). The service is paid for through a partnership between RTD, CU, and the city of Boulder. RTD passes are accepted on all the named bus routes. Interior advertisements on all buses beside the HOP are handled by RTD's advertising contractor Lamar Advertising. We do not provide interior ad space on the HOP route for anything other than non-profit organizations.<br />
<br />
Does this answer your questions?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
Cris Jones</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was asking specifically about how funding works for The HOP and why GO Boulder buses don't have any commercial advertisements, as I wasn't aware at the time that other points of fact were in dispute.</p>

<p>According to nobelprize.org, no person named "Joel" or "Button" ever won an award, so I'm removing that name.</p>
<p>The best known Charles Boettcher (unambiguously called "Charles … III" in one source) was born in Germany (1852); his grandson Charles Boettcher (called by one source "Charles … II") was born in Denver (1901). <i>Claudius Kedzie</i> Boettcher (son of the German-born Charles and father of the Denver-born Charles) <i>was</i> born in Boulder (1875). Another source says "Charles … III" owned the Denver Falcons ice hockey team in 1950; German Charles died in 1952, so this may be him, the grandson, or a third Charles. Anyway I'm removing Charles Boettcher from this section because of all the uncertainty.</p>
<p>I'm also removing the years, since it's not obvious what they mean (they're not all dates of birth).</p>

<p>Can the anonymous user who keeps vandalizing the page with obviously false information and a heading "Culture of Rioting" stop? On one of the paragraphs which says "no students were suspended", the source link, when followed by a Daily Camera subscriber states: "CU also is proceeding with disciplinary action against 15 of its students. Several have admitted their roles in the riot, and one already has accepted a four-year suspension"</p>
<p>The number of times the alleged riots times varies with each vandalizing, and as a resident a few blocks away, I can recall maybe 3 times the police were sent to the hill in the past ten years.</p>
<p>reply:</p>
<p>Ken,</p>
<p>Your recollection is poor. Or you deliberately want to suppress the facts about the neighborhood near where you live.</p>
<p>Here's a timeline of rioting from the Daily Camera.</p>
<p>URL: <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/city_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2422_3298089,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/city_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2422_3298089,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/city_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2422_3298089,00.html</a> Boulder's riot history November 2, 2004</p>
<p>February 1971— About 50 people "attacked" officers on University Hill.</p>
<p>May 1971— For three days, rioters rocked the Hill in an action that had no apparent connection to social protest.</p>
<p>May 1972— For several days, anti-Vietnam War protesters closed the Hill with a sit-in. Beat poet Allen Ginsberg calmed down the demonstration.</p>
<p>November 1984— Police used tear gas to break up a group of demonstrators near 28th Street and Baseline Road.</p>
<p>Early 1990s— The Hill was twice the site of Halloween trouble. Between 1992 and 1997, there were at least six additional riots.</p>
<p>April 1992— Local riots coincided with the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>May 1997— Three nights of rioting resulted in at least 33 arrests.</p>
<p>Halloween 1997— Hundreds of revelers set bonfires the Hill.</p>
<p>January 1998— After the Super Bowl, fans on the Pearl Street Mall and the Hill lit bonfires and jumped on cars.</p>
<p>February 1999— Police used tear gas to disperse about 400 fans gathered on the Hill after the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Halloween 1999— Hundreds of revelers set bonfires on Hill streets, damaged parked cars and fought with police.</p>
<p>August 2000— About 1,000 partiers ignited a bonfire, damaged four vehicles and hurled objects at authorities.</p>
<p>September 2000— About 200 people assembled around a burning couch and other debris at 14th Street and Euclid Avenue.</p>
<p>October 2000— Police arrested 10 people, issued 33 tickets for alcohol offenses and shut down several parties. People threw things at police and set fires.</p>
<p>December 2001— Students rioted after the CU football team won the Big 12 Championship.</p>
<p>[Halloween 2004]</p>

<hr />
<p>Anonymous user: writing a headline "A Culture of Rioting" is editorialism. And no, my recollection is fine: "Police used tear gas to disperse about 400 fans gathered on the Hill after the Super Bowl." is not a riot. If you want to expand the content in the section that's fine, but I shouldn't be able to tell what the opinion of the writer is. Obviously, I can.</p>
<p>Writing <i>despite</i> a Colorado law requiring disciplinary action against rioting students, none were suspended was actually contradicted by your own source -- the Daily Camera reported that police and school administrators were unable to identify many of those responsible, although one student was suspended as a result of the Halloween disruption. It isn't as though there is complacency on the part of the school. Calling Princeton Review "pseudoscience" is also quite unprofessional and actually kind of confusing.</p>
<p>I originally added the remark in the "Boulder Riots" because its omission in the wikipedia article seemed foolish.</p>
<p>Ken:</p>
<p>Go check Colorado law for definition of riots. 400 people is a riot. And, I watched the December 2001 riot--that was the real thing, Ken. Boulder City Council members and the paper always struggle to avoid calling riots what they are. You and they use words like disturbance, melee, fracas, etc. They're riots; it's easy.</p>
<p>I'd say that your biases are that Boulderites should be able to thumb their noses at police on Thursdays and smash windows, overturn cars, and burn things in the street without police intervention. Your bias comes through loud and clear in your posts, which, by the way, is not liberalism but closer to libertarianism. In the 1997 riot, someone dropped a cinder block on a police officer's head, which ended her career. That's not harmless fun.</p>
<p>A Culture of Rioting really gets at Boulder's culture of lawlessness. But, I can give that up.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that you add some riot pictures to the site. That would enliven it. I don't know how to add them.</p>
<p>As for CU, they are completely complacent in all of this. Here's a recent example: after the Nebraska game, when the student sections were cleared, how many students were actually disciplined? Read the newspaper archives carefully; how many students get disciplined after riots, when the smoke has cleared.</p>
<p>As for the Princeton review, their social science sucks. Maybe I should have said sucky-social-scientific?</p>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but you don't own this article, do you Ken? You don't own the true picture of Boulder. That's the whole wiki idea.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anonymous user: <i>everyone</i> owns this article, but the point of Wikipedia (not just a wiki) is an encyclopedia that everyone can edit. Inserting paragraphs that <i>get at</i> some perceived social ill is not the purpose of a wikipedia article, unless the article is specifically on that social ill.</p>
<p>I thank you for at least not putting <i>their science sucks</i> in regard to the Princeton Review link, but calling it pseudoscience isn't much better. Another example is that you expanded the 1997 paragraph to be three days, when in the article linked to as a source (the one I originally used), it clearly states that the problem last for <i>five hours</i>, not three days.</p>
<p>"Evidence" suggests that fraternities aren't enforcing their rules regarding alcohol at in-house parties? I wouldn't be terribly surprised if some of them didn't, but his isn't the place for editorializing or speculation.</p>
<p>To resolve this, I've asked that the article be protected, as this thread isn't helping anyone.</p>
<p>-Ken <a href="../../../k/k/i/User%7EKkinder_2eb7.html" title="User:Kkinder">user:kkinder</a></p>
<p>Okay, so the admins told me that the problem hasn't been going on long enough to warrant protecting the article. As such, under wikipedia's <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">Edit wars</a> policy, we should really try to work it out to everyone's satisfaction.</p>
<p>Every opinion has at least two sides.</p>
<ul>
<li>Culture of lawlessness? Among the lowest crime rates in the country.</li>
<li>City's attitude/culture at fault? Most students aren't from Boulder.</li>
<li>Police under-reacted? They probably don't want to get sattled with a lawsuit.</li>
</ul>
<p>See what I mean?</p>
<p>Here's my issue. Your first edit said <b>12</b> instances of rioting, then it was <b>10</b>, then <b>8</b>. Where did <b>any</b> of these numbers come from? I agree that 400 people rioting is a riot. A dozen people with a bonfire or some war protesters doesn't constitute a <i>riot</i> to me.</p>
<p>There is probably an opinion that the city and the school didn't do enough to punish those involved, but again there's also the fact that they can't prosecute anyone without evidence. The city is in a position of enforcing a federal drinking age on one of the largest universities in the country -- so if there is an argument about complacency on the part of the university, it's just that -- an argument, not a point of fact.</p>
<p>I think saying there have been X many disruptions is fine, but mentioning a massive riot followed by a statement that implies such an incident has been repeated dozens of times is misleading.</p>
<p>See Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../n/p/o/Npov.html" title="Npov">Neutral point of view</a>. I have no quarrel with you -- just please stick to citing sources, not making opinionated remarks.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../k/k/i/User%7EKkinder_2eb7.html" title="User:Kkinder">user:kkinder</a></p>
<p>Ken,</p>
<p>I don't have time to respond fully now, but a couple of points: I've always said 10 riots. If you start with 1997 and count to 2004, there were 10. I said 8 after you split out the 1997 and 2004 riots. 10-2=8. Ten is the correct number.</p>
<p>There have been no war protesters between 1997 and 2004. None of the ten riots includes 12 person bonfires.</p>
<p>As for sources, I would like to work through some of your text later on. There are no sources sited for a number of things.</p>
<p>Note the IP addresses for recent edits. Someone else was editing the riot text last night. I edited and someone else did too. You're conflating the two of us. I will say that I liked that editor's addition of a comment about the alcohol ban in the frats; they passed that and then ignored it. I think you should just eliminate the ref to the ban, or we could add an item that shows they ignored it. Long before Gordie Bailey they were drinking in the frats.</p>
<p>And finally, I changed the 2004 riot date to 30-31 October because that's when it was. It started on Saturday evening--see the new story--and lasted until Sunday morning. The news stories came out on Monday the first.</p>
<p>Any chance you can add a riot picture?</p>
<hr />
<p>The issues with adding pictures are copyright. There are photos on the city's website, but we can't use them without permission. If you find you can use (ie, it's licensed under creative commons, whatnot or you get permission), you can upload it with a user account.

<p>There does seem to be an ongoing cycle with someone (or some people) wanting to express their opinions about Boulder via wikipedia.</p>

<p>One of the tenets of the wikipedia as I understand it is no orginal research. Are there sources for the Happy Thursday section, particularly for the 250 figure?</p>
<p>A different anonymous user removed Happy Thursday completely. I put it back. While I think it's silly and even annoying--the event, that is--it's part of Boulder's culture. I created a new section though, called Amusements, since Happy Thursday seems not to be about transportation but about fun with an undercurrent of anti-authoritarianism.</p>
<p>I was glad to see that earlier in the day the advertisement for the Bar dropped out of this item. This item could still use a source, though. I'm not sure that Happy Thursday happens are regularly as the authors want everyone to think.</p>
<p>I've participated in Happy Thursday, but it's a minor event that's not even held every week. It's not noteworthy enough to be in an encyclopedia. I could name a half dozen weekly frat parties and a weekly poker game that draw more participants, but these aren't encyclopedic either. Fringe events shouldn't be in, it's not culturally relevant at all unlike Kinetics or the Bolder Boulder. --<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunky_52ca.html" title="User:Junky">Junky</a> 19:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Junky, your comparison of Happy Thursday to a frat party is insulting, as are your repeated deletions. I will continue to revert any deletions of this subject you make, as they are clearly hostile in nature. I'm sorry, in your case, I simply can't assume good faith as you clearly have an agenda to push by the various sections you have deleted from your article and from your deletion log, it's clear people agree with me.</dd>
<dd>Were it not for the Wikipedia entry on Happy Thursday, I would never have found out about the event, and it has since become a weekly ritual for me. In that respect I consider the entry in Wikipedia to be a useful resource for people such as myself, and I am frankly outraged at your attempts to remove it. Your edits to the article as a whole have sought to remove things which you are not personally interested in, but again, your views are not reflective of the majority of Boulderites, or what they wish the article on Boulder to be.

<dd>That's super that you found out about it that way and have become a fan, but it's still a minor event that's not encycopedia-worthy. But I see that you are a participant and now understand why you want more recognition for this minor event. I'm not sure why you find a frat party comparison insulting, but the point stands. There are several weekly activities with more participants and more cultural value than Happy Thursday, and it's not even close be being able to be called a Boulder tradition on par with something like Kinetics.--<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunky_52ca.html" title="User:Junky">Junky</a> 18:33, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Far more people have been involved in riots on the Hill than with Happy Thursday. Plus, the Daily Camera just announced the other day that Happy Thursday is over for the year. So, the paragraph was not only trivial but wrong, too.</p>

<dd>junky, when was the last time you saw a frat party mentioned in a nationally syndicated magazine? there are two articles showing that the event has received media attention, both locally and nationwide. it seems pretty obvious a lot of people want the cruiser ride mentioned in the wikipedia article, and so far the only person who seems to think it should be deleted is you. 71.212.128.102 07:19, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree, the media attention it's received alone make it notable. Junky, you're using a newspaper article to justify its non-notability? Doesn't that seem a little hypocritical to you? Sure the Cruiser Ride doesn't compare to Kinetics, but Kinetics happens once a year while the Cruiser Ride is a weekly event. In the end, Junky, I don't buy your arguments 24.8.179.172 23:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Cruiser Ride is noteworthy because it's a weekly event which has received media attention from a number of different outlets, including a nationally syndicated magazine. Furthermore, besides Junky I have not heard anyone else express that it is non-notable. I believe it should stay. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarcieri_5f20.html" title="User:Tarcieri">Tarcieri</a> 02:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the city's couch ban, the hill's boundaries are Baseline, Nineth, and Broadway.

<p>You ask for good faith, Ken, but here's what is not good faith about your insistent editing. You eliminated some vandalism about goats. That's fine and thank you. But then you also take out a legitimate argument contra your own, namely the argument that Wayne Laugesen and others have made regarding Boulder's alleged liberalism. The argument, put simply, is that Boulder's liberalism masks an exclusionary racism that has served to exclude people of color from Boulder. I know that some of the law professors at CU--Delgado I think his name is--have written about this too. So, Boulder may be an enclave of white liberalism that (here's the flip side) makes people of color feel unwelcome and thereby excludes them.</p>
<p>You might also read Jon Caldara's argument that people move to Boulder in spite of its liberalism.</p>
<p>I believe that you have repeated this pattern often--you fix vandalism and then at the same time take out an argument that you do not agree with. That's passive aggressive, it seems to me.</p>
<p>Likewise, the stuff that you have said about University Hill has been maddening. First you denied that the police had been called to the Hill more than three times or so in the past ten years. You were shown to be wrong. Then you denied that there had been more than two riots. Wrong again. Then you switched to denying that the riots were riots. That's wrong again. Then you said that the Ramsey house was not on the Hill. Wrong again. Then you switched to saying that we don't know just where the murder took place but once you faced the assessor's record that says "University Hill" then you finally capitulated to the truth of the matter. I think you also said that there can't be a district within a neighborhood; well, University Hill is mostly residential and has a commercial strip (district?) on 13th.</p>
<p>Waiting for an official record to confirm that the Ramsey House was on the Hill might be fine if you were consistent in that approach. But, take a look at Happy Thursday. You have never provided any sort of source that Happy Thursday is a real event. And the other day, you elevated it from an amusement to a tradition. If I edited like you, then I'd delete that every single morning. But, Ken, I am assuming good faith with regard to the existence of "Happy Thursday." I'd like you to start assuming good faith with regard to arguments that are not quite as sanguine as yours regarding Boulder's "liberalism." I suspect that the vandals are frustrated by your domineering POV, and I think that if you showed more good faith, the vandalism would likely decline.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anon.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm not entirely sure Laugesen's theory about the purpose of Boulder's green belt being racially motivated is worthy of inclusion in an ecyclopedia, but you're right -- it wasn't vandalism and I should have taken that up on the talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the rest of this. Please understand that, (1) I'm not the only person who edits this page, (2) from my (and others') point of view, you sometimes <i>are</i> using Wikipedia as a <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">soapbox</a>, and (3) some (not all) of your edits have not sourced material. For example, the hill being a "scene of multiple rapes, murders," etc. By comparison, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver</a> doesn't have paragraphs about crime on <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colfax_Avenue_8ff6.html" title="Colfax Avenue">Colfax Avenue</a> (and for that matter, neither does the main article on that street.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I added a source for Happy Thursday and renamed it to Traditions because I'm not sure 10k race is an "amusement". I'm not sure why that's controversial.

<dd>It's hardly fair to compare towns like Eldorado Springs (pop. 557, not a town but a census designated area), Niwot (pop. 4160) and Erie (pop. 6291) to Boulder. Louisville (18,937) and Lafayette (23,197) are larger but nowhere near the size of Boulder (94,673). Broomfield is larger at 38,272 but very close in terms of diversity (discrepancy of 0.3% white people ... it's misleading when you round up) These places may be geographically close, but are essentially hamlets and suburbs. The best comparisons for race need to have size accounted for. Some better comparisons might include Thornton (pop. 82,384; 82.71% white), the previously mentioned Longmont (pop. 71,093; 84.76% white), and Westminster (pop. 100,940; 84.19% white). You can't just define "diversity" to mean "African-American." <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diversity.html" title="Diversity">Diversity</a> means variety of cultural/racial backgrounds. Now I realize all these numbers and statistics are bordering on <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, but that was my point to begin with. Commenting on the diversity of some areas over others using self-determined criteria and self-conducted demographic research constitutes "original research." There may in fact be a valid point at the root of it all; however, you really need to cite a source of some sort to support your claims. -S</dd>

<p>I cleaned up the Race and Ethnicity section, though I'm not really all that satisfied about it. It's not very encyclopedic. What is the nature of the Hispanic community in Boulder? Is it poor? Is it "ghettoized" into a particular area of the city? What is the racial history of the city?</p>
<p>These 2005 incidents don't seem all that historic, either. I would really like to see a solid, concise summary of the current racial/ethnic environment of Boulder and a brief historical survey of incidents. --D Wilbanks 18:15, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>~~The riot section is a very useful one. During the spring and summer, unsuspecting out-of-staters buy houses on University Hill and then discover just how out-of-control CU students are during the school year. An encyclopedia article that includes an honest section about the riots might prevent the tension that occurs when people discover to their horror that they just bought a $500,000 house in a riot zone. Plus, does any other city have as many riots as Boulder? There's a whole wikipedia section on riots.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There have been two "riots" in its entire history, and I doubt dozens of tourists buy houses on a whim that then get burned down in the waves riots that you seem to think happen every year. It's so far from being the city with the most riots that I think maybe you're just trying to be funny. Riots should stay out. Are you a UHNA member trying to push an agenda or something? --<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunky_52ca.html" title="User:Junky">Junky</a> 19:32, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just checked the wikipedia article on <b>Riots</b>, together with some of the examples cited. By the standards represented by that article and by comparison with the examples, the city of Boulder has never had a riot. Using the term much more loosely, the University Hill commercial/fraternity neighborhood has had (just as Junky remarked) two riots in the last 12 years, plus one or two more during the Vietnam War era. Boulder has <i>never</i> had a riot, by any stretch of the meaning of the word, in a residential neighborhood, not even in the residential portion of University Hill.</p>
<p>It is easy for newspaper hyperbole to be mistaken for solid information. When drunken frat boys haul a couch into the street and set it on fire, that is not a pleasant event, but it's not particularly noteworthy either. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrand51paul_309f.html" title="User:Grand51paul">Paul</a> 19:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>~~Paul and Junky. I think what you mean to say is that because the rioters where white students, they were not really riots. Isn't there a Wikipedia article on student riots? You're like Ward Churchill. You put aside truths that are inconvenient to you. Boulder's students have have several recent 1000+ riots as well as a host of riots with hundreds of students. But, you think they are little campfires with couches. A critical look at race at riots might turn this piece into something other than a fantasy puff And Junky, I'm in Pasadena, what'a UHNA?</p>
<p><br />
~~Didn't we go through this a few months back? Ken Kinder made the same arguments but when presented with facts about the riots, he relented. Now come some new trolls to sit on the page and shape it with their own POV, namely that Boulder has no race issue worth talking about and that CU students don't riot. Sheesh. What is this--the Chamber of Commerce article about Boulder?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, what other city article contains similar material about "riots" and "hate crimes"? This material is utterly out of place. Yes, there is a Wikipedia article on student riots. I cannot stand Chamber of Commerce material either, but there is no reason to post one's baseless fantasies here about the supposed evil of a city. Check the articles on Denver, Fort Collins, Longmont, Greeley, Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, etc. -- show me where they have something comparable and I will relent.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrand51paul_309f.html" title="User:Grand51paul">Paul</a> 05:28, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>~~Check the Madison, WI entry for a long discussion of its party culture. Or check the entry for Los Angeles, which does not shy from mention of riots there. Having watched a couple of 1,000+ person riots on the Hill, I don't know what you mean by "baseless fantasies."</p>
<p>You're going to need to demonstrate that there has been even one riot in Boulder in the past ten years according to the definition of "riot", not by your anecdote and made up criteria. --<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunky_52ca.html" title="User:Junky">Junky</a> 20:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

~~Junky, my friend, start here: <a href="http://web.dailycamera.com/buffzone/riot.html" class="external free" title="http://web.dailycamera.com/buffzone/riot.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.dailycamera.com/buffzone/riot.html</a> and then read above on this page. In the Halloween riot of two years ago, 1,500 or so student rioted. They flipped cars over and threw cinder blocks at the cops. In December 2001, roughly the same number of students were out. Before that, riots of 3-500 students. I want you to ask yourself, 1) if you live in Boulder, why do you not know about these; or 2) if you do not live in Boulder, why do you not think these are riots?</p>
<p>Do you work for the Chamber of Commerce or the University of Colorado?</p>

<dd>I saw the December 2001 "riot" and the Halloween "riot", as well as being in downtown Denver after the '98 Super Bowl and the '05 NBA all star game. Both the events in Denver were much larger, resulted in more property damage (and actual looting, unlike in Boulder), and required more policing than the Boulder events, yet nothing is mentioned about them in the Denver article. They weren't riots, and hardly even newsworthy. --<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunky_52ca.html" title="User:Junky">Junky</a> 16:59, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, the Los Angeles page barely makes mention of the Watts Riots, not to mention the other riots that city has had. The argument of, "out of state real estate buyers should be warned" is patently absurd. Wikipedia is not a real estate guide. I didn't "relent" after being "confronted with truth" -- I reverted a version that lead with "A Culture of Rioting" and negotiated a compromise with someone who obviously had some kind of weird agenda. <a href="../../../k/k/i/User%7EKkinder_2eb7.html" title="User:Kkinder">Ken</a> 00:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
