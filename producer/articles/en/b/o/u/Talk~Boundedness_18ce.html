(<i>Of course</i>, keeping the adjective as a very convenient <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">redirect</a>, so all links work fine.) -- <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby Bartels</a> 08:33, 2005 Feb 20 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see your point. I read now the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28adjectives%29_835b.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (adjectives)">naming conventions</a>, and that rule in general makes sense.</p>
<p>In this particular case though, I would rather not follow the "recommended" rule. You see, 98% of articles would indeed link to <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded.html" title="Bounded">bounded</a> rather than <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">boundedness</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">boundedness</a> noun sounds kind of clumsy and artificial. What do you think? <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 18:44, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I certainly don't find the word clumsy and artificial; it's the word that mathematicians use when they want a noun that describes the property shared by bounded functions. You can find examples among the pages that link directly to <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">Boundedness</a>; another (almost) example is on the page <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totally_bounded_space.html" title="Totally bounded space">Totally bounded space</a>, where I naturally wrote (with no ulterior motive) the phrase "total boundedness" a couple of times. The proportion of links is irrelevant; that's (one reason) why we have redirects: so that people can write "[[bounded]]" without needing to use the pipe trick as "[[boundedness|bounded]]".</p>
<p>(It is true that one reason that we have <i>naming conventions</i> is so that links to <i>nonexistent</i> articles will work properly. Thus anybody familiar with our naming conventions should use the pipe trick as "[[boundedness|bounded]]" so long as the page doesn't yet exist. Then when it's created, ideally under the proper title <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">Boundedness</a>, the next person will creat a redirect from <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded.html" title="Bounded">Bounded</a> <i>instead</i> of using the pipe trick. Only once the page has been created can we fall back on writing "[[bounded]]" directly.)</p>
<p>I do agree that this isn't an ideal title; I definitely prefer titles like <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_space.html" title="Bounded space">Bounded space</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_function.html" title="Bounded function">Bounded function</a>. Someday, those will exist as separate articles; and then <i>this</i> page will become a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_page_1257.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation page">disambiguation page</a>. But it should still be at <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">Boundedness</a>. (See <a href="../../../c/o/m/Completeness.html" title="Completeness">Completeness</a> -- including its edit history -- for an example of how I expect this page to develop.)</p>

<p>Should <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue.html" title="Blue">blue</a> be redirected to <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blueness.html" title="Blueness">blueness</a>? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 20:36, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't see why; the word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blue" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:blue">blue</a> is a noun (meaning the same as "blue colo[u]r", much as the noun "English" means the same as "English language"). However, a redirect the other way wouldn't be a bad idea -- I'll create it now! ^_^ (Arguably, the grammatical relationship between the noun "blueness" and the adjective "blue" is the correct analogue of the grammatical relationship between the noun "boundedness" and the adjective "bounded". But then the <i>noun</i> "blue" is more or less the analogue of the noun "bounded space", which I agree is a better title! -- once we <i>have</i> an article that precise.) -- <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby Bartels</a> 11:27, 2005 Feb 21 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would interpet Charles's comment as the statement that the word "boundedness" is a cooked up noun. Come on Toby, I get the impression you are just determined to follow the rule even if it does not make much sense in this particular setting.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Maybe we should ask more opinions about this, but the way I see it, <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">boundedness</a> is not a good idea. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 19:11, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I completely agree with Toby and I do not think <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">boundedness</a> sounds awkward.

<dd>I do suggest <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_space.html" title="Bounded space">bounded space</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_function.html" title="Bounded function">bounded function</a> are really separate pages for the future; this page should probably mostly give that choice. 'Blue' was just my first reaction. I suppose if the principle is correct, rather than advisory, we should look at <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semisimplicity.html" title="Semisimplicity">semisimplicity</a> from <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semisimple.html" title="Semisimple">semisimple</a>; but that really is a jargon word, while boundedness is real English (actually I think <i>unboundedness</i> is more familiar). Whatever the principle, it is true that abstract nouns are less used in English than in some other European languages. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 21:06, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>The disambiguation page</s> The new page (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_function.html" title="Bounded function">Bounded function</a>) is great. However, the disambiguation page should still be at <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">Boundedness</a>, which is, of course, not in any sense a made-up word -- as evidenced by the fact that it is used!

<dd>I disagree, and I feel strongly about it. Would you like to post this on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_baf7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics</a>, so that we get more opinions? Please do not make unilateral changes before that; above, you had had one week to reply to my comment before I actually performed the move back to <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded.html" title="Bounded">bounded</a>. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 04:55, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I take it back. The disambiguation page is <i>terrible</i>! Don't you know how to make a disambiguation page? You can look it up at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> (particularly section 3) if you like. Since I've just gone through all the work of fixing all of the links to <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded.html" title="Bounded">Bounded</a>, <i>and</i> fixing the page <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">Boundedness</a> (which you left redirected the wrong way), <b>and</b> fixing the amazing distortion of grammar that you put through on <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totally_bounded_space.html" title="Totally bounded space">Totally bounded space</a>, I don't feel the least bit unjustified in that, after fixing all of that as smoothly as I could, the page has just now ended up back at <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">Boundedness</a>.</p>
<p>I will, incidentally, be happy to accept a naming convention that pages like <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded.html" title="Bounded">Bounded</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complete.html" title="Complete">Complete</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semisimple.html" title="Semisimple">Semisimple</a> ought to be placed at adjectives. I would disagree with such a change, but it's not a big deal; and I left things so that, once such a naming convention is adopted, anybody (not just an administrator) can make the change. But in the face of current naming conventions, I am hardly making unilateral changes as I clean up your mess.</p>

<dd>No, no, I did not mean to say your argument is not good. I would on any day vote for "compactness". However, I really love "bounded" more than "boundedness". You see, "bound" is a noun, then you make it into the adjective "bounded", which is very reasonable, and then you force the "ness" at the end just because you want a noun derived from an adjective. And before all this story started, it was so easier to say "a function is [[bounded]]" and "a set is [[bounded]] rather than "a function is [[boundedness|bounded]]". Now of course those are separate articles, so this last argument loses force, but the one before is still valid. Anyway, I felt that this is one of those cases in which the (noun) rule trumps common sense; although I can certainly live with "boundedness". <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 03:10, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>To move <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">Boundedness</a> back to <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded.html" title="Bounded">Bounded</a> (perhaps after a change in naming conventions?), just use <a href="../../../m/o/v/Special%7EMovepage_4900.html" title="Special:Movepage">Special:Movepage</a> like normally. This can be done by anybody at any time, and doesn't require an administrator. (And it can be undone by anybody afterwards.)</li>
<li>To combine <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_function.html" title="Bounded function">Bounded function</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded_set.html" title="Bounded set">Bounded set</a> once again into a single page (either at <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundedness.html" title="Boundedness">Boundedness</a> or at <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounded.html" title="Bounded">Bounded</a>), you <i>do</i> (now) need help from an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_f252.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator">administrator</a>. However, I'm pretty sure that nobody actually wants to do this.</li>
<li>To add new meanings of "bounded" (I can't think of any offhand, but they must exist), just add more bullet points on the diambiguation page, with appropriate links.</li>
