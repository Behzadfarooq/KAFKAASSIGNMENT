<p>Nice job! tanx buddy Two things - the location of the Iceni territory (more or less), would be handy; and what happened to the daughters? I only vaguely remember that their rape and or otherwise outraging was a contributing factor. --MichaelTinkler</p>
<p>in the bit about (paraphrasing) "retreating soldiers prevented from fleeing by their families", it's written a little bit ambiguously: presumably it means that the families were physically crowding the way. Alternately, it could mean that their families refused to allow them to leave, urging them to stay and fight. Since I don't know the right answer, I won't clean it up.</p>
<p>I've rewritten that bit - it should be a bit clearer now. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 16:56, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Everyone is a bit ambiguous about the exact dates involved. Is it really not known for sure exactly when Boudicca was defeated? Would the fact that it's descibed as 60/61 suggest that it was around the turn of the year? - Jayem</p>
<p>No, it's pretty clear from Tacitus that the revolt started in the spring or summer (campaigning season) and was defeated before the start of winter. Dates from Britain in this period have been worked out by counting up the years served by each governor. There's a one year margin for error because it's not clear whether Quintus Veranius died within twelve months of being appointed, or within the calendar year of his appointment. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 18:08, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have cross referenced the bit of trivial about Boudicca and platform 9-3/4 Kings Cross station from the Harry Potter page. --Andrew Grimmke</p>
<p>Yes it is true that it was started in spring but on the Roman calendar the year starts in March so it would be the March of 62 C.E but then considered the turn of the year. -Royal Russell 9:54 PM, 8/31/2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's true that the Roman calendar started in March, but the dates in question aren't based on the original Roman calendar. The relavant historians (Tacitus and Dio Cassius) used the consuls to identify the year, and the consuls took office on 1 January, so events they describe are dated retrospectively using a January-December year. However, Tacitus isn't entirely annalistic when dealing with Britain in his Annals, but often sums up a period of several years at an appropriate place in the overall narrative, and Dio Cassius's account comes from an epitome which doesn't mention the consuls, hence having to count up years served by governors. The rebellion (or at least the build-up) started before seed-time, as Tacitus says the Britons had neglected to sow their crops, hoping to seize Roman grain, so it could have started before March and therefore in the calendar year of 59 or 60 and ended at the start of winter 60 or 61. By the turn of 62 it would have been all over, and Suetonius Paulinus would have been carrying out his punitive operations. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 19:18, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now on to a different subject: MichaelTinkler you said you had a bit of trouble with under standing where Iceni is. Well Iceni is the bump sticking out just above Kent, which is modern-day Norwich. And her daughters, Cammora and Tasca probaly poisoned themselves with Boudicca. -Royal Russell, 9:31 PM, 9/28/2005</p>
<p>That "bump sticking out" is in fact East Anglia, comprising the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Norwich is the main city in Norfolk..... 192.30.202.16 16:19, 26 November 2005 (UTC)Vivien Shiers</p>
<p>OMG! I just re-read what I wrote back more than a year ago! I feel really dumb! "bump sticking out?" How could I be so air-headed?

<p>In the second paragraph, this caught my attention: "Roman emperor Nero briefly considered withdrawing Roman forces from the island, but ultimately Boudica was defeated at the Battle of Watling Street <b>by the heavily outnumbered forces</b> of Roman provincial governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus." (<b>bold</b> added for emphasis)</p>
<p>Is this correct? Were the Roman forces outnumbered, or were Boudica's forces outnumbered? I didn't edit it, since I don't know the facts, but it makes more sense if Boudica's forces were outnumbered, not the Roman forces. Can someone look into this and make the necessary changes?70.17.38.39 17:00, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to the History Channel special airing 3/26/06 - Boudica's forces outnumbered the Roman forces. However, her forces were more 'savage' and not highly trained nor protected like the Roman forces, hence the loss.</p>
<p>Boudiccas forces outnumbered the Romans by about 20 to 1.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_mci_a545.html" title="User:Andy mci">Andy mci</a> 17:49, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section is largely rubbish. The bit about her family being well-off is okay, and the roundhouse is reasonable supposition, but there's no evidence that the (medieval Irish) practice of fostership was practiced in Britain (and the purpose of it in Ireland was more about political patronage than "learning how to be sociable"). The bit about "warrior school" and the date of her marriage are simply invented. This is not history and does not belong in an encyclopedia.

<p>Ok now how old would Prasutagus be at his death? What was the normal age for a Icenian Briton at the time? Or any Briton?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Prasutagus's age at death is not given in any of the sources, therefore nobody knows. It's not even known that, as is often assumed, he died in 60. The account of the conspiracy to rebel given in <i>Agricola</i> suggests that discontent had been building for some time, so he could easily have died, and the Iceni lands been annexed, quite a number of years previously. Stats for average life expectancy in Britain at the time don't exist, so any attempt to give a figure would only be guesswork. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 23:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article states that: "Kenneth Jackson concludes that the correct spelling of the name is Boudica, pronounced /bəʊ'diː.ka:/, although it is mispronounced by many as /buː.dik'ə/"</p>
<p>However, the stress markings are in the wrong place for IPA transcriptions: I assume the contributor meant /'bəʊdiː.kaː/ (with stress on the 1st syllable) and /buː'dɪkə/ (with stress on the 2nd syllable) respectively. However, I've never heard the name being pronounced with stress on the 2nd syllable - it is usually pronounced "BOO-di-ka" (ie. /'buːdɪkə/).</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm the pronunciation before I edit the article? I particularly would like confirmation of Kenneth Jackson's pronunciation of the name (note that the system of transcription used in the book may place stress markings after the stressed syllable, rather than before it).

<dd>To quote the article in question:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The philological fact is that the name must have been <i>Boudica</i>, pronounced in phonetic terminology /boudi:ka:/, in 'English' spelling it would be ' <i>Bowdeekah</i> ', where <i>ow</i> means the dipthong seen in e.g. the phrases 'tie a bow' or 'bow and arrow', and the stressed syllable is the <i>dee</i>, with long vowel, the final <i>a</i> being also long. The generally accepted <i>Boudicca</i> is probably (and incorrectly) pronounced by most people as /budikə/, or, in popular spelling, ' <i>Boodikka</i> '."</dd>

<dd>Don't know how that would be best rendered in IPA, but hopefully it should help you. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 17:08, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Could some one explain to me how it should be pronounced instead of BOO-di-kah? is it Bee-oo-dik-ah? or what? sorry I'm an air-head (see above my comments made signed as "Royal Russell"). <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexas_Drama_King_44ac.html" title="User:Texas Drama King">- signing off as the Drama King from Texas!</a> 06:17, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <i>o</i> and the <i>u</i> are pronounced separately, so it comes out as something like "bow" as in "bow-and-arrow". --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 12:47, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am from Colchester and I thought her name was <i>Boudicca</i>, pronouced BOO-di-ka. I am not sure what they say it is in the Castle Museum - I must find out. {Jake95 21:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)}</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was wrong. It is in fact <i>Boudica</i>. This spelling was used for ages before a Roman historian spelt it as <i>Boudicca</i>. Someone in the middle ages found it and mistook the <i>o</i> for an <i>a</i> and the second <i>c</i> for an <i>e</i>, hence the spelling <i>Boadicea</i>.

<p>I've reverted back to the spelling "Iceni" for now. It may be that "Eceni" is more accurate (but then again, Iron Age British coin spellings are pretty variable, particularly between <i>E</i> and <i>I</i>), but Wikipedia policy is that the best known version of a name should be used, and as far as I know the scholarly literature still uses "Iceni". My suggestion would be to find an authoritative scholarly work that supports the spelling "Eceni" as the more accurate one and edit the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceni.html" title="Iceni">Iceni</a> article accordingly (the way this one does with Kenneth Jackson and the spelling "Boudica"), and after that, roll out the change to this article and others. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 12:37, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a>, I have reverted your edit to the opening of the article. Firstly, starting with "best known as Boadicea" is incorrect, as the correct name is now very well known and used in all sources from popular to scholarly. It is also bad practice to open with the incorrect name. Secondly, the year of her death is not certain (it was either 60 or 61, but Tacitus is not precise enough to allow us to plump for one or the other, as is discussed elsewhere on the talk page. Thirdly, the opening clarification bit is entirely unnecessary as the matter is discussed thoroughly in the article. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 15:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One - why have you ignored the points above? Two - why have you duplicated pretty much the whole article in the introduction in the summary?

<dd>Further corrections: Catus Decianus was not a proconsul. Tacitus says that Boudicca was flogged and her daughters raped, not that all three of them were flogged and raped. The "ambush" of the 9th legion is fiction - Tacitus gives no details of how it was defeated, just that it was defeated. Londinium was not yet the capital of Roman Britain. Tacitus makes no mention of the evacuation of Verulamium by Suetonius. If you are not prepared to read the sources, which are helpfully linked to in the footnotes, you have absolutely no business editing the article. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 17:19, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
