<p><b>Bourne</b> is a market town on the western edge of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fens_4447.html" title="The Fens">The Fens</a>, in southern <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. The town owes its origin to the Roman road upon which it was built, and also to the exceptionally fine-quality water supply derived locally from natural springs. The name “Bourne” (or “Bourn”, as the town was originally known) is a common name for a settlement and derives from the Anglo-Saxon meaning “water” or “stream”. The town lies on the intersection of the <a href="../../../a/1/5/A15_road.html" title="A15 road">A15</a> and the B1193 (formerly <a href="../../../a/1/5/A151_road.html" title="A151 road">A151</a>) roads at <a href="http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=g&amp;gazString=TF096202" class="external text" title="http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=g&amp;gazString=TF096202" rel="nofollow">TF0920</a>. As well as the main township, the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_parish.html" title="Civil parish">parish</a> includes the hamlets of Cawthorpe, <a href="../../../d/y/k/Dyke%2C_Lincolnshire_cd8e.html" title="Dyke, Lincolnshire">Dyke</a> and <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty%2C_Lincolnshire_5a53.html" title="Twenty, Lincolnshire">Twenty</a>. The town economy was based on rural industries. The coming of the railway opened up a market for mineral waters bottled locally. Today the local economy is still mainly rurally-based, revolving around agriculture and food preparation and packaging geared towards the modern system of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarkets.html" title="Supermarkets">supermarkets</a>, but there are also important light engineering and tourism activities. The district as a whole has one of the fastest-growing housing markets in the whole country, with much of the new building taking place in Bourne. The town population is now (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>) nearer to 15,000 than the 12,000 or so given in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_Census_2001_bcd1.html" title="United Kingdom Census 2001">2001 Census</a> data.</p>

<p>Bourne is reputedly the birthplace of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereward_the_Wake_09d0.html" title="Hereward the Wake">Hereward the Wake</a> (in about <a href="../../../1/0/3/1035.html" title="1035">1035</a>), although the twelfth century source of this information, <i>De Gestis Herwardi Saxonis</i>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> refers in this connection only to his father as being 'of Bourne' and to the father's house and retainers<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> there. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Kingsley_90d6.html" title="Charles Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a> used the <i>De Gestis</i> text for his lively novel which repeats the fundamental story with much descriptive embellishment.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Orm (or Ormin) the Preacher (flourished <a href="../../../1/1/8/1180.html" title="1180">1180</a>) worked at Bourne Abbey during the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_Century_6011.html" title="12th Century">12th Century</a>, about a century earlier than Robert Mannyng (see below) but his presence here has only been revealed during recent research. His collection of homilies known as <a href="../../../o/r/m/Ormulum.html" title="Ormulum"><i>The Ormulum</i></a> has been well known to linguists and language historians ever since the 17th century but its source has only recently been established as <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourne_Abbey_4224.html" title="Bourne Abbey">Bourne Abbey</a>. Orm's language provides a glimpse of the English vernacular of the time and before it was strongly influenced by the French. It is assumed that the manuscript remained at Bourne Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries between <a href="../../../1/5/3/1536.html" title="1536">1536</a> and <a href="../../../1/5/4/1540.html" title="1540">1540</a> and after various owners, it is now in the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodleian_Library_1cf5.html" title="Bodleian Library">Bodleian Library</a> at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>, where it is kept in conditions in keeping with its age and fragility.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Mannyng_1720.html" title="Robert Mannyng">Robert Mannyng</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/6/1264.html" title="1264">1264</a> – <a href="../../../1/3/4/1340.html" title="1340">1340</a>) is perhaps the most notable of the town's past citizens in that he is credited with putting the speech of the ordinary people of his time into the recognisable form that we have today. He is best known as Robert de Brunne because of his long time residence as a canon at Bourne Abbey where he completed his life's work and in the process, popularised religious and historical material in a Middle English dialect that was easily understood by the people of his time. His work <i>Handlyng Synne</i> is acknowledged to be of great value because it gives glimpses into the ways and thoughts of his contemporaries and even more, shows us the language then in common use.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cecil_9f19.html" title="William Cecil">William Cecil</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/2/1520.html" title="1520">1520</a> – <a href="../../../1/5/9/1598.html" title="1598">1598</a>) became the first Lord Burghley after serving <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> for forty years, during which time he was the main architect of Britain's successful policies of that period, earning a reputation as a master of renaissance statecraft with outstanding talents as a diplomat, politician and administrator. He was born at a house in the town centre at Bourne that is now the Burghley Arms and a plaque on the outside reminds us of this event.</p>
<p>Job Hartop (<a href="../../../1/5/5/1550.html" title="1550">1550</a> – <a href="../../../1/5/9/1595.html" title="1595">1595</a>) was a farmer's boy working on the land near Bourne but hankered after a life of adventure and ran away to sea when he was twelve years old. After a short apprenticeship with a gunpowder manufacturer in London, he signed on with the English admiral <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_John_Hawkins_0561.html" title="Sir John Hawkins">Sir John Hawkins</a> and sailed the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Main_9a66.html" title="Spanish Main">Spanish Main</a> in the company of the young <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Drake_386b.html" title="Francis Drake">Francis Drake</a>. He was captured by the Spanish on his third voyage and spent ten years as a galley slave and thirteen years in a Spanish prison but managed to escape and make his way back to Bourne where he spent his final days recounting his adventures in the town's taverns, although the privations he suffered had taken their toll and he died at the age of 45.</p>
<p>Robert Harrington (philanthropist) (<a href="../../../1/5/8/1589.html" title="1589">1589</a> – <a href="../../../1/6/5/1654.html" title="1654">1654</a>) made large bequests to Bourne from which the community benefits to this day. Legend has it that he walked to London to seek his fortune and was most successful in his endeavours and when he died, he remembered his home town by leaving shops and dwelling houses in the <a href="../../../l/e/y/Leytonstone.html" title="Leytonstone">Leytonstone</a> area "for the benefit of his own people", namely the citizens of Bourne. The charity established in his name is by far the greatest currently administered by Bourne United Charities and fittingly, Harrington Street was named in his memory.</p>

He was also the son of the Rev William Dodd who was Vicar of Bourne from <a href="../../../1/7/2/1727.html" title="1727">1727</a>–<a href="../../../1/7/5/1756.html" title="1756">56</a>, graduating with distinction from <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_College_fdcd.html" title="Clare College">Clare College</a>, Cambridge, and then moved to London where his extravagant lifestyle soon landed him in debt and worried his friends who persuaded him to mend his ways and so he decided to take <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_orders.html" title="Holy orders">holy orders</a> and was ordained in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1751.html" title="1751">1751</a>. He became a popular and fashionable preacher but was always short of money and in an attempt to rectify his depleted finances, forged a bond in the sum of £4,200. He was found out, prosecuted and sentenced to death and publicly <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanging.html" title="Hanging">hanged</a> at <a href="../../../t/y/b/Tyburn%2C_London_9b54.html" title="Tyburn, London">Tyburn</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">27 June</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1777.html" title="1777">1777</a>.</p>

<p>The two famous racing car marques English Racing Automobiles and British Racing Motors were both founded by Raymond Mays, international racing driver and designer. ERA started in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> and BRM in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, when the first car was unveiled at <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Folkingham_6183.html" title="RAF Folkingham">Folkingham</a> Airfield. Success was slow in coming but new workshops were opened in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> where engines and cars were developed. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Hill_f3da.html" title="Graham Hill">Graham Hill</a> won the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions_0172.html" title="List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions">world championship</a> in the BRM, the first British driver to win in an all-British car. The BRM team won the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions_f392.html" title="List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>, and also that year's team prize at the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> Sports Personality of the Year awards. Motor racing fans believed this would be the start of a new era for the sport, but it proved to be something of a false dawn. By <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, the company had 100 employees in Bourne and this was another victorious year when BRM cars gained either a first or second prize in every <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Prix_motor_racing_f1a4.html" title="Grand Prix motor racing">Grand Prix</a> race that was held. After that, the cars had mixed fortunes until the Mexican driver <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Rodriguez_%28racing_driver%29_0d76.html" title="Pedro Rodriguez (racing driver)">Pedro Rodriguez</a> scored a comeback victory in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_Belgian_Grand_Prix_1027.html" title="1970 Belgian Grand Prix">1970 Belgian Grand Prix</a> at <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps_db91.html" title="Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps">Spa</a>. There were further successes but as the sport became the province of heavy commercial sponsorship, advancement was dogged by mechanical failures and lack of resources. The team ceased to compete after <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. In all, BRM won seventeen Grands Prix between <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, the successful drivers apart from Hill (10), Stewart (2) and Rodriguez were <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joakim_Bonnier_48b3.html" title="Joakim Bonnier">Jo Bonnier</a>, the tragic <a href="../../../j/o/_/Jo_Siffert_a1de.html" title="Jo Siffert">Jo Siffert</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Gethin_40f9.html" title="Peter Gethin">Peter Gethin</a> and finally, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Pierre_Beltoise_aa65.html" title="Jean-Pierre Beltoise">Jean-Pierre Beltoise</a>. Soon after Mays died in 1980, <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubery_Owen_2457.html" title="Rubery Owen">Rubery Owen</a> decided to sell the BRM collection of racing cars. The sale created international interest when it took place during the Motor Show at <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earls_Court_Exhibition_Centre_c924.html" title="Earls Court Exhibition Centre">Earl's Court</a>, London, in October <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>.</p>
<p>The former workshops are now occupied by a firm of auctioneers who use them as a saleroom, but the achievements of Raymond Mays and the motor racing connection with Bourne are remembered with a Memorial Room at the town's Heritage Centre (Baldock's Mill in South Street). The room is filled with photographs, memorabilia and an impressive display of silverware won by BRM cars and drivers on international circuits. Following on from a uniquely memorable Sunday in August 1999 when a collection of BRM cars paraded around the streets of the town watched by hundreds of spectators <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:Ux29cl8vZBQJ:members.madasafish.com/~d_hodgkinson/brmplaces.htm+bourne+brm+parade&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:Ux29cl8vZBQJ:members.madasafish.com/~d_hodgkinson/brmplaces.htm+bourne+brm+parade&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a superb memorial to Raymond Mays and the town's motor racing heritage was unveiled in South Street in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>

The Abbey and Parish Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are currently 69 listed buildings in the parish of Bourne, the most important being the Abbey and Parish Church of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Saint Paul</a> (<a href="../../../1/1/3/1138.html" title="1138">1138</a>) which is the only one scheduled Grade I. The others are Grade II, the most colourful being the aptly named Red Hall (ca. <a href="../../../1/6/2/1620.html" title="1620">1620</a>), finished in red brick with ashlar quoins, many gabled and featuring a fine Tuscan porch. From <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, it was the town's railway station booking office and waiting room. At two stages, in the <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890s.html" title="1890s">1890s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, it came close to demolition but the building is now well preserved by <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourne_United_Charities_a1a8.html" title="Bourne United Charities">Bourne United Charities</a>. The former station booking office serves as the BUC's office.</p>
<p>Baldock's Mill (<a href="../../../1/8/0/1800.html" title="1800">1800</a>), once a corn-grinding water mill, together with the miller's house, has been converted by <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourne_Civic_Society_824d.html" title="Bourne Civic Society">Bourne Civic Society</a> to serve as the town's Heritage Centre. It houses many interesting artefacts, most recently a water-wheel has been installed and a newly-created replica of a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Worth_b602.html" title="Charles Worth">Charles Worth</a> dress is on display.</p>
<p>The Baptist Church building dates from <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a> but the Church itself was established here in the <a href="../../../1/6/4/1640s.html" title="1640s">1640s</a>. This building, the Methodist Church (<a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>) and the United Reformed Church (<a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a>) are all still in active use.</p>

<p>The Old Grammar School was housed in a fine red-brick building with a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collyweston.html" title="Collyweston">Collyweston</a> roof, built in the seventeenth century and largely rebuilt in <a href="../../../1/7/3/1738.html" title="1738">1738</a>. The school closed in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, and the building, which stands in the Abbey churchyard, has since been used for a variety of purposes. Maintenance has been lacking for many years, and the roof was condemned as unsafe in April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. The building is rapidly becoming derelict.</p>
<p>At the cemetery owned and run by the Town Council is a chapel <a href="http://homepages.which.net/~rex/bourne/cemetery8.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepages.which.net/~rex/bourne/cemetery8.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, built in 1855. In recent years, the building has not been used as a chapel, and the fabric has deteriorated. This is attributed to a lack of maintenance by the Council due to financial constraints <a href="http://homepages.which.net/~rex/bourne/cemetery9.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepages.which.net/~rex/bourne/cemetery9.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The chapel now requires considerable expenditure if it is to survive, but on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_23.html" title="January 23">23 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> the Town Council took the decision to demolish it <a href="http://homepages.which.net/~rex/bourne/cemetery7.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepages.which.net/~rex/bourne/cemetery7.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Action is not imminent, and local campaigners are trying to secure a listing and identify a source of funding in an eleventh-hour effort to secure the future of the chapel situated in the town's two-time award-winning cemetery.</p>

<p>Bourne Market Place is at the crossroads of the <a href="../../../a/1/5/A15_road.html" title="A15 road">A15 road</a> and the B1193. Strictly speaking, it was a staggered pair of T-junctions where the A15 was met by the A151 from Spalding to the east and the B676 from the west (the article <a href="../../../a/1/5/A151_road.html" title="A151 road">A151 road</a> explains) before the B676 was redesignated as an extension of the A151 to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colsterworth.html" title="Colsterworth">Colsterworth</a>. The A151 was diverted from the town centre via Cherry Holt Road and a newly-opened relief road in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. When the rapid expansion of the town was first proposed in the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, development was scheduled to the north-east of the town, and part of this would have been a north/south bypass on the A15 under Section 106 of the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_and_Country_Planning_Act_1990_7360.html" title="Town and Country Planning Act 1990">Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a>. However, the chosen site was shifted to the south-west of the town, and the proposed by-pass was lost. A large volume of traffic is generated within the town, with the result that the A15 between Bourne and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peterborough.html" title="Peterborough">Peterborough</a> is one of the busiest roads in the whole county.</p>
<p>The town's bus services are provided by <a href="http://www.delainebuses.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.delainebuses.com/" rel="nofollow">Delaine</a>, a family-owned and run company which has been operating in Bourne for many years.</p>

<p>Bourne had a railway station which was on both the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Northern_Railway_%28Great_Britain%29_198e.html" title="Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)">Great Northern</a> line from <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essendine.html" title="Essendine">Essendine</a> to <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleaford.html" title="Sleaford">Sleaford</a> and the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_and_Great_Northern_Joint_Railway_58f6.html" title="Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway">Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway</a> connecting the Midlands to East Anglia. Both these were closed to timetabled passenger service by the end of February <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> and the lines were closed to occasional use by the <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beeching_Axe_f2ab.html" title="Beeching Axe">Beeching Axe</a>. With the exception of the Red Hall, the principal station buildings were demolished in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, the year after the Beeching Report. The main goods shed survived however, just into the new century and there remains an unusual survival: a goods store of wooden construction.
