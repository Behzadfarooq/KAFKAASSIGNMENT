<p>OK, I tried to do this in private e-mails, to which you do not respond, so here goes:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>thanks for your interest in my business, but I have no intention of discussing my business plans with you. If I violate NPOV, please bring it to my attention.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>I don't have the remotest interest in your business, nor your plans. Nor did I ask about your plans, as you falsely and knowingly claim. It is obvious that you cannot establish bounding for any product that has no test standards or tests. It is likewise obvious that commercial success for a construction and fire protection product is hampered when those fundamentals do not exist. That is what is at issue and that is the basis of your discomfort with this article. If it were anything else, you would have pointed this out.--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 00:19, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Your interest in the topic is commercial. You have invented a product and patented it and it is listed right here:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php" class="external free" title="http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php</a></p>
<p>Your background in fire protection cannot be found on the web, apart from the above mentioned patent text. No <a href="../../../b/u/i/Building_code.html" title="Building code">building code</a> and no fire code makes the use of your product mandatory. Consequently, no test standards exist to test it or compare it to anything else. Consequently, you have no acceptable proof that it works, because that is ordinarily established through the existence of active <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_certification.html" title="Product certification">product certification</a>, for which you are not eligible, and for which your text indicates you have no funding.</p>
<p>You stated below, a few days ago, that you agreed that you should become an expert in <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_protection.html" title="Fire protection">fire protection</a> before editing subject related text. Your written agreement can be seen below. When it became clear that you have no significant background are in the field and are unlikely to become with great rapidity and without working in the field, you then decided to write from the "reader's", or in other words layman's perspective.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a few days later, you sent me a note suggesting that unless I debate you publicly, after refusing to engage in this via e-mail between us, you indicate that you will do a major re-write.</p>
<p>Let's make one thing very clear: All that <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounding.html" title="Bounding">bounding</a> is, is that field-installed products and systems conform in all respects to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_certification.html" title="Product certification">product certification</a> listings, such as those available from <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underwriters_Laboratories_8030.html" title="Underwriters Laboratories">Underwriters Laboratories</a>. Since no code calls for your product and no standard exists to test it, you are not eligible for certification of your product, which I believe is your exclusive interest in here. If someone used your product without certification, there would probably be no law against it. However, nobody will touch it because without any certification, people worry about potential problems. Nobody will listen long enough to understand that going above and beyond the code (by using your product) is OK in and of itself and until industry supports your concept not much will happen.</p>
<p>Therefore, the concept of bounding is a thorn in your side because it is the very thing that keeps people from accepting, marketing, buying and selling your product. That, however, is not so much a legal requirement for your product as it is the necessity for comfort level with your product to stimulate the sales you want. That is exclusively what is at issue, which explains your sudden interest after the publication of your patent. If it were of interest generally, you would have challenged the matter previously. I did not want to air this here, but you forced my hand.</p>
<p>Now, specifically to your statements below:</p>
<p>The origin of the term is from the nuclear industry. Speak to anyone at the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission_894e.html" title="Nuclear Regulatory Commission">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>, in the OWFN building, for instance, or any licensed reactor, and you will hear that everyone knows that installed configurations must be bounded by acceptable test results. That is where the term is from.</p>
<p>Industry extended its use to the commercial/industrial realm.</p>
<p>The fact that you have questions about this underlies the fact that you have a way to go to attain your expert status.</p>

<p><i>Added note:</i> it occurs to me that perhaps we have a language issue? Maybe you're referring to whether certification is legally <i>binding</i>, i.e. whether it is a legal requirement that a certification test lab's standards be implemented? or whether a test lab is a legally binding authority, i.e. it is illegal to sell products of that category unless they are certified by the lab? --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeDayoub_964d.html" title="User:MikeDayoub">MikeDayoub</a> 18:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Author's Reply:</b> There is no language issue. The origin of the term is explained above. Your comment clearly exposes your fundamental need for industry understanding. The certification or testing lab uses public standards and when it publishes results of the tests, it is required to be able to document that it adhered to the standards in getting the results. Nobody on a construction site, for instance, can comply with ASTM E119. It's not possible. They don't fire test inside construction sites. UL has to comply to it whilst running a test. An authority likewise cannot be legally binding. Contractual terms are legally binding for parties to a contract.</p>

<p><i>Actually, bounding does not refer to a legal requirement. In the context of test labs, bounding refers to the max and minimum of test criteria. For example, in electronics one such parameter which is subject to bounding is the maximum joules a product will be subject to in a power surge test. Another example of bounding is when smoke detectors are tested, they are bounded by the conditions the detector would be subject to such as temperature, humidity, smoke density (obscuration) etc. Example: <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-0510104-194400/unrestricted/Lynch.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-0510104-194400/unrestricted/Lynch.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></i></p>
<p><b>Author's Reply:</b></p>
<p>Laboratories comply with test standards in order to maintain their accreditation. You could extend the term into that realm if you wish but it is not customary and I suggest you get acceptance from somone in the field of testing and certification. I don't think they're interested in the help. In the construction field, and particularly, though not exclusively, in fire protection, bounding, again, means that installed systems comply with certification listings in all respects.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/u/Talk%7EBounding_db3d.html" title="Edit section: MikeDayoub suggested advantages of bounding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeDayoub_964d.html" title="User:MikeDayoub">MikeDayoub</a> suggested advantages of bounding</span></h3>
<p><i>The advantages of bounding are</i></p>
<ul>
<li>customer usage of tested products can be recommended to be limited to those bounds</li>
<li>designs can be bounded (example: what the WTC can withstand in terms of shock, heat, etc.)</li>
<li>predictable test conditions</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Author's Reply:</b> It does not matter what you think the advantages of bounding are. The issue is code compliance. "Customer" terms are completely irrelevant here. Codes define that items whose fucntionality must be demonstrable, such as a 2 hour fire-resistance rating, must be tested to a public standard, such as ASTM E119. The standard number is shown in the code text. The codes further define that the items used in the field must be <b>included at the time of test</b>. That's the way codes put it. You cannot expect municipal building inspectors and fire prevention officers to pore over test results for every widget on a construction site. That would take ages. Consequently, they use the short versions of the test results, which are listings. Items installed in the field that comply with the listings in all respects are <i>bounded</i>. An <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authority_Having_Jurisdiction_5571.html" title="Authority Having Jurisdiction">Authority Having Jurisdiction</a>, is obliged by mandate to accept only the nationally accredited laboraties, who have accreditation not only for testing, but also for certification. This makes sense, because testers write no listings. Nobody would take responsibility for interpreting test results. That is why certifiers write listings. That is why AHJ's will only accept certification listings by nationally accredited certifiers, such as UL, ULC, etc. The use of such listings to be sure that installed conficurations are <b>bounded</b>, is the construction industry's means of complying with its fire codes and building codes. Whatever other advantages you may see, are not relevant. The only thing that matters here is the ability to prove that code compliance has been achieved. The absence of code compliance spells <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negligence.html" title="Negligence">negligence</a> and thus <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culpability.html" title="Culpability">culpability</a>. In construction, there is no tolerance for venturing outside this realm, which is what is hampering the commercial success of any products that do not fit the mould. To check this out for yourself, ask a local building inspector or fire prevention officer about using products that do not have this sort of back-up. In any civilised country, the result will be the same. If the use of the product is mandated by code, you have no alternative but to provide the back-up. If it goes above and beyond the code, you're on your own anyway. You advocate the use of your product for unoccupied buildings. The primary purpose of codes is life safety. If there's nobody whose life needs to be saved, you're into property protection and coninuity of operations, which falls outside the normal realm of codes in the first place.</p>

<p><i>In terms of structural fire protection, I believe bounding refers to surfaces of a structure where thermal transfer can be measured and inhibited, firestops can be installed, and smoke containment is possible. I don't think it's a legal term implying some sort of protection or liability, except for when products are used outside of the bounds defined for tests or implementation. Example: <a href="http://www.colocode.com/ftcollins/municipal/chapter5.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.colocode.com/ftcollins/municipal/chapter5.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (a municipal fire code) If you can provide references to support bounding as some sort of legal term, please do so because it would be a valuable learning experience for me. Unless references can be cited to support the previous versions of this article, I recommend it be replaced with a much shorter definition and the older content be moved to more suitable articles on test lab certification. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeDayoub_964d.html" title="User:MikeDayoub">MikeDayoub</a> 17:28, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>When installed configurations comply with systems or certification listings published by accredited certifiers, they are <i>bounded</i></p>
<p>Here is a specific government text reference to the term <b>bounding</b> in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passive_fire_protection.html" title="Passive fire protection">passive fire protection</a></p>
<p>A direct quote from the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission_894e.html" title="Nuclear Regulatory Commission">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>:</p>
<p><b>6. Comment. The basic premise of the NRC rule change fails to address industry experience in properly bounding fire tests for the myriad of fire seal configurations deployed throughout nuclear power stations. In one case, the licensee improperly used a single test to bound 2000 fire barrier penetration seals in many different fire seal configurations. This omission does not lend to the credibility of the agency's argument. Such evidence documents improperly tested seal configurations.</b></p>
<p>You can find that sentence on the following website from the US Government:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2000/secy2000-0080/2000-0080scy.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2000/secy2000-0080/2000-0080scy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2000/secy2000-0080/2000-0080scy.html</a></p>
<p>Here is another text reference from <a href="http://www.nirs.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.nirs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nirs.org/</a>:</p>
<p><b>3.1.c The Petitioner contends that after Duke Power performed the three-hour fire tests at Omega Point Laboratories they utilized a hose stream test in accordance with requirements of EEEI 634. The referenced test standard is used exclusively for electrical penetrations using a light shower of a fog nozzle hose stream test. The test required for all other penetrations seals (mechanical, seismic, etc.) is ASTM-E and requires a hose stream test that uses a standardized one and a half inch nozzle at 30 psi.</b></p>
<p><b>The Petitioner contends that the Duke Power fire test does not provide an adequate test for standard fire fighting techniques likely to be utilized in the event of fire at the applicant units. The much gentler fog nozzle hose stream test provides for a preserving shower of water and does not simulate the pressure rating behind a standardized play pipe hose stream.</b></p>
<p><b>The Petitioner therefore contends that the Duke qualifying fire tests do not provide the appropriate</b> <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounding.html" title="Bounding">bounding</a> <b>hose stream test for fire barrier penetrations seals in the applicant units to include all mechanical seals.</b></p>

<p><b>Installation requires that additional insulation material be placed on the top section of the cable trays, which, in turn, provides a more restrictive heat transfer system, potentially causing the cables to heat up to temperatures higher than those predicted by the test. This is a non-conservative requirement outside the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounding.html" title="Bounding">bounding</a> limits of the test.

<li>standards,</li>
<li>bounding for design, and</li>
<li>bounding for test inputs and test outputs.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>It might also be useful if we find citable prose for how bounding reduces liability for designers and implementors of procedures, emergency plans, products, structures and facilities. I will attempt to document verifiability using citations and links for some of the other prose in this article. The section on structural fire protection I propose moved to a fire protection article. The sections on confidentiality and governmental accreditation I propose be moved to articles describing different uses and types of test labs. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeDayoub_964d.html" title="User:MikeDayoub">MikeDayoub</a> 14:47, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><i>1. your editing question</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You are free to edit, as is anyone else. Reversing edits is also equally fair ball, especially if the edits are demonstrably without basis in fact. The above questions and answers clearly establish your need for expert knowledge in this field, without which, it is unwise to alter expert text. That does not prevent you from editing, but at some point, it may be deemed vandalism. You were clearly proven wrong above, offered no counter argument and refused to keep the debate to e-mail between us, preferring to carry on a dispute on here. Even the commercial basis, as the sole motivation for your edits, the motive of commercial success for your patent <a href="http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, you have no rebuttal for. The offer to have a telephone discussion, you likewise did not respond to. Instead, more verbiage on here.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>2. "bounding as a legal term"</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You are still not getting it, after many repetitions of the same thing, in the article, on this talk page and in e-mails to your house. Legal back-up for an installed configuration, or due diligence is proven via bounding. there are now three places for you to look this up...</p>
<ul>
<li><i>3. "proposed edits by Michael Dayoub"</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>standards,</li>
<li>bounding for design, and</li>
<li>bounding for test inputs and test outputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, you still don't get it. While it is possible to extend the term to those or a number of other fields, it is not currently in use there. It would not sui any purpose whatsoerver for you to attempt to superimpose terminology into any fields of which you obviously know absolutely nothing. You don't know about these fields because they are not your fields. You have a commercial interest in the success of your patent. You perceive this article appears to be a thorn in your side. If you attempt to use Wikipedia to superimpose terminology into unrelated fields, that is called <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> and it will get you locked out of here. If you told me that you were a member on a task group at Undwrwriters Laboratories or ASTM or ULC on a consensus standard and the term were used there, then your word would carry some credibility. However, that does not appear to be the case. Bounding is a field term in construction. No standard is deemed to be "bounded" by anything. That is not the language used in the standards writing world, of which I have been a part and of which you have no knowledge whatsoever, as is extremely clear from your prose here.</p>
<p>Likewise, design teams in cosntructions muist abide by codes and the standards to which the refer and sound engineering practice. While the term could be used there, there is no evidence that it is actually in use, which would make your contemplated edits nothing other than commercially motivated vandalism.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Test inputs and outputs?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>That little catchphrase you just invented is likewise not in use in the world of product testing and certification. I have run hundreds of tests over the years in my own labs and in third party labs such as ULI, ULC, TUB, Nelson/Tulsa and more. You can see one example right here: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/astximw/test.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/astximw/test.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/astximw/test.html</a>. The term bounding is not used in that realm. It IS used where described in the article.</p>
<p>So, I can't stop you from editing and neither can you stop anyone else from reversing what you intend to do. If you're going to do it though, I suggest you do your homework a little better and answer the biggest question of all:</p>
<p><b>What is <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeDayoub_964d.html" title="User:MikeDayoub">MikeDayoub</a>'s editing motive apart from his commercial interest in his patent <a href="http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freshpatents.com/Power-strip-with-smoke-detection-auto-shutoff-dt20050804ptan20050168901.php" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which has trouble succeeding because its use is not a code requirement and because there is no specific standard to test it meaning that bounding cannot be established, which hampers distribution and sales?</b>--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 23:57, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Bounding refers to a legal requirement for goods and services whose use is mandated by law. It means adhering to the requirements of installing and/or using safety-related products and items in conformance with an active certification listing that has been issued by an organisation that is nationally accredited both for testing AND product certification.</i></p>
<p><i>Products whose use is not mandated by any <a href="../../../b/u/i/Building_code.html" title="Building code">building codes</a> or fire codes often lack a consensus test method. Unless there is a test standard in existence to prove the functionality and reliability of such a product, there can be no certification listings and thus no bounding. Such new products may be seen as optional, or going above and beyond the requirements of a code.</i>--<a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 00:05, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. Surely a technical term ought not to have evolved a definition that's too far from common sense meaning. Shouldn't "bounding" mean (a) necessity of the set of bounds is satisfied by the instance: that a particular system's components can be demonstrated to have measurable attributes that are within the bounds that would be necessary for acceptable performance (necessary -- that if not all were satisfied then unacceptable performance would/could occur); and (b) the set of bounds is sufficient: that as long as each attribute is within its bound, then that is sufficient to guarantee that a system will have acceptable performance?</p>
<p>If you want to see a technical term that's too stretched, check out the definition of "ideas of reference" in DSM IV TR.</p>
<p>2. "[...] insurance adjusters will seek evidence that bounding has generally been occurred." "Been occurred"???!</p>
