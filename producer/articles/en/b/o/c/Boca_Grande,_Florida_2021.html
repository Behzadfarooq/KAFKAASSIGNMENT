<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/c/Boca_Grande%2C_Florida_2021.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p><b>Boca Grande</b> is a small residential community on <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasparilla_Island_606f.html" title="Gasparilla Island">Gasparilla Island</a>, southwest <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. It is a part of both <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_County%2C_Florida_f898.html" title="Charlotte County, Florida">Charlotte</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_County%2C_Florida_fdc0.html" title="Lee County, Florida">Lee</a> Counties, which is home to many seasonal and year-round residents.</p>
<p>Its name - <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> for "Big Mouth" - comes from the mouth of the waterway, called Boca Grande Pass, at the southern tip of the island. The pass was used as a busy shipping point for many years as the waters in the pass are naturally deep. Processed <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphate.html" title="Phosphate">phosphate</a> from the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_Valley_6261.html" title="Bone Valley">Bone Valley</a> region would be loaded onto waiting cargo vessels via. the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaboard_Air_Line_Railway_ce67.html" title="Seaboard Air Line Railway">Seaboard Air Line Railway</a> at the dock located on the southern tip of the island. Shipping business to the island declined when the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_of_Tampa_d7ee.html" title="Port of Tampa">Port of Tampa</a> was later <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dredge.html" title="Dredge">dredged</a> and phosphate shipping operations moved north to locations along <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa_Bay_1819.html" title="Tampa Bay">Tampa Bay</a>. Evidence of the island's industrial past can still be seen.</p>
<p>Space is at a premium on Boca Grande, so many local residents use a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf_cart.html" title="Golf cart">golf cart</a> as their main mode of transportation. On any given day in Boca Grade, you will see golf carts, as well as automobiles, making their way throughout downtown. A Lee County ordinance designates all but two streets as golf cart paths.</p>
<p>Boca Grande also provided the backdrop for <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denzel_Washington_8230.html" title="Denzel Washington">Denzel Washington's</a> movie, <i><a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_of_Time_%28film%29_03f5.html" title="Out of Time (film)">Out of Time</a></i>, where the quiet village was re-named 'Banyan Key' in reference to the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banyan.html" title="Banyan">banyan</a> trees that populate the island. Scenes for the <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoot_%28film%29.html" title="Hoot (film)">2006 film</a> based on <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Hiaasen_9c26.html" title="Carl Hiaasen">Carl Hiaasen</a>'s book <i><a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoot_%28novel%29.html" title="Hoot (novel)">Hoot</a></i> were also filmed on the island.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Charley_4177.html" title="Hurricane Charley">Hurricane Charley</a> hit Boca Grande heavily on August 13, 2004, causing some 20 billion US dollars' worth of damage to <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Florida_ffdd.html" title="Southwest Florida">Southwest Florida</a>. There were no deaths or injuries on the island, but many buildings were damaged and most of the banyan trees were heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Boca is very popular with affluent holiday makers, many of whom keep a <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottage.html" title="Cottage">second home</a> on the island. There is a degree of animosity between year-round residents and those who come to spend the winter months on the island.</p>
<p>The sleepy community regularly hosts members of Governor <a href="../../../j/e/b/Jeb_Bush_d0e2.html" title="Jeb Bush">Jeb Bush</a> and President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

<p>Boca Grande is known as the Tarpon Fishing Capital of the World. Each spring and summer, tarpon migrate to Boca Grande Pass by the thousands. Tarpon fishing plays a vital role in Boca Grande's economy. Unlike most Florida resort communities that depend on "Snowbird" winter tourism, Boca Grande continues to flourish in the spring and summer months. In addition to tarpon fishing in Boca Grande Pass, Gasparilla Island provides excellent backwater fishing for snook, redfish, trout and other species.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Hammerhead sharks are common in Boca Grande Pass. A <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Charlotte%2C_Florida_6c71.html" title="Port Charlotte, Florida">Port Charlotte, Florida</a> man named Bucky Dennis caught a new world record 1,280 pound <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammerhead_shark.html" title="Hammerhead shark">hammerhead shark</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, in Boca Grande, Florida. Mr. Dennis was alone on his boat when the 12-and-a-half foot animal took the bait -- a 25-pound <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stingray.html" title="Stingray">stingray</a>. A friend on a nearby vessel climbed aboard Mr. Dennis boat to help. The five-foot-nine, 180-pound man also used shoulder harnesses. Mr. Dennis says they finally got the shark on the boat after about five hours <a href="http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/florida/news-article.aspx?storyid=58228" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/florida/news-article.aspx?storyid=58228" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p><a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasparilla_Island_606f.html" title="Gasparilla Island">Gasparilla Island</a>'s first inhabitants were the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calusa.html" title="Calusa">Calusa</a> Indians. They were living on nearby Useppa Island by 5,000 B.C. and on Gasparilla Island by 800 or 900 A.D. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Harbor_%28estuary%29_7ec0.html" title="Charlotte Harbor (estuary)">Charlotte Harbor</a> was the center of the Calusa Empire, which numbered thousands of people and hundreds of fishing villages. The Calusa were a <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">hunting</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a> people who perfected the art of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maritime_nation.html" title="Maritime nation">maritime</a> living in harmony with the environment. They were a politically powerful people, dominating <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Florida_ffdd.html" title="Southwest Florida">Southwest Florida</a> during their "golden age." Since the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calusa.html" title="Calusa">Calusa</a> had no written language, the only record we have of their lifestyle and ceremonies comes from the oral history of the (much later) <a href="../../../s/e/m/Seminoles.html" title="Seminoles">Seminoles</a>, from written accounts of Spanish explorers, and from the archaeological record. The first contact the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calusa.html" title="Calusa">Calusa</a> had with the white man came during Spanish explorations at the beginning of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>. By the mid 1700s the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calusa.html" title="Calusa">Calusa</a> had all but disappeared, the victims of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> diseases, slavery and warfare.</p>
<p>Just like the Indians, the earliest settlers came to Gasparilla Island to fish. By the late 1870s several fish ranches were operating in the Charlotte Harbor area. One of them would later be at the north end of Gasparilla Island in the small village called Gasparilla. The fishermen, many of them <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_people.html" title="Spanish people">Spanish</a> or <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuban</a>, caught huge catches of <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullet_%28fish%29.html" title="Mullet (fish)">mullet</a> and other fish and salted them down for shipment to <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a> and other markets. In the 1940s the Gasparilla Fishery was moved to Placida across the bay, where it still stands today, and the fishing village died out. Today, many of Boca Grande's early fishing families are still represented in third, fourth and even fifth generation descendants who pursue many different vocations, including fishing.</p>
<p>In 1885 <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphate.html" title="Phosphate">phosphate</a> rock was discovered on the banks of the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_River_%28Florida%29_ea7f.html" title="Peace River (Florida)">Peace River</a> just above <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punta_Gorda%2C_Florida_6be5.html" title="Punta Gorda, Florida">Punta Gorda</a>, east of Gasparilla Island across Charlotte Harbor. It was this discovery that would turn the south end of Gasparilla Island into a major deep water port (Boca Grande Pass is one of the deepest natural inlets in Florida) and become responsible for the development of the town of Boca Grande. Wealthy American and British sportsmen began discovering the Charlotte Harbor area for its fantastic fishing (notably for the world class game fish tarpon) and hunting. It was these two discoveries - phosphate rock and fishing - that would put Boca Grande "on the map."</p>
<p>Phosphate was a valuable mineral for fertilizers and many other products, and was in great demand worldwide. At first the phosphate was barged down the Peace River to Port Boca Grande, where it was loaded onto <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schooners.html" title="Schooners">schooners</a> for worldwide shipment. But by 1905 it was felt that building a railroad to Port Boca Grande and carrying the phosphate to it by rail should improve the method of shipment.</p>
<p>In 1905 officials of the Agrico subsidiary Peace River Mining Company, along with engineers from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers_511b.html" title="United States Army Corps of Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> and 60 laborers, landed on Gasparilla Island and surveying and construction of the railroad began. Probably the only buildings on the island at this time were the lighthouse and the assistant keeper's house at the extreme southern tip of the island. The railroad terminus with its 1,000-foot long pier would be built nearby. The Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railroad was completed in 1907. For the next 50 years phosphate would be shipped out of the state-of-the-art port virtually without disruption. Phosphate laden trains were off loaded directly onto ocean going freighters, and the ships took the valuable commodity to ports all over the world. In 1969 Port Boca Grande ranked as the fourth busiest port in Florida.</p>
<p>In the 1970s phosphate companies increasingly switched their interest to ports in <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillsborough_County%2C_Florida_a5cf.html" title="Hillsborough County, Florida">Hillsborough</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manatee_County%2C_Florida_c18f.html" title="Manatee County, Florida">Manatee Counties</a>. As more money was put into developing these ports, traffic into Port Boca Grande began to dwindle, and in 1979 the line was abandoned and the phosphate industry in Boca Grande came to an end. The port was also used as an oil storage terminal by Florida Power and Light Company. This use ceased in 2001. The oil storage tanks were subsequently removed from the nine-acre site at the southern tip of Gasparilla Island adjacent to the century-old <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasparilla_Island_Lights_aaa1.html" title="Gasparilla Island Lights">Boca Grande lighthouse</a>. Island residents have begun an effort to have the property preserved as part of the island's state park system.</p>
<p>The Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railroad not only brought phosphate and supplies to Gasparilla Island; it also brought wealthy people from the north. By 1910 Boca Grande Pass was already famous for its unequaled <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarpon.html" title="Tarpon">tarpon</a> fishing among fishermen, who stayed on nearby <a href="../../../u/s/e/Useppa_Island_999e.html" title="Useppa Island">Useppa Island</a>. The Agrico Company, having begun to see the potential of the idea of developing Gasparilla Island beyond the port, began to develop the village of Boca Grande.</p>
<p>The railroad station in what would become downtown was built; roads, sidewalks, streetlights, shops, a post office, and water and telephone service were not far behind. The town was landscaped, including the now famous section of Second Street called Banyan Street. The railroad company built several cottages downtown and a few wealthy families from "up north" purchased land and built winter residences. The train stopped at Gasparilla, the fishing village at the north end of the island, at the railroad depot in downtown Boca Grande, and at the south end phosphate terminal.</p>
<p>In 1929 the Boca Grande Hotel was built just south of downtown Boca Grande. It was a three-story, brick resort hotel where most of the island weathered the hurricane of 1944. The Boca Grande Hotel changed hands and was demolished in 1975. It took six months to raze the building by means of fire and the wrecking ball, as it had been built to withstand fire and great storms.</p>
<p>The railroad continued to bring the grand visitors from all along the eastern seaboard until the Boca Grande Causeway opened in 1958. The depot was restored in the 1970s and a number of shops, offices and a restaurant now occupy the old building. The railroad continued to run work trains to the south end until the phosphate port closed in 1979. The community transformed the old bed of the railroad into a new use, Boca Grande's popular Bike Path. Boca Grande has become a unique community, with a large number of wealthy winter residents rubbing elbows with the fishermen and railroad and port workers who formed the permanent, year-round working</p>
