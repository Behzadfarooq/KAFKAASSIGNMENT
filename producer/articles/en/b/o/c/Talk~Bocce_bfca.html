<p>Question... In addition to the obvious 2 colors (4 balls per color), I see many ball sets sold with 4 colors (2 balls per color), plus the pallino. What's the intent? Is there a 4-team game played with 2 balls per team, or is it simply two colors per team, intermixed or ...? Just curious. --<a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDs13_da5c.html" title="User:Ds13">Ds13</a> 23:42, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A: DS, Theoretically, there could be a 4 team game of bocce with each person throwing two balls. In this case the 4 color set would come in handy. Either that or the normal two team game, with each team taking two colors.</p>
<p>Even in two color sets, however, each ball is differentiated from the others by the score line inscribed on it. In this way it is possible to keep track of which balls each team member is throwing. Typically, the 4 color sets are of lower quality and made for more informal play... in this way the 4 colors make it more 'fun'.</p>

<p>A: I believe any similarity is tenuous. In curling, the objective is to score points by getting your stones as close as possible to a target, but there the similarity ends. In curling, the target is fixed at the other end of a playing zone, with no jack, and the path of the stones can be influenced as they travel by other team members brushing the ice; the main skills required are fine judgment of speed, curl and deflection from other stones.</p>
<p>It does, however, closely resemble boules, petanque, and bowls.</p>

<p>Someone has proposed merging <a href="../../../b/o/c/Boccia.html" title="Boccia">Boccia</a> into this article - although they have not posted any justification for that proposal either here or on <a href="../../../b/o/c/Talk%7EBoccia_0485.html" title="Talk:Boccia">Talk:Boccia</a>. I don't think a merge is justified. Boccia is a distinct sport for athletes with a disability; while it is related to Bocce, they are no more the same game than are <a href="../../../p/%C3%A9/t/P%C3%A9tanque.html" title="Pétanque">pétanque</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowls.html" title="Bowls">bowls</a>. <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> 19:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I concur with EronMain's logic and position. DO NOT MERGE. N2e 03:36, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think a merge of Boccia into Bocce is reasonable. What we call "Bocce" and, presumably, what the Bocce article should cover are simple variants of:</p>
<ul>
<li>ball color</li>
<li>ball material</li>
<li>number of players</li>
<li>game length</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Boccia appears to me as essentially just more of the above, with a derivative name, why not consistently cover yet another variation here? --<a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDs13_da5c.html" title="User:Ds13">Ds13</a> 04:11, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Other sports variants are covered in their own articles - see <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">Rugby union</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">Rugby league</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_sevens.html" title="Rugby sevens">Rugby sevens</a>, or for a more directly pertinent example, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">Basketball</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheelchair_basketball.html" title="Wheelchair basketball">Wheelchair basketball</a>.

<dd>Sure, fair principle. But those are very large, deep articles. We have nearly a stub here with Bocce — more content, including variations, could be included at this point to strengthen it. An example to counter yours (there are many) might be <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_%28sport%29.html" title="Ultimate (sport)">Ultimate (sport)</a>, with its significantly different variants of Indoor Ultimate and Beach Ultimate included in the main article. Anyways, I'm game for whatever the majority thinks will make the strongest article(s) for both Boccia and Bocce — if that means 90%+ copy-and-paste for the basic mechanics of play, then so be it. --<a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDs13_da5c.html" title="User:Ds13">Ds13</a> 05:22, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I largely agree with Eron, though I see your point. Sports where there's unlikely to be any expansion, sure, merger would make sense - but I feel that both of these could be expanded, and that that would be a better thing to happen than running these articles together. Sure, the articles are currently small, but there's no reason to believe that will always be true in this case. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 12:18, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also agree with Eron. Boccia is a separate sport, with its own rules and equipment. It cannot effectively be given a section within this article. I suggest things be left the way they are. --<span style="padding: 2px; background-color:#000000">&#160;<a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoyagerfan5761_88e3.html" title="User:Voyagerfan5761"><font color="#FFCC66">Tuvok</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">^</font><sup><a href="../../../v/o/y/User_talk%7EVoyagerfan5761_18dc.html" title="User talk:Voyagerfan5761"><font color="#99CCFF">Talk</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">|</font><a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoyagerfan5761_Desk_cffc.html" title="User:Voyagerfan5761/Desk"><font color="#FFFF99">Desk</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">|</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Voyagerfan5761_de53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Voyagerfan5761"><font color="#CC99CC">Contribs</font></a></sup>&#160;</span> 22:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my humble and diffident opinion, some explanation of the game would be nice. I see that the greatest player of all time has been designated ... so is the game still played?

<dd>Yes, and it was in the article before a lot of vandalism during the month of November. I just looked at the November 7th version of the article. That version had a good explanation of rules and play, and an excellent graphic. I don't have time to look at all the vandalism and figure out the best material to merge back into the current article -- but that is what needs to be done. In the mean time, you can get the rules by looking at some older version of the article. N2e 06:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The article is short and already has a picture of bocce balls and a diagram, so if someone wants to figure out where to place it in the article, have at.

<p>I think the section is wrong since I would never say that the <i>objective</i> of the game is to hit another ball. The goal is throw your ball and make it land as close as possible to the little ball. Hitting other balls that might be already close is a strategy, but not the ultimate goal. 200.101.50.150 18:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
