<p>Why did you redirect <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_series_c8f9.html" title="Mega Man series">Mega Man series</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_b93e.html" title="Mega Man">Mega Man</a>, then <i>move</i> <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_b93e.html" title="Mega Man">Mega Man</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28series%29_3a71.html" title="Mega Man (series)">Mega Man (series)</a>?

<dl>
<dd>How are they still broken if it the redirects all point to the same place? On the other hand, I have no clue how the talk page disappeared... <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 20:28, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They are broken because pages that point to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_series_c8f9.html" title="Mega Man series">Mega Man series</a> (go ahead and click the link) now point to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_b93e.html" title="Mega Man">Mega Man</a>, which is a redirect to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28series%29_3a71.html" title="Mega Man (series)">Mega Man (series)</a>.. so it doesn't redirect twice.</dd>
<dd>The Talk page is broken because you didn't move the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_series_c8f9.html" title="Mega Man series">Mega Man series</a> page with its Talk page to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28series%29_3a71.html" title="Mega Man (series)">Mega Man (series)</a>. And then you edited the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28series%29_3a71.html" title="Mega Man (series)">Mega Man (series)</a> Talk page which makes it impossible to repair easily.</dd>
<dd>Plus, ALL OF THE EDIT HISTORY IS GONE. And you did NOT RECEIVE CONSENSUS as to why the move was neccessary. --<a href="../../../b/o/c/User%7EBoco_XLVII_2771.html" title="User:Boco XLVII">Boco XLVII</a> 20:31, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Waitasec... I moved it to "Mega Man (series)" instead of "Mega Man series" <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 20:29, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And as for the reason why I moved it in the first place... one doesn't need "series" to disambiguate it. "InuYasha" doesn't have (series) on it, after all. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 20:31, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, thank you very much for caring about the common uses of the term and how it applies to multiple things that were already disambiguated. Also, thank you for ignoring the consensus that moved it <i>away</i> from <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_b93e.html" title="Mega Man">Mega Man</a> in the first place, and for not trying to achieve a consensus on the Talk page before screwing tons of things up.</dd>
<dd>If you want it to be like this, at least fix it so your move was transparent. Fix ALL THE LINKS that point to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_series_c8f9.html" title="Mega Man series">Mega Man series</a>, fix the Talk page, make sure none of the edit history was lost, etc.</dd>
<dd>And stop posting on my talk page. THe discussion is here; if you want it to be on my talk page move the whole thing. --<a href="../../../b/o/c/User%7EBoco_XLVII_2771.html" title="User:Boco XLVII">Boco XLVII</a> 20:41, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've decided to move the whole thing here. I'll just refresh every now and then to see if anything has been added.</dd>
<dd>For the matter, I see redirects that should be individual articles (e.g. Mega Man II) <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 21:12, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And I was trying to move it back, but I guess I slipped up.. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 20:39, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first redirect to become an article: <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_II_ec21.html" title="Mega Man II">Mega Man II</a> <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 21:26, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Individual games in the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_Classic_59f6.html" title="Mega Man Classic">Mega Man Classic</a> seiries should probably be redirected to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_Classic_59f6.html" title="Mega Man Classic">Mega Man Classic</a> unless/until they have more content than that page provides.</dd>
<dd>Have you already requested admin assistance in restoring the Talk and edit history to the metaseries article? I still disagree with moving it but it's more hassle to move it back than it is to fix it. --<a href="../../../b/o/c/User%7EBoco_XLVII_2771.html" title="User:Boco XLVII">Boco XLVII</a> 21:34, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am an admin, so I'll get that done on my own. As for the articles, there are so many individual Mega Man games from the "Classic" universe alone that having all of the information related to them on one page would be daunting. There are six NES games, two SNES games, five Game Boy games, and a few Playstation games as well. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 22:17, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You missed quite a few. Anyway, unless there's more information than you provided on <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_II_ec21.html" title="Mega Man II">Mega Man II</a> I still think it should be redirected. See the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Talk%7EMega_Man_II_744f.html" title="Talk:Mega Man II">Talk:Mega Man II</a> page, by the way. --<a href="../../../b/o/c/User%7EBoco_XLVII_2771.html" title="User:Boco XLVII">Boco XLVII</a> 22:30, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm back after a 4-day hiatus. I'm gonna add brief summaries of articles (which are seen all over Wikipedia) like Mega Man X series and MegaMan NT Warrior to the Mega Man article, as it makes the latter a better article. - The summaries will have the "Main article: XXX" tag. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 01:25, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I do not like having everything redirected to "Mega Man Classic" because it doesn't directly lead to the information specific to that game (I.E. Robot Masters, new techniques in the game) - I just realized that the redirects from "titles" were there before I created the game-specific articles. I'm redirecting those to the game articles. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 06:44, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sometime someone should make a page that contains the timeline of the events in the Mega Man Universe, which could include Megaman/Rockman, Megaman X, and Megaman Zero, and then any other series people feel like need to be covered. I guess the years and events would range then from 2008 to some time in the 2200s, unless people wanted to say that in the 1930s or '40s Dr. Light and Wily were born, but anyhow, it would make for an interesting page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some events in the 70s are useful for the EXE series, so a timeline could cover before 200x. But a lot of problems with timelining is that we don't know specific years or dates for most events. Yes, the Nobel Prize ceremony was in 2007, so the Robot Master (Blues? Rock? All 9 originals?) had been created before then, but when? And yes, the first game happened in late 2008. But after that the timeline gets a little hazy. Exactly when does the World series happen in relation to the originals? What <i>is</i> the correct order between <i>8</i>, <i>Battle &amp; Chase</i>, <i>Power Fighters</i>, and <i>Rockman &amp; Forte</i>? Does <i>Rockman &amp; Forte WS</i> count as canon? When exactly is X unearthed (is it April 2114 or not)? and when does the first X game happen (is it December 2118 in Australia or not)? A strict timeline doesn't actually exist for the series and wouldn't be as useful as thought. Of course, timelines for the <i>X</i> series and for the <i>EXE</i> series can keep the sidestory games in line (<i>Transmission</i> is between <i>EXE</i> and <i>EXE 2</i> for example) but that kind of thing can be covered on the series pages.</dd>
<dd>Also, please sign comments in Talk space using four tildes. --<a href="../../../b/o/c/User%7EBoco_XLVII_2771.html" title="User:Boco XLVII">Boco XLVII</a> 1 July 2005 04:58 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I looked in the manual for <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockman_%26_Forte_d4c6.html" title="Rockman &amp; Forte">Rockman &amp; Forte</a> for the SFC/SNES the other day (I own a copy of the game) and yes, it does say that <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Wily_b9bc.html" title="Dr. Wily">Dr. Wily</a> is 57 years old by that game, so the timeline that we had worked up so far would be somewhat decent. But that aside, on the note about whether or not <i>Rockman &amp; Forte: Challenger from the Future</i> is really cannon or not, I'm inclined to say no due to the fact that Bandai really developed the game only with <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capcom.html" title="Capcom">Capcom</a>'s licensing. Also, the game has a timestamp of <a href="../../../2/0/0/200X_78e9.html" title="200X">200X</a> as the year, which completely destroys the timeline, especially since <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28Mega_Man%29_ef8b.html" title="Bass (Mega Man)">Bass (Forte)</a> wasn't developed until <a href="../../../2/0/x/20XX_3a7e.html" title="20XX">20XX</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/g/Megaman_7.html" title="Megaman 7">Megaman 7</a> (Rockman 7)...Just a thought! --<a href="../../../y/a/h/User%7EYahweh_divine_85ff.html" title="User:Yahweh divine">Yahweh</a> 18:08, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether or not <i>R&amp;F WS</i> is canon only matters when talking about whether Quint is dead, though.

<p>Sounds like a good idea.

<p>I found it incredibly ironic and infuriating that all of the Rockman X games which Inafune has admitted were outside his plans were credited to be designed to him, I removed his mention from the X games he specifically mention he didnt have a hand on, but I'd really like to know exactly which of the megaman titles he worked on, and tought you'd be the best guy to ask!

<dd>Well, he IS the series creator. Anyway, he is producer on all games, and director on the classic series 1-8, X1-X4, both main DASH games, and the EXE series (I think all 6). He also had a hand in the World series on GameBoy, X5, and the Zero series, I think as scenario writer? or original concept? or associate director? or something? It's best just to check the game in question's credits. --<a href="../../../b/o/c/User%7EBoco_XLVII_2771.html" title="User:Boco XLVII">Boco XLVII</a> 06:45, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I've expanded this article expodentially.

<p>Hi Boco XLVII. Since you're a Wikipedian and also a member of Bisqwit's site, I'd like to direct your attention to the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool-assisted_speedrun.html" title="Tool-assisted speedrun">tool-assisted speedrun</a> article, which I would like to do an improvement drive for this weekend. I'll personally be editing it heavily to try to bring it up to the status of good article, but I'll need the help of good editors who know a lot about the phenomenon. It would be great if you could help out! The <a href="../../../t/o/o/Talk%7ETool-assisted_speedrun_2b1c.html" title="Talk:Tool-assisted speedrun">talk page</a> contains some information that you could get started with. In case you're up for some editing, see you there! —<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichiel_Sikma_a1b1.html" title="User:Michiel Sikma">Michiel Sikma</a>, 06:38, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
