<p>im not done with my story but when i m i will add the rest Chapter 1 Today at school our teacher Mrs. Herflier told us that we were going to be learning about the art of cooking. Yea for me I hate cooking. Last time I tried to cook I ended up burning our house down. So we moved to Enderville, Massachusetts. Now I go to Enderville High and have only two friends, my boyfriend Ankar and my best friend Renee. I think that it is weird that Ankar and Renee love cooking and I hate cooking. RING! Oh it is the bell got to go. After school Renee and I were walking home from school, when Bobby Hilfsmore jumped out of the bushes, “roar,” he said I his dumb ha ha I scared you voice. “Oh my gosh that was so not scary,” I said in my best sarcastic voice. “Renee did I scare you?” he asked in a shy disappointed voice. “No you weren’t even a little bit scary. And just to let you know, a piece of paper with my name on it could have frightened me more than you frightened me,” Renee replied laughing her head off. When Bobby left we decided to go to the park. “Hey Claire were you invited to Kiyla’s party tonight?” Renee questioned. “No, but even if I was, I couldn’t go. I have dance recital tonight and tomorrow night. I also have to get ready for my date with Ankar,” I responded sort of bummed. When I got home from hanging out with Renee at the park I decided to call Grandma. I haven’t talked to Grandma in a good four months. Grandma and I talked about Ankar and how sweet, cute, and helpful he is. Then about cooking and how she thought it was weird that she loved cooking and I didn’t like cooking. I had to correct her on that because I don’t like cooking one bit and told her I HATE COOKING! Once Grandma and I were done talking I decided to work on my homework. I had math, reading, and english. It was all so boring. Since it was so boring I didn’t do a single subject and fell asleep with my books on top of me. Chapter 2 Friday when I got to school I had english first the teacher wasn’t to pleased that I didn’t do all of my homework. I got an unprepared and was sent to detention. The detention only lasted fifteen minutes because the teacher got sick and had to go home. So I was able to make it to math class where I got another unprepared for not having my homework done. This time I didn’t have to go to detention because there was no teacher there. Then it was time for cooking which was good because I didn’t have any homework so I couldn’t get an unprepared, but bad since I actually had to cook. During cooking I got sick and had to go home. Since I was at home and all of my friends were still at school, I was actually going to do my homework. The homework actually wasn’t that hard. When I was done with all of homework. My friends were knocking on the door. “Come in!” I yelled at the top of my lungs. “Hey Claire you want to go to the park?” Renee asked me. We decided to go to the park. We were there for an hour, when I had to leave for dance, Renee started crying. She didn’t want me to leave since she hadn’t seen me at school all day. I don’t really like dance, but mom made me join when I was in first grade. It was the first time in 5 weeks that I didn’t mind being there. During dance Ankar text me to see what was going on. He had forgotten that I had dance on Thursday and Fridays. I told him I would call him back when I got home from dance. When I got home at 9 I immediately called Ankar and told him how we started the cooking unit and how I hate cooking. Well we were talking we got in a huge fight and almost broke up. So I just hung up on him and went to bed. Chapter 3 I woke up to the annoying beeping noise my alarm makes. I was pouring my bowl of cereal when I realized that Kiyla and Renee were sitting my kitchen. That was really weird since Kiyla hates me. “So why are you two here?” I asked puzzled and confused. “Oh you were talking to me? We were wondering why you didn’t come to my party last night. It was like the best party ever,” Kiyla snapped back in a crabby brat-like voice. “Oh you were talking to me? Well for your information I had dance and was throwing-up. So if you have a problem with that the door is right there,” I said pointing at the door and giving here a really dirty look. We argued for about 20 more minutes. After we were done arguing we all walked to school together. On our way to school we got in an even bigger fight than last time, and ended up being late to school. Since we were late to school we got detention. Detention at our school only last 2 periods. We only missed reading and math and were able to make it to cooking on time. Cooking was actually a blast today. I actually enjoyed myself for once. I found myself starting to like cooking a little. We learned how to separate the white part of the egg from the yolk. Not the shell but the nasty white stuff in the middle. RING! Got to go. Renee is still mad at me so I ended up walking home all by myself. I wish Ankar was here, I still love him after the fight. At home I decided to have something to eat. Since my mom was at the hospital having her fourth and hopefully final child, I had to make it all by myself. She had me my stepbrother Cole, my stepsister Ali, and my new stepbrother Klye. My step dad Tia was at the hospital supporting my mom. I wish I was there. My mom got remarried a year ago to Tia, after my daddy Tyler died in a fatal plane crash. I miss him so much. After thinking about that I felt like calling Ankar and apologizing for starting the fight last night, but it is so hard to talk well crying. Chapter 4 I got really tired from crying for four hours straight. So I went to bed at 8 and got up at 6 this morning. It took me forever to get to school since I was crying the whole way to school. When I got to school, my teacher asked me what was wrong since my nose was as red as Rudolph. I told her the whole story and she started crying. RING! I don’t want to go to my next class, I will be so embarrassed with my nose looking like Rudolph’s nose. I ended up going home early. The teacher said that I was crying so hard that I was being a distraction to the class. Renee called me and told me what we did in ever class that I missed. I was excited to hear what we did in cooking. She said, “All we in cooking today was bake chocolate chip cookies,” then she asked, “ Why were you crying?” I told her the whole story and she started crying too. “Hang on there is someone on the other line,” CLICK, “Hello who is this?” “Hey its Ankar. I heard you were crying at school today. So what happened?” “I don’t want to talk about it,” CLICK!, I hung up on both of them. I ran to my room and started crying and screaming. When my dad got home, well my step dad. I was crying so hard I could barely breathe. “Calm down and tell me what’s wrong honey,” my dad answered in a very sweet voice. I was think about my dad and started crying and my friends started getting all up in my business. I got mad and hung up on them,” I cried back in a teary voice. Chapter 5 My little sister Latera woke me up this morning. I HATE HER!! “Shut your fat mouth Latera. No one wants to her your bratty little voice,” I screamed back at the top of my lungs. “Mommyyyyyyyyy, Claire just punched me! Owwwwy!” “I didn’t even touch her all she’s doing is trying to get me in trouble,” I said in a crabby voice, “Mom can I go over to Renee’s house.” “No, it’s Saturday and you know that you have a cake to bake for great grandma Franck’s birthday tomorrow,” my mom answered. “But…um…I hate cooking! Why can’t you bake the cake? Well I don’t care what you say I am going to Renee’s anyway,” I replied as I slammed the backdoor in her face and took off running. My mom opened the door and yelled, “You get back her right now young lady or else. Or else I will ground you for 2 months. You have to the count of three to get back her right now…1...2...3. You are grounded for 2 months.” At this point I couldn’t hear her anymore and why should I care about grounded it is not like I am never not grounded. After walking for like a half hour I was pooped. But Renee’s house was like right there. I walked over and rang the doorbell. Her mom answered the door. “Hi, Renee what brings you here today?” “Oh I was wondering if Renee could bake a cake with me. It is for my great grandma’s 75th birthday tomorrow.” “Sure I bet Renee would love to help bake a cake. Let me get her for you, RENEE!” her mom screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>
