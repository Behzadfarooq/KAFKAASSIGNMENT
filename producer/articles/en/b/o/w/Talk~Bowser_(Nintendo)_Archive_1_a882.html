<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bowser-Voldemort</span></h2>
<p>In New Super Mario Bros. Bowser is killed in the lava in the first level of the game, but in the final castle, Bowser Jr. gives him back a more powerful body using a potion, similar to voldemort.</p>
<p>and in Luigi's Mansion, Bowser's dead (somehow) and is ressurected by King Boo, and is transferred into a painting at the end of the game. However, Bowser's body was left in the Roof-Dimension inside the mario painting. Could it be that the Bowser head we see in the ghost Portificationaizer along with King Boo is a ghostly part of Bowser, possibly a frament of Bowser's soul, Similar to Voldemort's horcruxes!</p>
<p>It is possible, that as long as the painting of Bowser and King Boo remains intact, Bowser is immortal.</p>
<p>But it is a Mario Game. Maybe the plot shouldn't be read so much into.</p>
<p><a name="Bowser.27s_Death.3F_2" id="Bowser.27s_Death.3F_2"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bowser's Death? 2</span></h2>
<p>How do we know Bowser died before Luigi's Mansion? Madame Clairvoya merely states Bowser was "soundly defeated". How does this imply death? I'm not saying he didn't die; King Boo could be using Bowser's corpse, but there is the possibility that Bowser was laying low and King Boo was using a robotic (or even magical) Bowser suit. I think both options need to be stressed, not one of the other. --206.8.10.4 06:07, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, madame Clairvoya's exact words are: "Bowser? how can this be? I see the Hideous form of BOWSER?! I don't believe it, yet I see it. Could King Boo have found some way to revive Bowser?"</p>
<p>Is it not clear that this is nintendo's way of explaining what happened? surely she would have said something along the lines of: "Bowser?! I don't understand, could King Boo have revived bowser? or is he just using some nefarious Bowser suit - thing?" I know that we should register the 'its a bowser suit' argument as possible, but I personally feel that is is stupid, when nintendo have plainly given us a preferrable and much more interesting story.</p>
<p>I don't think there would be so much shock and disbelief if Bowser was merely in hiding, one would just assume he'd come out of hiding. Also, why would King Boo need to revive Bowser, if he was just hiding?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the exact words. I guess this does imply Bowser really did die. If someone wants to change the article, they can (as I am the one who added the suit information). I just needed a source to confirm the death. Thanks again. --206.8.10.4 19:15, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bowser's Death?</span></h2>
<p>For those pepole who saw the game video of the new super mario bros where he fell into the pit of lava and coming back without flesh on: He doesn't die! The fact is that he is a fake verson of bowser and the real him is at the final level. Bowser is everyones favourite villian and even though he always get owned by mario he will never die.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, we've seen from screenshots of <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Paper_Mario_f92c.html" title="Super Paper Mario">Super Paper Mario</a></i> that he's clearly still going to be alive for that one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, Bowser does die in the new game, in a sense. He becomes an undead Dry Bones like monster until Bowser Jr. uses a magic potion to restore his father to his normal self. Bowser did die, but he was brought back to life (the same thing could have happened in Luigi's Mansion, meaning that the game is not the last game chronologically. --63.226.134.36 02:27, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonsense. Mario is a plumber from Brooklyn who had been working in the sewers prior to actually being orientated with the Mushroom and Koopa kingdoms. That block of info your adding has just as much in my mind as if to add to <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, "He was infamous for his evil acts of slaughter in the Holocaust." And it looks like you're making some grammatical errors, that is, no caps on your second sentence, not to insult you. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus2</a>
<dl>
<dd>No problem, I usually catch those. Anyway, I maintain that Nintendo's promotional material clearly links the two Marios, so we should include it. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> 21:27, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I'd like to repeat my request here--find one source that says Mario and Luigi didn't meet Bowser in Super Mario World 2 (not counting fan fiction). If you can't, the info should stay. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> 21:44, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Having played and completed Super Mario World 2, as well as many of the other Mario games, I side with Meelar. I also think Marcus2 should follow his own advice, because I think the idea Mario is from Brooklyn comes mostly from promotional material. I'm not sure if Shigeru Miyamoto, for all intents and purposes the creator of Mario and writer of his history, ever stated that Mario is from Brooklyn, though he <i>has</i> stated he's a plumber (and it's implied Mario was originally a carpenter in Donkey Kong). It's possible that Miyamoto has said this but if so, I'd like to see a source. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">Furrykef</a> 19:31, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Marcus2: If you continue this edit war, I may suggest that this topic be locked. All nintendo games are cannon, even if they contradict. Rather than removing content, perhaps just extend to article to say that the SMW:2 storyline conflicts with the other possible story. <a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETacvek_a197.html" title="User:Tacvek">Tacvek</a> 02:56, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. The correct procedure in cases of discrepencies in story lines are to document the discrepencies in good NPOV fashion. Sherlock Holmes fandom has been doing this for years. Same with comic book fandom for retcons in continuity. Also Edgar Rice Burroughs fandom. For the comic book character Archie there are at least two separate stories of how he first met Veronica, both of them contradicted by the L'il Archie series about Archie and the gang as very young children.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Document. Don't argue about which is right. If promotional material says something, then cite the exact promotional material (which will encourage other readers to cite other promotional material confirming it or to document other statements in contradiction). If you can't cite it, don't spread it. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">jallan</a> 20:00, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Most people consiter Baby Mario (BM) and Mario (M) as two characters. Up until the "Partners in Time" game, they've been seporated and always have been. Any events BM might experience are not part of M's past unless noted so. At least, that's my opinion. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWack%27d_About_Wiki_b3f0.html" title="User:Wack'd About Wiki">Wack'd About Wiki</a> 16:57, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Huh. I always though that the Brooklyn story was an outdated experiment of Nintendo of America, and was solely used in the cartoons, comics, and movie instead of the games (except for the cameo in the English SNES Sim City manual, but that's the only exception I can think of, and it isn't an in-game reference). My understanding is that fans used to merge this and the SMW2YI backstory to merge the pre-SMB games and the post-SMB games together, but it was nothing official... At least, I don't remember it being so. I think we can rule that the SMB2YI story works for the games, and the Brooklyn story works for the non-games, unless there's some big game evidence that I'm somehow missing out on besides the common old North American promotions (which also usually promoted the non-game material as well).
<dl>
<dd>Yeah...I also agree with the person above. The only case in which I've seen that says the Mario Bros. live in Brooklyn was in the <i>Mario Bros. Movie</i>.
<dl>
<dd>... and the TV-show...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To the topic of Baby Mario and Mario being two seperate characters, shouldn't it be obvious that Baby Mario is the same person as Mario? SMW and SMW2 (YI) are a series of games in which both feature Yoshi. I would think that, comparing the two, SMW2 would be a prequel to SMW, thus completing the fact that Mario is the same character as Baby Mario. And Nintendo should make it's character and game stories clearer. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamePlayer623_6a8c.html" title="User:GamePlayer623">GamePlayer623</a> 00:43, 4 July 2006 (UTC) 17:43, 03 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Rumor???!!! It was stated in Paper Mario 2 in Bowser's first scene, were 2 Hammer Bros. say that he was staring at a picture of her affectionatly. Although we do not know if the Hammer Bros. were just joking or not, it could have happened. I favor a theory of Bowser just wanting to marry Peach to take over the Mushroom kingdom. ~ Ultimate Perfect Chaos 04:46, 3 February 2006 (UTC) ~
<dl>
<dd>While I agree that Peach generally rejects Bowser's affections, that doesn't mean he isn't after her. I'd also like to add Super Mario RPG as evidence, when they save her from Booster's cake in the wedding town, he attempts to kiss her.

<dd>Well, Mario isn't a king now is he? Bowser is far from acting demonish, he is simply a villain, and there are many more characters from different series that act alot like him. Bowser has several less than good character traits, glutony, wrath, etc. But these villianous traits do not make him demonic.

<p>I still don't buy the idea that his name is "Bowser Koopa". As far as I know, in Japan it has always been "King Koopa", and in the United States, it was "Bowser, King of the Koopas" in canonical sources (the games), and "King Koopa" in some non-canonical sources (the cartoons). I've never seen the form "King Bowser Koopa" even in such non-canonical sources. - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 22:09, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I agree with you that you don't usually see it written that way in video games, but if the <a href="../../../k/o/o/Koopa_Kid_c31d.html" title="Koopa Kid">Koopa Kids</a> are any indication, it's his name nonetheless. They all have names like "Wendy O. Koopa" and so on, so presumably it's a clan and a surname. Just as if my name were John Doe, you could call me (somewhat archaically) John, King of the Does, or Leader of the Does, or some such.

<dd>Things get difficult along this path. In the original Japanese, he is known as Koopa (クッパ, <i>kuppa</i>). In the original SMB, he was Great Devil Koopa (大魔王クッパ, <i>dai maō kuppa</i>)! (I'm not sure at the moment if he's even been "King Koopa" before and not just "king of the Koopa.") "Bowser" is something the folks here at Nintendo of America (NoA) created, to my chagrin (though I admit, it fits well). Likewise, in Japan, the Koopalings' don't have Koopa as their surname; they're just Larry, Morton, Wendy O., etc. Thus, I'm against the "King Bowser Koopa," especially since it's an inference (though admittedly a valid one). Either we should stick to the Japanese info and mention the American info (my choice since the Japanese info comes from Nintendo itself and Miyamoto himself); stick to the American info and mention the Japanese info (which I'm not wont to do); or create an amalgamation of the two, which would likely be a bit confusing. I think we should do "King Koopa," "Koopa," and "Bowser" and <i>not</i> "King Bowser" (unless supported) or "(King) Bowser Koopa." (Not to mention that "Bowser Koopa" sounds pretty lame ...) -- J44xm 03:38, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>It has nothing to do with the disambig debate. Kammy Koopa calls Bowser King Bowser. So, what you're saying is that the fact that his title as a King being fact can't compete with him not being called it everytime someone refers to him? He is a King. There is no reason to not refer to him as King Bowser when it's undeniable fact that his title is King. There's no difference between his situation and the situation of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Peach_Toadstool_50f2.html" title="Princess Peach Toadstool">Princess Peach</a>; if you are arguing that this is his name or whatever, what's that then? Why not call her Peach? King Arthur's article is King Arthur, not Arthur (Britain). King Bowser is a better term than Bowser (Nintendo), because it's not only 100% true, but it's also a better name. No one will be confused, some people would type in King Bowser occasionally (no one would do it now without previously knowing it). Absolutely no reason to not change it.

<li>That's not WP policy, though, which (as I keep saying) is to use most common names. Which in this case would be to "Bowser".

<li>The policy is foolish. King Bowser isn't called King Bowser for the reason that he's not Mario's King. If a character is more commonly referred to with a nickname than his actual name, should it be his Wiki name? So, you're saying that his official title, his superior name, is not the one appropriate for Wikipedia because he's more often referred to as Bowser? And Nintendo can't be called Nintendo Corporate Ltd, because it includes Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, IIRC. There is no reason to keep it as Bowser (Nintendo). King Bowser is his official title, established by Nintendo of America. Okay? Okay. Okay, wow, characters who aren't under the rule of Bowser don't call him King Bowser, while his minions and Nintendo call him.

<p>I'm bringing up the King Bowser move again. Honestly, you can't argue the more-common thing; it's not a fair comparison, as the only people who usually talk are the heroes, who do not think of Bowser as a King. In the RPGs, however, whenever one of his minions refer to him, they call him King. Like King Arthur, that IS his official title. There's no disputing that. He's never been Prince Bowser, or just Bowser, or Bowser Koopa, or whatever. Since he has been introduced, he has been a King. His name has changed, but his title has not. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:18, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The games very rarely address him as King Bowser. However, the games frequently mention "Princess Peach" and "Princess Daisy." I think whatever the character is best known as should go. Putting "King Bowser" would be like listing Mario as "Mr. Mario Mario," though some people would argue that that is correct. Also, I think a good standard would be Nintendo's official literature and promotional art, none of which ever refers to Bowser as "King Bowser". <a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKidicarus222_8b5d.html" title="User:Kidicarus222">Kidicarus222</a> 04:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It totally belongs in the article. Bowser fan art—especially of the gay, beefcake and even adult-oriented variety—are <i>all over</i> the place. This is relevant because it's an extremely popular fan use of Bowser. Wikipedia isn't simply a canonical Nintendo publication nor an official press release center. It's neutral, and it covers the facts, both corporate and popular. I can provide sources of Bowser fan art and fan fiction in furry, kemono and oyaji genres. Bowser is middle-aged or older, he's muscular, he's chubby, he wears leather and spikes, he has chic hair, and he's badass—he's a <i>magnet</i> for gay fans. Some of it's pretty and tasteful, and some of it's quite ugly and not what you'd want to show to your children or your mothers, but this is a natural consequence of fans (many who have been playing the franchise since they were children) expressing their diverse appreciation for a favorite character. So do you <i>want</i> the sources? - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 03:59, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, come to think of it, if we should be using a neutral point of view, we should discuss Bowser's long history as a fan art subject, of which a portion is gay and beefcake, and a portion is not. It's important to note that Bowser isn't exactly a <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_icon.html" title="Gay icon">gay icon</a> per se, but rather an object of attraction, particularly among men who like bear, chubby, leather, oyaji, etc. In layman's terms, a lot of people think he's hot. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 04:08, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

However, I still think they deserve mention. In this, articles like <a href="../../../o/y/a/Oyaji.html" title="Oyaji">oyaji</a> already do this a great degree, but I think something brief is still worthy of mention, such as "Bowser has long been a very popular subject of art, fiction and doujinshi made by fans young and old," or something similar. This has been used and is accepted in many articles, such as for Final Fantasy topics. Though FF players tend to <i>start</i> playing those games older than Mario players, I don't see why this mention of older fan involvement is less deserving here than it is in those articles. Get my drift? (Heh, personally I browse a lot of gay art, but I don't have interest in anything I couldn't show my straight friends.

Isaac Marshall did his voice before he had speaking roles, right? <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERon_Stoppable_09a2.html" title="User:Ron Stoppable">Ron Stoppable</a> 07:56, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's what the article says, but back then, he always had generic roaring sounds that have been used outside of Mario games as well (an episode of ReBoot, for example). I know Marshall was listed in the Mario Kart 64 credits for Toad, at least. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_CH_d308.html" title="User:Agent CH">Agent CH</a> 15:47, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problem with Sephiroth comparison?</span></h2>
<p>I made a comparison to Bowser using disguised clones in Mario Bros. to how Sephiroth does this in FF7. I don't feel that this is inaccurate, and shows it's influence on later games, probably in others I have not thought of. Why was it removed? <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 19:14, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Talon and Malon both wear Bowser lanyards in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to contest this... first off, what is a lanyard, and how is this in any way related to Bowser? Malon wears a dress and Talon wears overalls. This needs to get specific. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 07:47, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A lanyard is a cord worn around the neck to hold something like a whistle. So lanyard wouldn't be the right term here - Bowser appears as the medallion <i>on</i> the cord, not the cord itself. But it's still a cameo appearance by Bowser, and as such would belong under "Cameo appearances" where it is. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_CH_d308.html" title="User:Agent CH">Agent CH</a> 18:17, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, I never noticed that, guess I'll have to beat the entire game over from the beginning to check this out...&#160;:) Not knowing what Lanyards were, when they said 'bowser lanyards' I was picturing Malon and Talon in shells. Does Info where one? Must be a family heirloom, which does raise some questions... as well as fanfic ideas. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 15:00, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anyone ever notice that Bowser's head is green and his body is orange? If you zoom in on his trophies in Super Smash Bros. Melee, you can look under his spiked collar and see the delineation between the two colors.</p>

<dd>He is a royal for gods sake!!! The name must King Bowser Morton Von Koopa I, and Morton jr and Bowser jr´s must be, Prince Bowser ``Morton´´ Von Koopa II and Prince ``Bowser´´ Morton Von Koopa III.</dd>
<dd>What are you talking about? It's just King Bowser Koopa. No II or Mortons or Vons. Why would Von be in the name anyway?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fan Joke</span></h2>
<p>I took a line out that read: One fan has joked that, "Bowser isn't really evil, he just likes to kidnap people." It seemed to be one person's opinion and did not furthur anyone's knowledge of the subject. I think most people will agree with me. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocoppitiesthefool_6cc0.html" title="User:Robocoppitiesthefool">Robocoppitiesthefool</a> 15:35, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I modified a picture from this site. Should I replace the old one? As one can see, in my version, it contains a more modern Bowser at the end and all of the Bowsers have been flipped in one direction. Well, all except for that Mario Cart one. --MrRandomGuy 07:55, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
