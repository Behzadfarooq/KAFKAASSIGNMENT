<p><b>Bowing</b> is the act of lowering the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_%28anatomy%29.html" title="Head (anatomy)">head</a>, or sometimes the entire upper body from the waist, as a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social.html" title="Social">social</a> gesture. This is common around the world, but is especially prominent in <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental.html" title="Oriental">Oriental</a> cultures especially in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_culture.html" title="Chinese culture">China</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_culture.html" title="Korean culture">Korea</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_culture.html" title="Japanese culture">Japan</a>. Different cultures have placed varying degrees of importance on bowing, and have used bowing in a variety of ways. to show the highest degree of politeness, you bend your head and waist about 45 degrees. Common courtesy to most people is shown by bending your head and waist about 15 degrees. In a very casual meeting with a person about your age, nodding your head would be enough. People often bow while shaking hands with one or both hands.</p>
<p>In European cultures, bowing is an exclusively male practice - females perform a related gesture called a "<a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtsey.html" title="Curtsey">curtsey</a>" or "curtsy." As in Asian cultures, the depth of the bow expresses degree of respect or gratitude. In European courtly circles, males were expected to "bow and scrape" (hence the term "bowing and scraping" for what appears to be excessive ceremony). "Scraping" refers to the drawing back of the right leg as one bows, such that the right foot scrapes the floor or earth. Typically, while executing such a bow, the man's left hand is pressed horizontally across the abdomen while the right is held out from the body.</p>
<p>Bowing originated as a gesture of subordination, as lowering the head leaves the bower vulnerable. This was particularly the case in Asian cultures such as the Samurai's <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokugawa_Shogun_6a0c.html" title="Tokugawa Shogun">Tokugawa Shogun</a> period in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. This was the period of which Samurais were at the height of a highly stratified society; as they increasingly became courtiers, bureaucrats, and administrators rather than warriors.</p>

<p>Bows are the traditional <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeting.html" title="Greeting">greeting</a> in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asia_cb20.html" title="East Asia">East Asia</a>, more so in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> than anywhere else. However, bowing is not reserved only for greetings. Bowing is a gesture of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Respect.html" title="Respect">respect</a>. Different bows are used for apologies and gratitude, to express different emotions, humility, sincerity, remorse, or deference, and in various traditional arts and religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>Basic bows are performed with the back straight and the hands at the sides (boys and men) or clasped in the lap (girls and women), and with the eyes down or closed.. Bows originate at the waist. Generally, the longer and deeper the bow, the stronger the emotion.</p>
<p>Bows can be generally divided into three main types: informal, formal, and very formal. Informal bows are made at about a fifteen degree angle and more formal bows at about thirty degrees. Very formal bows are deeper. There is an extremely complex etiquette surrounding bowing, including the length and depth of bow, and the appropriate response. For example, if the other person maintains his or her bow for longer than expected (generally about two or three seconds), it is polite to bow again, upon which one may receive another bow in return. This often leads to a long exchange of progressively lighter bows.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, an inferior bows longer and more deeply, and more frequently, than a superior.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowing_%28social%29.html" title="Edit section: Bowing at school">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bowing at school</span></h3>
<p>Students at all levels of primary and secondary education must bow many times each day. A typical class begins and ends with the students and teacher standing and bowing in unison to each other. Assemblies and club activities begin and end the same way; at assemblies students generally must also bow to each teacher who speaks in front of the assembled school. School ceremonies (such as graduation, welcome and farewell ceremonies) and special gatherings follow the same pattern as well.</p>
<p>Students will generally bow after speaking with a teacher in the staffroom, in thanks or apology, and particularly after being scolded.</p>
<p>In all but the most traditional schools, bows among teachers of similar rank are somewhat less frequent (except in thanks or apology), but subordinate teachers will usually bow when speaking with superior teachers such as the vice principal and principal.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowing_%28social%29.html" title="Edit section: Bows of apology and thanks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bows of apology and thanks</span></h3>
<p>Bows are a required and expected part of any apology or expression of thanks in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a>, and only parts of <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>.</p>
<p>Bows of apology tend to be deeper and last longer than other types of bow. They tend to occur with frequency during the apology, generally at about 45 degrees with the head lowered and lasting for at least the count of three, sometimes longer. The depth, frequency and duration of the bow increases with the sincerity of the apology and the severity of the offense. Bows of thanks follow the same pattern. In extreme cases a kneeling bow is performed; this bow is sometimes so deep that the forehead touches the floor. This is called <i>saikeirei</i> (最敬礼) in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanji.html" title="Kanji">Kanji</a> and <i>sebae</i> (새배) in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean.html" title="Korean">Korean</a>.</p>
<p>Bows of apology are frequently performed at press conferences by high-ranking members of a company that has performed some misdeed, such as producing faulty parts that resulted in a death. These bows are almost invariably performed standing behind a table; the tips of the fingers touch the table while the upper body, held straight, is lowered from the waist until the face is parallel with the tabletop.</p>

<p>Bows are commonly used in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeting.html" title="Greeting">greeting</a>, both when meeting and when parting. Bows almost automatically accompany the greeting phrases, but generally are no longer used among the immediate family unless addressing a family member after or in anticipation of a long absence or separation.</p>
<p>Bows also replace speaking under certain circumstances. For example, when encountering again a person to whom one has already spoken that day, a silent bow replaces such phrases as "hello" or "hi."</p>
<p>A superior addressing an inferior will generally only nod the head slightly (some people may not bow at all), while an inferior will bend forward slightly from the waist.</p>

<p>When dealing with non-East Asians, many East Asians will <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handshake.html" title="Handshake">shake hands</a>. Since many non-East Asians are familiar with the custom of bowing, this often leads to a combined bow and handshake which can be quite complicated to execute. Bows may be combined with handshakes or performed before or after shaking hands.</p>
<p>Generally when bowing in proximity to another, as necessitated when combining bowing and shaking hands, people turn slightly to one side (usually the left) to avoid bumping heads.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowing_%28social%29.html" title="Edit section: Bowing in China">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bowing in China</span></h4>
<p>Bowing in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> is not nearly so formalized as in Japan and Korea. Bowing is normally reserved for occasions such as funerals or ancestral worships only. The <a href="../../../k/o/w/Kowtow.html" title="Kowtow">kowtow</a> is extremely rare among the Chinese since the collapse of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_China_fd80.html" title="Imperial China">Imperial China</a>. However in modern day China, bowing is necessary for Hangook people (Koreans) living in the Northern part of China. Vice versa for any Chinese or Japanese living in South Korea, a perfect example would be the community living in 서울특별시 Seoul City.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowing_%28social%29.html" title="Edit section: Bowing in Korea">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bowing in Korea</span></h4>
<p>Bowing in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_culture.html" title="Korean culture">Korean culture</a> has different aspects to it than in other East Asian cultures. It is an especially integral part during martials arts, religious services dedicated to the dead, and formalized holidays. Unlike in the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_tea_ceremony.html" title="Japanese tea ceremony">Japanese tea ceremony</a>, a central approach to tea in Korea is an easy and natural coherence, with fewer formal rituals, fewer absolutes, greater freedom for relaxation, and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas, services, and conversation. As a result, other than a bow of greeting and departure, bowing is not an integral aspect of the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_tea_ceremony.html" title="Korean tea ceremony">Korean tea ceremony</a>.</p>

<p>Bowing in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> is distinct from other East Asian cultures when done in more traditional settings such as during a <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_tea_ceremony.html" title="Japanese tea ceremony">tea ceremony</a> or during the beginning and end of a traditional martial arts match.</p>
<p><a name="Bowing_in_martial_arts:_Aikido.2C_Kendo.2C_Karate.2C_Judo" id="Bowing_in_martial_arts:_Aikido.2C_Kendo.2C_Karate.2C_Judo"></a></p>

<p>Bowing is an integral part of traditional martial arts. Bows are used to begin and end practice, sparring bouts and competitions, and when entering and leaving the <i><a href="../../../d/o/j/Dojo.html" title="Dojo">dojo</a></i>, or practice room. This tends to be standard among practitioners in any country, and is common also among the practitioners of martial arts originating from outside of Japan, such as <a href="../../../t/a/e/Taekwondo.html" title="Taekwondo">Taekwondo</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kung_Fu_921b.html" title="Kung Fu">Kung Fu</a>, but in Japan other types of bow (for example, of thanks or apology) are also standard in the dojo. In traditional Japan, a bow in a Kendo sword fight when one is defeated means a plea for beheading to save shame.</p>

<p>Bowing is an important part of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_tea_ceremony.html" title="Japanese tea ceremony">Japanese tea ceremony</a>.</p>
<p>There are three main types of bow performed in a ceremony; they are classified as <i>shin</i> (深), <i>gyō</i> (行), and <i>sō</i> (草). All are usually performed from a kneeling position. <i>Shin</i> bows are the deepest; from a kneeling position, the bower bends forward from the waist, placing the hands palms down on the floor in front of the body, with the fingers facing. <i>Shin</i> bows are performed to teachers and superiors. <i>Gyō</i> and <i>sō</i> bows are less deep and less long (<i>gyō</i> bows are deeper). From a kneeling position and bowing from the waist, the hands are slid over the knees until the tips of the fingers touch the floor in front of the body. They are performed among persons of similar rank.</p>
<p>Students of tea ceremony bow to each other and to their teacher; each class begins with bows between the teacher and students. If a senior student is teaching a junior student, bows are exchanged between the two. Before beginning a practice, a student bows to all the other students as well. This pattern is repeated when the practice ends.</p>
<p>A bow is performed at the door before entering the tea room, or <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_house.html" title="Tea house">tea house</a>. One then proceeds to the <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokonoma.html" title="Tokonoma">tokonoma</a>, or scroll alcove, and bows again. Finally one greets the teacher, and then the other students, or the other guests, with bows. This pattern is repeated when leaving the tea room as well.</p>
<p>The host of a tea cereomony bows before beginning the ceremony. Bows are exchanged repeatedly throughout a tea ceremony, between the host and guest of honour, among the guests, between guests and the hosts assistants, and between the host and guests.</p>

In many traditions, individuals will bow when passing in front of the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">altar</a>, or at certain points in the service (for example, when the name of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> is spoken). It may take the form of a simple bow of the head, or a slight incline of the upper body. A profound bow is a deep bow from the waist, and is often done as a substitution for <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genuflection.html" title="Genuflection">genuflection</a>.</p>
<p>For bowing in <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodoxy_14a3.html" title="Eastern Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodoxy</a>, see <a href="../../../z/e/m/Zemnoy_poklon.html" title="Zemnoy poklon">zemnoy poklon</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> setting, bowing, like Christianity, is a sign of respect, and is done at certain points in the Jewish services. This is done by merely bending the knees, and then, while straightening the knees, bending the upper body forward. After a few seconds, the congregant returns to the standing position. Most importantly during the concluding <i>Aleinu</i> section of the services, congregants will bow when they say "V'anachnu korim umishtachavim u'modim," meaning "we bend our knees, bow, and acknowledge our thanks." Another moment in the service which triggers the bow is during the "Bar'chu." Many bow at the mention of "Adonai" (the Jewish addressing of the Lord) at this and various other parts in the service (most likely if they are to remain standing during that prayer). The only other bow is on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Jews will get on their knees and bow towards the ark (which holds the torah). This bow is similar to the bows that Muslims do during their daily prayers.</p>
