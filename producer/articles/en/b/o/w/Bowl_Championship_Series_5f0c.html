<p>The <b>Bowl Championship Series</b> (<b>BCS</b>) is designed to pair the top two teams in <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_football.html" title="College football">college football</a> against each other in the <a href="../../../b/c/s/BCS_National_Championship_Game_e8a6.html" title="BCS National Championship Game">BCS National Championship Game</a>, with the winner being the BCS national champion. The system also selects matchups for the other prestigious BCS <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowl_game.html" title="Bowl game">bowl games</a>. The ten teams selected include the conference champion from each of the six <a href="../../../b/c/s/BCS_conference_da1c.html" title="BCS conference">BCS conferences</a> plus four others ("at-large" selections). It has been in place since the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season_b272.html" title="1998 NCAA Division I-A football season">1998 season</a>. Prior to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_season_8b23.html" title="2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season">2006 season</a> eight teams competed in four BCS Bowls.

<p>In the current BCS format, four bowl games, and the National Championship Game, are considered "BCS bowl games". The other four bowl games are the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Bowl_Game_3a09.html" title="Rose Bowl Game">Rose Bowl Game</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasadena%2C_California_0cce.html" title="Pasadena, California">Pasadena</a>, the <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar_Bowl_a643.html" title="Sugar Bowl">Sugar Bowl</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, the <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fiesta_Bowl_75b3.html" title="Fiesta Bowl">Fiesta Bowl</a> in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_Arizona_a261.html" title="Glendale, Arizona">Glendale, Arizona</a>, and the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Bowl_%28game%29_6e6b.html" title="Orange Bowl (game)">Orange Bowl</a> in <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a>. In the first eight seasons of the BCS contract, the championship game was rotated among the four bowls; for example, the Sugar Bowl would have the national championship "weight" once every four years. Starting with the 2007 BCS, the site of the game that served as the last game on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> (or if January 1 fell on a Sunday, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">January 2</a>) in the BCS will now serve as the host facility of the new stand-alone BCS National Championship game played on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">January 8</a> of that year, one week following the playing of the traditional bowl game which would follow the Rose Bowl with the exception of the games to be played in 2010. There are also twenty-seven <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automatic_Bids_to_Non-BCS_Bowls_6006.html" title="Automatic Bids to Non-BCS Bowls">non-BCS bowls</a>.</p>
<p>Initial plans were for the additional BCS bowl game to be held at the site of that year's championship game, such that the additional, non-championship bowl be named after the original bowl (e.g. the Sugar Bowl when the championship is in New Orleans), and have the extra game just be called "The National Championship Game". Later, the BCS considered having cities bid to be the permanent site of the new BCS game, and to place the new game in the title rotation. In the end, the BCS opted for its original plan.</p>
<p>A complicated set of rules is used to determine which teams compete in the BCS bowl games<a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/eligibility" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/eligibility" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Certain teams are given automatic berths depending on their BCS ranking and conference, as follows: The top two teams are given automatic berths in the BCS National Championship Game. The champions of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coast_Conference_a463.html" title="Atlantic Coast Conference">ACC</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_12_Conference_5b21.html" title="Big 12 Conference">Big 12</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_East_Conference_f830.html" title="Big East Conference">Big East</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Ten_Conference_77c8.html" title="Big Ten Conference">Big Ten</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ten_Conference_569b.html" title="Pacific Ten Conference">Pac-10</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Conference_3deb.html" title="Southeastern Conference">SEC</a> conferences are guaranteed automatic BCS bowl appearances. The highest ranked champion of a non-BCS conference will receive an automatic berth if it is ranked in the top twelve, or ranked in the top sixteen and higher than another <a href="../../../b/c/s/BCS_Conference_a185.html" title="BCS Conference">BCS Conference</a> champion. A special case is made for independent <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Notre_Dame_aca9.html" title="University of Notre Dame">Notre Dame</a>, which receives an automatic berth if they finish in the top eight. If there is an available spot the third-ranked team will receive an automatic berth. Again if there is another available spot, and the third-ranked team did not require an at-large berth, then the fourth-ranked team will receive an automatic berth.</p>
<p>After the automatic berths have been granted, the remaining berths, known as "at-large" berths, are filled from a pool of teams who are ranked in the top fourteen and have at least nine wins. The actual teams that are chosen for the at-large berths are determined by the individual bowl committees.</p>
<p>A final consideration is that no more than two teams from any conference may play in BCS Bowls in any year, regardless of whether they are automatic or at-large selections.</p>
<p>Despite the possibility of an "at-large" berth being granted to a "mid-major" conference team, this didn't happen until the 2004-05 season, when <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Utah_bbd8.html" title="University of Utah">Utah</a> received a BCS bid to play in the Fiesta Bowl, in which the Utes convincingly defeated <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pittsburgh_9287.html" title="University of Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> 35-7. The extra BCS game will relax requirements to give mid-major conferences better access to a BCS bowl game, possibly ahead of a higher ranked school from a major conference.</p>
<p>Unless their champion is involved in the BCS National Championship game, the conference tie-ins are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rose Bowl - Big Ten vs. Pac-10.</li>
<li>Fiesta Bowl - Big 12.</li>
<li>Orange Bowl - ACC.</li>
<li>Sugar Bowl - SEC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Big East champion takes one of the at-large spots remaining.</p>
<p>Using the 2005 BCS standings and the above tie-ins as an example, here is what the new system likely would have resulted in had it been in effect:<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>For the portions of the ranking that are determined by polls and computer-generated rankings, the BCS uses a series of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borda_count.html" title="Borda count">borda counts</a> to arrive at its overall rankings. This is an example of using a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting_system.html" title="Voting system">voting system</a> to generate a complete ordered list of winners from both human and computer-constructed votes. Obtaining a fair ranking system is a difficult mathematical problem and numerous algorithms have been proposed for ranking college football teams in particular. One example is the "<a href="http://rankings.amath.unc.edu/" class="external text" title="http://rankings.amath.unc.edu/" rel="nofollow">random-walker rankings</a>" studied by applied mathematicians Thomas Callaghan, Peter Mucha, and Mason Porter that employs the science of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_Networks_830b.html" title="Complex Networks">complex networks</a>.</p>

<li>Poll average: Both the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">AP</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>-<i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> coaches polls were averaged to make a number which is the poll average.</li>
<li>Computer average: An average of the rankings of a team in three different <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_rating_system.html" title="Sports rating system">computer polls</a> were gathered (<a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Sagarin_367c.html" title="Jeff Sagarin">Jeff Sagarin</a>/<i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i>, Anderson-Hester/<i><a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Times_a494.html" title="Seattle Times">Seattle Times</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>), with a 50% adjusted maximum deviation factor. (For instance, if the computers had ranked a team third, fifth, and twelfth, the poll which ranked the team twelfth would be adjusted to rank the team sixth.)</li>
<li>Strength of Schedule: This was the team's NCAA rank in strength of schedule divided by 25. A teams strength of schedule was calculated by win/loss record of opponents (66.6%) and cumulative win/loss record of team's opponents (33.3%). The team who played the toughest schedule was given .04 points, second toughest .08 points, and so on.</li>
<li>Losses: One point was added for every loss the team has suffered during the season. All games are counted, including Kickoff Classics and conference title games. <a href="http://www.fansonly.com/schools//md/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061098aaa.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fansonly.com/schools//md/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061098aaa.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<p>Five more computer rankings were added to the system.

<p>In place of the <i>NYT</i> and Dunkel rankings, the Peter Wolfe and Wes Colley/<i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Journal-Constitution_62d1.html" title="Atlanta Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a></i> computer rankings were used. The change was made because the BCS wanted computer rankings that did not depend heavily on margin of victory. <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/0712/1225482.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/0712/1225482.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> The highest and lowest rankings were discarded, and the remainder averaged. A team's poll average, computer average, strength of schedule points, and losses were added to create a subtotal.</p>
<p>In addition, a Quality Win component was added. If a team beat a team which was in the top 15 in the BCS standings, a range of 1.5 to .1 points was subtracted from their total. Beating the #1 ranked team resulted in a subtraction of 1.5 point, beating the #2 team resulted in a deduction of 1.4 points, and so on. Beating the #15 ranked team would have resulted in a deduction of .1 points. A team would only be awarded for a quality win once if it beat a Top 10 team more than once (such as in the regular season and a conference championship game), and quality wins were determined using a team's current subtotal, not the ranking when the game was played. The subtotal ranks were used to determine quality win deductions to create a team's final score.</p>

<p>The BCS continued to purge ranking systems which included margin of victory, causing the removal of the Matthews and Rothman ratings. Sagarin provided a BCS-specific formula that did not include margin of victory, and the <i>New York Times</i> index returned in a form without margin of victory considerations. In addition, a new computer ranking, the Wesley Colley Matrix, was added. <a href="http://www.dailyorange.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=22d3b932-8bfc-4123-8def-1c0a962fe5b2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailyorange.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=22d3b932-8bfc-4123-8def-1c0a962fe5b2" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> The lowest ranking was dropped and the remaining six averaged.</p>
<p>In addition, the quality win component was modified such that the deduction for beating the #1 team in the BCS would be 1.0, declining by 0.1 increments until beating the 10th ranked team at 0.1. Teams on probation were not included in the BCS standings, but quality win points were given to teams who beat teams on probation as if they were ranked accordingly in the BCS.</p>

<p>In response to the controversy created by the voters in the AP poll naming USC as the No. 1 ranked team at the end of the year and a general consensus that USC would have been a preferable opponent for BCS Champion LSU (over Oklahoma, the actual opponent), the formula was completely rewritten. Supporters of USC and the media in general criticized the fact that human polls were not weighted more heavily than computer rankings and this criticism led to the new math.</p>
<ul>
<li>AP Poll: A team's AP Poll number is the percentage of the possible points it could receive in the poll. As an example, in the final regular-season poll of 2003, LSU received a total of 1,580 out of a possible 1,625 points from the voters, giving them an AP Poll percentage of 97.2.</li>
<li>Coaches' Poll: This is calculated in the same manner as the AP Poll number. For LSU, their final regular-season number in this poll would have been 99.4 (1,516 out of 1,525 possible points).</li>
<li>Computer Average: The BCS used six ranking systems, with the <i>New York Times</i> opting not to participate. In the calculation, the highest and lowest ranking for each team are dropped. Then, it will give a team 25 points for a Number 1 ranking in an individual system, 24 points for Number 2, and so on down to 1 point. Each team's set of numbers is then added, conveniently making the number compatible with the percentages from the two polls. To address concerns about loss of the schedule strength factor, the description of the computer rankings explicitly included schedule strength as a consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>For USC, dropping their highest and lowest computer rankings would have left them with four third-place finishes, worth 23 points each for a total of 92, while LSU would have had four second-place finishes for a total of 96. The BCS <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic_mean.html" title="Arithmetic mean">averaged</a> the three numbers obtained above, divided the result by 100, and converted it to a decimal fraction. This system placed twice as much emphasis on human polls than computer rankings, and made it highly unlikely that the top team in both human polls would be denied a place in the title game, as it happened in 2003-04.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowl_Championship_Series_5f0c.html" title="Edit section: BCS controversies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BCS controversies</span></h2>
<p>Among the criticism of the BCS (and the bowl system in general) is the fact that the final ranking of Division I-A NCAA football teams is decided by arbitrary and subjective standards. Opponents of the current system believe that the “champion” of the largest and most popular collegiate sport should be decided on the field, in a head-to-head match-up. The BCS was especially criticized and deemed controversial in both the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 seasons. In 2003, five teams (three from <a href="../../../b/c/s/BCS_conference_da1c.html" title="BCS conference">BCS conferences</a>) finished the regular season with one loss, with no unbeaten team, while in the following season, the same number of teams (again with three from BCS conferences) finished the regular season unbeaten. In both seasons, the three teams from BCS conferences had legitimate cases for playing in the <a href="../../../b/c/s/BCS_title_game_2c84.html" title="BCS title game">BCS title game</a>. Most recently, additional controversy has come from the decision by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> to prohibit the BCS from using their rankings in the BCS formula, and by <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> choosing to remove itself from the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> coaches poll.</p>
<p>Much of the controversy stirred by the BCS arises simply from the fact that there is a single national championship game. As such, the formulas must be used to determine which two teams are the most deserving teams to play for the national championship. In some minds, the two top teams in the nation are not always clear-cut choices. The most recent year in which there were only two undefeated Division I-A teams at the end of the regular season was <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, when Ohio State and Boise State both finished the regular season undefeated. Even undefeated regular seasons cannot always give a clear determination of the better teams, due to strength of schedule. Florida lost one game while competing in what many would argue is the toughest conference, the SEC. After Florida routed Ohio State in the title game in 2007, few would argue Florida isn't worthy of the title. Yet if USC had beaten UCLA, it would have played in the title game, leaving Florida out of luck because of the lack of a playoff.</p>
<p>Another criticism of the system is that it is often accused of institutionalized bias towards the six BCS conferences (and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_010f.html" title="Notre Dame Fighting Irish football">Notre Dame</a>, which is independent) at the deliberate expense of the five non-BCS conferences. Since its implementation, five non-BCS conference Division I-A teams have finished the regular season undefeated (<a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulane_Green_Wave_b961.html" title="Tulane Green Wave">Tulane</a> in 1998, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_University_f973.html" title="Marshall University">Marshall</a> in 1999, <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Utes_3413.html" title="Utah Utes">Utah</a> in 2004, and <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_State_Broncos_football_7428.html" title="Boise State Broncos football">Boise State</a> in 2004 and 2006) without being given an opportunity to win the title, making it impossible (the AP title may be awarded to any team that the nationwide pollsters feel is best in the nation) for a non-BCS conference team to compete for the national title regardless of their achievements on the field. (In fact, Marshall, despite being ranked #11 that year, was in danger of not going to ANY bowl game if they had lost the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Mid-American_Conference_6a89.html" title="Mid-American Conference">MAC</a> Championship.) It has sometimes been claimed that this was done deliberately in order to prevent a repeat of an event like <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young's</a> controversial national title in 1984 and that the larger conferences felt that their dominance was being threatened. It is also believed that this bias is designed to adversely affect recruitment to non-BCS schools in favor of BCS schools, intended to create a qualitative downward spiral and a de facto "two-tier" Division I-A.</p>
<p>Some schools, such as <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisville_Cardinals_ec77.html" title="Louisville Cardinals">Louisville</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Bearcats_48f7.html" title="Cincinnati Bearcats">Cincinnati</a>, moved to BCS conferences primarily in order to avoid this bias. The primary reason given that non-BCS conference champions are not given automatic berths to BCS bowls, or are not ranked high enough for a BCS Championship Game, is the assertion that non-BCS schools play easier schedules. However, advice that non-BCS programs should strengthen their schedules by scheduling games against quality, non-conference opponents is disingenuous given that top BCS programs generally decline to schedule regular season games with top non-BCS programs. Top BCS programs generally prefer to schedule their non-conference games against other top BCS programs because win or lose it is considered to be a "quality" win or loss than a game against a non-BCS team.</p>

<p>The first year of the BCS ended in controversy when <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_State_Wildcats_8b0b.html" title="Kansas State Wildcats">Kansas State</a> finished third in the final BCS standings but was passed over for participation in BCS bowl games in favor of <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football_a97f.html" title="Ohio State Buckeyes football">Ohio State</a> (ranked 4th) and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Gators_football_95d9.html" title="Florida Gators football">Florida</a> (ranked 8th). The following season, the BCS adopted the "Kansas State Rule," which provides that the 3rd ranked team (or 4th ranked team if the 3rd ranked team has already qualified as a conference champion) in the final BCS standings is ensured of an invitation to a BCS bowl game.</p>
<p>The following season, Kansas State finished 6th in the BCS standings but again received no invitation, this time being passed over in favor of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_Wolverines_football_3be9.html" title="Michigan Wolverines football">Michigan</a> (ranked 8th). Kansas State's predicament (as well as that of undefeated Tulane who was denied a BCS bid because they played in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conference_USA_59f3.html" title="Conference USA">Conference USA</a>) demonstrated early on the arbitrary nature of invitations to BCS bowl games. To be fair, however, the BCS system was designed to select the top two teams but left the remainder of discretion to the participating bowls themselves (subject to the above modifications as time went on).</p>

<p>One-loss <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_State_University_Seminoles_6f01.html" title="Florida State University Seminoles">Florida State</a> was chosen to play undefeated Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl for the national championship, despite their one loss coming to another one loss team, the Miami Hurricanes, that was ranked #2 in both human polls. Adding to the confusion, Miami's one loss came to yet another one loss team, the 10-1 Washington Huskies, leaving three teams with a legitimate claim to play Oklahoma in the National Championship game.</p>
<p>Florida State lost to Oklahoma 13-2, after Florida State was finally able to score on a safety with minutes to go in the game. Washington and Miami both easily won their bowl games, adding more fuel to the fire. As a result of the controversy, the BCS was tweaked in the off-season. A "quality-win" bonus was added to the formula, giving extra credit for beating a top ten team.</p>

<p>In another controversial season, second-ranked Nebraska in the BCS was chosen as a national title game participant despite being ranked #4 in the human polls and not playing in the Big 12 championship game or winning their conference or division. The Huskers went into their last regularly scheduled game at Colorado undefeated, but left Boulder with a 62-36 loss. The Buffaloes went on to win the Big 12 championship game. However, the BCS computers don't take into account time of loss, so one-loss Nebraska came out ahead of two-loss Colorado and one-loss, second-ranked Oregon. Nebraska beat Colorado for the #2 spot in the BCS poll by .05 points. Chants of "Number Four!" were heard throughout the title game held at the Rose Bowl. Nebraska was routed in the game, 37-14, by the Miami Hurricanes. Meanwhile Oregon, the consensus #2 team in both human polls (and #4 in the BCS), routed Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl.</p>

<p>The 2003-2004 season aroused much controversy when three schools from BCS conferences finished the season with one loss (in fact, no I-A Division team finished the season undefeated, something that hadn't happened since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, two years before the advent of the BCS). The three schools in question were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_Sooners_football_9223.html" title="Oklahoma Sooners football">Oklahoma</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../l/s/u/LSU_Tigers_football_cf04.html" title="LSU Tigers football">LSU</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../u/s/c/USC_Trojans_football_61d4.html" title="USC Trojans football">USC</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Three non-BCS schools also finished with one loss:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_RedHawks_football_4c44.html" title="Miami RedHawks football">Miami University (Ohio)</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_State_Broncos_football_7428.html" title="Boise State Broncos football">Boise State</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Christian_University_ffb7.html" title="Texas Christian University">TCU</a></li>
</ul>
<p>USC was ranked #1 in both the AP and ESPN-USA Today Coaches poll, but was burdened by a collective 2.67 computer ranking due to a perceived weak schedule. Meanwhile Oklahoma, after an undefeated regular season was beat by Kansas State (35-7) in the Big 12 Championship Game. The loss dropped them to #3 in the human polls (while the computers still had them at #1). LSU had earned a stronger computer ranking than USC and a #2 human poll ranking, and went on to claim the BCS championship (and thus an automatic #1 ranking in the final Coaches Poll) with a 21-14 win over Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl. USC, which beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl, retained its #1 ranking in the AP Poll, which is irrelevant post-BCS. Oklahoma (which finished 12-2) had been clearly eliminated from national championship contention, but the split in polls left both LSU (13-1) and USC (12-1) displeased, and resulted in USC being co-champion (based on its final ranking in the AP Poll). This incident has been considered an embarrassment for college football and the BCS in particular.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Coaches were contractually obligated to award their trophy and votes to the winner of the BCS championship game. However, for the first and only time in BCS history, the BCS Champion was not a unanimous #1 in the final Coaches Poll. Three coaches broke rank and voted USC as first place.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> If every coach who voted USC as #1 prior to the bowl games had felt able to break the contract and continue that vote after the bowls, LSU could have received the Coaches' Trophy at the end of the Sugar Bowl, but not been the Coaches' Champion for the year.</p>

<p>The 2004-2005 regular season finished with five undefeated teams for the first time since 1979. Despite having perfect records, the <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn_Tigers_football_3de2.html" title="Auburn Tigers football">Auburn Tigers</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Utes_3413.html" title="Utah Utes">Utah Utes</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_State_Broncos_football_7428.html" title="Boise State Broncos football">Boise State Broncos</a> were denied an opportunity to play for the BCS championship. Auburn was left out despite of having the strongest strength of schedule, a factor whose emphasis in the formula had been decreased, possibly because it caused Southern California's exclusion a year earlier. Also, preseason rankings this year had USC and Oklahoma at #1 and #2, a fact that enabled ESPN and pollsters to argue for an increasing bar of "style points" for the other three schools. Oklahoma went on to play USC for the title. USC thrashed Oklahoma, 55-19. Ironically, the PAC-10, which called endlessly for that change, was harmed by it when the at-large bids were issued. The pollsters jumped the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Longhorns_7b8f.html" title="Texas Longhorns">Texas Longhorns</a> over the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Golden_Bears_9aca.html" title="California Golden Bears">California Golden Bears</a> in the final regular-season poll.

<p>The 2005-2006 season resulted in few controversies, as USC and Texas went wire-to-wire as the number 1 and number 2-ranked teams, respectively, and played in the Rose Bowl for the BCS title. However, a minor controversy ensued as after all the automatic bids, there were two at-large bids available. The first was taken by fourth-ranked <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_09a2.html" title="Ohio State Buckeyes">Ohio State Buckeyes</a>.

Many felt that Oregon deserved the BCS Bowl Bid and would have provided a better match for OSU. Both Oregon and Notre Dame ended up losing the Holiday and Fiesta Bowls, respectively, making a clear argument either way difficult.</p>

<p>Going into the final poll, undefeated <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Boise_State_Broncos_football_team_463d.html" title="2006 Boise State Broncos football team">Boise State</a> and four one-loss teams (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Louisville_Cardinals_football_team_4420.html" title="2006 Louisville Cardinals football team">Louisville</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Michigan_Wolverines_football_team_0f99.html" title="2006 Michigan Wolverines football team">Michigan</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin_Badgers_football_fbfa.html" title="Wisconsin Badgers football">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Florida_Gators_football_team_5961.html" title="2006 Florida Gators football team">Florida</a>) were up for a spot against undefeated top-ranked <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football_team_85e0.html" title="2006 Ohio State Buckeyes football team">Ohio State</a> in the BCS National Championship game. Most fans and pundits did not consider Wisconsin, Louisville, or Boise State contenders because they played significantly weaker schedules than Florida and Michigan.</p>
<p>Michigan lost to Ohio State 42-39 in its regular season finale, but was still ranked ahead of Florida going into the final ballot. Florida defeated Arkansas in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/SEC_Championship_Game_c741.html" title="SEC Championship Game">SEC Championship Game</a>, leaving Michigan and Florida as one-loss teams who both claimed they deserved to play for the national championship against Ohio State. Many pundits denied that Michigan should get another chance to play Ohio State, and Florida coach Urban Meyer lobbied heavily in the press using this argument. Ultimately, the BCS National Championship was a meeting between Ohio State and Florida. A mere .0101 points separated #2 Florida from #3 Michigan. This small difference was a result of the human polls (USA Today's Coaches' Poll and Harris Interactive Poll) ranking Florida above Michigan while the computer polls had the two teams tied for second.</p>
<p>Michigan went to the Rose Bowl, which they lost to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_USC_Trojans_football_team_5a02.html" title="2006 USC Trojans football team">USC</a> 32-18. Florida officially became the national champions by impressively beating Ohio State 41-14. Florida also received all but one of the 65 first-place votes in the final Associated Press poll (the other went to undefeated Boise State, which won <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Fiesta_Bowl_28af.html" title="2007 Fiesta Bowl">an epic Fiesta Bowl</a> over <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Oklahoma_Sooners_football_team_dca1.html" title="2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team">Oklahoma</a>).</p>
<p>Ironically, despite its proven dominance on the field in the title game, Florida likely wouldn't have received a title shot had USC not lost to crosstown rival UCLA in its final regular season game. With a win, USC likely would have locked up the #2 spot and earned the trip to Glendale, leaving Florida out of contention as a result of the knowledgable yet ultimately unknowing judgment of the poll voters.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the season, three other one-loss teams were denied the chance to compete in a playoff or to play Florida for the national championship. Wisconsin and Louisville ended the season with only one loss (the same as No. 1 Florida and No. 2 Ohio State). Boise State, which received the other first-place vote in the AP poll, was the only undefeated Division I-A football team, yet became the first such team in two seasons that did not go on to compete in the National Championship.</p>
<p>Because of a BCS rule allowing only two teams from each conference to play in BCS bowl games, highly-ranked <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_Razorbacks_5d83.html" title="Arkansas Razorbacks">Arkansas</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn_Tigers_football_3de2.html" title="Auburn Tigers football">Auburn</a>, and Wisconsin were not eligible for selection to a BCS game. Arkansas and Auburn were excluded because <a href="../../../l/s/u/LSU_Tigers_football_cf04.html" title="LSU Tigers football">LSU</a> and Florida already represented the SEC while Wisconsin was excluded because Ohio State and Michigan represented the Big Ten. The final BCS poll had seven teams from the SEC and the Big Ten ranked in the top twelve but by the rule only two from each conference were eligible to play in BCS bowl games, offering the opportunity to argue either that both conferences are overranked or that the limit of 2 teams from any one conference is inappropriate.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowl_Championship_Series_5f0c.html" title="Edit section: BCS support">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BCS support</span></h2>
<p>While there is substantial criticism aimed the BCS system from coaches, media and fans alike, there is also ardent support for the system. Supporters cite several key advantages that the BCS has over a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playoff.html" title="Playoff">playoff</a> system. Under the BCS, a single defeat is extremely detrimental to a team's prospects for a national championship. Supporters contend that this creates a substantial incentive for teams to do their best to win every game. Under a playoff system, front-running teams could be in a position of safety at the end of the regular season and could pull or greatly reduce their use of top players in order to protect them from injuries or give them recovery time (this happens frequently in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">NFL</a>). It is even possible for a team to advantageously "<a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_fixing.html" title="Match fixing">tank</a>" an end of season game if it results in the losing team playing a weaker (but higher seeded) team in the playoffs, similar to how the New England Patriots' loss to the Miami Dolphins in their last regular season game of the 2005-2006 NFL season ensured that they would not have to play the last-seed Pittsburgh Steelers. This is very unlikely to happen in the BCS system where a team in the running for a #1 or #2 ranking at the end of the year would be nearly certain to be punished in the polls enough for a loss that the team would be eliminated from contention.</p>
<p>Supporters also note that while the BCS routinely involves controversy about which two teams are the top teams, in rare instances there is a clear-cut top two; the BCS ensures these top two will play each other for the championship. For example, USC and Texas in 2005 were the only undefeated teams, and both teams had only a couple of close contests and had nearly every other game out of reach for the opponent by the second or third quarter. Under the BCS system, these two teams got to play for the championship. Before the BCS, they would likely have played two other schools, and if they both won, then there would be either two champions, or else #2 Texas would have been denied a championship despite going 13-0. However, a playoff would also avoid a co-champion outcome in the given scenario.</p>
<p>Another reason for supporting the BCS system is that the multitude of bowl games offer many teams an opportunity to finish the postseason with a victory. Under a playoff system, only one team can win out. Every other team invited to the playoff would end their season with a loss, just as in Division I <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship_caac.html" title="NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship">basketball</a> and <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_Division_I_Baseball_Championship_642e.html" title="NCAA Division I Baseball Championship">baseball</a>.</p>
<p>The BCS format system is currently scheduled to end after the 2010 season. However, there has been one extension from the 2006 season for four years, so the system could be extended again.</p>

<p>The 2006-07 BCS featured major changes from its previous editions.</p>
<p>Television rights shifted from <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> to <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a>, while ABC continued telecasting the Rose Bowl. Second, the addition of a BCS National Championship Game matched the top two teams in the BCS rankings (Ohio State and Florida) at the site of one of the BCS games one week after these games have been played (<a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Phoenix_Stadium_63bc.html" title="University of Phoenix Stadium">University of Phoenix Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_Arizona_a261.html" title="Glendale, Arizona">Glendale, Arizona</a>, one week after the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl). The addition of a fifth BCS game allowed for the potential addition of two "at large" teams.</p>
<p>Another new rule stated: <i>"...one conference champion from among <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conference_USA_59f3.html" title="Conference USA">Conference USA</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Mid-American_Conference_6a89.html" title="Mid-American Conference">Mid-American</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_West_Conference_aca4.html" title="Mountain West Conference">Mountain West</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Belt_Conference_4614.html" title="Sun Belt Conference">Sun Belt</a>, and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Athletic_Conference_1aed.html" title="Western Athletic Conference">Western Athletic Conferences</a> will automatically qualify to play in a BCS bowl if it is: (1) ranked among the top 12 teams in the final BCS Standings; or (2) ranked among the top 16 teams in the final BCS Standings and ranked higher than the champion of one of the conferences whose champion has an annual automatic berth in a BCS bowl."</i><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> In the first year with this new rule, Boise State was able to earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl by virtue of a 12-0 regular season and #8 ranking in the final BCS Standings. Boise State became the second non-BCS school (after Utah in 2004) to play in a BCS game, and the second to win, defeating Oklahoma 43-42 in overtime.</p>
<p>If the 2006 automatic qualification standards had been in place, the following additional teams would have been guaranteed automatic selection to the BCS during the first eight seasons of the BCS: 1998 Tulane, Conference USA (#8); 1999 Marshall, Mid-American (#12); 2003 Miami (Ohio), Mid-American (#11).<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The term BCS Buster refers to any team not from a BCS conference that manages to earn a spot in a BCS bowl game.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> With the exception of independents, it is generally more difficult for a non-BCS team to reach a BCS bowl than for a BCS conference team (see rules above), so becoming a BCS Buster is noteworthy. Even though there have been a number of worthy teams, only two teams have actually been considered by the BCS officials to be "good enough" to become BCS Busters. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Utah_bbd8.html" title="University of Utah">University of Utah</a> football program became the first BCS Buster in 2004 after an undefeated season. The <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Utes_3413.html" title="Utah Utes">Utah Utes</a> played in the 2004 Tostitos <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fiesta_Bowl_75b3.html" title="Fiesta Bowl">Fiesta Bowl</a>, and beat their opponent, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pittsburgh_9287.html" title="University of Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pittsburgh_Panthers_1ca9.html" title="University of Pittsburgh Panthers">Panthers</a>, 35-7.</p>
<p>With the addition of a fifth BCS bowl game in 2006 and the accompanying rule changes, it is now slightly less difficult to bust into the BCS. It is unclear whether or not BCS Busters will become more commonplace, but due to the rule change, in 2006 <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise_State_Broncos_football_7428.html" title="Boise State Broncos football">Boise State</a> became the second BCS Buster after a 12-0 regular season and subsequent Fiesta Bowl berth against the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oklahoma_0676.html" title="University of Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_Sooners_football_9223.html" title="Oklahoma Sooners football">Sooners</a>. The Broncos won 43-42 in overtime, making non-BCS teams undefeated (2-0) in BCS bowl games.</p>
<p>Each season, among all the preseason picks and predictions, media members will pick their most likely BCS Buster(s). In addition to the two successful BCS Busters, recent media favorites have included, but are not limited to, Louisville in early 2004,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> Boise State in late 2004, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Christian_University_ffb7.html" title="Texas Christian University">TCU</a> at several different points over the last few years (2003, late 2005 and early in 2006), and <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_RedHawks_football_4c44.html" title="Miami RedHawks football">Miami University</a> (Ohio) late in 2003.</p>
