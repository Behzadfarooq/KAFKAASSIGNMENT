<p>I herad that the reason there is ten pins is because nine pin bowling was outlawed in many colonies due to gambling and such. well, this displeased most practitioners of the sport, but a large loophole was found: throw in another pin and it is no longer nine pins, but ten pins, making it therefore legal.</p>

<dd>I agree as well...The article is long, and discusses issues that would generally be outside the confines of a "general" article about bowling. Additionally, the article contains many false or misleading statements. When I have more time, I will attempt to edit it. One minor problem: the U.S. Open, PBA World Championship, and PBA Tournament of Champions do not use "sport bowling" lane conditions. --MMan710 17:51, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For the hell of it, I looked up "sport" after reading "There is disagreement over whether bowling should be regarded as a sport." Sure enough, bowling is easily classifiable as a sport (alongside darts, perhaps) according to that page. This is a good example of disagreement between wikipedia pages.</p>

<p>I really enjoy bowling but yet it gets me mad as hec when i miss all the pins. Well who cares it just a sport right?

<p>Consider that until very recently, the typical format of a PBA Tour tournament consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning of Day1 (usually Wednesday) - six games of qualifying, changing lanes between games</li>
<li>Evening of Day1 - six games of qualifying</li>
<li>Morning of Day2 - six games of qualifying</li>
<li>Cut to the top 24 scorers</li>
<li>Evening of Day2 - eight games of head-to-head match play</li>
<li>Morning of Day3 - eight games of head-to-head match play</li>
<li>Evening of Day3 - eight games of head-to-head match play</li>
<li>Cut to the top 5 scorers</li>
<li>Saturday TV show.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <i>forty-two games in three days</i>, not including the TV show. For anyone to not consider this to be a significant physical and mental challenge, well they are simply ignorant. Surely, at the top level, bowling is a great sport! Irish Pat 21:43, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think bowling is to sport as video games is to art, that is to say, the answer will vary by generation and by those who play and those who don't, and those who dedicate themselves to it. maybe the last sentence needs to reflect this? btw, videogames are totally art, even something as simple as frogger is art. like warhold and his blurred line between comercial and consumer and high art, etc. but that's me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>By what definition of sport is bowling not a sport? I don't think this section needs to be there. This is what the sports article says about sports:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>A sport consists of a physical and mentally competitive activity carried out with a recreational purpose for competition, for self-enjoyment, to attain excellence, for the development of a skill, or some combination of these. A sport has physical activity, side by side competition, self-motivation and a scoring system.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Who has argued it is not a sport? Is there a citation to a reputable source claiming it is not a sport? Unless cogent arguements are given to the contrary I will remove this section tommorow. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 21:09, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/o/w/Talk%7EBowling_8bcf.html" title="Edit section: Why are there bowling shoes?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why are there bowling shoes?</span></h2>
<p>As the heading indicates, someone explain this.</p>
<p><br />
The reason there are bowling shoes is because proper delivery of a bowling ball requires an approach to the lane (usually 4 or 5 steps), which requires sliding at the end (for a right hander, you slide on your left foot). If a skilled bowler were to take a normal approach wearing a normal shoe or sneaker, they would not slide, and their forward momentum would cause them to fall (and hurt themselves).</p>
<p>The reason why bowling proprietors require normal people to wear bowling shoes is because even if you are delivering the ball by walking slowly up to the lane, the forward movement of throwing the ball will make you slide. If you wear regular shoes, you may stick and fall.</p>
<p>Additionally, since regular shoes can scuff the lanes or deposit dirt on the lanes, it can cause other bowlers to slide improperly and hurt themselves.</p>
<p>Bowling shoes are made with special soles that enable you to slide. While shoes you rent have sliding soles on each foot, shoes bought for the personal use of serious bowlers have different soles (the major brands of bowling shoes include Dexter and Linds). For a right hander, the left foot sole is made to encourage sliding, whereas the right foot is made of materials intended to allow your foot to grip the floor better for greater traction. I hope this answers your question. --MMan710 17:47, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This should be mentioned in the article. I think that bowling ball technology itself is sufficiently complex that it needs its own article. There is a lot more stuff (bowling ball bags, shoes, resin, wrist stabilizers, etc.) that can be listed under this article's 'technology' heading. - <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstvanWolf_aaa4.html" title="User:IstvanWolf">IstvanWolf</a> 22:56, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. The bowling ball technology section also has several problems and inaccuracies, with some poorly written sections (like the sentence you removed). When I have more time I plan to edit it and remove them. --MMan710 19:26, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm left-handed and I have normal dexter bowling shoes, both have sliding soles. Hm, I think they are making i for both right and left handed bowlers. -Frankyboy5</p>

<p>I removed the following, as the latter part is un-encyclopedic and the whole thing is pretty much self-evident (in what real-life example do people with money *not* buy the most advanced gadgets for use in whatever pursuits they are engaged?): "Many advanced bowlers frequently buy new, improved bowling balls to try to obtain an advantage over their opponents, and all have access, at least as far as their bank accounts can go." - <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstvanWolf_aaa4.html" title="User:IstvanWolf">IstvanWolf</a> 22:57, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed a paragraph, recently added, from the very problematic "Ball Technology" section. The section as a whole is poorly written, with content of questionable substantive content. The information about 15 to 16 pound balls is VERY questionable. While many professionals have gone to 15 pound equipment, it is because newer ball technology is more powerful, thus one sacrifices less power by switching to the lower ball weight. While this information would be useful if added, the current section was so problematic, it is better deleted than there. --MMan710 05:18, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
