<p>Bowling for Soup was formed in <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wichita_Falls%2C_Texas_b2c5.html" title="Wichita Falls, Texas">Wichita Falls, Texas</a> in 1994 by <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jaret_Reddick_2628.html" title="Jaret Reddick">Jaret Reddick</a> (lead vocals, guitar), Erik Chandler (bass guitar, backing vocals), <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Burney_eb20.html" title="Chris Burney">Chris Burney</a> (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Lance Morril (drums, backing vocals). Morril left the band in 1998 (on good terms) and was replaced by Gary Wiseman. The band's name is derived from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedian.html" title="Comedian">comedian</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Martin_d496.html" title="Steve Martin">Steve Martin</a>'s "Bowling for Shit" routine from his 1978 comedy album, <i>Wild and Crazy Guy</i>, itself a reference to <i><a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_for_Dollars_e2dd.html" title="Bowling for Dollars">Bowling for Dollars</a></i>. In 1998, the band relocated to <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denton%2C_Texas_f669.html" title="Denton, Texas">Denton, Texas</a> and recorded their first studio album]] <i><a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_On_Honorable_Ones%21%21%21_bac7.html" title="Rock On Honorable Ones!!!">Rock On Honorable Ones!!!</a></i> in 1998 for Denton music label FFROE. Bowling for Soup released their first studio album, Tell Me When To Whoa!!!<i>, through FFROE later that year. The album sold over 10,000 copies, prompting <a href="../../../j/i/v/Jive_Records_d91d.html" title="Jive Records">Jive Records</a> to sign the band.</i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Let%27s_Do_It_for_Johnny%21_c8ee.html" title="Let's Do It for Johnny!">Let's Do It for Johnny!</a> <i>, Bowling for Soup's major label debut, was released on Jive in 2000. The album mostly contained re-recordings of their previous material, but it also contained a few new tracks and a cover of <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Adams_219c.html" title="Bryan Adams">Bryan Adams</a>' song "<a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_of_%2769.html" title="Summer of '69">Summer of '69</a>".</i></p>

<p>In 2002, the band recorded their second major label album, <i><a href="../../../d/r/u/Drunk_Enough_to_Dance_812a.html" title="Drunk Enough to Dance">Drunk Enough to Dance</a></i>. The lead single from the album, "<a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_All_the_Bad_Guys_Want_50a9.html" title="Girl All the Bad Guys Want">Girl All the Bad Guys Want</a>", became a top 10 hit in the UK and a top 100 hit in the US. The next year, the single was nominated for the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_0dda.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</a> for "Best Pop Performance by a Group or Duo". The success of the single helped <i>Drunk Enough to Dance</i> reach #2 on the <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard.html" title="Billboard">Billboard</a></i> <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Heatseekers_d2fd.html" title="Top Heatseekers">Top Heatseekers</a> album chart, with a peak of #129 on the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_200.html" title="Billboard 200"><i>Billboard</i> 200</a>. The follow up single, "Emily" did not fare so well, climbing to a disappointing #67 in the UK Singles chart and not even charting in the US. Bowling For Soup's record label felt that a third single should be released, because of the success of "<a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_All_the_Bad_Guys_Want_50a9.html" title="Girl All the Bad Guys Want">Girl All the Bad Guys Want</a>" but did not feel any of the remaining songs on <i><a href="../../../d/r/u/Drunk_Enough_to_Dance_812a.html" title="Drunk Enough to Dance">Drunk Enough to Dance</a></i> were single material. So the band recorded a new song, "<a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_Rock_101_0401.html" title="Punk Rock 101">Punk Rock 101</a>" to release as the third single. The song was included on a re-issue of the album <i><a href="../../../d/r/u/Drunk_Enough_to_Dance_812a.html" title="Drunk Enough to Dance">Drunk Enough to Dance</a></i>. The single was more successful than "Emily", climbing to #43 in the UK Singles Chart. In support of their album, Bowling For Soup enbarked on a UK tour, being supported by such UK bands as <a href="../../../s/p/u/Spunge.html" title="Spunge">[spunge]</a>.</p>

<p>Following the release of their covers album, Bowling for Soup spent most of 2006 readying their seventh studio album, entitled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Burrito_Extortion_Case_cbe5.html" title="The Great Burrito Extortion Case">The Great Burrito Extortion Case</a></i>, which was released on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. They released the first single off that album, "High School Never Ends", to <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a> on September 19, 2006. The music video for "<a href="../../../h/i/g/High_School_Never_Ends_55f5.html" title="High School Never Ends">High School Never Ends</a>" debuted in the UK on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">December 8</a> 2006 on Kerrang TV and is currently available to select from their playlist. The band embarked on a US tour in support of the release of their new album, which ended in late January 2007. This was followed by a UK tour in early February 2007. Coinciding with this UK tour was the UK release of the album on 5th February 2007, a full 3 months after the US release.
