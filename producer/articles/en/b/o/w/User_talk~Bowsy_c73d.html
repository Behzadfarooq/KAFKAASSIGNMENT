<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've noticed that you've been adding or removing content from articles with the edit summary "rv vandalism" or "remove vandalism". However, many of the edits before these edits were not vandalism, rather <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> edits. It's encouraged to assume good faith on Wikipedia, meaning that edits that aren't blatant vandalism should not usually be considered vandalism. Try to use a different edit summary, such as "rm/rv <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith edits</a>". You are quite a good contributor, especially for a relatively (&lt;2 months) new user. Try to improve based on this message, and keep up the good work! –<a href="../../../l/l/a/User%7ELlama_man_ae32.html" title="User:Llama man">Llama</a> <a href="../../../l/l/a/User_talk%7ELlama_man_2dbb.html" title="User talk:Llama man">man</a><sup><span style="color:red;">sign here</span></sup> 20:03, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I apologize, but I had to remove the image of the shroob. I have seen the "fight" you had with Metros about a Bowser pic, am I wrong? I'm sorry, but those types of images are official artwork. It breaks Florida law. I see in your last post regarding the Bowser pic on his page, you complained that the image should have been replaced with a link to the image. If you would like the link on I am sorry, but just type [[:Image:Shroob.jpg|Your text here]] where the image used to be.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I have no proof. Nor does Metros. However, it is clearly stated on a guideline page and sorry, must be followed.</p>

<p>I have been suspected as a sockpuppet of Henchman 2000, which I'm not. They have no evidence to say this except that our pages are similar, we edit at roughly the same time and that I voted for the deletion of WP:CRUFT.

<p>I have encouraged no one to treat you unfairly. Check my edit history. Where exactly did I do that? I can't just tell people not to agree with my opinion. I don't control what others think and/or post on Wikipedia. I'm using no tricks: I'm following the guidelines (which everyone needs to follow, there shouldn't be exceptions made). You and Henchman share a computer, while it appears you aren't sockpuppets, meatpuppets seems more likely (even if both of you dispute it). I don't want anyone banned from Wikipedia, so don't put words in my mouth. Also: I didn't create the sockpuppet and meatpuppet guidelines (and I wasn't the first to post the guideline mentioned either). So I certainly didn't just throw that out there and convince everyone to agree about that. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 11:52, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for the whole "encouraging" nonsense: I was just pointing out something people should know. The sockpuppet case is closed, but the comment at the bottom still applies. There is absolutely no reason to ignore it, or pretend it never happened. You and Henchman share a computer, and it's possible you two are meatpuppets. Ignoring the fact you two share a computer (and the whole sockpuppet case and so on), isn't how Wikipedia works. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 23:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I already know what Isotope wrote (I read his comment: as it was posted on the RFC for Henchman days ago). That request for comment is still not settled, by the way. The RFC isn't about meatpuppetry, in case you were wondering. It's about Henchman's personal attacks and threats. Well I'm glad you didnt go and post an attack like Henchman did. So I will give you credit for that. But nothing has been proven against meatpuppetry still, in my opinion. Sockpuppetry: yes, proven you two aren't that... but meat is a different story. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:46, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I made my position fairly clear on the page. I would be quite willing to change my vote if I saw a significant change in the article, and I believe it could be cleaned up. However, at present I believe the article is highly unencyclopedic and I believe that, due to the nature of the article, it would be difficult to rewrite it in an appropriately encyclopedic manner. Perhaps comparing it to a walkthrough was inappropriate, but the fact remains that there is little encyclopedic content on that page. If the minigames were described in more clarity or with more than just a simple plot summary of what the player must do (hence the "walkthrough"), then I would support the article's inclusion. However, as it stands, I see no reason to change my vote of weak delete. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 17:09, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure the article could be made very encyclopedic, given the subject matter. If you really need suggestions as to how to clean up the article, first of all, the article should be referenced appropriately; at the moment (or the last time I saw the article anyway) there were just a bunch of links hanging around. To rectify this, see the appropriate pages at <a href="../../../h/o/w/WP%7EHOW_8408.html" title="WP:HOW">WP:HOW</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/y/WP%7ESTYLE_9c31.html" title="WP:STYLE">WP:STYLE</a>. As far as the data go, if you were to include more about the minigames' history, significance and function in the game, and any important details about the minigames, they might be improved to make the article useful. However, as I said, the reason that I favor the article's deletion is that I don't think there is much of substance to the article that could constitute an encyclopedic article, even though I believe the games themselves are notable. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 20:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, the changes you made are an improvement to the article, but I don't know that they are sufficient to make the article very encyclopedic. And it would still require a great deal of work to appropriately source the article. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 21:23, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for the slow response; I was busy for a couple of days. I haven't looked at the details of this sockpuppet/meatpuppet business, but my best advice to you would be to step back from commenting on polls, <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfDs</a>, etc., for a while. If you're not saying anything and <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenchman_2000_6976.html" title="User:Henchman 2000">User:Henchman 2000</a> continues to speak up, it might be more obvious that the two of you aren't working collaboratively. Give it a few weeks, and things should cool off. If it continues to be a problem, then maybe it's time to abandon this account and create a new one instead. Stop using <a href="../../../b/o/w/User%7EBowsy_2307.html" title="User:Bowsy">User:Bowsy</a> entirely, and "become" a different person. Then forget about the places where these conflicts were occurring and get on with your Wikilife elsewhere on Wikipedia.

<p>Well, that's just completely inane. Really. "Face Lift - Similar to playing with Mario's face in "Super Mario 64", players try to get their Bowser face to match the face in the center. The player with the closest match to the center face wins." How is this not guide content? It's telling you how the game is won. A list of levels would never tell you how to beat the level in any way, or at what points you would beat the level, so why in the world can a mini-game list do so? And I ask you, why does a list of mini-games have ANY encyclopedic value whatsoever? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:38, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The problem isn't necessarily references. It's the fact that these articles do absolutely no good to non-Mario Party fans.

<p>Hi, I have rewritten the introduction to List of Mario Party minigames. As I know nothing about the game except what's in the article and what I skimmed from the references, I'd appreciate it if you would take a look. Thanks, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. If the article is kept (to me, it looks like a "no consensus"), I think the main issue would be to add more real-world context and description of the minigames in relation to the overall game, rather than about the minigames themselves.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. And yes, the games are decided by the colour of the spaces the players land on; <i>that</i> is randomly selected. But you are right, that should be noted somehow. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 16:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I will try to add some prose for the other lists but can make no promises unfortunately. It largely depends on how much coverage there is of versions 2-8. Also, I have a backlog with a few other articles, so I may not be able to get to the Mario lists soon. However, I will do my best to research and add a little to each list in the coming days.

<dd>I just noticed that the first list was deleted. I don't know if the ruling will be appealed, but I don't think adding prose to the other lists is likely to save them from deletion. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There are several people who support rewriting the material and including it in the main game articles. I think it's impossible to properly describe a game without describing its levels. It only becomes a game guide when it tells you how to play the game, or give a walkthrough or cheats for its levels. You might be better off convincing people that the reasoning is faulty instead of challenging the validity of their comment/vote. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:32, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The comments I saw from McKay used faulty reasoning. They put the burden on the discussion participants about things that are the creator or the article's editors' responsibilities.

<dd>And next time before accusing me of, and I quote, <b>Vote is abuse of DRV, for it is not about content. This user has clearly voted in this manner because they also did so on the AfD, and for no other reason.</b>, you should make sure you actually know what the f**k your talking about BEFORE you throw around words like 'abuse'. Even a 'special' person would have thought a smart move would be to first check the AfD to see if I had voted. Let me talk you through how to do this.

<p>Bowsy, my exact words when I closed the sock case were:<br />
<i>"...however, that being the case you both need to be careful about meatpuppetry; soliciting a person sharing your computer to show up to articles for deletion debates or content conflicts on articles and support your position is probably not going to be looked upon very favorably by the community. Both of you need to keep that in mind."</i><br />
I have no authority to tell you what you can and cannot participate in here, but like I said in that statement, participating in the same AfD's as Henchman probably isn't going to be looked favorably upon; and that is pretty much where this has gone. My suggestion on AN/I that you both be barred from participating in the same AfD's is the common sense solution in my opinion. I don't want to see you or Henchman get blocked or banned from general editing here and it appears that 90% of the issues and conflict surrounding the both of you are stemming from these AfDs. At this point though it is up to the community at large on <a href="../../../c/n/_/WP%7ECN_1165.html" title="WP:CN">WP:CN</a> how this should be handled.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:30, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I said/say isn't the final word here. The text I posted there was a statement of opinion, not some official decree from on high. Up to this point there is no policy, etc that says you cannot participate in the same XfD's but like I've said several times, doing so may wear out the community patience here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:48, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sadly your <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freudian_slip.html" title="Freudian slip">Freudian slip</a> makes your combined intentions perfectly clear in my opinion, and given your abuse of the DRV process and harassment of anyone who disagrees with the deletion of the non-encylopedic articles, you have dug your own grave in my opinion and seemingly in the opinions of other editors as well. Your badgering of me based on my comment on WP:CN is inappropriate, and I kindly ask that you desist from it henceforth. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 18:16, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
