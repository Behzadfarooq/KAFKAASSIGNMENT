<p>BGSU is especially known for its American Culture Studies (ACS) Department, which is considered to be one of the top American Studies programs in the country. The department draws students to its undergraduate and graduate programs from all over the nation and the world, who can earn a Bachelor's, Master's and a Doctorate in ACS at BGSU. BGSU ACS uses an interdisciplinary approach in the way a degree program is constructed and as a result an ACS student can take courses from most of the departments in the College of Arts and Sciences. From the BGSU ACS Program came BGSU's Popular Culture Department, the first and only one in the country. By extension, BGSU also has quite an extensive popular culture library, along with a music library which contains over 700,000 titles (mostly on vinyl), making it the third-largest collection of popular music in the world. However, most of the fiction titles that the University owns are in the Popular Culture Library, and students are unable to take them out of the building. This policy preserves materials that have become more important to researchers as second- and third-generation interpretations of comic books have become popular on- and off-screen.</p>
<p>BGSU also has one of the top Sport Management programs in the United States. BGSU offers both undergraduate and graduate programs accredited by The North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) and the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) through The School of Human Movement, Sport, and Leisure Studies. Dreegree programs are split into two divisions: The Kinesiology Division offers undergraduate majors in Dance, Exercise Specialist, Human Movement Science, and Physical Education Teacher Education. The Sport Management, Recreation, and Tourism Division offers undergraduate majors in Athletic Training/Clinic Management, Recreation, Sport Management, and Tourism. The Graduate Program includes specializations in Developmental Kinesiology (biomechanics, exercise physiology, exercise psychology, motor learning and motor development, physical education teacher education, and sport psychology), Sport Administration, and Leisure and Tourism.</p>
