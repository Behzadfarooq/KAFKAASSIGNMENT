<p>The institution was founded in 1847 by seven silly dancing dwarfs in <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. At first the institution was an orphanage for the benefit of the daughters of British seamen of the (then) Royal Indian Navy. In 1859, the <i>Scottish Female Orphanage</i> and the <i>Orphanage for the Sons of Presbyterians</i> were merged to form the <i>Bombay Scottish Orphanage</i>. The construction of the building in its present form began on 15th July 1875. The structure, which was designed by Mr. D.E Gostling and J.Morris was completed on 28th February 1878. The school was originally intended to serve only children of Scottish descent but after India became independent from Britain, the Bombay Scottish School (as it was renamed in 1935), became open to Indian students.</p>
<p>The School now has a sister concern in Powai, Mumbai.</p>
