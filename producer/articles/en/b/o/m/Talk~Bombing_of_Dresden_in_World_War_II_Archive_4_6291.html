<dd>Just to be clear, I didn't add this sentence in the first place, I just restored it and modified it slightly after Philip had removed it. All the same, I do think that the information elsewhere in the article (eg the "Was the Dresden bombing justified?" section, External links section, etc) are adequate to keep the sentence as it was, without linking sources for it from the opening paragraph. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif"></a><tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> <small>(<a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif">talk</a>)</small>[[]] 08:53, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because Noam Chomsky makes an extreme statement to open the article does not mean that the article is not valid or that it is nonfactual.

<p>I do not mind the statment appearing lower down but not in a brief introduction where it can not be refuted in detail. To prove the point I have turned the source on its head by adding "do not". Lets talk about it. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:18, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The bit about people believing they should be tried as war criminals was redundant; it can be inferred from the fact they believe it was a warcrime. The external links should go in the links section. --<a href="../../../k/h/e/User%7EKhendon_2ad2.html" title="User:Khendon">Khendon</a> 09:31, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Philip, these were just the first handful I could drag Google from Dresden. I could come up with countless others, and you know it. That's why we say "many". I'm quite happy for it to read as I had it, lose the sources, and to give the opposite view: "however, some believe it to have been necessary in the context of total war" or whatever. Weasel words are in this instance far preferable to littering the article with thousands of so-so references and bickering over them. I agree with Leif overall. The intro sums up the material presented elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 09:33, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So we are all agreed that there are already good articles at the end of the document and that the references are not needed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The sentence which is there now is even worse than the original! "<i>Some regard the bombing as a war crime and an act of state terrorism, while others believe it was a justified act of war.</i>" This can be read that those who think that the bombing was justified think that it was a war crime and state terrorism but war justified it. Which is not true. There are good legal reasons for thinking that it was neither.
<ol>
<li>as it pointed out lower down in the article. One can not say that it was a war crime.</li>
<li>To say that this is state terrorism could be said about any act in war. For example one can argue the the invasion of Normandy in 1944 was state terrorism because it was the use of violence by a state as a means of political intimidation and control. The definition given in the article is "The use or threat of violence by the state or its agents or supporters, particularly against civilian individuals and populations, as a means of political intimidation and control (i.e. a means of repression)". The bombing of Dresden was not about "repression".</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>what was the firebombing of Dresden about then? Humanitarian aid? Decreasing the fire shortage? A happy barbeque party? <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 17:18, 2004 Dec 14 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The article starts with the phrase "remains controversial after more than 50 years" It contains in the section on "Was the Dresden bombing justified?". The advantage of using the Churchill quote in the introduction is that it allows the concerns of "many people" to be indicated without the need to use a weasel statement. However given the first sentence this one could simpley be removed.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 10:52, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"It cannot be considered a crime because no one was tried." LOL. If Hitler had won, Churchill would have swung. What a foolish argument and one that even a rampant POV pusher should be ashamed of making!<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 00:20, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where does the quote come from? Unlike the waging of unrestricted submarine warfare, for which Karl Donitz was tried and found guilty; assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory was never tried, so "it is not possible to state categorically that aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory during World War II was a war crime." See <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Conventions_%281899_and_1907%29_6818.html" title="Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)">Hague IV</a> <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Arts 25,26,27.

<p>Lacking a good reason to <i>not</i> include the sentence in question, I have restored it again. I followed Khendon's suggestion, and removed the redundancy of saying <i>war crimes</i> and <i>war criminals</i> in the same sentence. Philip, I think that to state that "many people" believe a thing is <b>not</b> necessarily "weasel terms", but I would certainly not oppose improved alternate wordings that convey the same information.

<dl>
<dd>Because I can add the words "do not" and the sentence you have added and it would be just as true. the wording "The controversy is centred around the legal and moral justifications for the raids." already covers the point you and I wish to make. The sentence you have added is PVO and bloat to the introduction. Yet another sentence to balance it would just bloat the introduction further. As both POVs are covered "Was the Dresden bombing justified" section why not leave the controversy to that section? [BTW <b>centred</b> is a correct spelling (as is <b>centered</b>) but squatters rights makes centred correct in this case].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have just covered why "war crime" is a POV in (my last reply). Do I need to explain it further to you? I also covered "state terrorism" a little higher up this section but to expand it further. The definition of "state terrorism" in the article "state terrorism" does not cover acts like the bombing of Dresden "(<i>i.e. a means of repression)</i>". The article also goes on to say "However, many contend that states cannot commit acts of terror and/or that acts of terror cannot be committed within the scope of a declared war." See my comments above about the Normandy invasion. This is too much to add to a introductory paragraph so it is better put into the section "as the Dresden bombing justified" where the arguments can be expanded.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:31, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<ol>
<li>Saying that "The controversy is centred around the legal and moral justifications for the raids" does <b>not</b> convey the same meaning as "many people regard it as a war crime or an act of state terrorism"</li>
<li>The article about <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">state terrorism</a> actually <i>does</i> specifically address Dresden and some of the reasons why many people believe that it qualifies.</li>
<li>Your comments above about the invasion of Normandy are a non-sequitur - one event involved troops fighting other troops, on the ground, while the other was solely an air raid on a civilian population.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I can't/won't argue with you about if Dresden <i>was</i> a war crime because I suspect you'll always fall back on your argument that, since nobody was tried for it, it <i>can't</i> be one. That many people do regard it as one <i>is</i> a fact, however, and I think it's one worth of mentioning in the opening. There are numerous references to people saying it was one, and I have seen only a handful saying it was not. I don't have time to argue on and on about this right now, but unless someone can provide a good reason to not include this sentence I will probably continue to re-add it to the article if Philip keeps removing it. Philip lost his credibility, in my opinion, when he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II&amp;diff=8262327&amp;oldid=8262121" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II&amp;diff=8262327&amp;oldid=8262121" rel="nofollow">inserted</a> <i>DO NOT</i> before the word <i>regard</i> in the sentence in question. I take the statement's continued presence in the paragraph for a good length of time (I haven't found exactly when it was first added, but there was something about war crimes in the opening paragraph at least a year ago) as approval by other editors who read it, and so far I've only seen one person (Philip) who wants no mention of war crimes there at all.</dd>
<dd>Also, btw, I did not realize that <i>centred</i> was a valid spelling, sorry about changing that (my spellchecker didn't know it either). I don't follow your reference to <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatters_rights.html" title="Squatters rights">squatters rights</a> though; what do you mean by that? <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif"></a><tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> <small>(<a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif">talk</a>)</small>[[]] 20:15, Dec 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have not said that it was not war crime. It have not said that it was not one because no one was tried for the act of bombing Dresden. I have said that as no one was tried for the ANY act of "aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory during World War II", <i>it is not possible to state categorically that that aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory during World War II was a war crime</i>. As the POV appears in a section were it is possible to place it in context, I do not think that a POV statement dressed up in weasel words should be in the introduction as a replacement sentence like "The controversy is centred around the legal and moral justifications for the raids." expresses the same thing without a POV. I do not want to get into an edit war with you, and you have stated that you "<i>can't/won't argue</i>" and that "<i>I will probably continue to re-add it to the article if Philip keeps removing it</i>" so I suggest that we have a straw poll on the question with two options:<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a></p>

<li>Many people regard the bombing as an act of <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">state terrorism</a>, and believe that the allied commanders who ordered the action and the airmen who carried it out should have been tried as <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war criminals</a>.</li>
<li>The controversy is centred around the legal and moral justifications for the raids.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please alter (1) to whatever wording you like here on this page and then we will have a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html#Conduct_a_survey" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution#Conduct a survey</a> straw poll on the issue.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 23:12, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't object to the first sentence, but think it is wrong to have it in the intro <i>by itself</i>, without stating the other side (that no German was tried for any Lutwaffe bombing of civilians [Warsaw, Hague, London, etc, etc], that some British leaders thought they were acting for real military goals, etc). So either we should give <i>both</i> sides in the intro para, or <i>neither</i>. I would much prefer the latter, and leave the intro with just i) a bald statement of the facts, and ii) note that it remains controversial. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:28, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, but then I'd want to see <i>four</i> options in said poll:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple statement that there is controversy around the legal and moral justifications for the raids.</li>
<li>Statement that some people consider the bombings a war crime, and no countervailing viewpoint.</li>
<li>Statement that some people consider the bombings to have been a then-acceptable act of war, and no countervailing viewpoint.</li>
<li>Statements on both sides.</li>

<p>Personally, I would consider <i>either</i> 2 or 3 to be non-NPOV, and thus completely unaccepable, and would therefore argue that they aren't legitimate options.

<li>Huh? Option one is to say <i>precisely</i>, right up top, that there <i>is</i> controversy over whether the bombings were justified and/or 'right'. Nobody's trying to sweep anything under the rug. And your claim that "no controversy" -&gt; "no article" fails - see comments below about the article on the attack on Hamburg. And I consider your claim that "The interest of some here is <b>solely</b> to write an apologia" to be i) wrong, ii) self-righteous, iii) insulting, and iv) offensive.

<li>Option one leaves the article not mentioning "war crimes" until halfway through it. Just saying it is <i>controversial</i> is a massive understatement, catering to the POV that it was not a war crime, a POV which it appears Philip was been slowly but surely promoting more in this article for quite some time. ~leif</li>
<li>I'd be OK with somewhat punchier language than "controversial", to make it clear how deep some people's assessment is, but without some more data as to how widely the "war crime" POV is held, I don't know how to <i>balance</i> the treatment of the two (actually, many) views. That's part of what leads me towards quite brief language in the opening - how to accurately convey what is a <b>very</b> complex set of views in such a small amount of language.

<li>Good question, actually. Almost every German city was heavily bombed, but only a few of these attacks have articles. E.g. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, the target of the first '1,000 bomber raid', has no article on that attack. The article on <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Hamburg_in_World_War_II_ec3c.html" title="Bombing of Hamburg in World War II">the fire-bombing of Hamburg</a> has gone to the other end of the spectrum from this one, and has no discussion of the necessity/legality/morality of area bombing of cities. Which maybe says that we ought to have an article about that specific topic, where we can marshall the data and arguments at length, instead of having it scattered in dribs and drabs in various articles on specific acts. We can then reference it from <i>all</i> the relevant pages (Hamburg, etc). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 13:14, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<p>I think that options 2, 3, and 4 are are just begging for perpetual NPOV issues and weasel words. I think that the options should be replaced with the text which is proposed for each one so that people know what they are voting for. I suggest for option (1), that to help clarify the statement the word "justifications" can be linked to the subsection heading "Was the Dresden bombing justified?":</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The controversy is centred around the legal and moral <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II_6c21.html#Was_the_Dresden_bombing_justified.3F" title="Bombing of Dresden in World War II">justifications for the raids</a></i>.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a> you say "that it <i>was</i> a war crime", what was the alleged war crime which you think was committed? If you do that then 2 might be an option with a little less POV but I doubt it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have not suggested that the article should definitively state that it <i>was</i> a war crime. The crime that <i>I</i> think was committed was intentionally killing huge a huge number of civilians. I know that many people do not consider killing civilians to be a crime (I think I've actually read you say it isn't), and I don't object to representing that POV in the article also.

<dd>It's not at all clear that their <i>primary intention</i> (as opposed to an inevitable side-effect, one they knew about and accepted before-hand) <b>was</b> to "kill[] a huge number of civilians". Yes, this distinction is a fine hair which won't bring much comfort to the victims and their families, etc, but fine distinctions of this sort, with the same lack of comfort to the victims, are common in legal proceedings, and can have enormous effects on the outcome (e.g. someone who kills someone in what they maintain was self-defense). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:31, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have not been able to find a primary source which says that targeting civilians in enemy territory is a crime. This surprises me because the British Government was careful to state that they were targeting property useful to the German war effort, not Germans. But this is somting we can discuss further after the poll. PBS</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that option (4) is a realy bad idea because it adds bloat. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>One can argue that before the failure of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Berlin_%28air%29_86c7.html" title="Battle of Berlin (air)">battle of Berlin (air)</a> that the British, as the Germans before them, were committed to a "state terror" bombing campaign because they were trying to do massive material and morale damage to the enemy in a total war. But after the failure of the battle of Berlin, with the directive, dated 25 September 1944, recommending that RAF Bomber Command concentrate on oil and communications targets, which was the American position, the former policy and hopes were abandoned. The primary reason for bombing Dresden was for its communications links the secondary reason (See Yalta) was that it still had a relatively intact arms industry. There is very little to no evidence that the Allied High Command expected to be able to alter German morale, let alone Hitler's views, by this raid.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I do not see how this explanation can be comfortably placed in the introductory section (because it is so large) when there is already a section where this can be covered if necessary. To put "Many [why not some?] people regard the bombing as an act of state terrorism and many [why not some?] do not" is just POV with no useful information. "Many people regard the bombing as an act of state terrorism because they do not know about the directive, dated 25 September 1944, recommending that RAF Bomber Command concentrate on oil and communications targets". Would give a lot more information but would probably be unacceptable to you and would add bloat to the introduction when in could go into the appropriate section. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 21:12, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

This bombing (and also Hamburg, and all the other ones that get less visibility) <i>is</i> very troubling, but we need to be accurate about the complexities of the situation, and also do so in a way that respects that the mental framework of today is not the framework of then, and it's unfair to apply today's standards to then (just as it's unfair to criticize, say, the Greeks of Pericles' era for allowing slavery, using today's moral framework). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:31, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>YES "war crime" should be mentioned in the section "Was the Dresden bombing justified?" as one of the legal controversies mentioned in the phrase "The controversy is centred around the legal and moral...". Indeed to avoid "weasel words" one could start the sentence. "The legal controversy surrounding the Dresden bombing is whether it constituted a war crime..." and "The moral controversy surrounding the bombing is whether the Allies should have considered..." There is room in that section to put both sides of the argument which there is not in the introduction.

<dd>The problem with language like "war crimes" &amp; "state terrorism" is that they inflame readers, rather than enlighten. Their use may cause a sceptical reader to react strongly over the langauge, &amp; ignore its content. This is of even greater importance as the article now stands, because these words are not attributed to anyone; one could conclude that this language was added to disingenuously discredit this opinion, e.g.: "Some people (wink) whine over what happened in Dresden, but here are rational reasons why it happened. And we all know that, unfortunately, civilians suffer during wartime. So this whole accusation is nothing more than making a mountain out of a mole hill."</dd>

The <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Hamburg_in_World_War_II_ec3c.html" title="Bombing of Hamburg in World War II">Bombing of Hamburg in World War II</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing_of_Kassel_in_World_War_II_72e9.html" title="Bombing of Kassel in World War II">Bombing of Kassel in World War II</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blitz_2aa3.html" title="The Blitz">The Blitz</a> have not a mention of "war crimes" or an "apologia" yet articles have been written. Who has written "solely to write an apologia"? "Why do they feel the need" are weasel words. There is a whole section on the controversy so why emphasise one POV in the introduction? There are articles on lots of things which happened in World War II written as a matter of interest and to write "if there were no controversy there would be no article" is just wrong. You go on to say "and there is controversy because and only because some believe the bombings to have been criminal acts." No there is also the moral issue of should the Allied high command, knowing the effects of earlier raids, not have considered German civilian loss of life when selecting targets at Yalta. The arguments put forward by British political opponents of Area Bombing during the war were moral, none of them (in the texts I have seen) argued that it was illegal. It is precisely because the type of thing which you have written above that option (1) is the best so that the subject can be discussed in detail in the appropriate sub-section. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 13:21, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I doubt Dr. Zen meant that those other events <i>shouldn't</i> have articles, just that the <i>most notable</i> thing about dresden is that it is widely believed to have been a totally unjustifiable war crime. Describing Dr. Zen's comments to you now as "weasel words" makes me wonder if you've even read the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_687f.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms</a> page you linked to. That guideline is about <b>article text</b>, not discussions. Also, having just re-read said page now, I think that the exceptions to the rule clearly apply here, to the actual article dispute in question: - "When the belief or opinion is actually the topic of discussion." - it is - "When the holders of the opinion are too diverse or numerous to qualify." - they are. If we can apply the weasel words label to things people say on talk, then I think your habit of calling things you don't like weasel words is weasel words. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif"></a><tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> <small>(<a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif">talk</a>)</small>[[]] 19:14, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no strong concern with how its worded. I am concerned that there be appropriate citations for whatever opinions are mentioned. If the wording is "Many people regard", that should be followed with at least three citations showing different notable people who hold this opinion. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:30, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>A straw poll is a good idea. Hopefully there will be a clear consensus within a week or so. ~leif (talk) 21:51, Dec 11, 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>It is now over a week and there had been no additional vote for 3 days (since 19:26, 16 Dec 2004). There is a clear majority for option 1. So unless anyone objects I suggest that this straw poll is closed at 12:00 tomorrow Dec 20. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:19, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Should every article on every battle and every war start out like this?</p>

<dd>The action described here was stupid and cruel and would not have happened without greed, ignorance, and human failure of the worst kind. The pain and horror of this event are unimaginable and can only be excused by hypothetical justifications of what would have happened otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In other words, my vote is for Option 1, recorded above. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a> 19:35, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Any evidence for this? Unless windspeeds exceeded ~150mph, unlikely. Rather sensasionalist. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> 18:34, Dec 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>
