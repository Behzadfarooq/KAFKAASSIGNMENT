<p>The first <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> settlement in the Bombay Presidency was in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1618.html" title="1618">1618</a>, when the East India Company established a factory at <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surat.html" title="Surat">Surat</a> in present-day <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, protected by a charter obtained from the <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal_empire.html" title="Mughal empire">Mughal Emperor</a> <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahangir.html" title="Jahangir">Jahangir</a>. In <a href="../../../1/6/2/1626.html" title="1626">1626</a> the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> and British made an unsuccessful attempt to gain possession of the island of <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a> in the coastal <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konkan.html" title="Konkan">Konkan</a> region from <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/6/5/1653.html" title="1653">1653</a> proposals were suggested for its purchase from the Portuguese. In <a href="../../../1/6/6/1661.html" title="1661">1661</a> it was ceded to the British crown, as part of the dowry of the infanta <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Braganza_8783.html" title="Catherine of Braganza">Catherine of Braganza</a> on her marriage with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II of England</a>. So lightly was the acquisition esteemed in England, and so unsuccessful was the administration of the crown officers, that in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1668.html" title="1668">1668</a> Bombay was transferred to the East India Company for an annual payment of £10. At the time of the transfer, powers for its defence and for the administration of justice were also conferred; a European regiment was enrolled; and the fortifications erected proved sufficient to deter the Dutch from their intended attack in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1673.html" title="1673">1673</a>. In <a href="../../../1/6/8/1687.html" title="1687">1687</a> Bombay was placed at the head of all the Company's possessions in India; but in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1753.html" title="1753">1753</a> the government of Bombay became subordinate to that of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>.</p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha_Empire_f811.html" title="Maratha Empire">Maratha Empire</a> expanded rapidly, conquering Konkan and much of eastern <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> from the disintegrating Mughal Empire. In western Gujarat, including <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathiawar.html" title="Kathiawar">Kathiawar</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutch.html" title="Cutch">Cutch</a>, the loosening of Mughal control allowed numerous local rulers to create virtually independent states. The first conflict between the British and the Marathas was the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Anglo-Maratha_War_39a6.html" title="First Anglo-Maratha War">First Anglo-Maratha War</a> which began in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1774.html" title="1774">1774</a> and resulted in the <a href="../../../1/7/8/1782.html" title="1782">1782</a> treaty of Salbai, by which <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salsette.html" title="Salsette">Salsette</a> was ceded to the British, while <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharuch.html" title="Bharuch">Bharuch</a> was ceded to the Maratha ruler <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scindia.html" title="Scindia">Scindia</a>. The British annexed Surat in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800.html" title="1800">1800</a>. British territory was enlarged in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Anglo-Maratha_War_a5dd.html" title="Second Anglo-Maratha War">Second Anglo-Maratha War</a> which ended in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1803.html" title="1803">1803</a>. The East India Company received the districts of <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharuch.html" title="Bharuch">Bharuch</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaira.html" title="Kaira">Kaira</a>, etc., and the Maratha <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaekwad.html" title="Gaekwad">Gaekwad</a> rulers of <a href="../../../v/a/d/Vadodara.html" title="Vadodara">Baroda</a> acknowledged British sovereignty.</p>
<p>In 1803 the Bombay presidency included only Salsette, the islands of the harbour (since 1774), Surat and Bankot (since <a href="../../../1/7/5/1756.html" title="1756">1756</a>); but between this date and <a href="../../../1/8/2/1827.html" title="1827">1827</a> the framework of the presidency took shape. The Gujarat districts were taken over by the Bombay government in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a> and enlarged in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1818.html" title="1818">1818</a>; The numerous small states of <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathiawar.html" title="Kathiawar">Kathiawar</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahikantha.html" title="Mahikantha">Mahikantha</a> were organized into <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princely_state.html" title="Princely state">princely states</a> under British suzerainty between <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/2/1820.html" title="1820">1820</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/j/Baji_Rao_II_03a7.html" title="Baji Rao II">Baji Rao II</a>, the last of the <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshwa.html" title="Peshwa">peshwas</a>, who had attempted to shake off the British yoke, was defeated in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khadki_eb52.html" title="Battle of Khadki">Battle of Khadki</a>, captured subsequently and pensioned (1817 1818), and large portions of his dominions (<a href="../../../p/u/n/Pune.html" title="Pune">Pune</a>, <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmednagar.html" title="Ahmednagar">Ahmednagar</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasik.html" title="Nasik">Nasik</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Sholapur.html" title="Sholapur">Sholapur</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a>, Kaladgi, <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharwad.html" title="Dharwad">Dharwad</a>, etc.) were included in the presidency, the settlement of which was completed by <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountstuart_Elphinstone_e18a.html" title="Mountstuart Elphinstone">Mountstuart Elphinstone</a>, governor from 1819 to 1827. His policy was to rule as far as possible on native lines, avoiding all changes for which the population was not yet ripe; but the grosser abuses of the old regime were stopped, the country was pacified, the laws were codified, and courts and schools were established. The period that followed is notable mainly for the enlargement of the presidency through the lapse of certain native states, by the addition of <a href="../../../a/d/e/Aden.html" title="Aden">Aden</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/3/1839.html" title="1839">1839</a>) and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sind.html" title="Sind">Sind</a> (1843), and the lease of the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panch_Mahal_aee9.html" title="Panch Mahal">Panch Mahals</a> from Sindhia (1853). The establishment of an orderly administration, one outcome of which was a general fall of prices that made the unwonted regularity of the collection of taxes doubly unwelcome, naturally excited a certain amount of misgiving and resentment; but on the whole the population was prosperous and contented, and under Lord Elphinstone (1853-1860) the presidency passed through the crisis of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolt_of_1857.html" title="Revolt of 1857">Revolt of 1857</a> without any general rising. Outbreaks among the troops at <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmedabad.html" title="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolhapur.html" title="Kolhapur">Kolhapur</a> were quickly put down, two regiments being disbanded, and the rebellions in Gujarat, among the <a href="../../../b/h/i/Bhil.html" title="Bhil">Bhils</a>, and in the southern Maratha country were local and isolated. Under Sir <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartle_Frere_89bf.html" title="Bartle Frere">Bartle Frere</a> (1862-1867) agricultural prosperity reached its highest point, as a result of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> and the consequent enormous demand for Indian <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton.html" title="Cotton">cotton</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The money thus poured into the country produced an epidemic of speculation known as the Share Mania (1864-1865), which ended in a commercial crisis and the failure of the bank of Bombay (1866). But the peasantry gained on the whole more than they lost, and the trade of Bombay was not permanently injured. Sir Bartle Frere encouraged the completion of the great trunk lines of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Railways_05c3.html" title="Indian Railways">railways</a>, and with the funds obtained by the demolition of the town walls (<a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a>) he began the magnificent series of public buildings that now adorn Bombay (<a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>).</p>

The native states under the supervision of the government of Bombay are divided, historically and geographically, into two main groups. The northern or Gujarat group includes the territories of the gaekwar of Baroda, with the smaller states which form the administrative divisions of Cutch, Palanpur, Rewa Kantha, and Mahi Kantha. These territories, with the exception of Cutch, have an historical connection, as being the allies or tributaries of the Gaekwad until 1805, when final engagements were included between that prince and the British government. The southern or Maratha group includes Kolhapur, Akalkot, Sawantwari, and the Satara and southern Mahratta Jagirs, and has an historical bond of union in the friendship they showed to the British in their final struggle with the power of the peshwa until 1818. The remaining territories may conveniently be divided into a small cluster of independent <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamindar.html" title="Zamindar">zamindaris</a>, situated in the wild and hilly tracts at the northern extremity of the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahyadri.html" title="Sahyadri">Sahyadri</a> range, and certain. principalities which, from their history or geographical position, are to some extent isolated from the rest of the presidency.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolt_of_1857.html" title="Revolt of 1857">Revolt of 1857</a>, The British East India Company rule ceased, and India came under the control of the British Crown. The government of Bombay was administered by a governor in council consisting of the governor as president and two ordinary members. The governor was appointed from Britain; the council is appointed by the crown, and selected from the Indian civil service. These were the executive members of government. For making laws there was a legislative council, consisting of the governor and his executive council, with certain other persons, not fewer than eight or more than twenty, at least half of them being non-officials. Each of the members of the executive council had in his charge one or two departments of the government; and each department had a secretary, an under-secretary, and an assistant secretary, with a numerous staff of clerks. The political administration of the native states was under the superintendence of British agents placed at the principal native capitals; their position varied in different states according to the relations in which the principalities stood with the paramount power. The administration of justice throughout the presidency was conducted by a high court at Bombay, consisting of a chief justice and seven puisne judges, along with district and assistant judges throughout the districts of the presidency. The administration of the districts was carried on by collectors, assistant collectors, and a varying number of supernumerary assistants.</p>

<p>The Bombay Presidency had a large and diverse population. The census of 1901 gave a total of 25,468,209, out of which the chief religions furnished the following numbers: 19,916,438 <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a>, 4,567,295 <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>, 535,950 <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jain.html" title="Jain">Jain</a>, 78,552 <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrian.html" title="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a>, and approximately 200,000 <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a>.</p>
<p>In Sind Islam had been the predominant religion from the Arab conquest in the 8th century. In Gujarat the predominant religion is Hinduism, although Muslim kingdoms have left their influence in many parts of the province. The Deccan is the home of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a>, who constituted 30% of the population. The Konkan is notable for various Christian castes, owing their origin to Portuguese rule; while in the Carnatic, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingayat.html" title="Lingayat">Lingayatism</a>, a Hindu reformation movement of the 12th century, was embraced by 45% of the population.

<p>The overwhelming majority of the population of the Bombay Presidency was rural and engaged in agriculture. The staple crops were as follows: <a href="../../../j/o/w/Jowar.html" title="Jowar">jowar</a> (<i>Sorghum vulgare</i>) and <a href="../../../b/a/j/Bajra.html" title="Bajra">bajra</a> (<i>Holcus spicatus</i>) were the staple food grains in the Deccan and Khandesh. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice.html" title="Rice">Rice</a> was the chief product of the Konkan. <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheat.html" title="Wheat">Wheat</a>, generally grown in the northern part of the Presidency, but specially in Sind and Gujarat, was exported to Europe in large quantities from Karachi, and on a smaller scale from Bombay. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barley.html" title="Barley">Barley</a> was principally grown in the northern parts of the presidency. <a href="../../../n/a/c/Nachani.html" title="Nachani">Nachani</a> (<i>Eleusine coracana</i>) and kodra <i>(Paspalum scrobiculatum)</i> furnished food to the Kolis, Bhils, Waralis, and other hill tribes. Of the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulse_%28legume%29.html" title="Pulse (legume)">pulses</a> the most important are the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chickpea.html" title="Chickpea">chickpea</a> or Bengal gram (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>), <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pigeon_pea.html" title="Pigeon pea">pigeon pea</a> or tur (<i>Cajanus cajan</i>), <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catjang.html" title="Catjang">catjang</a> or kulti (<i>Vigna unguiculata cylindrica</i>), and <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urad_%28bean%29.html" title="Urad (bean)">urad bean</a> (<i>Vigna mungo</i>).

<p>The chief industries of Bombay Presidency involved the milling of cotton. In the late 19th century steam mills sprang up in Bombay, Ahmedabad and Khandesh. In 1905 there were 432 factories in the presidency, of which by far the greater number were engaged in the preparation and manufacture of cotton. The industry is centred in Bombay, which contains nearly two-thirds of the mills. During the decade 1891-1901 the mill industry passed through a period of depression due to widespread plague and famine, but on the whole there was a marked expansion of the trade as well as a great improvement in the class of goods produced. In addition to the mills there were (1901) 178,000 hand-loom weavers in the province, who still have a position of their own in the manipulation of designs woven into the cloth. Silk goods were manufactured in <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmedabad.html" title="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surat.html" title="Surat">Surat</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/o/Yeola.html" title="Yeola">Yeola</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasik.html" title="Nasik">Nasik</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thana.html" title="Thana">Thana</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a> (<a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>), the material decorated with printed or woven designs; competition from European goods caused the silk industry to decline in the early 20th century. The custom of investing savings in gold and silver ornaments gave employment to many goldsmiths: the metal was usually supplied by the customer, and the goldsmith charged for his labor. <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmedabad.html" title="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surat.html" title="Surat">Surat</a> are famous for their carved woodwork.

<p>The province was well supplied with railways, all of which, with one exception, concentrated at Bombay City. The exception is the North-Western line, which enters Sind from the Punjab and terminated at Karachi. The other chief lines are the Great Indian Peninsula, Indian Midland, Bombay, Baroda &amp; Central India, and the Rajputana, Malwa &amp; Southern Mahratta systems. In 1905 the total length of railway under the Bombay government open for traffic was 7980 miles, which did not include the railway system in Sind.</p>

The education department was under a director of public instruction, who was responsible for the administration of the department in accordance with the general educational policy of the state. The native states generally adopted the government system. Baroda and the Kathiawar states employed their own inspectors. In 1905 the total number of educational institutions was 10,194 with 593,431 pupils. There were ten art colleges, of which two were managed by government, three by native states, and five were under private management. According to the census of 1901, out of a population of 25.5 million nearly 24 million were illiterate.</p>
