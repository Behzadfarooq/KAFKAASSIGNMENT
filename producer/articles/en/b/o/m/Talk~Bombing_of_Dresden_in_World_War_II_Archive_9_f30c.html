<h2><span class="mw-headline">Once more: Strafing of civilians</span></h2>
<p>I refer to the debate mainly between Slim Virgin and Noel on February 27-28, last archive, on strafing of civilians. You were looking for a historian who might give credibility to memory reports of eye witnesses: such as the little 8-year-old girl in that late report whose link Get-back-world-respect posted.</p>
<p>Well, there is one: Götz Bergander himself ("Dresden im Luftkrieg" p. 192-209) has looked for and sorted out credible eye witnesses. He points out that <i>no one</i> of them saw or heard of a massive organized attack of many planes strafing civilians on purpose. He explicitly refutes the Nazi legends of such attacks: They were simply impossible in the night of February 13 and not reported for February 15. Those reported for the February 14 day raids took place 170 kilometers beyond Dresden on the way towards Prague; Bergander prooves that as fact in detail.</p>
<p>But also he gives credit to eyewitnesses who saw, heard and experienced <i>single</i> planes shoot with machine guns near the ground <i>only</i> on February 14, 1945. He explains these experiences as <i>probable facts</i> which were <i>misinterpreted</i> as directly aimed shooting. Single Planes - one, two, three at the most - were flying low above fleeing survivors of the bombings, <i>fighting</i> with German planes and therefore shooting with their machine guns; people had the impression they were shooting <i>at them</i>. So not all of their memories must have been late "legends" or "myths", only false interpreted perceptions because of their traumatized situation at that time. - That´s the only reason we left the link of that woman´s report in the article, but cited Berganders explanation of her perceptions, which preceeds those of Helmut Schnatz and Frederick Taylor.</p>
<p>Hope this makes this issue more clear. Greetings, Jesusfreund --217.229.122.67 20:41, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You mention the bishop but his link in the article leads to that famous baseball player...;-) Good not to loose your sense of humor in this tough subject.</p>
<p>Two of our German Dresden authors, me one of them, have written an article on Bell recently: I would like to offer it to you English wikipedians. Can someone put it in the translation request list for me? Thanks a lot. No time to translate it myself, sorry! --217.229.122.67 20:41, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps the article should mention Bells <i>first</i> public criticism of area bombing. As far as I know he already denied it in sermons <i>before</i> the war in 1939; and in the House of Lords he spoke against it February 1943, one year before his bestknown debate in 1944.</dd>
<dd>The article also should point out his arguing then: I believe Bell refered to the targetting of civilians thus applying the criteria of La Haague peace agreements (from 1907 on) <i>and</i> the Church criteria of a "just war". This argument was uttered in public, while Bells knowledge of the plans of German Anti-Hitler-conspiracies was uttered in letters to Anthony Eden, later and secondary to those debates. He did not reject and deny area bombing for any military or strategic reasons but for the sake of humanity and civilization itself. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 08:21, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Bombing Holocaust"</span></h2>
<p>As far as I know,</p>
<ul>
<li>the leader of the "Nationaldemocratic Party of Germany", Holger Apfel, in his speech in January 2005 did not use the term "Dresden holocaust", but "bombing holocaust".</li>
<li>This term is used not by single Neonazi leaders only but has evolved to be a widespread propaganda term in German right wing media and groups.</li>
<li>The three parties which are considered to be "right extremists" by German state officials were all supporting the recent Neonazi gathering which used the term as a motto.</li>
<li>Historians like Friedrich who use unreflected speech ("mass extermination", "crematoria", "murderous bombing plans", "annihilation" etc.) support their view, can be abused and are abused by them. --217.83.37.136 21:22, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bomb Tonnage</span></h2>
<p><i>Later on 14th from 12:17 until 12:30 311 American B-17s dropped 771 tons of bombs on Dresden, with the railway yards as their aiming point.</i></p>
<p>This tonnage (711) is almost certainly wrong in that it seems to have been calculated on a B-17 load of 4,500lb on the assumption that that was the load carried to Dresden. Whilst 3,500 - 4,500lb (depending on the differing distances of the airfields in the UK from the target) was the load a B-17 could carry to Berlin, the loads to Dresden where actually down to aproximately 1,500lb per-aircraft, due to the much greater distance involved, which would make the actual figure something like 233 US tons. The British figures are about right and work-out at an individual Lancaster load of about 7,500lb to Dresden, which is also down from the Berlin figure, again due to the greater distance involved - more petrol needed for the greater distance (the RAF raid on Dresden was a nine-hour round trip, as opposed to a six-hour one to Berlin and back) so lower bomb load carried.</p>
<p>Also, when comparing published USAF/RAF bomb tonnage figures bear in mind that US figures are given in US (2000lb) tons and British in Imperial (2,240lb) tons - many, even 'official', US sources get this wrong. And if anyone wants to calculate the fuel loads then they might also like to allow for the fact that US fuel figures are in US gallons and RAF figures in Imperial gallons, which are %20 larger than US gallons.</p>
<p>BTW, as regards the Mustangs strafing people on the ground after the US raids try reading <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i> by Kurt Vonnegut, as he was there at the time. I read it years ago and seem to remember him mentioning it, but I may be wrong.</p>

<dd>311 B17's dropping 771 tones comes from <a href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dresden.html" class="external text" title="http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dresden.html" rel="nofollow">RAF website</a>. <a href="https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm" class="external text" title="https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm" rel="nofollow">USAF Historical Studies Institute Air University</a> states "Nevertheless, as a matter of record, the following is an authoritative tabulation of all Allied bombings of Dresden" and qutoes the following sources: "Statistics on 8th Air Force bombing from Eighth Air Force Target Summary, Period 17 August 1942 thru 8 May 1945, p. 20. Supporting Document No. 1, Statistics on RAF Bomber Command bombing from Allied Air Attacks Against Targets in Dresden, Headquarters, United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe, Office of the Commanding General, p 1. Supporting Document No. 2." It states that the figure was 316 B-17s dropped 487.7 tons of H/E and 294.3 tons of incediaries. A total of 782 for the mid-day raid. Some may have been on the secondary target, which would explain the 311 to 316 diffrence and the difference in tonnage which per plane works out about the same from both sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On page 365 of "Dresden Tuesday 13 Feb 1945" by F Taylor, he states that the USAAF planned to use used 678.3 tones of HE and 400 tones of incendiaries, not all were dropped on Dresden but those that were, were in the same ratio.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">David Irving</span></h2>
<p>I have reverted the edits on Irving again. Here are the reasons why.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a> should not be called an historian. "Justice Charles Gray, the trial judge, at Irving's 1998, libel suit said</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Irving has for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence; that for the same reasons he has portrayed Hitler in an unwarrantedly favourable light, principally in relation to his attitude towards and responsibility for the treatment of the Jews; that he is an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-semitic and racist and that he associates with right wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>None of Irving historical facts can be trusted. Richard J. Evans, Professor of Modern History, University of Cambridge says in (<a href="http://www.holocaustdenialontrial.org/evidence/evans006.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.holocaustdenialontrial.org/evidence/evans006.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.holocaustdenialontrial.org/evidence/evans006.asp</a>) this about Irving:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Parg 10:<i>Irving’s claim to be a scrupulous historian is completely bogus.</i></dd>
<dd>Parg 21:<i>Not one of his books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In "The Bombing of Dresden in 1945" (<a href="http://www.holocaustdenialontrial.org/evidence/evans005.asp#5.2" class="external free" title="http://www.holocaustdenialontrial.org/evidence/evans005.asp#5.2" rel="nofollow">http://www.holocaustdenialontrial.org/evidence/evans005.asp#5.2</a>), by Richard J. Evans, which is a detailed critique of problems with David Irving's book. He writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>3. Irving’s own estimates of the numbers of dead have varied widely over time, and have changed from one edition of his book to the next and in his public speeches:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the 1966 edition of The Destruction of Dresden the triple blow was ‘estimated authoritatively to have killed more than 135,000 of the population...’, but the ‘documentation suggests very strongly that the figure was certainly between a minimum of 100,000 and a maximum of 250,000.’</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the 1971 edition the triple blow was ‘estimated authoritatively to have killed more than 100,000 of the population...’</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1989 Irving told journalists whilst launching the ‘Leuchter Report’ in Britain that: ‘There were one million refugees in the streets of Dresden at the time that we burned Dresden to the ground, killing anything between 100,000 and 250,000 of them.’</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1992 Irving told the Institute of Historical Review that ‘a hundred thousand people were killed [in Dresden] in a period of twelve hours by the British and Americans.’</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1993, in a publicity video made for the Australian public, Irving stated that ‘over 130,000 people died in that particular air raid.’</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the 1995 edition of The Destruction of Dresden the figure was no longer authoritative and the attack had ‘cost the lives of between fifty and one hundred thousand inhabitants....’ Elsewhere he dropped the lower figure and said the attack cost ‘up to a hundred thousand people their lives.’</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1996 Irving had changed this figure yet again in his Goebbels: The Mastermind of the ‘Third Reich’, where he notes of the Dresden raids that ‘Between sixty and one hundred thousand people were choked to death or burned alive...’</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>4. As will be demonstrated, these erratic fluctuations in Irving’s figures are entirely arbitrary and have never accorded to the changing state of research (either his own or that of others) into the Dresden death roll. The only consistency in his figures is that they have resolutely remained far in excess of the most reliable and agreed figures (i.e. those based on the most solid research and which command the most general assent). We shall now see how he has arrived at these inflated estimates, and what evidence that they are indeed far above the likely number.</i></dd>

<p>As many people where taken in by Irving's "research" about Dresden, this needs highlighting in this article. If there is an historian with a credible international reputation, who has published figures in the last 15 years, which agree Irving's figures that do not include his <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/i/irving.david/ftp.py?people/i/irving.david//irving-dresden-casualties-01" class="external text" title="http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/i/irving.david/ftp.py?people/i/irving.david//irving-dresden-casualties-01" rel="nofollow">Times letter revisions</a>, then they can be quoted as a possible source for Encarta and Columbia Encyclopaedias if not then the sentence should remain as is because it highlights the likely unreliable source for the figure of 135,000. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 19:58, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not know the history of this little dispute here; but as far as I can see the article is completely correct in saying where the higher estimates came from and why they are not reliable and credible at all. Of course it has to be mentioned that Irvings high estimates have been proved wrong and that there was a "controversy" about them.</dd>
<dd>If the article states Irving is a "controversial figure" I believe it is a euphemism refering to his trial in the sixties without making it a theme for itself, just giving a hint for the footnote. But then I think if you mention Irving at all you should tell the reader who he is: not a historian but a convicted lyar and holocaust denier, period. Nothing controversial about that, is it?</dd>

<dd>The gist is that high estimates have come from many people, not just David Irving. The article currently says that biased figures tend to have higher estimates. I think this is adequate and I found references to Irving is irrelevent and distracting, not to mention ad hominem.</dd>

<dd>PS: Of course the "estimations" of high victim numbers of Dresden raids have to do with the holocaust denial: Irving was always far more interested in possible crimes of the Allied than those of the Nazis, and so these numbers were useful to him. This is not "a bone to pick" against a person; it´s the exact connection between these <i>issues</i> established by that person <i>itself</i>. And therefor both issues - Dresden and Holocaust - were investigated in his trial, weren´t they? - But you are right, this article should concentrate on Dresden. And Irving lied on Dresden because he couldn´t give reliable sources for his estimations. And he lied again because he used higher figures without source again after he had been proved wrong. So even if the article would state he is a convicted lyar it would be totally in line with NPOV. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 07:59, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why not start a section 'David Irving on Dresden'? But before you do, remember the topic ends with him retracting his estimates. So what's the point of all of this? I'm sure plenty of estimates were retracted in light of new evidence, just as the early Sept. 11th attack estimates of 20,000 were retracted.<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a> 17:54, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point is that your ordering of the information suggests that the 135,000 of Encarta and Columbia is somehow a legitimate number. I have already asked you to provide a source other than Irving (or an author using Irving's numbers) who has come up with such a number.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I can definitely see how it can be read as that, although that was not my intention. It is not upon me to 'prove' where Encarta got their figures. I have no earthly idea. The burden is more on you to prove they got them from Irving.

<p>If you can not then it should be pointed out that this is a discredited number from a discredited source (As it did before). As for your statement "I'm sure plenty of estimates were retracted in light of new evidence". He retracted his higher figure in a letter to the Times in the 1960s, but despite this he has repeatedly stated higher figures since (see above). If he had not repeated the higher figures after his letter to the Times, I could agree which you implication, but he has not and he has been found IN COURT to be someone "<i>for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence</i>". That is not the same thing as the retraction of "<i>early Sept. 11th attack estimates</i>". It would only be the same if someone was to agree that the figure of 20,000 was incorrect and then afterwards keep using the number of 20,000 it as if it were true for propaganda purposes.</p>

<p>BTW The court case was in 1999/2000 not in the 1960s. Irving's libel suit against Deborah Lipstadt, and her publisher Penguin Books, was launched in 1998. Irving chose to bring the case in England where the burden of proof is on the defendant, and not, as in most Western jurisdictions, on the plaintiff. That he did not win his case shows how overwhelming the evidence is against him. Given "<i>that he is an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-semitic and racist</i>", I am supprised that you wish to use a POV phrase like "a controversial figure" to describe him.

<dd>You seem to think I'm trying to defend David Irving. I really think his stuff is crap. I read some of his Goebbel's biography and found it contrived.

<p>The figure of 135,000 comes from Irving's very popular book on the Bombing of Dresden in 1963 called "The Destruction of Dresden" <i>estimated "<b>authoritatively</b> to have killed more than 135,000 of the population...</i>". [My bolding of the word authoritatively]. He republished the figures in the 1966 edition despite the letter to the Times on July 7, 1966 which was about this "authoritative" figure. To the best of my knowledge he has never retracted the information published in the Times. Indeed it is on <a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.fpp.co.uk" rel="nofollow">his web site</a> under the title of <a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/General/Dresden/TheTimes070766.htmlReal" class="external text" title="http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/General/Dresden/TheTimes070766.htmlReal" rel="nofollow">History and the Dresden air raids 1945</a> . Up until 1990 the figure 135,000 was reproduced in many other publications because they had no reason to doubt that although Irving my have had right wing views that his research was not accurate. For example Norman Longmate in "The Bombers" pub 1983 says on page 341 "<i>This is in line with the figure of 135,000 suggested by David Irving, the British historian of the raid, which, though sometimes challenged since, remains the best estimate available</i>". So unless you supply a published source in the last 15 years from any professional historian who agrees with the figure please do not remove the information that the figure of 135,000 is from Irving and it is a retracted figure. If you do not allow that connection you are being duped into supporting an Irving attempt to use the Nazi <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_lie.html" title="Big lie">big lie</a> propaganda technique (Do a web search on [Dresden and 135,000]). If you can come up with another source independent of Irving's research which uses the figure then of course we can revisit the sentence. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:54, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Holocaust"</span></h2>
<p>I changed this sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Since 1945, the word "holocaust" has been taken over by another meaning but it is quite clear that within the meaning of the word as it was in 1945, the results of bombing in several German cities were holocausts; as had been those elsewhere, from Stalingrad to Coventry and Guernica.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think an explanation of the word´s own meaning does not justify this statement. "Holocaust" by itself means something like "whole offering". It may have been used for carpet bombing somewhere, but "it is quite clear" is not true. The use of "Holocaust" is related to genocide (crime against humanity), and none of the given examples were genocides by definition. War crimes, yes, disputable as it is disputed in the article. The goal of that kind of warfare was surely to destroy infrastructure <i>and</i> a lot of lives, be it on purpose or not; so call it "mass killing" or "mass destruction". The use of the term "Holocaust" in connection to Dresden raids is related to Neonazi and right wing purposes only. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 12:34, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The point of what I wrote was to the effect that this use of the word <i>holocaust</i> to mean <i>genocide</i> is modern, developed after February 1945. The people concerned with the Dresden raids knew nothing of it. The original meaning of <i>holocaust</i> was <i>a thorough burning</i>. This, it seems to me, adequately describes what happened in places like Hamburg and Dresden. It is true that the word had, in antiquity, become associated with religious service and that this service had been expressed by the destruction of something or someone, at some kind of altar, commonly by fire. However, this, like the genocide association, is a later slant on the original and basic meaning of the word. This basic meaning would have been understood by educated European people in 1945. Those who had received what was regarded as a good education could read classical Greek. (In case it needs pointing out, that is what <i>holocaust</i>, ‘’όλοκυστός’’ is.)</p>
<p>If people such as Jesusfreund, with the benefit of hindsight, so thoroughly miss the point that the planners of the Dresden raids were conditioned by their upbringing and life-experience, as we are by ours, how on earth can we expect the people of sixty years ago to have anticipated our responses to their efforts.

<dd>Words change their meaning over time. To use the word "holocaust" in this article does not bring clarity and it is likely to confuse many readers who do not have your classical education.

<dd>It needs a source that the bombing of Dresden was done to "terrorize the German people not only to win the war". In all the sources used in the section "Reasons for the attack" that is not given as one of the targeting considerations. By February 1945 the Allies did not expect bombing to terrorise the Germans into surrender. That bolt had been shot with the failure of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Gomorrah_7172.html" title="Operation Gomorrah">Operation Gomorrah</a> and the failure of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Berlin_%28air%29_86c7.html" title="Battle of Berlin (air)">Battle of Berlin (air)</a>. Secondly the attempt to "terrorize" of the German people <b>earlier in the war</b> had been attempted to shorten the war, not as an aim in its self outside the war aims. In fact the aim had never been to <i>terrorize</i> but to weaken the German war effort:
<ul>
<li>a) it is difficult to concentrate fully on the war production job when one is looking for new accommodation etc</li>
<li>b) It is unnerving for soldiers at the front to learn that they can not defend their cities and that their civilian friends and relations are being killed.</li>
<li>c) If Berlin was bombed Goering boasted "You may call me Meyer". Bombing helped to destroy some of the myths which the Nazi propaganda machine put out. Particularly the one which said that war happened outside Germany.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Just because no allied person was tried for a war crimes does not mean that assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory was a war crime. It is a fact that as no Axis personnel were tried at the post-war Nuremberg Trials for participating in the decisions on, or execution of, assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory, there is no legal precedent available to indicate that the bombing of Dresden constituted a war crime. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 10:58, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Both the view that Dresden's bombing was a war crime, and the view that there should have been prosecutions for it, even if it did not rise to that level, are strongly disputed. Critics of both views argue the necessities of war, and the danger and horror of the Nazi regime were reasons for the attacks. They further argue that even if the bombing of Dresden did violate the laws of war against excessive civilian casualties, that military decisions about where and when to attack were not prosecuted at war crimes trials after World War II, and therefore the bombing of Dresden should not have been prosecuted either, since it is a decision of the same type.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>"<i>The ultimate aim of an attack on a town area is to break the morale of the population which occupies it. To ensure this, we must achieve two things: first, we must make the town physically uninhabitable and, secondly, we must make the people conscious of constant personal danger.

<p>By 1945 the RAF directives about area bombing earlier in the war had been superceeded by several more recent directives like:</p>
<dl>
<dd>10 June 1943 the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued a directive to RAF and USAAF on the POINTBLANK plan for destruction of the German aircraft industry.</dd>
<dd>16 September 1944 combined Chiefs of Staff directive "OCTAGON 29", that stated the primary objective to be
<dl>
<dd><i>"the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic systems and the direct support of land and naval forces."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Which are both mentioned in passing in the first section "Reasons for the attack".</p>
<p>By 1945 It is not true to say that "<i>ultimate aim of an attack on [the Dresden]] area [was] to break the morale of the population which occupies it</i>" was not true. The Primary reason is listed in the first section "Reasons for the attack":</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Air Staff have now arranged that, subject to the overriding claims of attacks on enemy oil production and other approved target systems within the current directive, available effort should be directed against Berlin, Dresden, Chemnitz and Leipzig or against other cities where severe bombing would not only destroy communications vital to the evacuation from the east, but would also hamper the movement of troops from the west</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The information on Bishop George Bell is interesting and I have copied it into the article on him, but Bishop Bell made his 1945 speech( 24 hours?) before the Dresden raid the MP who was most influential in criticising the bombing of Dresden was Richard Stokes as is mentioned in another section.</p>

<dd>It´s not up to me to make a decision, but I think you removed too many aspects of the controversy in Britain at the time. It is not true that Bell spoke only shortly before the attacks, and this was not the information given in the article either before you removed the whole section.</dd>
<dd>And his influence - well, he had none on the military strategy, of course, but he had some on public opinion. As a main leader of Anglican church he represented part of churchs position on aireal bombing. Of course, other bishops did not appreciate his opposition to it.</dd>
<dd>And if others like Richard Stokes were more influential, why not mention there position also? I think the rare votes in the House of Lords and Commons against these kind of raids and their reasoning should find acknowledgment here; otherwise you support the isolated military approach to look at the issue too much.

<p>Richard Stokes is mentioned in the section British "Responses to the bombing". This is an article about the Bombing of Dresden. Not an article on the earlier RAF campaign of <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_bombing.html" title="Area bombing">area bombing</a>. I agree that Bell did not only speak shortly before the the attacks he had been doing it for a long time. But as far as I know it was Stokes and not Bell who spoke after the Bombing of Dresden and influenced other people. As this is an article about the bombing of Dresden not about area bombing in general, Bell is not directly relevant to this article.</p>
<p>Slightly off topic for this article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>That Bell, Stokes and Salter consistently spoke out about area bombing, is less than a handfull of MPs. Bell was one of twenty-six Anglican bishops who sit in the House of Lords (<a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html#Lords_Spiritual" title="House of Lords">Lords Spiritual</a>) and he was not a senior bishop (<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_York_2903.html" title="Archbishop of York">York</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_London_50d5.html" title="Bishop of London">London</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Durham_bc2a.html" title="Bishop of Durham">Durham</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Winchester_f2e2.html" title="Bishop of Winchester">Winchester</a>). Do not get drawn in by Goebbels's propaganda that the London based "Bombing Restrictions Committee" represented a substantial part of British public opinion. During the war the vast majority of the British people were in favour of bombing the Germans. They thought it was helping to shorten the war, and as that was seen as a way to save British lives, they supported it. Further after the Blitz and with V1 and V2 still landing around the clock in London, most British hearts were hardened against any sympathy for German civilians, particularly as they were under the illusion that what the RAF was dishing out was similar to that of the Luftwaffe during the Blitz. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:33, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the warning of Goebbels propaganda; emphasizing the rare opposition voters at the time is not meant to support that, of course. Don´t get drawn in that kind of logics. Bell and Stokes probably were among the most decisive anti-Nazis. What makes them relevant is exactly their minority position which keeps up the ethical debate about the righteousness of bombing civilians - raising the question, if anything is allowed in a defensive war against a totalitarian and absolutely criminal regime. This question has to be raised even if 99,9% of public opinion would have answered: "YES, mass killing is necessary and justified." This general thinking, by the way, is the strongest support for the total victory of immorality in war which the Nazis pushed. The few opposers who kept ties to German resistors and made a difference between civilians and Nazi regime - even though German civilians mostly weren´t able to make that difference themselves - could turn out to be the solid ground on which reconciliation can be built afterwards. It was churches work after 1945 which started healing the wounds between Dresden and Coventry f.e.; and it was the link between church doctrine of a just war and La Haague criteria of a legal war in 1907 Bell referred to in his speeches of 1943 which might make him relevant to this article. It´s not only the responses, it´s the predictors and warners who are important to this issue, I think. But if you discuss that at Aireal warfare in general, OK. Perhaps a short essence of that debate should be integrated here, though. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 11:45, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't point to a specific rule, but it is a common FAC objection. I have yet to see a FA article heavy on quotes (and this one IS). The usual thing to do is to incorporate info in the article, and move all quotes and citiations off to Wikiquote. Now, as I wrote earlier, I like quotes - so I don't object to Tylor in lead. But if - when - this article goes to FAC, you will see this objection appear fast, and unless we adress it then, the article will fail likely on those grounds: <b>Object</b>.

<p>The bombing of Dresden was a consequence of escalating use of <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_bombing_of_cities.html" title="Aerial bombing of cities">aerial bombing of cities</a> by both sides of the World War II. What was primarily the German tactic in the first years (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blitz_2aa3.html" title="The Blitz">The Blitz</a>), have became increasingly adapted and used by the Allies in the latter years. Early in the year 1945, the higher Allied Western political-military leadership started to consider how they might aid the advancing <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> with the use of the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bomber.html" title="Strategic bomber">strategic bomber</a> force. The plan was to bomb Berlin and several other eastern cities in conjunction with the Soviet advance. Eventually, the bombing of Dresno, codenamed by the Allies as Operation Thunderclap, destroyed over 95% of the city's <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infrastructure.html" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> and buildings and caused the deaths of up to 35,000 people (approximately 6% of the total city population), and has suceeded in crippling all of the city's <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry.html" title="Industry">industry</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communication.html" title="Communication">communication</a>.</p>

Second, <i>even after 60 years.</i> is a rather useless phrase - will we change it by year as the time passes? Anybody can count, and the present tense (remains one of...) is, well, present. Third, while I like quotes (and thus I left that one), 9 times out of then Peer Review and FAC requires quotes to be moved to Wikiquote (thus, in fact, this lead has only one-sentence para. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 14:56, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have read the archives - well, most of them. I have yet to see an article that would have to be gutted this way because it would be POVed otherwise.

I am not insisting on using my older version (this is why I created the above section), I am not reverting your revert, but I do insinst that we work out a compromise and improve thsi article. Nowhere in Wiki official or semi-official policies is it stated that old version, even supported by a vote, cannot be updated.

<dd>The Germans were cerful not to target British cities until after the RAF bombed a German city {Berlin?} (done in retaliation for an accedental bombing of London). After that during the Battle of Britiain, the German stratagy was to bomb London to bring up the RAF fighters, (lucky for the RAF that they had not continued thier anti-aifield stratagy which was winning them the battle). It was not to terrorise the British. Later raids on Coventry and other cities may have been designed to effect a change in British resolve, but I do not think think that they can be termed terror raids like those on Polish refugees. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a></dd>

<li>" Also, the city had no fighter cover, as the German fighters have been relocated to defend the Ruhr Area industries". This shows a fundamental misunderstanding about how fighters were allocated for defence: Radar targeted in bands/boxes over western Germany. Just as they were in the Battle of Britain and against the V1s in Britain at the time, not from airfields around specific towns. Also there were day fighters over Dresden when the USAAF attacked.

<li>Allied experiences of the attac: There are anecdotes of the pilots and crew having problems years later. Some had nightmares, some thought they would go to hell as war criminals, some had unshakable visions of the fires and the burning cities. Other veterans, however, doubt these anecdotes, noting that their briefings included details on what they were hitting, and that no one in their recollection had any misgivings about the mission.

<li>While the bombing for Dresono remains the single most devasting instance of destruction of Europan city solely by <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing.html" title="Strategic bombing">strategic bombing</a>, it was neither the first, nor the last city affected in such a manner. Germans have been using aerial bombardment and [[terror bombing][ tactics since the very first day of the Second World War, startigng with the first day of their <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_September_Campaign_01ad.html" title="Polish September Campaign">attack on Poland</a> on <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_September_82e0.html" title="1st September">1st September</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, and continued this tactic during the later <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">battle of Britain</a>. On 18th February 1943, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Goebbels_d1dd.html" title="Joseph Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> during a parade in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> has asked the population in his famous <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sportpalast_speech.html" title="Sportpalast speech">Sportpalast speech</a>: <i>"Do you want a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_war.html" title="Total war">total war</a>?"</i>.

<li>After the end of the war, Dresden has became part of the Soviet occupation zone, and later, a city in the Soviet <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppet_state.html" title="Puppet state">puppet state</a> of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Democratic_Republic_b577.html" title="German Democratic Republic">German Democratic Republic</a>. Soviets viewed the Dresden bombing as a valuable propaganda fule. At first, the Soviet propaganda put the blame for the bombing on the German people themselves. On the second anniversary of the bombing, Dresden mayor Walter Weidauer wrote in the '"<i>Sachsische Volkszeitung"</i> newspaper: <i>"destruction of Dresden has been intentionally provoked by the facist villains. [...] Political weakness of the German nation is responsible for this war"</i>. Soon afterwards, with the begining of the Cold War, Soviet propaganda found a new target: the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Allies_8b0c.html" title="Western Allies">Western Allies</a>. The bombing was now called an action of the <i>Anglo-American <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a></i>, Allied pilots were reffered to as <i>barbarians</i> and even the Dresono reconstruction was delayed, so that the very ruins could serve as a reminder of the <i>western barbarism</i>. Meanwhile, in the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Germany_0e8f.html" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a>, the bombing was rarely noted, mostly being kept alive by the far-left and far-right (neo-nazis) parties. After the fall of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Wall_24be.html" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reunification_of_Germany_107a.html" title="Reunification of Germany">reunification of Germany</a>, the bombing has become increasingly popular among the German politics and historians, and is now mentioned as one of the main arguments in the debate that German people have been the victims of the Second World War.</li>
<li>After the bombing, commander Harris has became nicknamed Bomber Harris (withhing the Allied press) and Harry the Reaper (by the Axis propaganda). British veterans have formed an organisation to defend the good name of their commander: the Bomber Harris Trust. In 1992 the organisation has erected a monument to Harris, in RAF chapel in St. Clement Davies church in London; the statue has been vandalised a day after the opening ceremony.

<ul>
<li>killed an unknown number of Jews among Dresden citizens; they were not allowed to use cellars for shelter during the bombings</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Impact of the attack</span></h2>
<p>Currently the article reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Out of 28,410 houses in the inner city of Dresden, 24,866 were destroyed. An area of 15 square kilometers was totally destroyed, among that: 14,000 homes, 72 schools, 22 hospitals, 19 churches, 5 theaters, 50 bank and insurance companies, 31 department stores, 31 large hotels, 62 administration buildings as well as factories such as the Ihagee camera works. In total there were 222,000 apartments in the city. 75,000 of them were totally destroyed, 11,000 severely damaged, 7,000 damaged, 81,000 slightly damaged. The city was around 300 square kilometres in area in those days. Although the main railway station was destroyed completely, the railway was working again within a few days.</i></dd>

<p>Can anyone provide a source for these statistics because they vary from the ones I have?</p>
<p>Taylor Page 408 quotes a German police report which gives figures which include:</p>
<dl>
<dd>39 schools, 19 hospitals, 11, churches, 6 chapels, 3 theatres, 50 banks and ins, 31 department stores, 31 large hotels, 63 administration buildings, + 647 shops, 64 warehouses, 18 cinimas, 5 cultural buildings, 5 consulates, 1 zoo, 1 water works, 1 railway, 19 postal facilities, 4 tram facilities, 19 ships and barges. Military targets were main cammand post, Wehrmacht library, vet testing centre, and many military hospitals. The main military barracks around the old arsenal was missed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Taylor Page 409: 200 factories damages, 136 seriously 28 medium and 35 light.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Later British assessments, which were more conservative, concluded that 23 per cent of the city’s industrial buildings were seriously damaged and that 56 per cent of the non-industrial buildings (exclusive of dwellings) had been heavily damaged. Of the total number of dwelling units in the city proper, 78,000 were regarded as demolished, 27,70 temporarily uninhabitable but ultimately repairable, and 64,500 readily repairable from minor damage. This later assessment indicated that 80 per cent of the city’s housing units had undergone some degree of damage and that 50 per cent of the dwellings had been demolished or seriously damaged.<a href="https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>
