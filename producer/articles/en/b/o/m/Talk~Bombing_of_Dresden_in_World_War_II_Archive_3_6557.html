<p>I found another serious source which I trust. <a href="http://www.geschichtsthemen.de/dresden_1945.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geschichtsthemen.de/dresden_1945.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geschichtsthemen.de/dresden_1945.htm</a> (German) It looks scientifically made to me, all sources are explained.</p>
<p>It offers the following numbers: all together dead people found 02/1945 untill 04/1945: 25.000, war-dead people found in later years 10/1945-09/1957: 2.000. No registration of burried people 05/1945-09/1945. number of missed people: 35.000, about 10.000 of those 35.00 missed ones were found alive. The estimated number of killed people for 02/1945 is 40.000. It is said in this ttext that often left wingers want less, and right wingers want more to be the new official number.</p>
<p>The guessed number of refugess within the city for 02/1945 is 200.000 according to that text. Long time it was estimated to be even 500.000 and more but the refugees (really very very very many, I saw balancd films about in the today´s TV.) were told to quickly leave Dresden. The guessed number of 200.000 actually in the city was given by the refugees adminstration. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetguruDD_6425.html" title="User:NetguruDD">NetguruDD</a> 11:55, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nobody warned the refugees from the east more than any other population. With "told to quickly leave the city" I only meaned that they could not stay too long in such huge amounts because they maybe would have needed too much resources, room etc., don´t know why, I just read that the administration didn´t want to keep too many of them. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetguruDD_6425.html" title="User:NetguruDD">NetguruDD</a> 18:11, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The militaric facilities in the north of the city can be watched at any time today. They were not really hit. The main station in the southern city center was destroyed completely. However, three days later rains went again through the city. Sorry, I don´t know a source for the second claim, it´s just popular guessing. I have no and had no relatives who lived here in those days, my knowledge is just from reading and watching. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetguruDD_6425.html" title="User:NetguruDD">NetguruDD</a> 16:41, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>"85% of Dresden were destroyed." This is wrong. Only the center was destroyed completely. There are flat statistics and a destruction map above this abstract here. The population was 570.000 out of former 630.000 plus 200.000 refugees, the city size is 328 square kilometers, the number of killed people is estimated 40.000 today. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetguruDD_6425.html" title="User:NetguruDD">NetguruDD</a> 16:49, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am removing the words "<i>British and</i>" from the sentence "There are eyewitness reports that civilians fleeing the firestorm engulfing Dresden in February 1945 were strafed by British and American aircraft, though it is doubted", because the British did not have any fighter aircraft with the range and the British bombed at night so they would not have been able to see people on the roads. As the official MOD page <a href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dresden.html" class="external text" title="http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dresden.html" rel="nofollow">RAF Bomber Command</a> states "Part of the American Mustang-fighter escort was ordered to strafe traffic on the roads around Dresden to increase the chaos."

<p>I have moved the fist sentence of this paragraph to the top of the section. I have moved the second sentence into the the section The attack.</p>
<p>I think that the first paragraph "<i>Dresden was widely considered...</i>" should be moved to the top of the section called "Dresden compared with other bombing targets in Germany". Any one disagree and if so why? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:29, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bomber Harris</span></h2>
<p>As is shown in the section "reasons for the attack", many senior people in all three of the major allied nations were involved in the principle of attacking cities because they were major communication nodes and to do so would help stop German troop movements between fronts.</p>
<p>The Air Staff short-listed Dresden and Berlin because not only were they rail transport centres, but they were also industrial targets as well (two targets in one).</p>
<p>Harris did not order the bombing of Dresden as part of an overall bombing policy. It was the The British Air Staff commanded by Sir Charles Portal who according to the British Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair in his memo to Churchill on 27 January 1945 recommended the attacks on "Berlin, Dresden, Chemnitz and Leipzig" over and above those already under way under the "current directive" which is what Harris was following.</p>
<p>Harris could not order the USAAF to attack Dresdon (nor could the Air Staff) that had to come from higher up in one of the Allied Joint Commands or from a Senior American commander.</p>
<p>So the sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>"British Air Marshal Arthur Harris, inventor of area bombing, ordered the action"</li>
<li>"Some think that Air Marshal Arthur Harris and others should have been held accountable for war crimes or crimes against humanity."</li>
</ul>
<p>are misleading because they put Harris too far up the chain of command. (also the first is wrong because Harris was not the "inventor of area bombing").</p>
<p>I suggest that the sentences are modified to read:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Allied commanders who ordered the action,[some ...]"</li>
<li>"Some think those who in the Allied commands approved and ordered the attacks and others who carried them out, should have been held accountable for war crimes or crimes against humanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does anyone object to this and if so why? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:21, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>He was not the <i>main character in the attacks</i>. What is your source for stating that he is? He is not even the best known ([[Jimmy Doolittle] is). I think what you mean, is that his is the name you are most familiar with and you do not like the man, because, unlike Churchill, he did not show any contrition for the attack. However he did not alter allied priorities which made Dresden a the target, he did not personally drop a bomb, and he did not order the Americans to bomb Dresden.</p>
<p>I do not think that specific person should be named because it was a joint allied decision taken at very high levels with a lot of people concurring. But if you wish to name an individual, for most Americans <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Doolittle_37e3.html" title="Jimmy Doolittle">Jimmy Doolittle</a> a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a> holder is far better known than some obscure Brit. He as in the same postion in the American Chain of command as Harris was in the British, and the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_Air_Force_f1db.html" title="Eighth Air Force">Eighth Air Force</a> bombers carried out more raids on Dresden than the RAF. So if you think that a crime was committed and you want to name a specific person why not name him? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 01:55, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article heavily overrepresents the view that the bombings were legitimate attacks on military targets. It is however a major dispute whether the deliberate killing of tens of thousands of civilians was not a war crime totally unnecessary for the end of the war that was close anyways. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 20:09, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The paragraphs do not "<i>seemingly supporting the legitimacy of the attacks</i>" They report on who in the Allied commands gave what reasons for the attack and who knew and approved of those reasons. It would seem to me, that as you think that the bombing of Dresden was a war crime, you would want the organisations and people involved in making the decisions named.

<p>Not sure if it is true that they were set up that way -- but I am not an expert on that and I do not wish to go and find out so I'll take your word on it. But no one Axis side on the was tried as "participants in the decision or execution of assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory". If it was a war crime why not? It was either because no crime had been committed <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Conventions_2c8d.html" title="Hague Conventions">Hague II</a> (1899) Arts 25,26,27), or because of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victors_justice.html" title="Victors justice">victors justice</a>.

Sec II Art 6 of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Charter_62c9.html" title="London Charter">London Charter</a> defined them as "trial and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis countries". It certainly would have been awkward to try Nazis for aerial bombings the Allies had copied so well. I was told that it was argued that the Hague Convention applied only to war "on land", allegedly there were no rules for aerial warfare. I do not know if that is true. As the crimes fit so well with the crimes defined by the Hague Convention, and as the damages occurred on land, I am not sure if this is true. At least <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimes_against_humanity.html" title="Crimes against humanity">crimes against humanity</a> fits perfectly: "a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population". <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 14:02, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is that all you have! You want to use a <b>2003 definition</b> of what constitures a "crime against humanity" for an alledged crime that took place more than 58 years before it?</p>
<p>BTW I have scanned all the Hague documents and I can not find the phrase "crimes against humanity". Please could you tell me in which document I can find it in and in which paragraph because 1907 covers Hague VI-X.</p>
<p>As the British treaty obligations stood at the time of WWII the RAF was acting within them Hague IV (1907) Arts 25,26,27. I think no crime was commited and you think that a crime was committed. It does not matter what we think, without a court case with the law as it was at that time, it is only speculation. When I put in that no prosecution took place of Germans because Arial bombardment was covered by Arts 25,26,27 or victors justice, you took it out with the comment speculation. So I have rewriten it without that phrase. But if you wish to mention that some people think a war crime was commited, then the sentence about the Axis not being tired for such a crime is relevent. I would prefer to put why they may not have been tried either 25,26,27, or victors justice, but you have said that is speculation.</p>
<p>I am going to revert the sentences to what I wrote because and I would appreciate it if you would come up with a better argument than you opinions and a <b>2003 definition</b> for a replacement, if you do not like it. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:51, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you could have seen easily from the article <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_against_humanity.html" title="Crime against humanity">crime against humanity</a>, the term existed before the war, but its interpretation was only done by the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trial_b70c.html" title="Nuremberg Trial">Nuremberg Trial</a>, one reason why some speak of victor's justice.

<p>An encyclopida article should not hold information as a fact if it it is only POV. The Holocaust is a crime against humanity. The "assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory" had never been judged to be a war crime let alone a crime against humanity.

<p>The statue of Harris is covered on the Harris page it should not be mentioned here. It is not directly relevent to the Dresden bombing, unlike the Queen's concert in Berlin, which was. So I am taking it out for the second time.</p>
<p>BTW Harris was offered baronet in 1953 which is the same as the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Dowding_2caa.html" title="Hugh Dowding">Hugh Dowding</a> who was commander of RAF fighter command during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a>.

<dd>I still think that the Dresden bombing was the primary reason why the Harris statue conflict occurred, and that is what many others think:
<dl>
<dd><i>At s SHAEF press briefing two days later it was revealed in 'off the record' comments that the aims of 'Thunderclap' were to bomb large population centres and prevent relief supplies from getting through. An Associated Press war correspondant immediately filed a story that the Allies had resorted to terror bombing in order to seal Hitler's doom and this set in train a number of embarrassing questions on both sides of the Atlantic on the morality of this form of attack. Eventually, even Churchill, who had been a wholehearted supporter of 'Thunderclap', went so far as to comment to the British Chiefs of Staff that 'the destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing.' Harris, however, remained unrepentant, commenting on Churchill's objection that he did not regard 'the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British Grenadier'. Even so, Dresden remains the prime example cited by those who condemn the morality of 'city busting' as practised by the Anglo-US bombing forces and was still a matter of contention in 1992 when a statue of Harris was unveiled in London.</i></dd>

<p>I am however ok with not mentioning it here as long as Harris is mentioned prominently enough to encourage the interested reader to click on his article. I found that Harris was the only commander in chief not to become a peer in 1946 and refused the title later because the bombers were declined a campaign medal. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 11:50, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then put Harris in a "See also" section, or mention that he was C-in-C of RAF Bomber Command. He was not the only "commander in chief not to become a peer able to sit in the House of lords in 1946" what about <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Dowding_2caa.html" title="Hugh Dowding">Hugh Dowding</a> the C-in-C of the RAF during the Battle of Britain. Also as you have written on the Harris page you know the reason why he was not. BTW Churchill was given a peerage either! (but I leave it to the reader to find out why). Why do you want to mention him over and above that American hero <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Doolittle_37e3.html" title="Jimmy Doolittle">Jimmy Doolittle</a> who held the same poition in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAAF_4158.html" title="USAAF">USAAF</a>?</p>
<p>The Briefing is correct "were to bomb large population centres and prevent relief supplies from getting through [to the front]" it was the associated press report which reported the briefing incorrectly "had resorted to terror bombing in order to seal Hitler's doom". This was never stated as an objective by the senior command of the the USAAF or the RAF as policy. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 16:30, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
