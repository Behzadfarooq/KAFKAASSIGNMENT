<p>In Japanese version it mentions about the possible war crimes committed. Why not here? Hostory revisionist? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESYSS_Mouse_58d6.html" title="User:SYSS Mouse">SYSS Mouse</a> 18:25, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think there's any revisionism unless you dispute the intentional targeting of civilian (lives) and the actual lives lost. However, flaunting that now as a war crime has nationalistic overtones that stinks of Ishiharaism. Cf. <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shintaro_Ishihara_c367.html" title="Shintaro Ishihara">Shintaro Ishihara</a>, current governor of Tokyo. Personally, I don't like him or any of the nationalism he advocates. For the record, I am Japanese, and I think this is the disucussions page and not the main article, so this kind of soap boxing is allowed. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 208.54.15.1 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.54.15.1.html" title="User talk:208.54.15.1">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.54.15.1_8577.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.54.15.1">contribs</a>) 04:35, 10 March 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>There's no need to be Japanese nor Ishiharaist to consider these civilian target bombings as war crimes. All you have to do is to consider the facts without passion, which is hard for both the US and the Japanese. The same goes for the bombing of Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki of course. The reason for these bombings not being called by their true name, "war crimes", is those who judged what were war crimes and what were not, when ended WWII, were the winners. The winners judging the defeated, how could they be neutral? (!<i>BTW did you noticed there is a "Japanese war crimes" article in the English wiki but no US/UK war crime articles -the very same there is a "pornography in japan" article and nothing about the US, while the world's 1st porno industry is, as everybody knows, US-!</i>). This article being in English explains why US/UK war crimes are not mentionned here in this version. Don't expect the US government and people to admit they fought evil criminals with evil crimes (same goes for every country). The "war crime" concept is a nonsense, isn't war itself a crime? "War crime" is just an hypocrite perspective upon how war is supposed to be according to the old and obsolete standards. Don't expect governments to make war like gentlemen, like in the old days (like the French and English did at the 1745 <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fontenoy_ef9c.html" title="Battle of Fontenoy">Battle of Fontenoy</a>). But came the industrial revolution who changed both the way to think war and the medium to do war, WWII was an industrial war. Hence the 20th &amp; 21st centuries conflicts became a fully rationalized struggle between rival ideologies, and it lasts... religion just being part of the ideology. At a certain point in the conflict, governments rationalize the losses on both sides and are ready to accept every mean to be victorious, it includes terrorism, torture, civilian targets, attacking Red Cross convoy. This is how politicians and chiefs of staff stop to be pure strategists and become "war criminals", but even without those so called war crimes they were already plain criminals. During war each side has its own vision and ideology, and once its finished each country has its own memory, which is an euphemism for revisionism. Calling the others reviosionists or war criminals is an evidence of the remaining ideology and the biggest hypocrisy. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShame_On_You_c488.html" title="User:Shame On You">Shame On You</a> 01:08, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you want to discuss in the article the war crimes aspect of the U.S. area bombings of Japanese cities, including Tokyo, there's no problem with doing so as long as you're repeating, citing, and referencing credible sources. There are several works that discuss the possible war crimes aspect of these bombings. One of the most recent, significant books on the subject is, <i>Among the Dead Cities</i> by A.C. Grayling, which is already included in the references section for this article. If you present the case about the debate over whether the bombings were war crimes or not in a neutral manner, with inline citations to back up all of your assertions, there shouldn't be a problem. The "criticism" section as it stands right now in the article is uncited, and therefore subject to immediate deletion or radical editing at the whim of any other editor. Remember, this is an encyclopedia so it should contain other people's <i>published</i> opinions, not our own. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 01:32, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi, you're absolutely right. Unfortunately I know how things work on (all versions of) wikipedia i know by experience that such criticism would be considered as anti-US or anti-UK by the majority of the editors and will be reverted, censored, and i'll end banned. this is the sad truth about wiki. i was just answering this editor about the different perpsective on the different wiki (perspectives, sides). My opinion is wiki is great for neutral database, or sciences or some arts, but as long as it is about history, the encyclopedia turns into propaganda and is, i believe, a powerful tool of revisionism. you can testify by yourself just by checking the same event article in different languages. this is kind of logical, human behaviour and not that hard to understand. Having wikipedia neutral about history events is just utopic. You can try this game if you please, but i won't. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShame_On_You_c488.html" title="User:Shame On You">Shame On You</a> 01:47, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The POV wars do happen on Wikipedia, but I've also seen the opposite happen, where someone was able to present a controversial issue in such a neutral, well-referenced way that it was pretty-much left alone after that. I can give you some examples on your talk page is you want to see them. I know of at least two instances that I was involved with. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 02:15, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to expand on this article with more information about the bombing campaign against Japan as a whole (not just the city of tokyo).

<dd>An article on the Strategic bombing campaign against Japan makes sense, and that would take most of the info now on this page. However, that's not a reason not to have an article on this <i>specific</i> subject. The March 9-10 raid, at least, deserves an article.</dd>

<p>Personally I think that an expansion of "XX Bomber Command", and short articles on the "XXI Bomber Command" and the "U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific" would be a good place to start as the latter pulls in the 8th air force as well as the 20th. A section in the "Bomber Command" article on the "XX bomber Command" would be useful. IMHO there also needs to be a substantial Japanese section in the "strategic bombing during World War II" <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:20, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My suggestion is to have a Strategic bombing campaign against Japan article with this article, Matterhorn, and the atomic bombing articles as sub-articles. Articles on the other large bombing raids on Japan (Osaka, Yokohama, etc) could then also be started as sub-articles for this campaign. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 23:17, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article was #1 Google in response to request: "Tokyo fire bombing." In the film "Fog of War" Robert McNamara recounts a conversation with Curis LeMay. McNamara attributes to LeMay something to the effect: 'If we were to lose the war we'd be war criminals.' (Not a quote.) I started the Google search because I wasn't sure if LeMay was the general in charge of the fire bombing and therefore the person to whom McNamara attributed the remark.</p>
<p>I'm new to Wikipedia and may be violating and showing ignorance of its protocols, but wouldn't it be valuable to provide source information for this particular quote. By citing the film, a reader could see and hear for himself someone who purports to be an precipient witness to the remark. The fact that McNamara is one of the most accomplished liars of his age is vitiated in part or in whole by the fact that the statement if made by LeMay is also against McNamara's personal interests. That victors decide who is and isn't a war criminal is an old subject. But McNamara is describing a remark made when there was no possibility that Japan would win the war. Hence, it's a different moral/ethical situation than one in which the acts are preformed when there is still a chance that one would be punished for them.</p>
<p>Because of the way it can be sourced, because it is so short (making it easier for McNamara to recall accurately), because of its content, and because of McNamara's character and subsequent personal history, this is about as "good" as history gets. Isn't it? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 68.6.44.158 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.6.44.158_9fbe.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.6.44.158">contribs</a>) 02:07, 19 June 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>PBS: I check quote. It's more general, beginning with "Killing Japanese didn't bother me very much at that time" and then to the war criminal remark with no specific reference to Tokyo. If no one else comes up with it I'll get the DVD and get the exact words. In my previous note I remark on the quality of this kind of statement - direct from the precipient witness, pithy, etc. Given the difference between the words attributed to LeMay in wiki &amp; McNamara, it seems possible, if not likely, that McNamara conflated a conversation he had with LeMay with what he read about LeMay. Is history bunk?

<p>This article is full of POV statements, one-liners and conclusions. This really is a quite appallingly drafted page and I’m surprised it made it onto the front page!</p>
<p>Someone should take a look at the article on the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and incorporate some of the changes they have made there. That article has been the site of a long-running battle between people with vastly different POV’s and as a result the page itself has actually come out of it rather well done, with both sides represented and portrayed in a neutral manner (mostly, as there’s always still work to be done).</p>
<p>This page includes throw away comments regarding the “murderous” nature of the attacks and draws a stark conclusion about how the subsequent nuclear attacks were simply a demonstration to Russia (a conclusion which is discussed in a very clear and non-POV manner on the Hiroshima/Nagasaki page).</p>
<p>While the attacks may well be easily argued as being murderous, encyclopedic articles are not there to draw such conclusions but to detail the arguments on which the reader may then form their own conclusion.</p>
<p>Much of this page needs a complete re-write and I would suggest that the format of the Hiroshima/Nagasaki page serve as a foundation for that work.</p>

<dd>Not in the Pacific Theater. The Soviets and the Japanese Empire had previously signed a "Non-Agression Pact," which remained in effect until after the US dropped the atomic bomb in 1945 and the Soviets terminated the pact as part of their agreement to the Potsdam Conference in Germany about July 1945 with the US and UK. At least one B-29 landed in the USSR due to either battle damage or in-flight problems and the Soviets also interred the plane and crew.

<dd>I don't think that the U.S. bomber commanders explicitly stated that the purpose of the firebombing was to "kill as many Japanese civilians as possible." Instead, I think they said that it was to destroy the Japanese industrial base, which they felt included many small workshops and factories spread throughout residential areas in Tokyo. Therefore, the civilian deaths could be considered as collateral damage. Of course, if you want to argue the point either way in the article, you need a cited source in support. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 00:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>The nature of the construction of Japanese cities was well known to the attackers viz. paper and wood. The attacks were especially planned to <b>maximize</b> the incindiary effects of the bombs. The mix and distribution of the bombs was designed to set the entire (or, as much as possible of) city on fire i.e. to destroy it by fire. (I wrote my junior English term paper on this raid in high school. [the theme required was: Man's inhumanity to man.]) This would obviously kill and maim a large portion of the inhabitants (men, women, and children). It would also leave the survivors homeless and destitute and more vulneralble to further depredations. If this is not a crime, for the love of God and man, what is? That this was one of the greatest crimes in all human histroy is beyond dispute. The attempt was made with due knowledge, deliberation, and planning to destroy a whole city by by fire using a carefully planned massive mix and distribution of incindiary and explosive bombs. It was even planned so that the civil defense and fire prevention means of the city would be massively overcome. Americans are kept ignorant of their own history and that of the rest of the world. This makes them vulnerable to further manipulation by unscrupulous polititians and the leaders of the military/industrial complex. Their ignorance, complacency, and self-serving denials do not absolve them of complicty in their country's crimes, however.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What kind of crime do you specifically believe that it was? If you read the discussion on the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_war_crimes.html" title="Allied war crimes">Allied war crimes</a> article, you will see that the bombing of Tokyo didn't break any specific conduct of war statutes. So, are you saying that the bombing of Tokyo was a moral crime? If so, you need to make that distinction in your argument. Because, moral crimes are in a different class than legal crimes, and need to be discussed in that context. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 13:57, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The answer to the first question is easy: mass murder. I believe that it was an act that was so immoral, so wrong in other words, that it violates a universal standard of human decency and restraint, statutory or not. I did not say "war crime" specificly because I am not knowledgeable about the Geneva Conventions, nor of International Law, nor of other laws and treaties pertaining to warfare. I don't defend my ignorance. I believe such study is useful and pertinate. Yet, I fervently hold that the fire bombing of any large city, or the indescriminte destruction en-mass of any large population of human beings is repugnant not only to yours truly, as I feel that it is generally so among the great majority of the human race. It violates the conscience of mankind.</p>
