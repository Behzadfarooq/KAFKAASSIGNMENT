1949 Bombardier B12</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Prior to the start of the company's development of track vehicles, Armand Bombardier experimented with propeller driven snow vehicles. His work with snowplane designs can be traced to before 1920. He quickly abandoned his efforts to develop a snowplane and turned his inventive skills to tracked vehicles. From the start the company made truck-sized <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-track.html" title="Half-track">half-track</a> vehicles, with skis in the front and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Caterpillar_track.html" title="Caterpillar track">Caterpillar tracks</a> in the rear, designed for the worst winter conditions of the flatland Canadian countryside. After producing half-tracks in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> for the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Canadian_Army_83b8.html" title="History of the Canadian Army">Canadian Army</a> the company experimented with new forms of track systems and developed an all-tracked heavy duty vehicle designed for logging and mining operations in extreme wilderness conditions, such as heavy <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow.html" title="Snow">snow</a> or semi-liquid <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskeg.html" title="Muskeg">muskeg</a>. They produced it under the name <i>Muskeg tractor</i>.</p>

<p>Each track is composed of 2 or more rubber belts that are joined into a loop. The loops are held together with interior wheel guides and exterior cleats, commonly called grousers. The tracks are driven by a large drive sprocket that engages the grousers in sequence and causes the track to rotate. 2 belt tracks were common on early model Bombardiers as well as for <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskeg.html" title="Muskeg">muskeg</a> machines. For deep snow use, wider tracks, employing addition belts, are used for added flotation over the snow.</p>
<p>The research for the track base made it possible to produce a relatively small continuous rubber track for the light one or two person snowmobile the founder of the company had dreamed about during his teen years. This led to the invention of <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowmobile.html" title="Snowmobile">snowmobiles</a>, as we know them.</p>

<p>The company created the market, and held its own after it was invaded by worldwide competitors in the late 1960s. From the 1940's through the early 1970's Bombardier built the most successful <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowcat.html" title="Snowcat">snowcat</a> models ever produced by any <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowcat.html" title="Snowcat">snowcat</a> manufacturer. The B12 seated 12 people, and the C18 seated 18. Both were similar in design with long tracks in the rear and skis used to steer the vehicle. The B12 and C18 were very fast for their day, with speeds over the snow exceeding 30 miles per hour. Most historic and most modern <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowcat.html" title="Snowcat">snowcats</a> have a top speed of barely 20mph. The Bombardier B12 and C18 were probably the precursors to the more modern <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_coach.html" title="Snow coach">Snow coach</a> currently used by resorts for transporting tourists. In their day, the B12 and C18 vehicles were used as school buses, for mail delivery and as emergency vehicles in northern United States and Canada and were best suited to flat land conditions, frozen roadways or frozen lakes. While more than 3000 of the Bombardier B12/C18 variants were produced, there was plenty of competition for Bombardier to contend with in both the North American and world markets. Most of the Bombardier production stayed in North American and it was the most popular series of <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowcat.html" title="Snowcat">snowcats</a> ever produced, but it was clearly a niche product.</p>

<p>The front ski design was incapable of being used in deep snow and rough ground conditions and this opened the door for the development of dual track and quad track <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowcat.html" title="Snowcat">snowcats</a>. Unfortunately the front ski design was not easily adapted to change for other ground conditions, so while it was successful on flat lands, frozen lakes and snow covered roads, it could not compete on rough off road conditions. The combination of the the lack of design flexibility, incompatibility with off road conditions, and the advent of modern snowplowing practices of public roadways beginning in the 1950's, and becoming common in remote areas by the 1960's probably led to the demise of the B12/C18 design.</p>
<p>Notable competitors included the Aktiv <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_Trac_8419.html" title="Snow Trac">Snow Trac</a> ST4 from Sweden, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiokol.html" title="Thiokol">Thiokol</a>, and Tucker <a href="../../../s/n/o/Sno-Cat_15df.html" title="Sno-Cat">Sno-Cat</a> from the USA. The <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_Trac_8419.html" title="Snow Trac">Snow Trac</a> was produced, virtually unchanged until 1981 but it was very successful with over 2000 units sold and it was used all over the globe for exploration and commercial purposes as well as the 1972 Winter Olympic games in Soporro, Japan. Tucker <a href="../../../s/n/o/Sno-Cat_15df.html" title="Sno-Cat">Sno-Cat</a> grew to become one of the world's largest buiders of these vehicles and currently produces a wide range of large commercial and exploration vehicles from its location in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medford%2C_Oregon_4a83.html" title="Medford, Oregon">Medford, Oregon</a>, USA. <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiokol.html" title="Thiokol">Thiokol</a> produced many popular units, notably the Imp, Super Imp and Spryte models but changed ownership and name several times before going out of business in 2000 as the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logan_Machine_Company_e156.html" title="Logan Machine Company">Logan Machine Company</a> and manufacturer of the LMC brand.</p>

<p>Armand dreamed of developing a fast, lightweight snowmobile that could carry one or two people. In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles. But by the end of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come on the market. Armand resumed his efforts to build a "miniature" snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombardier.html" title="Bombardier">Bombardier</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowmobile.html" title="Snowmobile">snowmobile</a> went on sale in 1959.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Ski-Doo</b> was originally intended to be named the <b>"Ski-Dog"</b> because Bombardier meant it to be a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By an accident, a painter misinterpreted the name and painted "Ski-Doo" on the first prototype. The public soon discovered that speedy vehicles that can zoom over snow were a lot of fun. Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centered in Quebec. In the first year, <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombardier.html" title="Bombardier">Bombardier</a> sold 225 Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and move resources away from his all-terrain vehicles. He vividly remembered his earlier business setbacks that forced him to diversify. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products but still dominate the entire <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowmobile.html" title="Snowmobile">snowmobile</a> industry. The <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowmobile.html" title="Snowmobile">snowmobiles</a> produced were of exceptional quality and performance, earning a better reputation than the rival Polaris and Arctic Cat brands of motosleds. In 1975 <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombardier.html" title="Bombardier">Bombardier</a> completed the purchase of the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Moto-Ski_d64a.html" title="Moto-Ski">Moto-Ski</a> company to expand the Ski-Doo line and eliminate a competitor from the marketplace. <a name="Motorcycles_and_ATVs" id="Motorcycles_and_ATVs"></a></p>
