<p>Thank you for your contributions on <a href="../../../a/r/v/Talk%7EArvanites_53e1.html" title="Talk:Arvanites">Talk:Arvanites</a>. If you need any help when dealing with Greek nationalism, don't hesitate to ask me. I'm very experienced. There is nothing they can throw at you that I have not yet seen. Just remember, they <b>never</b> have any sources, so the are always in violation of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia policy</a>. REX 16:07, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bomac, I wouldn't attack Greece unjustifiably. I know it has its <b>dreadful</b> points, but lets not be unfair. I know that in your country you probably don't think highly of Greece, probably because of that trade embargo (which I happen to think was unnecessary and malicious), but let's not get carried away. Moderation is a virtue, something that Greek extremists and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaida_a98c.html" title="Al-Qaida">Al-Qaida</a> lack, but so do Macedonian, Albanian, British and Turkish extremists.

<p>Hello Bomac, I didn’t really want you leave this message on your talk page because I wanted to avoid Theathenae prying through it and coming up with racist comments (as usual) but as you have provided no e-mail address so that I can contact you through the website, I didn’t have a choice. I think that I should give you the briefing on the dispute that “everyone” has with the Greek nationalists. These are the universal truths in these circumstances whatever the Greek extremists may say: the Greek extremists NEVER have any sources; they will just imagine one and keep talking about it. What I (and certain other users, such as FlavrSavr, GrandfatherJoe, Zocky, Macedonian etc) are seeking to achieve is to reduce the influence of Greek nationalists on Wikipedia. In other words to make many articles, such as “Macedonian Slavs”, “Republic of Macedonia”, “Arvanites” etc use phrasings that can be found in numerous sources such as UNESCO Reports, the Helsinki Human Rights Reports, Ethnologue and various encyclopaedias, most notably the “Britannica Encyclopaedia”. Everything the Greek nationalists want to do is to “change” the meanings of the words so as to make them promote Greek nationalists ideas. The Greek nationalists never have sources, so the obvious thing to do is to keep asking for them. Just know that if the Greek nationalists start being rude, then you’re winning because they are feeling uncomfortable. I’m assuming that you’re over 18 because you should be prepared that Chronographos (another Greek extremist) will be making some very personal and improper comments about you and you should just ignore them. He is trying to distract you. If you are under 16, then you should seek permission from your parents before participating in Wikipedia; although I can certify that Wikipedia is perfectly safe, I must emphasise that as always when on the Internet, don’t trust anyone, EVER. I sincerely hope you enjoy editing Wikipedia and participating in its discussions. Again, welcome! REX 22:03, 30 September 2005 (UTC) <b>Note:</b> This is not a hate note. Reasonably moderate centrist Greeks are great people. I have nothing against <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>. Only against the nationalists who seek to deny people their identity. REX 22:28, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>But ofcourse I have nothing against <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>. You just can't generalise things - not everyone in Greece is like, for example, Theathenae. Just like you, I'm highly against the violent greek nationalism and I don't want it to interfere in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/m/User%7EBomac_e7d7.html" title="User:Bomac">Bomac</a> 10:31, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So we can agree that we are all of the same mind. Good. You know that <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation</a> is on the cards for <a href="../../../m/a/c/Talk%7EMacedonian_Slavs_b999.html" title="Talk:Macedonian Slavs">Talk:Macedonian Slavs</a>, let's hope that it passes. Theathenae has indicated that he doesn't want Mediation. Obviously this is due to the fact that he has <b>no sources</b>. Aha! He has been caught out. REX 10:47, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have my opinion and other people may have their opinion. Talking about it, or disagreeing, or proving with facts what is true and what is not, has nothing to do with "<i>violent extremism</i>". Was <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diogenes.html" title="Diogenes">Diogenes</a> and other philosophers who argued about various issues, extremists when they prooved that someone or some argument is false? I thought that was called <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialogue.html" title="Dialogue">dialogue</a>. I told you before that labeling other people is against <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/o/m/User%7EBomac_e7d7.html" title="User:Bomac">Your user page</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">that user page</a> have many similarities. You could perhaps (as I've mentioned before) leave a note on your page stating how you got inspired.</p>
<p>I hope that answered your questions. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 13:20, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What I meant (you can read again my previous comment) is that if you talk, disagree, or prove that someone is wrong, it is called <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialogue.html" title="Dialogue">dialogue</a> not extremism. Labeling other people doesn't help the process of any dialogue. Dialogue is the foundation of Democracy. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 13:41, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/o/m/User%7EBomac_e7d7.html" title="User:Bomac">Bomac</a>, a word of caution though. Don't keep on attacking Greek extremists on their talk pages.

<p>Bomac, you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedonian_Slavs&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24730033" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedonian_Slavs&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24730033" rel="nofollow">moved</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_%28Macedonians%29_4a7b.html" title="Macedonian Slavs (Macedonians)">Macedonian Slavs (Macedonians)</a>. You can't arbitrarily do that without first leaving a notice on the talk page and gaining some support. I know that you're new and that you're not familiar with the way things work here, but you shouldn't do that. Also, if someone moves it back, don't move it again without reasonable support as that it against Wikipedia policy. I know it's hard, especially when hard-line extremists are involved who never listen, but there is very little you can do about it except talk. If there were a way around it, believe me, Wikipedia would be NPOV now. REX 15:44, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with REX. Bomac, please don't see our comments as an attempt to patronize you ("you are a new user" etc.). It is a fact that you a relatively new user, and it is normal that you'll be doing erroneus moves. <b>Page moves</b> are a big deal. I am sure that you acted in good faith, but your move was a wrong thing to do, because of several reasons. First of all, because of the reasons stated by REX, you can't do that before gaining some support. It is my firm belief (I'm into this dispute for several months), that all we need to do is attracting neutral observation of this naming dispute - it will take a while, but I believe that they will do that move, eventually. Every other arbitrary move would start an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a>. Second, I don't see how the Macedonian Slavs (Macedonians) does any good in resolving the naming conflict. It can be only a <i>temporary</i> alternative for the name of the article, only. Wikipedia can use either Macedonians or Macedonian Slavs, within texts. There are cases where Macedonian Slavs can be used, as well - in a historical context. When disambiguation is needed, we can use, "ethnic Macedonians", "Macedonian speaking Macedonians", "Slavic speaking Macedonians" etc.</p>
<p>I reccomend that you read these policies entirely: <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conflict_12e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conflict">Wikipedia:Naming conflict</a> (especially the part How to deal with self identifying names) for the naming dispute. Also, I reccomend that you read the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">No personal attacks</a> policy. It is a <i>bad thing</i> that you go to user talk pages and personally attack them, even if you believe that the attack is justified. If somebody does a personal attack on you, require his apology or report him. Responding to personal attacks on user talk pages leads you nowhere - you definitely won't change Theathenae's mind if you personally attack her (him), and you'll do a bad thing for your reputation as a serious Wikipedia editor. Again, please accept these advices, they are definitely given for good reasons.

<p>On the relevant wiki it says that: "The Macedonian language is most closely related to the Bulgarian language. Macedonian also has similarities with Serbian, particularly Old Serbian. Bulgarian and Macedonian share typological similarities with Romanian, Greek, and Albanian". Yet we don't call it bulgarian dialect, nor the article name is macedonian-serbian-bulgarian language. And while I disagree with the term macedonia, I agree and I believe MK (or sil:mkl) should be called a language. Do you think we should call Arvanitika as Arvanitika Albanian, if Arvanitika share a common origin with modern Tosk? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 16:13, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't because UNESCO, Britannica and Ethnologue appear to disagree with that and all call Arvanitika a dialect of Albanian. Who should we believe? Them or MATIA? I think I'll believe the linguists and not the amateur encyclopaedia editor who seem to think that he can POV push just because he feels like it. MATIA, any luck finding sources yet?&#160;:-)REX 16:54, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why shouldn't I express my opinion? You only want to hear Bomac's? Bomac and I seem to be of the same mind most of the time and we are good friends. We both recognise the damage Greek nationalism is doing to Wikipedia. And to answer your other question, it's not wikistalking; I just have Bomac's talk page on my Watchlist like you have mine on yours, MATIA. I just happened to notice the question and I wanted to express my NPOV views as well. <i>You gotta problem with that?</i> REX 18:45, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>MATIA, I think that you are confused again about something that exist somewhere (maybe not in your country) and it is REALITY (Macedonia). I don't understand you: country name - something that doesn't contains the word Macedonia or with some stupid additions, and language that is spoken in this country - Macedonian. I think that this is a clear <b>paradox</b>.</p>
<p>Every Slavic language has similarities with eachother. If you are going in direction to say that Macedonian is Bulgarian (or Bulgarian dialect), first compare Bulgarian and Russian (including their letters).</p>
<p>About Arvanitika, I choose to trust the various linguists, because I believe they are the experts about that question.</p>

In fact, the idea that the macedionian-speaking population in the Greek part of Madedonia are Bulgarians is one of the myths many Greeks believe in, in the same way that they believe that their language has been pronounced the same way for millenia (see <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_pronunciation_ca99.html" title="Ancient Greek pronunciation">Ancient Greek pronunciation</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/c/Talk%7EAncient_Greek_pronunciation_710f.html" title="Talk:Ancient Greek pronunciation">Talk:Ancient Greek pronunciation</a>. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:Ανδρέας">Andreas</a> 00:20, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember that once during our frequent childhood travels from Greece to Germany by train, there were two men sitting face to face to each other. Both were reading a newspaper. At some point, one of them looked up and saw on the front page of the paper in his fellow's hands the word: <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28newspaper%29.html" title="Macedonia (newspaper)">ΜΑΚΕΔΟΝΙΑ</a>. When the other passenger looked up, he could read the word <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Macedonia_%28newspaper%29_2cb4.html" title="New Macedonia (newspaper)">МАКЕДОНИЈА</a>. The two men looked at each other with a friendly smile. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:Ανδρέας">Andreas</a> 15:11, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just thought you should check up on "Macedonian" history. During the 1910s -1940s so-called "macedonian" people living in Serbia/Yugoslavia considered themselves Bulgarians, and even had demonstrations etc to that effect. Tito invented "Macedonianism" in the 1940s and forced it on the Bulgarians living in Yugoslavia. It was recognized at the time as an obvious attempt to grab Greek and Bulgarian land and justify the Serbo-Croats' control over "Macedonia" . During the 1940s to at least the 1960s there were massive demonstrations/riots in "Macedonia" by people who demnded that they were ehtnically/linguistically/culturally etc Bulgarian and not Macedonian (by which they meant 'Greek') . Thus the parents/grandparents/great-grandparents of today's "Macedonians" fought tooth and nail to be recognized as Bulgarian, yet today's generation claim to be Macedonian. Also the "Macedonian language" exists only from the 1940s onwards, before that it was identical to Bulgarian, because it was Bulgarian. Rewriting history doesn't change the truth.</p>

<dd>Dear annonymous, Tito did not invent something that you call "macedonianism". Tito released the macedonian people from the repressions from the neighbouring countries towards the Macedonians and from their struggle who to take Macedonia first. The Bulgarians and Greeks were punishing everyone who will say a macedonian word (dialect), and not to talk about someone stating himself as a Macedonian. Obviously, that struggle continues today. I think that the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> that these countries spread is weakening. It will dissapear some day.</dd>

<p>Please, stop telling me about how Macedonian ancestors were calling themselves, 'caus my ancestors (my grandfather, grand-grandfather) were and always will be Macedonians (they've told me that in four-eyes).

<p>Hi. It may be appropriate for you to refresh your familiarity with <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;curid=41978&amp;diff=29921606&amp;oldid=29913943" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;curid=41978&amp;diff=29921606&amp;oldid=29913943" rel="nofollow">this edit summary</a> you refer to your removal of an ungrammatical tense change as "revert vandalism". Poor grammar, while not something that we want in Wikipedia, does not fit our definition of vandalism, and calling it that could easily <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">upset a new contributor</a>.

<p>When you revert my edit without explanation, it makes me angry. Forget about that. The point is that I was following the style guidelines and was reverted without explanation. Do you feel that is playing nicely with others? Please use <a href="../../../m/a/c/Talk%7EMacedonia_%28disambiguation%29_9062.html" title="Talk:Macedonia (disambiguation)">Talk:Macedonia (disambiguation)</a> to explain.
