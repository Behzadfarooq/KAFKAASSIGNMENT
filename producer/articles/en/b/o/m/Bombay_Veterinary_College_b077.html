<p><b>History</b> In the early days the city of Greater Bombay (now <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>) the seat of Bombay Veterinary College comprised of seven islands, viz. Colaba, Bombaim, Mazgaon, Varel (Worli), Varella (Wadala), Syva (Sion) and Mahim. These islands were on the outskirts of the dominions ruled by successive dynasties of Western India such as Mauryas, Satavahanas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas. In Maurya and Chalukya periods (450 A.D. to 750 A.D.), the city of Puri on Elephanta island was a principal harbour near Bombay group of islands. Besides these passing references to Bombay, little is found in the recorded history of this harbour in the first milinia of Christian Era.</p>
<p>The N.M.Petit Gateway to Hospital and CollegeBombay became the main harbour on western coast through which import of horses took place in those days. It was also the seat of the Governor of Bombay Presidency. The Governor's residence was the present site of Haffkine Institute, Parel, a stones throw distance from the Bombay Veterinary College" with parapharnelia of horse drawn buggy and ounted guards. Today the traces of these historical landmarks are hardly recognizable with expansion of city overflowing the hinterland. Bombay Veterinary College, the first institute of the kind, was at the time of its establishment at Parel was located in the premises of Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in the northern outskirts of the city. Now with the considerable increase in the size of the city, the islands have merged and the Bombay Veterinary College has come to occupy the centre of the city. VETERINARY PROFESSION IN INDIA The distinction between the art of veterinary doctoring and the Science of Veterinary Medicine is subtle. In the earlier days the Veterinary doctoring was done by people as an art with love', faith, irection and driving desire. It was achieved with apprenticeship and this experience was practiced without any training thereafter. This branch therefore developed as a science by acquiring knowledge of base (core) subject's and accumulation of clinical experience together with laboratory diagnostic aids. The basis of veterinary education underwent metamorphosis and in Europe founding of institutes with scientific rational outlook started at the dawn of Eighteenth Century. "HASTYA-AYURVEDA" a work on husbandry and diseases of elephants, and 'ASHVA-PARIKSHA' a work on husbandry and diseases of horses both in Sanskrit exist though it is not known as to when these were first written. The modern veterinary practice in India is traceable to the period when Moghul and Maratha Empires were subjugated. East India Company, after virtually eclipsing the Moghul Empire in the North and Maratha Empire in the Deccan in the latter half of the eighteenth century, settled down to govern and administer the country. In order to meet their remount needs some horse breeding farms were started in 1774 under the Army establishment. But due to rampant prevalence of equine diseases the outcome was dismaying. In 1788 Joseph Earles got Sanskrit work on Horse Management and Diseases translated into English and worked in consonance with it. Similar treatise was published by Pigott in Calcutta shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The army authorities were extremely exasparated over the knotty problem of equine malady in 1793. Surprisingly there was not a single trained individual present in India who could doctor the horses. There were only two such trained persons in Great Britain whose help could be sought for. The idea of finding native talent for this work was unthinkable to the conquerors of the land. Had the local talent been tapped at that time, it would have certainly changed the course for the profession in India. It was not until 1799 that the services of a few Veterinarians could be secured for the British army in India but very little is known as to their background training and as to what they were able to do professionally. William Moorcroft, however, stands out as a distinguished figure in this regard. After his medical career at the Liverpool Infirmary he received training at the Veterinary School at Lyons. He left a profound impression in the Veterinary field and refused headship at the London Veterinary School as he could not leave his profitable Veterinary practice. In 16 years, after his early resignation from the joint professorship with Coleman, he made a fortune for himself and later accepted an invitation from the East India Company in 1808 to become the Superintendent of their stud in Bengal on a salary of £ 3000/- a year. He diagnosed Bursati and recorded that it was prevalent in Pusa (Bihar.). He also drew pointed attention to Glanders, Strangles, Paraplegia and Anthrax He either originated or very well knew the well known operation of neurectomy and stated that it should be performed only as a last resort. He investigated Glanders in India and his concepts were more developed than those of his contemporaries. He also described the parasitic aneurysm of the mesenteric artery. Under his superintendence in a short time the losses due to diseases in the farms were reduced by 90%. The introduction of Oat as a crop in India for feeding horses also helped. Moorcroft introduced a system of co-operative breeding with native stud farms resulting in improvement of progeny over the imported Company horses. It was in 1866, because of the unprecedented famine in Bengal and Orissa, a policy of having a special department to watch over the interests of agriculture and livestock was first mooted out. Lord Lawrence, the then Governor General, however, thought the step was premature. In 1882, a despatch No. 21 dated 20 April, 1882 was promulgated by Lord Harington, Secretary of State for India urging that the then newly constituted Department of Agriculture should give early and very careful attention to the subject of cattle diseases and that comprehensive measures should be taken in co-operation with provincial Governments to deal with it. This set in motion an idea for the formation of Civil Veterinary Department. A committee was organized at Calcutta in 1883 which recommended the formation of a Civil Veterinary Department for the entire country.</p>
<p>Col. J.H.B. Hallen who was appointed President of the Indian Cattle Plague Commission worked with an outstanding zeal. His pioneering work stimulated interest in Veterinary work and several officers actively participated in investigating various obscure diseases e.g. Bursati, Lichen tropicus, calcarious nodules in internal organs of debilitated horses, Anthrax, worm infection and paraplegia. Kumri received considerable attention from several workers including Queripel and Fredrick Smith (later made Knight). The most outstanding scientific discovery of the time was the demonstration in 1881 by Griffith Evans, of Trypanosoma evansi, the causative agent of equine Surra. This discovery was important not only for India where Surra was a very troublesome condition to deal with, but also for the progress of scientific research in general by opening up the study of other protozoan diseases of both man and animals. It is very interesting to recall here that Col. Hallen, President, Cattle Plague Commission recommended establishment of a Veterinary College each at Bombay, Lahore and Rangoon. Government of Bombay was quite alert to this recommendation. In their resolution No. 4002 of 1883 Revenue Department, Government of Bombay, stated "It is difficult to Overrate the importance of agriculture and agricultural stock in India and seeing that the value of agricultural cattle which perish from plague and other epidemic diseases in India is calculated at £6,000,000 sterling per annum (1883), it is obvious that any measure which would tend to check this great mortality and heavy loss by increasing the knowledge of the nature and remedies for various diseases which attack cattle and provide a class of persons competent to treat scientifically the different maladies to which cattle are subject would prove of immense advantage to the State and to the innumerable owners of livestock comprising the mass of the cultivators". <b>BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE</b></p>
<p>Thus the process of establishment of a Veterinary College on modern concepts and imparting instructions in English medium was started. The Bombay Veterinary College was inaugurated on 2 August; 1886 with Prof. J. H. Steel, B.Sc . F.R.C.V.S., a person with experience and dynamism as its first principal. Principal J. H. Steel can be considered as the father of modern Veterinary education in India. He also can be called the father of modern Veterinary Journalism. The Bombay Veterinary College was initially housed in the vast compound of Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals, Parel, Bombay which was established in 1883 by Sir D. M. Petit Baronet. Prof. J. H. Steel was assisted by three Indian Medical Officers and an European Farrier to conduct the teaching. But when trained Veterinary graduates became available in 1889, two of them, Prof. N. D. Dhakmarvala and Prof. Nariman were taken on the college staff and the medical officers were transferred.</p>
<p>Principal J. H. Steel, in his annual reports during the four years he presided over the college, outlined his ambitious ideas for the future development of the college. He reported "The average amount of knowledge conveyed to our students before they become practitioners will equal that given in theFirst Batch Of Veterinary Students 1886 British school. Our best men may not be equal to the best European graduates but they will not fall far short and the shortcoming, if any will disappear in time with further development of the college". Indeed Principal. Steel in his comprehensive reports also dealt with other aspects such as affiliation of the college to that local university and the minimum admission standard. In his annual administration report (1888) he states " It is confidently expected that in a very few years it (Bombay Veterinary College) would be affiliated to the Bombay University and the time will have arrived when admission may be refused to non-matriculates ". On establishing the college in Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals, certain buildings belonging to the Hospital were handed over to the Government for the use of the college. The large central Main College Building 1908bungalow was utilized as the college building with certain alterations and additions such as two large lecture rooms, a library, a museum, pharmacy, office rooms for the Principal and Professors and quarters for the Resident Veterinary Officer. The curricular teaching and the clinical work of the hospital was placed in the hands of the Principal and the Faculty while general management of Hospital and patients was undertaken by the Secretary, S. P. C. A. Bombay. Pathology laboratory 1891This dual control system worked for some time but later on due to certain religious sentiments of Jain-Hindu members of the S. P. C. A. post-mortem and dissection of animals which are the aids in diagnosis and advancement of the science could not be performed in the S. P. C. A. Hospital compound. The Government of Bombay therefore, constructed a post-mortem room and the dissection hall outside the Hospital compound but in its vicinity. Other buildings such as students' hostels, shoeing forge were added from time to time. A three storied building with Roman gothic architecture, called Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory was built by Sir D. M. Petit and handed over to the Government in 1891. A Lazaretto for animals suffering from contagious diseases and an incinerator were constructed. New college building - a prototype of I. V. R. I. building Mukteshwar was built by the Government in the compound adjoining S. P. C. A. Hospital in 1908. A hostel building was also added in 1921. For quite a long time Bombay Veterinary College supplied fully qualified veterinary graduates and practitioners to all parts of India and neighbouring countries. It also filled the gap that existed between the few European Veterinary Surgeons and quite numerous but inadequately trained local personnel for veterinary job, called "Salutris", who occupied a position in Veterinary profession similar to that of Sub-Assistant Surgeons in Medical Department. It may be noted that the word "Salutri " is derived from the Sanskrit word "Saluhotra" who was a renowned Veterinarian of the ancient India.</p>
<p>The band of newly educated Veterinarians coming out of Bombay Veterinary College did yeoman service to veterinary education, research and extension and through it to the land and people of India. What Veterinary Scientific work is seen in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, East Africa today is due to these graduates who have spread far and wide. This continued until Veterinary Colleges at Lahore and Rangoon began to give instructions in English and other colleges were opened at Calcutta. Madras and Patna giving equivalent training. Bombay veterinary College, therefore, get's the credit of taking the initiative in this movement of Veterinary education and research and this college has therefore, been rightly styled as "The PIONEER" of modern veterinary education in India. The renowned Bombay Veterinary College diploma, instituted by Prof. J. H. Steel hardly operated for 5 years. The Professor's demise in 1891 and the Government, disregarding Prof. Steel's vision and expert opinion, modified and simplified the course and clubbed it in 3 years. Not withstanding the modification and axing, the course at Bombay Veterinary College remained at the highest standard of veterinary education in India for many years.</p>
<p>The two stalwarts, Lt. Col. J. Brodie Mills, and Major F. Joslen worked in the footsteps of the Founder. They were also professors of talent and brought out books and booklets especially regarding the Cattle Students` Hostel 1908Wealth of India. Frank Ware writes about his impressions of 1907 as follows. "I met different members of the staff of Bombay Veterinary College who were to be my colleagues for next two years. Col. J. Brodie MiIls, Permanent Principal was on leave and Col. Joslen was acting for him. Other members of the staff were Khan Saheb Dhakmarvala, Messers Sowerby, Vakharia and Sheikh, Rao Bahadur, B. K. Badami was the very energetic House Surgeon. The Principal showing me round remarked that one of the first things I should do was to make a close Study of the different breeds of Indian Cattle of which there was always a good selection in Bombay city. Looking back on that remark of Col. Joslen, I have often thought how far sighted it was and how pregnant with possibilities for the future, if one had been able at that time to take the advantage of it". The all energetic Shri M. S. Sastry, G.B.V.C., General Secretary, All India Veterinary Association in his article. I.V.A. and I.V.J.- their genesis, growth and career ", (Indian Vet. J. 26:13) said “The Bombay Veterinary College came into existence in 1886 with English as the medium of instruction right from the very beginning. The graduates passing out of this college were absorbed in the Veterinary Departments both Civil and Military in this Country and abroad viz. Ceylon, East Africa, Zambia, Aden and distant Brazil ".</p>
<p>From 1886 to 1910 quite a large number of Veterinary experts touched the footsteps of Bombay Veterinary College as acting or Assistant Principals before they were drafted to other Provinces. Major F. S. H. Baldrey, F. R: C. V. S., acting Principal and Col. H. T. Pease F. R. C. V. S., Assistant Principal for some time were the pillars of the profession having been associated with Dr. A. Lingard at Mukteshwar in 1897. Major F. S. H. Baldrey authored a book "Elements of Bacteriology". Col. Pease was president of Second All India Veterinary Conference held in Lucknow in 1924. Mr. Frank Ware (Later made Sir) who joined in November 1907, was for some time Vice-Principal of Bombay Veterinary College. The standard of Veterinary education in India was differing among institutions. Therefore the Government and the Principals of various colleges decided to meet at a conference. Accordingly, in January 1900 a conference of the Principals of various colleges was held at Ambala to consider the mostNew Laboratory Building 1959 appropriate curriculum which would be of uniform standard in teaching at various Veterinary Educational Institutes. As a result of deliberations, the written tests at Bombay Veterinary College were abandoned, the course still simplified and was made uniform with those of Calcutta and Lahore colleges. Oral tests were thus introduced. This curriculum remained the basis for teaching until 1912 when the post of the Inspector General. Civil Veterinary Department was abolished. The Presidencies and Provinces which had coordinated veterinary education became free to settle their own curriculum for the Diploma. Bombay Veterinary College without losing much time reverted to its three years curriculum and written, practical and viva voce mode of examination.</p>
<p>At the Fifth All India Veterinary Conference held at Bombay on 27-12-1915 in his presidential address, Principal K. Hewlett, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S, O.B.E. J.P. said, “It is almost exactly 25 years ago, I first joined the staff of Bombay Veterinary College. Research, in my opinion is one of the chief needs of India today. Veterinary education in India requires to be reformed and adopted to the changed condition. The college staff should be strengthened to such an extent so as to permit teachers specializing in their subjects and having time for study and experiment. In a vast country like India, depending almost wholly on its agriculture and its agriculture depending entirely on the working bullocks, it is strange to find apathy with regard to that Science which alone can keep the livestock of the country free from scourge of diseases. But such is the case." From the available records of history it is however found that the then Government of Bombay during this period (1912¬1936) was very apathetic to the veterinary education, research and services and at one stage wanted to abolish the college. But better counsel prevailed and the college got a new lease of life.</p>
<p>The diploma course of three years with the theory, practical and viva voce examinations adopted in 1912, continued up to 1940, when the diploma curriculum was modified. The entrance to the diploma course was raised to Inter Science 'B' group which means basic sciences were already taken care of in the University education of two years, leaving three full years for the study of professional subjects. This arrangement made it possible to broad base the studies of Pathology Bacteriology and Parasitology. It also ensured teaching of Physiology and Bio-chemistry on a better footing. Other professional subjects also got a new face and approach. In these dark days of existence and apathy, Principal K. Hewlett, the last of the I.V.S., retired. In 1932 Rao Bahadur V. R. Phadke took over as the Principal. The college by this time was kept under the Director of Veterinary Services whose responsibilities were purely medicosurgical advice and administration of the personnel. During these bleak days of 1932 Principal V. R. Phadke and Prof. N. D. Dhakmarwala, two stalwarts were continuously on their toes to convince the Government about the short sightedness of its policy of neglecting the Veteritnary college. They did so through All India Veterinary Conferences. Rao Bahadur V. R. Phadke was the first Indian Principal to take over the stewardship of the Bombay Veterinary College. A graduate of 1904, he underwent post-graduate studies at Liverpool as well as at the London School Tropical Medicine. He was the first in India to successfully employ serum simultaneous technique for the control of Rinderpest. Prof. Phadke was also the author of the pamphlet "Multivitellaria hewletti" a new fluke discovered by him in an Indian house crow. Subsequently he retired as Director of Veteril1ary Services in 1938. In appreciation of his Meritorious services the title of 'Rao Bahadur' was conferred on him on the New Year Honours Day in 1938.</p>
<p>In the year 1945, due to Herculean efforts on the part of the then Principal S. R.Chadha, retired Principal V. R. Phadke and Prof,. N. D. Dhakmarwala, the college was affiliated to the Bombay University for the award of B. Sc. (Vet) degree. Thus it took 60 years for fulfillment of the dreams of Principal J. H. Steel. Madras and Lahore Colleges had taken this step even earlier. With this affiliation the Bombay Veterinary College came in tune with the other veterinary colleges in India in the matter of advanced veterinary education. With the affiliation of the Bombay Veterinary College to Bombay University in 1945 the academic picture began to transform. There evolved independent departments of Anatomy, Surgery, . Physiology and Biochemistry, Animal Husbandry, Bacteriology, Pathology, Medicine and Parasitology. Principal S. R. Chadha, Prof. J. P. Damri, Prof. F. S. Khambata, Prof. R. N. Naik, Porf. K. R. S. Aiyer, Dr. K. B. Nair and Dr. S. R. Rao were selected and appointed as professors of respective departments. For the first time a regular research wing was created under the Professor of Bacteriology with Dr. D. T. Parnaik and Dr. W. V. Chatupale as Assistant Research Officers and Drs. S. V. Phadke, P. R. Dhake, V. B. Kulkarni and S. R. Kulkarni as graduate assistants. With this increase in teaching and research facilities a new era started in the life of the college. Animal Husbandry department which was only in minuscule form was expanded with Dr. F. S. Khambata as the Professor to look after the teaching of livestock management, hygiene, farm constructions, animal nutrition, milk hygiene and animal genetics on an elaborate scale. Extramural training in farm practices was introduced at this lime giving the students an opportunity to study management and economics of livestock rearing at farm level.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture in the life of the college a golden opportunity, which would have changed its Veterinary Polyclinic 1983-84 face was missed in the year 1947. The Government of Bombay had an ambitious plan of developing the Aarey Colony campus for livestock housing and milk production. It was very strongly suggested that the veterinary college may consider the possibility of manning this enterprise by starting a new campus of the college in the colony premises. It was also in the mind of the Government to make the college Veterinarians responsible for the livestock welfare of the thousands of livestock housed in this colony which was perhaps the largest congregation of animals in the East. However, the then administrators of the college, for obscure reasons, were less enthusiastic about the proposal.</p>
<p>After the proposal to shift the college to Aarey Colony was shelved, the Government developed a taste for shifting. At one stage in 1950 it was under consideration of the Government to close the college of Bombay and convert it into a school attached to Agriculture college, Pune, Somehow the idea fizzled out of its own.</p>
<p>The Government during 1950s had apprehensions regarding the legitimacy of Veterinarians being the real custodians of the livestock. Due to such a fluid policy, the Bombay Veterinary College suffered a serious set back and the college expansion programme was inevitably hampered. Uttar Pradesh, Madras and some other States in the country had already given a serious thinking to this problem and had decided to bring Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services under one Directorate of Animal Husbandry of the state.</p>
<p>At last in the year 1957 the Government took a firm stand on co-ordinating all livestock activities under the Director of Animal Husbandry with the Veterinarians to steer the development. With the political freedom of India and meaningful Five year plans livestock production became an important aspect of development. In order to meet the national needs, the college curricula were required to be reoriented from time to time.</p>
<p>From 1952 onwards, the Government of India, in collaboration with various advanced countries, started teacher and professional training programmes under Colombo plan, U. S. AID etc. As agriculture and livestock development was given priority the Bombay Veterinary College received the benefit of such collaboration in the form of men and material. At this stage the Government of India decided to upgrade some of the existing Veterinary Colleges as post-graduate institutions as the need for such a training was keenly felt. Bombay Veterinary College was selected as an institution for upgrading. Under the T.C.M. programme, Kansas State University and Bombay Veterinary College were linked together and a Teacher's Training Programme was evolved. To improve the teaching and research talents in the Faculty every year five teachers were selected for advanced training in their fields of specialization. The band of young experienced teachers who participated in this programme improved their expertise and efficiency and paved the way for further progress of the institute.</p>
<p>As an all India measure of improving livestock of the country, Cattle Sterility Scheme was introduced in the State. Such a study needed multi-disciplinary approach and as such the head quarters of the cattle Sterility Officer was maintained at Bombay Veterinary College. This served the double purpose of teaching and investigation in the field of Animal Reproduction. Dr. C. R. Sane, an experienced Veterinarian shouldered the responsibility of operating the scheme. In 1958, the chair of Professor of Obstretics and Gynaecology was created which he rightfully occupied. With the introduction of this subject in under-graduate programme, the degree was changed from B.Sc. (Vet) to B,V.Sc.</p>
<p>The year 1956-57, experienced another change and reshuffle in the teaching faculty with Prof. F. S. Khambata as the Principal and Drs. S. P. Deshpande, S. N. Sapre, S. R. Rao, K. R. Alur, C. R. Sane, R. M. Kalapesi and D. T. Parnaik as Professors with a band of young teachers Drs. B. L. Purohit, S. G. Kshirsagar, G. R. Murkibhavi, M. R. Redkar, R. K. Raikar and S. R. Hattangady who had the opportunity to undergo advanced training abroad under one or the other National programme, bringing fresh breeze in the faculty. At this juncture Dr. Khambata was entrusted with the crucial task to nurse the newly started Veterinary College at Nagpur. Prof. G.G. Oak a Dairy Expert and an experienced Veterinarian took over as the Principal in 1958 for a short time and was succeeded by Prof. Parnaik who had earned a King's Commission in I.A.V.C. in the Second World War. It was during his regime from 1958 to 1963 the college took long strides in development. In 1960, postgraduate courses leading to Master's degree (M.V.Sc.) Were introduced in the subjects of Pathology, Bacteriology and Parasitology. In the following year this was extended to the subjects of Animal Genetics &amp; Breeding, Gynaecology, Surgery and Medicine. Anatomy joined this programme in 1963. This was made possible by the enthusiastic and encouraging interest taken by Dr. V. R. Khanolkar, Vice-Chancellor, and Dr. Govardhan Parikh Rector of Bombay University. Prof. C. R. Sane assumed stewardship of the college in 1963. A scientist with progressive attitude, he soon became popular with the staff and students and developed social. educational and research rapport with the Medical fraternity and earned a good name for the Animal Gynaecology and Artificial Insemination. The syllabus underwent a further modification in this period and the degree of B.V.Sc. was changed to B.V.Sc. &amp; A.H. Dr. S. L. Manjrekar succeeded Dr. Sane in 1964. He had earned a name for his work in 'Rickettsia' in sheep. He championed the cause of Indian Veterinary Journal, Madras which voices the Veterinary Professional opinion of the country. Before Dr. Manjrekar settled down to concrete work as Principal he was appointed as Joint Director of Animal Husbandry, Maharashtra State. Dr. F. S Khambata came as Principal of Bombay Veterinary College in 1965. This was the time when the State of Maharashtra had decided the formation of Agricultural University for the State with head quarters at Rahuri. A graduate of both the Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences, Principal Khambata was of the opinion that the interests of Veterinary Faculty will be better safeguarded under the Agricultural University. At this time the Department of Physiology was upgraded and started M.V. Sc. courses.</p>
<p>Dr. S. R. Hattangady took over the stewardship of the college in 1968. He was a graduate of Madras Vetarinary College and a reputed Veterinary Surgeon known throughout the country. He mastered the surgical techniques by attending an academic session at Royal Veterinary College, London. During his Principalship, Bombay Veterinary Collage became a constituent college under Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth. He very successfully steered the institution through the early period of the Agricultural university. The Departments of Animal Nutrition and Pharmacology started teaching at the Master's level in this period. In the year 1972, the Bombay Veterinary College became a constituent college of Konkan Agricultural University. Dr. R. K. Raikar and Dr. S. G. Kshirsagar held the post of Associate Dean, in succession. During the tenure of the latter it was decided to examine the total issue of the Veterinary Faculty more pragmatically keeping in mind the needs of the time by a committee consisting of Dr. Manibhai Desai of Urali Kanchan, Shri Shantaram Gholap, Dr. Jayantrao Patil, executive Concillors in Agriculture University aided by Prof. Kshirsagar, Principal and Associate Dean, Bombay Veterinary College and Shri B. R. Sawant, the Registrar, Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth. Appreciating the intense urbanisation of the city of Bombay the committee came to a conclusion that the Bombay Veterinary College can develop to its full potential only if it is located in a modern new campus for Faculty in the premises of Aarey Milk Colony which would overcome many of the handicaps experienced by the college in Parel Campus.</p>
<p>The Government of Maharashtra accepted the proposal of Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth and directed the University authorities to act on the recommendations expeditiously. In order to make a beginning in farm facilities Cow Unit No. 22 at Aarey was made available forthwith for establishing an instructional farm for practical experience to the under-graduate and post-graduate students. Dr. N. S. Deodhar took over as the next Associate Dean in 1976. Shortly thereafter, a site along the Western Express Highway in Aarey Milk Colony measuring 146 acres, was transferred to the university for establishing the new campus of the Veterinary College complete with faculty buildings and farms, the original site at Parel being retained for post-graduate studies. The realisation of this dream was mainly due to the intense efforts of Dr. Kshirsagar, Dr. Deodhar and Dr. Ajinkya. Dr. Ajinyka was entrusted with the responsibilities of the Project Officer He with the help of other members of the faculty drafted a development plan for the Aarey campus. Consequent on Dr. Ajinkya becoming Associate Dean, Dr. P. D. Sardeshpande took over the charge as the Project Officer.</p>
<p>In 1976, the Departments of Food Hygiene and Public Health and Poultry Sciences were established as independent entities raised to the post-graduate levels. Simultaneously, a project for developing technology in the manufacture of Heparin and Insulin from Buffalo lungs and pancreas respectively commenced with the I.C.A.R. assistance. The project culminated in the award of Biannial Interdisciplinary Research Award (I.CA.R.) for team work to Dr. (Mrs.) Asha Mantri Dr .A .K . Gudi Dr. A. T. Sherikar" &amp; Dr. S. M. Ajinkya.</p>
<p>On retirement of Dr. Deodhar Dr S. M. Ajinkya became the Associate Dean in 1979. A research minded person, he established the Radio-Isotope Laboratory, a facility which has a wide potential in research and diagnostic fields. He headed another scheme sponsored by I.C.A.R. on Infectious Bursal Disease. In 1983, he was honoured by the I.C.A.R. by recognising him as professor of Eminence and he undertook research on Adenovirus and Immunosuppression in poultry.</p>
<p>After a brief period during which Dr. M. K. Shingatgeri was at the helm of the institution, Dr. D. S. Jadhav assumed the charge as Associate Dean in 1983. The modern polyclinic started functioning at the new campus at Aarey in 1984. A project was also initiated at this time to undertake research in fodder production at the new campus. Some more research schemes such as Toxicology Laboratory and Sperm morphology Laboratory were submitted by him. Construction of the clinical departments at Aarey campus and the students hostel, lecture halls was completed at this time. A rare event in this period was the commencement of the Centenary celebrations of the college which was inaugurated by the Chief Minister of Maharashtra Hon. Shri. Shivajirao Patil Nilangekar on 2 August 1985, This was followed by a seminar in Animal Nutrition in September, 1985. The First Asian Congress in Animal Reproduction was held in December 1986 organised by the Indian Society for the study of Animal Reproduction in association with the Centenary Celebrations of Bombay Veterinary College, which was inaugurated by His Excellency the Governor of Maharashtra, Shri K. Prabhakara Rao, over 300 scientist delegates from abroad and from all over India participated and presented 165 research papers.</p>
<p>EPILOGUE Such is the checkered story of the birth and progress of the Bombay Veterinary College the root of the modern Veterinary Science in India, greater part of Asia and Africa. With a less than modest beginning the institute had to pass through a rough and often hostile terrain. But due to foresight of its pioneers and unceasing efforts of the successors the college has reached a stage when as it enters the 120th year it is poised to make a quantum jump. The Bombay Veterinary College can claim a just pride in seeing that the seeds of the Veterinary Science it had sown a hundred years back, has developed into a huge tree giving out numerous branches of specialization in various aspects of live stock industry; Thanks to this, the veterinary profession today has been contributing to the National Progress on a large scale.</p>
