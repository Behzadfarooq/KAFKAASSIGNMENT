<p>An encyclopedia article is not a consumer review or consumer watchdog. Bombardier has transit systems or major transit system components in hundreds of cities around the globe. If everybody who went through some problesm with Bombardier transit systems (or Bombardier airplanes) posted a paragraph here it would become a consumer's report. The paragraph previously posted on the Bombardier monorail operations in Las Vegas duplicated exactly a paragraph already existing in the Las Vegas monorail article. It is a concern specific to that monorail system. If there were other issues with other Bombardier monorail installations around the globe or other present or past issues with some other Bombardier transport systems then it would make sense to make a paragraph summing them up and then putting in half a phrase or a phrase on the issues with the Bombardier monorail in Las Vegas. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 21:34, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand that you are from Montreal and have some kind of loyalty to Bombardier, and that is great. But Wikipedia has a strong policy of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">neutrality</a>, and you do not have the right to censor articles to impose your own personal views of the company on everyone else.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. Die-hard <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> fans probably don't want to see allegations of sexual abuse in his article. But guess what? It is a major news story, and - true or not - people who want a rounded, unbiased view of Mr. Jackson deserve to hear every publicly known fact about him.</p>
<p>Now, much as when people hear the name "Michael Jackson", the first thing that comes to mind is "sexual abuse"; the same is true, in the western US, of Bombardier. When people hear this name, they immediately think of the malfunctioning monorail system. Therefore, especially at a time when this story is actively in the news, the Bombardier page deserves some kind of mention of the story.</p>
<p>I don't know how things are in Canada but here in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> we have a strong history of free speech, it's one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to every citizen; and most Americans agree that it is a right that should be extended to all citizens of the world. You may like Bombardier, and you certainly have the right to defend any kind of allegations against it. But you do not have the right to censor such a story from the page. This is a major news story here. It's created quite a controversy, and here in Las Vegas, when people hear the name "Bombardier" they immediately think of the scandal. It involved hundreds of millions of dollars, and therefore is important enough to warrant a small paragraph on the page.</p>
<p>You are more then welcome to research the issue, and make the case for Bombardier in the article, but again, you do not have the right to censor it. I am adding the paragraph for a third time, and if you remove it again, I will have no choice but to report this censorship to the Wikipedia authorities.</p>

<dl>
<dd>You have not signed your comments, but I am addressing the person above. The idea that someone would be "welcome to research the issue, and make the case for Bombardier in the article" vis a vis the Las Vegas transit system brings us to an issue of due weight. Problems with a Bombardier transit system in Las Vegas may merit coverage in this article, but they should not have the weight that you seem to think they deserve.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Step back please. To understand due weight, I suggest you visit the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Concorde</a> article. The aircraft's Paris crash is dealt with in a single paragraph, this from a very long article on the history of the Concorde. Now, can you argue that a startup delay for the Bombardier transit system in Las Vegas merits greater relative weight?</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>I have edited the section accordingly, trimming the attendant criticisms which were not specific to Bombardier. I also don't think we need the NPOV Hand any longer.</dd>

<dd>I made a summary of the paragraph you re-inserted. I was hoping that you would do it yourself since you seem to know the topic well. Every transit sytem has its "teething" problems, and instead of hiding or trying to hide them as you seem to think I was trying to do, I was in fact making it easier for everybody to see them. If you take the trouble of going to the page histories of this article and the Las Vegas you will discover that I was the one who placed hyperlinks between them. I noticed that while you have made several additions to the Las Vegas monorail article you did not mention once that the Bombardier monorail system in Disneyworld has known flawless operations for decades, taking millions of adults and children from point A to point B in complete safety. You have added only negative elements. And you have never provided context. Do you consider that unbiased? Is it neutral to report only the disasters and not report the possible causes that experts have offered in the press?--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 03:32, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also think the article is somewhat biased - against Bombardier. (CNT)</p>
<p>I agree with that. Free speech in the american mindset too often means free POV. Have to depict the whole thing, or nothing. True some controversies have parcelled Bombardier's history, but it didn't get where it is today by doing crap.</p>
<hr />
<p>I agree. This article as currently written is indeed biased <i>against</i> Bombardier. The criticisms section consists of four rather large paragaphs (with a total of 53 lines) criticizing various activities conducted by this company. Only 3 lines in the entire article can even remotely be seen as argueing in favor of Bombardier - and they are in the criticisms section. ("Canada and Bombardier have countered by denouncing Brazil's direct and indirect subsidies to Embraer, their own major aircraft manufacturer and one of Bombardier's principal competitors in the regional jet market.").</p>
<p>When only one side of the argument is presented at all (those 3 lines hardly count against 53 lines), then the article is very clearly one-sided and biased. It is not even an issue of "equal coverage" - the opposing side is not mentioned at all.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, whoever wrote the criticisms section against Bombardier has <i>himself</i> claimed that someone else is pro-Bombardier - and did so while using some rather heated language. He claims "I understand that you are from Montreal and have some kind of loyalty to Bombardier". Then, he someone compares this Bombardier case to the case of Michael Jackson?!</p>
<p>In addition, the comments above about Montreal and "loyalty to Bombardier" are turning this page into a national patriotic affair. It does not need to be this way.</p>
<p>Also, the article uses wording such as "Some Canadians object to..." or "some business analysts believe..." - without providing us with specific references as to who these Canadians or business analysts are. If there are no references provided, how can we tell that the statements are not just the personal opinion of whoever wrote that section of the article?</p>
<p>All in all, the criticism section must be reworked to become unbiased.</p>

<dd>Yes you are right about Tibet and reactions. And so I think "controversial" is appropriate. I'm not the original author but I went in and cut excess, trimmed back the rhetoric in that section. I noted my reasons above. I hope the NPOV Hand can stay off this one now. We'll see.</dd>

I see the latest additions to the Criticisms section were reverted and I'm inclined to agree with that move. But as this was an NPOV-flagged article until recently, I'd like whomever made the additions to come to the talk page here and simply explain how outsourcing is specific to Bombardier these days. It seems to me that this issue could be raised in pretty well every article about North American/European companies, couldn't it? The fact that Bombardier gets tax breaks does not seem to be specific to the company either, can you explain why you think it belongs in this article please. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomaC_400a.html" title="User:RomaC">RomaC</a> 01:47, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The concerns may be common, but they do come up a good deal more frequently with Bombardier than with most companies; outsourcing is also more of an issue with Bombardier than with many companies precisely because they are perceived as being in some way ‘propped up’ by the national government. Many people seem to have fixed on them as a standard example of ‘what’s wrong’ with multinational corporations, Canadian business, or whatever, and while Wikipedia certainly shouldn’t endorse these views, the article would be incomplete if it didn't mention that they exist. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 15:32, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
I see, thanks. Actually your explanation here is good, so Bombardier has come to symbolize the "big bad tax-sucking corporation" for many Canadians.</p>
<p>Also I'd hazard a guess that the fact Bombardier are from Québec and have been involved in the arms industry hasn't brought them any sympathy from 1) the old 'I don't want French on my Corn Flakes box' gang; 2) young, anti-war types; and, 3) the neo-anarchist anti-globalization camp. Well, now I see why the content in this article has been so hotly debated and controversial! Maybe this could/should be noted in the criticisms section of article? (half serious half joking) <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomaC_400a.html" title="User:RomaC">RomaC</a> 02:07, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I re-read the article again (I hadn't read it in a long time) and noticed somebody took out a phrase where I noted that Bombarier agressively seeks and obtains subsidies, direct and indirect, or other concessions such as tax breaks or cheap land for its factories in all of the countries in which it operates. And it does so openly within the legal framework of those countries. By taking this out it looks as if Canadian taxpayers only are subsidising Bombardier. I also had a phrase in there which noted that other large corporations did the same thing in the same countries. To note just one example: Bombardier got huge breaks of all sorts from the UK government when it bought the Shorts aircraft company in Northern Ireland but at the same time many other large corporations got breaks of all kinds from the business-friendly Thatcher government. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 05:19, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Noted. That's why I think we don't need to point out that some big companies get tax breaks, or that some people object to tax breaks for big companies, it's not something specific to Bombardier. But as DA pointed out above, Bombardier is something of a lightning rod for these complaints in Canada.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. It’s not so much a matter of what Bombardier do, but how they’re perceived, and while the article definitely could use some reworking to make this clear, it would be incomplete if the criticisms went unmentioned; the average Canadian, if Bombardier is mentioned, is more likely to know about subsidies, outsourcing, and badly-selling aeroplanes than about their large, successful train-building business. Another difficulty facing this article is that while criticisms appear on this page, positive statements about Bombardier will generally end up on the pages about their individual products, so I think it’s almost inevitable that the article about the company itself will come across as rather negative. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 15:11, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Slightly off topic perhaps but I found it interesting to discover while poking round on this that the Canadian government also gave a bunch of subsidies ($200 million) to <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_28d2.html" title="General Motors">General Motors</a> plants in Ontario this year. I wonder, was there also an outcry in Canada about that handout, because there is no mention of it in the GM article.</p>
<p>Another thought, there are Wikipedia articles on <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidies.html" title="Subsidies">Subsidies</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_welfare.html" title="Corporate welfare">Corporate welfare</a>. How about citing Bombardier along with other companies in a new section in one or both of those articles then cross-linking them with the Bombardier entry? Bombardier seems a good Canadian example of this sort of thing after all, but the whole issue could be put in context if it were addressed in a dedicated article. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomaC_400a.html" title="User:RomaC">RomaC</a> 15:48, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In today's Le Devoir (oct 25) <a href="http://www.ledevoir.com/2006/10/26/121347.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ledevoir.com/2006/10/26/121347.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ledevoir.com/2006/10/26/121347.html</a>, André Navarri, president of Bombardier, is quoted as «Bombardier est d'abord une entreprise européenne, la première entreprise ferroviaire d'Europe», a-t-il rappelé. Son siège social n'est d'ailleurs pas à Montréal mais à Berlin. (<i>Bombardier is first and foremost an European company, Europe's first in railway industry. Indeed, its headquarters are not in Montreal, but in Berlin</i>.)<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus_wilby73_b8e7.html" title="User:Marcus wilby73">Marcus wilby73</a> 19:18, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--Okay, it was sorted out. Apparantly, the division of transportation, Bombardier transportation, is the one having its hq in Berlin. 199.202.95.16 07:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Until someone can cite a source, I removed the paragraph on Bombardier booking profits on asset transfers between subsidiaries. This is completely out of line with how consolidated financial statements are presented under GAAP and any auditor would force management to change its statements accordingly.</p>
