<dd><i>A conservative estimate places the number of bombing runs at more than 5000, with more than 11500 bombs dropped, the majority of which were incendiary bombs. The targets of the bombing were all residential areas, business areas, schools, hospitals and other non-military targets.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Please can we have a source for this information. Who is the conservative who made this estimate? Who recorded that the bombss were "all... non-military targets" note it does not say that "most... none military targets". <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a></p>

<dd><i>These terror bombings were probably aimed at cowing the Chinese government, or as part of the planned Sichuan invaionsion.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Please can we have a source for the claim that it was terror bombing. Ie is there a Japanese document which states that it was the intent of their armed forces to cause terror.</p>
<p>Is it possible that attacking the city also disrupted Chinese command and control and/or communications? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:02, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>First off, insisting that the Japanese agree that it was a terror bombing is just naive. When the aggressor gets the last say that is just bad history. So that should simply be listed as an opinion and not a measure of the credibility of this article.</p>
<p>In the meantime, looking for sources I found one at All Experts</p>
<p>"The Japanese considered the Kuomintang rather than the Communists as their main enemy and bombed the Nationalist wartime capital of Chongqing to the point that it became the most heavily bombed city in the world to date."

<p>Well it was the most faithful translation I could do from the zh wiki article. I cannot gurantee the accuracy of the information as the zh wiki is sometimes festering with anti-Japanese sentiments. Don't shoot the messenger.&#160;:D</p>
<p>I did some research on my own, unfortunately English (and Japanese, I would think) sources downplays it and Chinese sources probably exaggerates it. But I found this link to a interview of a survivor<a href="http://www.boxun.com/hero/sadchina/27_1.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boxun.com/hero/sadchina/27_1.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Try doing a google page translation, though many of the nuances of language cannot be reflected. The article itself and the website, are pretty biased, but the interview should be trusted because I saw it on a few more sites.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It's a pretty graphic account of what happened on one air raid. Being an account, it's a localised version, so does not give any mention of statistics (which we need).</p>
<p>One thing I found is that 十八梯 ie., the location mentioned in the interview, has always been a residential and cultural district in <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chongqing.html" title="Chongqing">Chongqing</a>. The account also mentioned how the hospital she was in was not attacked because (she speculated) it was flying the British flag, so we can infer that other hospitals WERE attacked.</p>
<p>And yes, the attacks were to lower Chinese moral and infrastructure. By killing off everyone or giving the impression they are going to kill everyone, it works wonders (usually).</p>
<p>I will do more research on this. In the meanwhile, please retain this article as it is. -<a href="../../../h/m/i/User%7EHmib_4096.html" title="User:Hmib">Hmib</a> 01:08, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>ZNET</p>
<p>The United States was not, of course, alone in indiscriminate bombing in the Pacific War. The Japanese Imperial Navy engaged in the first indiscriminate bombing in the Asia-Pacific region with the January 1932 attack on civilians on Shanghai. Thereafter, Japanese bombers targeted civilians in Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing and other cities. Chongqing, in particular, was targeted with more than 200 air raids over three years from the end of 1938, bringing the total death toll up to 12,000. Here, too, the Japanese were not targeting a military facility, but sought to destroy the Guomindang's centre of power and demoralize the civilians who supported this regime.</p>

<p>“From 1938 to August 1943, the Japanese air force flew more than 6,800 sorties, bombing Chongqing night and day, causing huge life and property losses to the local people.</p>
<p>“On June 5, 1941 alone, about 2,500 residents who had taken shelter from the bombing in a tunnel in downtown Chongqing were suffocated to death.</p>
<p>Photographers from China, Germany, France, the United States and some other countries filmed major scenes of the bombings. Japanese photographers also filmed the bombings to flaunt their " victories".</p>

<p>TOKYO, March 30(Xinhua)-- Forty Chinese victims or family members of victims of Chongqing bombings between 1938 and 1943 filed a damages suit against the Japanese government on Thursday in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The group of plaintiffs consists of 36 Chinese who were wounded or lost their family members during the more than five years of bombing in Chongqing of southwestern China and four victims or kin of victims of bombing in Leshan, Sichuan Province of southwestern China. They demanded the Japanese government apologize and each sought compensation of 10 million yen(about 84,900 U.S. dollars).</p>
<p>The Japanese army indiscriminately bombed Chongqing and nearby Leshan, Chengdu of the Sichuan province between 1938 and 1943. A recent study by a Chinese group shows that the bombings killed 23,600 people and wounded 37,700 people.” Enditem</p>

<p>“When winter made way for spring the skies of foggy Chongqing finally cleared up. Chongqing without fog was a difficult period for the city. With the bright sun came dense fleets of Japanese bombers. [Graham]Peck had made quite a few sketches about the bombing of Chongqing. From Feb. 18, 1938 to Aug. 23, 1943, following orders from Emperor Hirohito and the supreme headquarters, the Japanese air force bombarded Chongqing for 5 years and a half. They called it “political bombing” or “strategic bombing”. One US journalist said that the bombing that was a horror to the atmospheric layer had slipped away from people’s memory. Yet the Japanese had invented a continuously escalating violence.”</p>

<p>“BERT FUNG” An Interview Conducted by Frederik Nebeker IEEE History Center December 12, 2000 Interview #408 For the IEEE History Center (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Inc.) and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</p>
<p>[excerpt] Fung: “But in the later years, the Japanese bombed Chongqing. Chongqing was a foggy city. Every morning by 10 am the fog lifted a little, the Japanese bombers would be coming in. We took classes at the crack of dawn, till about 9:30 or so, then we went to the dugouts. The University was on the banks of a big river, the Jialing River. The rocky banks were our natural dugouts. That’s where we spent most of our daytime.</p>
<p>Nebeker: How long did that period of Japanese bombing last?</p>
<p>Fung: About four years.</p>

Summation-</p>
<p>As for Imperial Japanese policy in China, you can refer to the wiki article “Three Alls Policy” and read Bix’s book, “Hirohito and the making of modern Japan.” The time for demands for Japanese acquiescence in these matters to establish credibility is long over. This is the same Nihonron nonsense we got with Iris Chang's "Rape of Nanking" when the Japanese publisher insisted on writing their own denunciation in the book itself, in a country where the glories of the Great War are eulogized every time the PM goes to Yasukuni Shrine. Tell what ever Uyoku dantai is behind this demand for Japanese sources to take it somewhere else. Those guys threatened to firebomb any bookseller who sold the Japanese translation of the book. I was there when that happened.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of people in Japan either won’t tell the truth because they do not have to (if they know it) or are not aware they need to look at this again. After having lived nearly 2 decades in Japan, I am confident that very few Japanese are inclined to look for other accounts or are even aware that their official version of the events of the last century is even tainted much less totally fabricated. Start with Bix, work back. I have many books on these accounts that were written in the 40s and 50s so they are out of print but can be found in a good library. Chongqing is a small footnote now but may be further developed in future.</p>

<p>This is peanuts compared to Allied strategic bombing. Would you characterize the devastation inflicted on Germany and Japan as horrific terror bombing on the part of the allies, or the assertion that they had legitimate military purposes as a blatant denial of responsibility for mass murder? <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKensai_Max_ebc4.html" title="User:Kensai Max">Kensai Max</a> 15:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Berlin article seems to state that it was bombed more times than Chongqing - can anyone clear this up? <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 03:36, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
